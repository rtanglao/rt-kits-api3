There is also an option to open that link in a new window, if you please. I have turned both browser.tabs.opentabfor.middleclick and middlemouse.openNewWindow to False. </p><p>However, what if (bear with me), you didn't want to do ANY of that? What if you just wanted to activate Autoscroll, *even if you middle click on a link*?  </p><p>Unfortunately, that is not possible. Middle clicking (the ONLY way to activate Autoscroll) on a link instead does nothing. Which is better than opening the link in a new tab, but still does not solve the problem. </p><p>Some sites have links riddled everywhere, or clickable elements that do the same thing. This makes Autoscroll unusable. </p><p>Is there ANY solution to this? I just want to use Autoscroll no matter where my cursor is.

I do IT support work and am very savvy to all the addons and mods for FF. Why in thunder was this option ever changed? It's a pure lack of common sense. Maybe not all, but there are tons of users who open new tabs and they set their new tabs to open their home page which is often a search engine such as Firefox, Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc. When the new tab is opened, the focus should be on the webpage (ie, where you type your search criteria). Instead, some one decided it was better to focus on the tab or the address bar itself which is ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS unless you know what website you're looking for in the first place. Otherwise, extra clicks are required to do your search which is ridiculous. I do use New Tab Override which has an option to Focus on the webpage but as of ver 85, that no longer works. I open a new tab to either search for something or to open a different site (which is usually bookmarked). To have the focus on the tab or address bar makes zero sense. I cannot think of a single instance where that would be useful. Tell the Firefox developers to simply put the option in Firefox to allow the user to select their preference as to where to focus when opening a new tab. If any of you FF gurus want to take a shot at answering this, give it your best. I'm listening. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",sdbutler
