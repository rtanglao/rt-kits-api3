Occasionally I accidentally hit the ""X"" on a single tab that I didn't intend to close.  I've searched Help with [warn close ""single tab""] but very apparent that putting 2 words in quotes does NOT require them to be together in the search.  It returns 106 pages!  I saw that it was do-able in older versions of Firefox but since they changed the field to True or False you can't put a 2 in it.  I think Firefox is great except for this very irritating flaw.  Thank you.. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",PGannon
