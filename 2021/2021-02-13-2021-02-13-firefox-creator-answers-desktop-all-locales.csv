Since I use the default theme in Firefox my tab bar is black all the time (and I need/want to keep it that way) so what I'd like to do is just recolor the Simple Tab Groups add-on icon myself. I just have no idea where the icon data is stored and how I could do so. </p><p>Help is appreciated! </p><p><em>-FB-Productions</em> </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",FB-Productions

Firefox Slow and Boring ( Especially after last update ) Call for new pages only by right-clicking on new tab possible direct call infinitely long or not possible. Have already tried all the ways I can repair Firefox Edge and Opera run at the same calls many times better and faster. For these reasons I will now part with Firefox after a long time ! PS: Since version 50+ it actually got worse and worse, so now long enough written bye bye. </p><p>Gruß </p><p>Karl-Heinz </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",k-mursal

Occasionally I accidentally hit the ""X"" on a single tab that I didn't intend to close.  I've searched Help with [warn close ""single tab""] but very apparent that putting 2 words in quotes does NOT require them to be together in the search.  It returns 106 pages!  I saw that it was do-able in older versions of Firefox but since they changed the field to True or False you can't put a 2 in it.  I think Firefox is great except for this very irritating flaw.
