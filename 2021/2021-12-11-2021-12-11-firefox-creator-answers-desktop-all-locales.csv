Mi serviva eliminare alcune righe della fattura e ogni volta il sito mi chiedeva, tramite una sorta di notifica push, ""Sei sicuro di voler eliminare la riga in questione"" e ogni volta davo l'OK.  In ognuno di questi messaggi mozilla mi dava la possibilità di selezione anche ""blocca l'invio di messaggi di conferma da questo sito"" o qualcosa del genere. Per sbaglio durante la comparsa di una di queste notifiche, invece di dare l'OK alla modifica della fattura, ho dato l'OK al blocco di questa tipologia di messaggi da questo sito. Morale della favola: non riesco più a modificare nulla quando lavoro su questo sito, perchè, ad esempio, clicco sulla cancellazione della riga della fattura, ma non succede nulla, dovrebbe comparire questa notifica di conferma che io però ho bloccato, e tutto rimane fermo. </p><p>Qualcuno saprebbe indicarmi una soluzione? Smanettando con le impostazioni delle notifiche push potrei risolvere?
