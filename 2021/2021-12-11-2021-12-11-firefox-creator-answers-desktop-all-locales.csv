I no longer get that prompt and cannot find the Trend Micro Toolbar when I search for the extension. I used to use Mozilla all the time but without the extension I am reluctant to use it now for banking or other secure transactions. There was some information on your site that you were working on the issue  some time ago but it does not seem to have been resolved yet. Your assistance appreciated Thanks Ana </p>,desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",anamonks
