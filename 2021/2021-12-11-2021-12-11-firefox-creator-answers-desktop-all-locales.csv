The updates are automatic and have never been a problem before.  This morning after the update, the file generator in Print Shop Pro is now coming up landscape instead of portrait like it has always done, and there is no way we can change it.   </p><p>We print shipping and job tickets together double sided, they have always come out portrait before.  Now they come out landscape this makes them 4 pages instead of 2 and the 2 extra pages are either blank or have just a little bit on them. </p><p>How can we get them to generate in portrait layout again? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,other,en-US,"",velinda.hunter

I no longer get that prompt and cannot find the Trend Micro Toolbar when I search for the extension. I used to use Mozilla all the time but without the extension I am reluctant to use it now for banking or other secure transactions. There was some information on your site that you were working on the issue  some time ago but it does not seem to have been resolved yet. Your assistance appreciated Thanks Ana </p>,desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",anamonks
