And it bothered me </p><p>First of all, you parasitic woman Mitchell Baker, who are you to stand in front of millions of Trump supporters? You do not even dare to comment on the nonsense you wrote. You did not give an email address to hear the defenses of Trump supporters there. Because you probably love Kamala Harris Black Butt, you are not allowed to use Firefox and the Internet against us. </p><p>Secondly, it is not up to you whether people want to be racist or not. It is good that racism is not even a crime. Biden's son is a pedophile. Why were you silent about this? You do not have the right to to decide how people think. </p><p>Why does a software company comment on policy and think it should take action? </p><p>I will remove Firefox forever today, but before that I want to say that you are tarnishing the name of free software.
