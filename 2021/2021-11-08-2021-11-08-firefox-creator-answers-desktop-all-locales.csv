Despite having 64 GiB of RAM in my desktop, running it for a few days - though with many tabs - can still cause it to crash, sometimes the entire OS. </p><p>So I want to migrate the session from SeaMonkey to Firefox, i.e. preserve my tabs.  Copying keys3.db and logins.sqlite ensures my passwords are copied over.  But copying places.sqlite or sessionstore.json from my SeaMonkey profile to Firefox does not work. </p><p>Inspect places.sqlite both generated by Firefox and SeaMonkey, I notice that they do not have the same schema for moz_places, so I wonder if that is upsetting Firefox, and scraps the entire file.  I notice that Firefox - while not using sessionstore.json any more - is using another file called sessionstore.jsonlz4, I wonder if I could convert my SeaMonkey sessionstore.json to a sessionstore.jsonlz4 file, that Firefox might be able to load it.  However, finding guides on how to generate a jsonlz4 is hard, since most - if not all - are about decoding them. </p><p>So I am a bit stumped.  How do I migrate my SeaMonkey session to Firefox?  I can live with losing my history, and I don't use bookmarks.  We are talking about well over 100 tabs, and I'd hate having to enter them manually. </p><p>I am using Firefox 92 and SeaMonkey 2.53.8.1 on Fedora 33. </p>",linux;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-920;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",svip7782

For example, whenever I hit the ""Attach"" button in Gmail, or the ""Upload File"" button on Overleaf, what should happen is that a system dialogue opens allowing me to select a file from my computer.
