When I click on gmail, the tab shows it is trying to open but it doesn't. When I close Firefox and try to reopen it I get the message ""Firefox is already running but it is not responding. The old Firefox process must be closed to open a new window."" When I click close it opens FIrefox. I have rebooted my machine and tried to open Firefox again and it opens but I still cannot open my Gmail. It is my laptop and I am on Windows 8. My email is kwrisue@gmail.com. I am not having the issue with Chrome so I can get to my email that way. </p>",desktop;other;windows-81;firefox-940;,firefox,other,en-US,1457480;,kwrisue
