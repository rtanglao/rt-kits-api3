This often happens umprompted even if the app has been in the backround untouched for a few minutes (or hours) such as when ive left it on my 2nd screen to refer to when playing a game or working. Having multiple windows open means it restarts all of them. Sometimes, opening a new tab or window, or upon starting firefox from closed will trigger the same behaviour, but this isn't consistant. </p><p>This has been going on about 6-8 months, across multiple updates. Until now it's been an annoyance, but i recently got a new job working from home, and it's starting to impact my ability to work, since some of that work is in-bowser. I've lost 15-30 minutes here and there a few times, and I lost 4 hours work the other day becuase the brower restarted without allowing me a chance to save my work. If I can't find a solution to this, i might be forced to change my browser, which i would really prefer not to do. </p><p>I only have a few addons, and disabling them hasn't seemed to solve the issue :  ReloadMatic (Lets you set tabs to reload automatically on a timer), Tampermonkey, uBlock Origin, and Yahoo Search </p><p>Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.

Despite having 64 GiB of RAM in my desktop, running it for a few days - though with many tabs - can still cause it to crash, sometimes the entire OS. </p><p>So I want to migrate the session from SeaMonkey to Firefox, i.e. preserve my tabs.  Copying keys3.db and logins.sqlite ensures my passwords are copied over.  But copying places.sqlite or sessionstore.json from my SeaMonkey profile to Firefox does not work. </p><p>Inspect places.sqlite both generated by Firefox and SeaMonkey, I notice that they do not have the same schema for moz_places, so I wonder if that is upsetting Firefox, and scraps the entire file.  I notice that Firefox - while not using sessionstore.json any more - is using another file called sessionstore.jsonlz4, I wonder if I could convert my SeaMonkey sessionstore.json to a sessionstore.jsonlz4 file, that Firefox might be able to load it.  However, finding guides on how to generate a jsonlz4 is hard, since most - if not all - are about decoding them. </p><p>So I am a bit stumped.  How do I migrate my SeaMonkey session to Firefox?  I can live with losing my history, and I don't use bookmarks.

I have NEVER gotten this message before, &amp; there is NO reason I should be getting it now. I was JUST THERE, IN my e-mail account &amp; it worked just fine. I am still on the same browser section &amp; went to check for an incoming message &amp; Firefox won't let me into my ONLY e-mail account, for NO good reason. I DEMAND some HELP getting into my E-MAIL. I NEED ACCESS to this account. I do EVERYTHING through that account, &amp; I HAVE NO other. PLEASE HELP!!!!! *NOW*!!! I'm PANICKING! RESPOND IMMEDIATELY. I would also include a screenshot, but your STUPID new browser updates no longer ALLOW me to. I'm starting to HATE this new Firefox, it SUCKS, just so you know. I need IMMEDIATE help, so someone had BETTER get to me in a CHAT right NOW. I CAN'T get an E-MAIL from you, because YOU WON'T LET ME IN to my ONLY e-mail account, so WHAT am I supposed to do NOW? You can't even CONTACT me. I'll tell you what, yes you can. You WILL have SOMEONE call me at THIS number IMMEDIATELY to HELP me get into my E-MAIL account &gt; 1 - 719 - 890 -1660 &gt; THANK you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-81;needsinfo;firefox-940;firefox-9401;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1457485;1457489;,windsinger5

When I click on gmail, the tab shows it is trying to open but it doesn't. When I close Firefox and try to reopen it I get the message ""Firefox is already running but it is not responding. The old Firefox process must be closed to open a new window."" When I click close it opens FIrefox. I have rebooted my machine and tried to open Firefox again and it opens but I still cannot open my Gmail. It is my laptop and I am on Windows 8. My email is kwrisue@gmail.com. I am not having the issue with Chrome so I can get to my email that way. </p>",desktop;other;windows-81;firefox-940;,firefox,other,en-US,1457480;,kwrisue
