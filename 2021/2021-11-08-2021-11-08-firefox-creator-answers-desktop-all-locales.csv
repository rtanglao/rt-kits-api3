These bookmarks are unreachable when using my PC from my home network.  No problem with that, it's the correct FF behavior. </p><p>However, recently selecting one of the unreachable bookmarks results in a re-direct to a third party (malicious) webpage. </p><p>How do I change the re-direct address on an unreachable URL?  Or default it back to ""normal behavior""? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",m.parker

The old Firefox process must be closed to open a new window."" When I click close it opens FIrefox.
