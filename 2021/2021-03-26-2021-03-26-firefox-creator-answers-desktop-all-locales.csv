For example, I can't speak what I want to say on Google Translate, &amp; I can't talk in voice chats on Discord (random examples). It always says that voice input is not supported. May I know why your browser doesn't support voice input? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,other,en-US,"",cookiedafox22

If I search for a single word like: ""Nasdaq"", I get a pop-up strip below the book-mark bar asking me if I was searching for ""<a href=""http://www.nasdaq.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.nasdaq.com</a>""?   </p> <ul><li> screenshot attached here. </li></ul> <p>This has become real annoying now as I use the browser on my office machine.

I have tried both running the installer again to fix it and downloading a new copy of the installer and running it, neither of which solved the issue. </p><p>I found a previous thread from 2018 detailing the same issue (wherein the chosen solution was to make sure that your firewall wasn't blocking firefox's access to the internet) however; </p><p>A) I can't even start the firefox application, let alone see if it can access the internet. B) I tried making my antivirus application ignore it (Malwarebytes), but when I tried to do so it said I didn't have permissions to access the file. </p><p>To be clear mine is the ONLY account on the computer, and is the admin account as a result. My pc is running on Windows 7 64 bit in case that is relevant (though I didn't see anything in the update notes to suggest that they're ending support for Windows 7 just yet). </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,1401323;1401333;,kaelhound
