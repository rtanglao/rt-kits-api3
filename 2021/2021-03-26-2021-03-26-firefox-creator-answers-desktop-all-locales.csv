I am running Firefox 87.0 on Windows 10. Both are fully updated as of the time of this writing (26 March 2021). In Calibre 5.13.0, I enable ""Sharing over the net,"" then I ""Start server,"" and then I ""Test server."" Calibre opens a tab in Firefox but returns the following error message: ""Error: Could not initialize database You must allow calibre to use IndexedDB storage in your browser to read books"" I cannot figure out how to enable IndexedDB storage for Firefox.
