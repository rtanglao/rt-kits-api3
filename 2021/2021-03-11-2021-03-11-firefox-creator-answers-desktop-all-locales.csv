But on some websites Firefox then offers to again save the password but its the WRONG PASSWORD, not the pw that was just used to log on to that website. As such Firefox has become onerous compared to every other browser that remembers and accurately automatically logs on to a website. The settings appear to be correct, I ""refreshed"" Firefox (no extensions, never had an added password manager)---still braindead. Short of using a different browser that actually works, which I mostly do now, is there any way to get Firefox to work correctly on any platform?
