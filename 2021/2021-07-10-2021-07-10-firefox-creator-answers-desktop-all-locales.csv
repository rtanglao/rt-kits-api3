Everytime I have to download you change things for the worse, and I spend sometimes even hours, like now, trying to get my things back to what they were. I do a lot of research and do not have time to continually have to go back and undo all of the changes to my very carefull set up toolbars at the top. Can I opt out of this madness except for the most truly vital downloads? Secondly:  After the latest download, I find a star symbol for bookmarks between my already too short search bar and my address bar. I use that space to lengthen my search bar a little as it does not allow a lot of length.  I wish there was a separate place for a long search bar as it never is long enough to make my searches fully visible.  I already had 4 symbols for bookmarks in my top toolbars. I don't need a damn star preventing space between the search and address bars. And when I need to clic on one of those bars, the star thing activates and I get bookmarks instead of the address bar, etc.  What is the point of these useless changes???  I went to the menu: it had 'customize tool bar' as one of the first options.  Now you have to hunt around for it. After wasting time, I found it:  you have to go all the way to the bottom of the options where you'll find tools; then click on the forward arrow beside it and that takes you to the customize toolbar menu. But when that comes up the page changes and the star symbol disappears. I have tried to drag the star symbol to some other places but it won't budge.  Does anyone know how I can get it off my toolbar? If not, is it ok for me to go back to my former version of ff, and how do I do that?  Thank you. Sorry for the rant, but this happens everytime and they never used to have updates all the time like they do now.

Why doesn’t “Delete cookies and site data when FF closes” clear all junk? </p><p>I want to tell you why I almost never do the updates FF always asks me to do. •	NOTE:  I never set ANY PROGRAM to do automatic updates. I don’t want them slowing down or interrupting my system when I’m trying to get something done. I’ll decide when. •	It seems like FF does updates WAY TOO FREQUENTLY.  •	THE MAIN PROBLEM – After the 1st to 5th update, there will always be about 30k to 60k of Cookies, Site Data, or Cache that will not clear when I select “CLEAR DATA” in the “Cookies and Site Data” section of “Privacy &amp; Security”. What the heck; how can I be sure that it isn’t something that does not belong on my system? Maybe it’s something FF requires, but there is no way of knowing that, and no way of knowing what it is.  •	THE SECOND PROBLEM - Even though I always select to “Delete cookies and site data when FF closes”; FF does not automatically clear all of that junk. I always have to go in and manually do it. Seems to mostly happen if I’ve been on facebook, but they are not exclusive. I thought FF is supposed to be a secure way of being on the net? Perhaps that does not apply to certain web services or vendors. Perhaps that does not apply to whatever it is that the FF program will not allow me to clear from Cookies, Site Data, or Cache.  If I'm wrong please let me know, otherwise please forward to FF to hopefully fix. </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-880;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",livn4god

And on right clicking on today, there was a drop down menu that was ""open all in tabs"", ""delete"" and ""copy"". ""Copy"" was super duper worthless, it literally just copied the word ""today"" into the clipboard, in case I really wanted to paste the word ""today"" the hard way into notepad or something. I wanted to then test if I could delete the history from just today without deleting the entire history, so FOOL that I am, I tried the delete choice. And what did it do? It deleted the ENTIRE CATEGORY of ""today"". Now it just says ""yesterday"", ""last 7 days"", ""this month"", ""june"", ""may"", ""april"", ""march"", ""february"" and ""older than 6 months"". Because it seems to think that by deleting ""today"", that means I NEVER AGAIN want to access any history of that day, of COURSE that must be what I intended to do when I chose delete. It couldn't possibly be that I wanted to delete the browsing history of today July 9 2021, no of course not, I must have wanted to delete the entire category of ""today"" for all time, why would anyone want to just delete the history of that day when they can delete the entire functionality of the browser to display any of the history of the current day ever again. I'm trying to imagine what was going through the developers' heads here. So, can I, get it back somehow? I'm not going using that computer now, in case something can be done to undo this that won't work if I do anything. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1426794;1426815;1426816;,someoneorother
