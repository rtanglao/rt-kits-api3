I am developing using Ubuntu Mozilla Firefox 89.0.2 </p><p>The test server uses <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">example.com</a>, but has a domain alias <a href=""http://test.example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">test.example.com</a>, that I use to differentiate between test and prod when working.   </p><p>I accidentally added the following HSTS apache2 directive to my test server: </p><pre>   &lt;IfModule mod_headers.c&gt;      Header always set Strict-Transport-Security ""max-age=15552000; includeSubDomains""    &lt;/IfModule&gt; </pre> <p>The net result, is that I can't open the test nextcloud site and the prod nextcloud simultaneously in my browser because `<a href=""http://test.example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">test.example.com</a>` will suddenly switch to `<a href=""https://test.example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://test.example.com</a>` and lock me out.   </p><p>I have researched and tried all multiple different methods to remove HSTS from test url, which are: </p><p>1.)

I edited ""SiteSecurityServiceState.txt"" located in my browser profile folder.  </p><p>4.) I also used about:config and switched `security.mixed_content.block_display_content` from ""false"" to ""true"" </p><p>5.) I also made the file `SiteSecurityServiceState.txt` as to to completely HSTS in the browser, yet the problem still persists.  (even tried deleting it) </p><p>5.) Also, in my `/var/www/config/config.php` for nextcloud, I have also edited the trusted domains section as follows: </p><pre>   'trusted_domains' =&gt;      array (      0 =&gt; '<a href=""http://test.example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">test.example.com</a>',        ), </pre> <p>All of this has failed to permanently correct the problem. I might be able to access <a href=""http://test.example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">test.example.com</a> for a short period of time, but if prod server <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">example.com</a> is opened the problematic `<a href=""https://test.example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://test.example.com</a>` returns. </p><p>And FYI, `<a href=""https://hstspreload.org/?domain=example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://hstspreload.org/?domain=example.com</a>` still shows: </p><pre>   Warning: Unnecessary HSTS header over HTTP<br>    The HTTP page at <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com</a> sends an HSTS header.

And on right clicking on today, there was a drop down menu that was ""open all in tabs"", ""delete"" and ""copy"". ""Copy"" was super duper worthless, it literally just copied the word ""today"" into the clipboard, in case I really wanted to paste the word ""today"" the hard way into notepad or something. I wanted to then test if I could delete the history from just today without deleting the entire history, so FOOL that I am, I tried the delete choice. And what did it do? It deleted the ENTIRE CATEGORY of ""today"". Now it just says ""yesterday"", ""last 7 days"", ""this month"", ""june"", ""may"", ""april"", ""march"", ""february"" and ""older than 6 months"". Because it seems to think that by deleting ""today"", that means I NEVER AGAIN want to access any history of that day, of COURSE that must be what I intended to do when I chose delete. It couldn't possibly be that I wanted to delete the browsing history of today July 9 2021, no of course not, I must have wanted to delete the entire category of ""today"" for all time, why would anyone want to just delete the history of that day when they can delete the entire functionality of the browser to display any of the history of the current day ever again. I'm trying to imagine what was going through the developers' heads here. So, can I, get it back somehow? I'm not going using that computer now, in case something can be done to undo this that won't work if I do anything. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1426794;,someoneorother
