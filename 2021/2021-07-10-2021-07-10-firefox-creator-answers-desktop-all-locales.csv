I've tried using a single file download, removing myself from my family's account and also tried using a download manager. I also deleted  </p><p>This issue has been happening for about half a year now- I've been able to finish downloads by simply retrying them, but I've never tried to download a file this large (the single file download is roughly 60 GB and I would rather solve this issue than retry the download for a 60gb file). </p><p>Any ideas or suggestions why my downloads keep failing? Is this maybe an issue with my ISP? </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",tdmahaf

What happens instead is my old synced config downloads to my local Firefox and overwrites all my settings. I don't want to delete my Firefox Accounts account, I just want to make my new profile overwrite the synced one after I'm done setting it up. </p><p>Things I've tried: -Signing out of my Firefox account on my old installation and selecting the option to delete my old synced data. -As many different combinations of refreshing Firefox+clearing all of my browsing history data+signing out of Accounts &amp; deleting my synced data......as I can think of, prior to uninstalling, and again after re-installing Firefox. -Logging into Firefox Accounts on my phone to confirm the deletion of my synced PC config </p><p><br> The last two options I can think of are to make sure *all* of my saved data in Accounts - across all of my devices and not just my PC - are deleted, and to try using the Profile Manage to create a new profile and upload that to Accounts........but I wanted to get someone else's input, as I've already burned several hours trying to figure this out. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",pirritanoandrew
