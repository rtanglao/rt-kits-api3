And on right clicking on today, there was a drop down menu that was ""open all in tabs"", ""delete"" and ""copy"". ""Copy"" was super duper worthless, it literally just copied the word ""today"" into the clipboard, in case I really wanted to paste the word ""today"" the hard way into notepad or something. I wanted to then test if I could delete the history from just today without deleting the entire history, so FOOL that I am, I tried the delete choice. And what did it do? It deleted the ENTIRE CATEGORY of ""today"". Now it just says ""yesterday"", ""last 7 days"", ""this month"", ""june"", ""may"", ""april"", ""march"", ""february"" and ""older than 6 months"". Because it seems to think that by deleting ""today"", that means I NEVER AGAIN want to access any history of that day, of COURSE that must be what I intended to do when I chose delete. It couldn't possibly be that I wanted to delete the browsing history of today July 9 2021, no of course not, I must have wanted to delete the entire category of ""today"" for all time, why would anyone want to just delete the history of that day when they can delete the entire functionality of the browser to display any of the history of the current day ever again. I'm trying to imagine what was going through the developers' heads here. So, can I, get it back somehow? I'm not going using that computer now, in case something can be done to undo this that won't work if I do anything. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1426794;,someoneorother

What happens instead is my old synced config downloads to my local Firefox and overwrites all my settings. I don't want to delete my Firefox Accounts account, I just want to make my new profile overwrite the synced one after I'm done setting it up. </p><p>Things I've tried: -Signing out of my Firefox account on my old installation and selecting the option to delete my old synced data. -As many different combinations of refreshing Firefox+clearing all of my browsing history data+signing out of Accounts &amp; deleting my synced data......as I can think of, prior to uninstalling, and again after re-installing Firefox. -Logging into Firefox Accounts on my phone to confirm the deletion of my synced PC config </p><p><br> The last two options I can think of are to make sure *all* of my saved data in Accounts - across all of my devices and not just my PC - are deleted, and to try using the Profile Manage to create a new profile and upload that to Accounts........but I wanted to get someone else's input, as I've already burned several hours trying to figure this out. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,sync,en-US,1426799;1426800;,pirritanoandrew
