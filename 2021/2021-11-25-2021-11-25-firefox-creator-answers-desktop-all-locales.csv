Az ilyen oldalakon (pl. Facebook), a Chrome-ban látszik, hogy a használt betűtípusban nem voltak ilyen karakterek, ezért a Chrome behelyettesít egy alap (pl. Arial) ékezetes betűt. Ez elüt a többitől, de legalább megjelenik. A Firefoxban látszólag nem működik ez a behelyettesítés. Azt megnéztem, hogy a hibásan megjelenő oldalak ugyanúgy HTML5-ösek és UTF-8 kódolásúak, lang=hu beállítással, mint azok, amelyeken megjelennek a karakterek. </p><p>A gépen pár napja Win 11 Pro van, de már a frissítés előtt is megvolt a hiba. </p><p>Én állíthattam el valamit, vagy ez egy bug?

After reading numerous posts addressing similar issues &amp; having no success, I've decided to post a question of my own. I am running the current version of firefox, 94.0.2. I use the <strong>Search Bar</strong> religiously for searches to sites like google, wikipedia, youtube, amazon, and ebay. I NEVER use the address bar for searches. I have attempted to disable all functionality associated with searching via the address bar. When I go to the address bar, it is because I have a specifc url I know I want to type with a specific destination in mind. Occasionally, I have a need to just go to the home page of one of my search sites, most often it's <a href=""http://amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">amazon.com</a>. Recently (not sure which version of firefox) I've found when I go to the <strong>Address Bar</strong> &amp; type <a href=""http://amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">amazon.com</a>, I cannot just go to <a href=""http://amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">amazon.com</a>, instead the address bar turns into a search bar. How do I disable this? Its driving me mad! I swear I've disabled every option I can within about:config related to <strong>urlb</strong>. Please Help. I don't want to switch to Chrome, but I'm tired of my settings getting messed up every time mozilla pushes a new version. </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-940;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",andrewpatricksmith

In several places the person offering an answer suggests sending feedback to Mozilla re the changes, but... no link or place to send feedback.  </p><p>My desktop and laptop have only just been updated to the latest version with very bright white backgrounds, really large firefox icon on home page, less definition between tabs, a lighter weight font on menus, strange layout on the hamburger menu, and a reset to a google-like print window.  </p><p>I tried on my desktop to change the bright white background using the colors option. Once I found the settings to  tone down the brightness to a very pale grey for the home page and results page, every page I went to had changed fonts and lost colors.  </p><p>Print preview was an awesome tool, many web pages are set up in such a way that when it is printed the fonts are huge, and the web page header prints over the text of the printout. On the worst panels of links to other stories and ads also print. Your preview allowed me to zoom in/out easily and the simplified version was brilliant. </p><p>The tabs are grey on grey with no definite edge, and they just keep shrinking showing less and less of the tab name, instead of hiding extra tabs of the edges. I have 10-20 tabs open on a regular basis often in 2 separate windows and would much rather have a tab label that IDs the page than having to click on each page.  </p><p>Font - the menu font is now a small fine sans serif that is difficult to read. </p><p>Hamburger menu - Why is new tab, find in page, save page as, and print here? In particular why are they at the top of the menu? Please move the new tab panel and print panel to the bottom, the Bookmarks panel to the top and put the Settings panel immediately below it. It would also help if you added a cog icon to the settings panel.  </p><p>Please add a feedback link without sign-on to your page. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,1462018;,olearymr
