I'm not happy with the new version of Firefox (attached) I have to go into History and restore tabs every time I restart my computer, I like to have many tabs continuously open so this doesn't suit me at all. Also the new search function at the top of the screen in the typical URL box is not nice, I preferred when the search was in a box in the middle of the screen and suggestions popped up when you start typing a search. Suggestions don't pop up in the new Firefox version. </p><p>I really enjoy Firefox and have been using it many years, I just wanted to share my opinions of the new version. </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",garthcusters

To reproduce please try the following: </p><p>1. Go to <a href=""https://mymummyteacher.com/store"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mymummyteacher.com/store</a> and add a product to the cart. 2. Close the tab / browser 3. Go back to <a href=""https://mymummyteacher.com/store"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mymummyteacher.com/store</a> and add a product to the cart. The single product that has been just added is shown, however the Subtotal and Total are showing as if the previously added product is still in there too.  </p><p>If I do a hard reload (hold down shift), all the other products then appear. So I think this is an issue with caching. I am not seeing it on other browsers.
