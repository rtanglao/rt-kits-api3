After using it for a while, I quite like the general concept, however the design has some flaws that could make it more user friendly. This is my wishlist. It would be great for others to add their ideas but please avoid the negative option of going back to the old dialogue, as that has been expressed in many other threads. </p><p>1. Add Simplify Page - I think this is in progress 2. Condense the dialogue box, there is too much white space. If it was more compact, every option could be visible removing the need for the ""More settings.."" extra click. 3. Rework/expand the Pages options. Currently there is only ""all"" or ""custom"". Bring it into line with the Windows dialogue and offer ""Page 1"" and ""Selection"". Maybe also a drop down list. In essence, having to type the specific pages should be the last resort. 4. The ability to choose the printer's ""Tray"" is missing (or hidden too well). 5. When the user is trying to choose a scaling option eg 80% or 90%, if the number is entered and then ""enter"" pressed, suddenly the document starts to print. Often scaling takes some trial and error, and pressing ""enter"" should not send the document to the printer. 6. The Scaling option should be higher in the box. It is more frequently used than Orientation etc. 7. I would prefer (others may disagree) that the dialogue default to the settings on the printer, regardless of what was changed last time. Instead of being confident that the page will default to my normal printing settings (eg tray 2, greyscale, one-sided etc), now I have to check the printer settings for every print, because it has probably remembered one small change made for the previous print session. </p><p>Please add to the list if you have constructive suggestions, or disagree with mine, and hopefully the feedback will be picked up... </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Feejaybee
