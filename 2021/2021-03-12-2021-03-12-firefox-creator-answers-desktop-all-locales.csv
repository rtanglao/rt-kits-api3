So forgive me for raising the topic again.  </p><p>My problem is as follows. I have multiple recordings made on my Xfinity account. These recordings are all HD quality which is I believe 720p with Xfinity. I can play these recordings using Xfinity Stream using Firefox as my browser on my desktop PC and it works fine with the CPU usage only being about 8%. </p><p>When I try to watch the same recording on my laptop which is underpowered by comparison the video stutters, freezes and in many cases just stops altogether. The CPU is maxed out at 100% and Firefox is using most of that with the plugin-container.exe using 40% of the total. I've tried turning off hardware acceleration and it makes no difference. I believe the issue is down to the plugin-container just getting bogged down (is the container running Widevine DRM?). </p><p>I can watch stream On-Demand and LiveTV from Xfinity because there are other sources of the programs so adaptive resolution kicks in and I get a lower quality video (but still a nearly maxed out CPU). With the DVR recording there is no lower quality file available so adaptive resolution does not apply. </p><p>The same laptop is capable of streaming 1080p Netflix when at 100%. I can see the Netflix resolution using the Ctl-Shift-Alt-D while streaming a movie. </p><p>So I'm convinced that my problem is all down to lack of CPU power for browser based DRM. But why should that be? Is it just a poor implementation of DRM support? (BTW the situation is no different using Chrome or Edge which also use Widevine DRM). </p><p>So 2 specific questions: </p><p>1. Is there a way when streaming a video with Firefox of seeing what the resolution the video is actually playing at (this is assuming adaptive routing is in effect)? </p><p>2. Are there any specifications that would tell me the required minimum Intel CPU that can handle streaming HD video with DRM. Assume the network is not an issue. </p><p>Additional information. Laptop has an Intel Celeron N2815 @1.86GHz CPU. I'm running Windows 10 20H2 with all patches up to date. My network is 1Gbs download and 40Mbs upload. The laptop can achieve 200Mbs download and 40Mbs upload. I'm running the latest version of Firefox with no extensions installed. </p><p>Thanks for any insight into this issue Mike </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",lenaghanm
