Mostly browsing social media, blogs, newspaper articles. (video streaming causes no cache problems and are generally unaffected by slow Firefox performance) </p><p>If I'm not working and doing many hours of browsing daily, I have to clear my cache 5-6 times a day, after every couple of hours. In the older Firefox, this was easier because ""cache"" and ""cookies"" were separate actions, so in three clicks (preferences, cache, clear) I could be browsing again. But in recent versions, the clear cache is now a longer process (preferences, privacy, cache, uncheck cookies, clear), then I can get back to browsing. (This seems to be a trend with a lot of new software engineers, making steps longer instead of shorter, mind boggling.) </p><p>I've already read some ""answers"" here that claim that clearing the cache ""should"" not improve performance. This is silly. Thousands of us are constantly forced to manually clear our cache to  be able to use Firefox. It's tiring, and gaslighty, but I continue with Firefox because I believe in the community principles of Firefox, but instead of improvements, every update just brings more and more dysfunction). Firefox's cache not self-managing is such a huge problem that there's a dozen extensions for cache clearing, but since my last Firefox reset, I can no longer find the one I liked, and the new cache clearing extensions don't perform so well, so it's back to preferences-manual-cache clear.  </p><p>Symptoms: -Page loads slow or stall -Twitter feed bounces to top of page (even with accessibility-Reduce Motion-setting) -Facebook group members list page bounces to top -Facebook post history browsing slows to a crawl (made worse by fb having removed its time selection tools, so now to see a historical post, we must scroll, scroll, scroll, scroll, and Firefox eventually just stalls out) -Logins fail That's when I head over to my cache, see it's above 400 or sometimes above 500, un-click cookies (which I sometimes delete too, any time the cookies are over 100, even though I'm set to minimal cookie retention, I delete all cookies older than a week), CLEAR CACHE, then Firefox performs correctly... for a couple of hours anyway.  </p><p>In theory, Firefox cache is supposed to ""self-clean"" of the old stuff? but I have not seen that in practice. Since this is a problem for so many people, why doesn't Firefox create an easy button to clear only the content we want, instead of total wipe? (I also reset my Firefox entirely 3-4 times a year, but I hate doing this as so many preferences get lost) </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",tallard

Specifically the one that would light up to indicate that a page was bookmarked and, when clicked, would show what it was saved as in your bookmarks and in which bookmark folder location. </p><p>The button was no longer allowing me to edit a bookmark I had recently saved when I had clicked on it, simply lighting up to show it had been saved. When I right clicked it, it gave an option to hide it and I clicked it in a rush thinking I could toggle it back on and now it's gone. Again, this is not the first time I've had this issue but it happens far apart enough I've forgotten how to fix it. </p><p>For now I have an extension that somewhat imitates this specific bookmark feature, whereas it will light up to indicate a page I'm viewing is currently saved to my bookmarks and I am able to quick save via clicking it, but it's a cheap imitation of the real thing. It gives me no option to edit the bookmark from there nor does it tell me in what location a currently viewed page I have bookmarked is located.  </p><p>If anyone knows how to fix this, please let me know.
