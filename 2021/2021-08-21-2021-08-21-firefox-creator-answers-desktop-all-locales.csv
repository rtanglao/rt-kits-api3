The issue with that is the pop up that warns of an earlier version and creates a new Profile every time it is opened.. If I have to go back what version is recommended?

It have a serious input lag when i try to type in the address bar and the search bar, about 1 to 2 second for the word show up. The problem is fixed when i am on the safe mode. So i went and refresh the Firefox and remove all the extension, the problem still persist. I also tried some other method suggested by other after my research, create a new account, turned off the hardware acceleration, set accessibility.force_disabled. None of them work, any clue on how can i fix this problem? The lag only happen on Firefox, i tried to typed on other software its fine, but i switch back to Firefox the input lag happen.

Cuando estoy reproduciendo videos en YouTube me ocurre que el video se congela por un instante, pero el audio sigue, uego, el video retoma su reproducción y todo sigue como si nada hasta que sucede de nuevo.  Es molesto y me ocurrió una vez ayer o antes de ayer, no recuerdo bien, pero lo solucioné borrando la caché y todo lo demás. El tema es que volvió a pasar ahora y, la verdad, se me ocurre que tiene que haber otra cosa que hacer.  No me pasa con videos guardados en la PC o en otro navegador, copio el link del video y me voy a Edge y no pasa.  Tengo una Dell 7567 con un i7 7700hq y una Nvidia Geforce 1050 ti.
