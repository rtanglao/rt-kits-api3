How to fix that?,"<p>Hi, </p><p>Type <a href=""http://www.ebay.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">www.ebay.co.uk</a> in address bar.  I'm offered the chance to search Ebay but not to go to it.  When I simply press return on the address nothing happens.  Firefox doesn't go to ebay.  Tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.amazon.com</a>, same result can't get firefox to go to either site unless I search for them on google and click a link.   </p><p>These are popular sites for me.  How can I just type in the site I want I get it to go there?  And how come it's suddenly stopped allowing me to go directly to ebay &amp; amazon? </p><p>Many thanks! </p><p>Evan </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,"",evanmjones
