YouTube videos work correctly. </p><p>I've checked all topics in standard Firefox support, but did not find solution. </p><p>It looks like Google Widevine CDM is not working correctly, but it appears as active and actual version in browser settings. I'm not sure, if this is somehow related, but recently I migrated from Windows 7 to Win 10 doing upgrade,  not fresh install (not sure though, if on Win 7 it was working, or not. I wasn't using Prime or Spotify while on Win 7). Today I tried to reinstall the browser, so I have fresh settings right now, but still the same issue. Will appreciate any support. </p><p>Regards, Marcin </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;widevine;firefox-950;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1469162;,zieba66
