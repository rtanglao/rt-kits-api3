Checking menu-&gt;passwords gives 'no logins found' </p><p>I use Thunderbird Mail which I had not updated for years. I was starting to get a lot of certificate errors of some emails so I did an update (and set auto update) It's now at 91.4.1. This update broke Thunderbird in that is needed a passwork every time is started, or sent email, or attempted to check the server for emails. Totally unusable. Searches to fix this suggested two files are used, and one post suggested a third file. Suggestions were delete these files and Thunderbird would recreate them. I did, it did and the problem remained. However the third file mentioned in only one post DIDN'T get recreated. From memory the three files were cert9.db, key4.db and logins.json and I think it was logins.json that didn't create. I created a dummy file of the same name and now I can save my email login. </p><p>As a result of the above cert9.db, key4.db and logins.json were deleted, from the Firefox profile as well as the Thunderbird one. </p><p>On starting Firefox I quickly found I'd lost all the logins, and started re-adding them as I needed them. This worked for a while, but now I can't add any more. Firefox still prompts to save but next time that site is accessed it asks for the password again (earlier sites are still remembered) The dates on the files are logins.json 14/11/2021, cert9.db &amp; key4.db 15/11/2021 (current date 26/12/2021) I removed all these files from the Firefox profile, started Firefox and it recreated the two db files with the current date, logins.json was created with the date 13/11/2021, which is the date of logins-backup.json Next I deleted the three files and logins-backup.json and started Firefox, db files recreated but not logins.json this time. </p><p>In both cases the earier web sites still remember the passwords and the laster ones don't, and firefox still shows 'No logins found' </p><p>Where are the passwords stored? It's clearly not cert9 or key4, there's a hight source that can recreate these files </p><p>Is there a registry problem? </p><p>Thanks </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-950;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1469210;1469221;,martin.fowler
