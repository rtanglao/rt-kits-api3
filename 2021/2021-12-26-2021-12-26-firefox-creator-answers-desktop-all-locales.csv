In order to actually search for thesaurus I have to go through the dropdown and select to google thesaurus. </p><p>This is an absolutely ridiculous issue that so far seems to only be triggered with one keyword.  I have used multiple one word searches to attempt to replicate and none of them trigger the same action.  I have cleared my history, disabled search bar autofill from about:config, disabled search suggestions, restarted my computer, restarted firefox, none of these corrects the issue. </p><p>Obviously, I can simply go to google and search for a thesaurus, but this seems like an issue for tech support to correct rather than something expected to be worked around. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",xaroso8373
