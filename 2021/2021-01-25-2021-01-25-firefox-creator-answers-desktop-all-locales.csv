How do I stop this?,<p>I frequently get a pop-up indicating that Norton Password Manager has along running script and my webpage is very slow as a result. I have removed it and re-added it. What else can I do to stop the long-running script?  This only happens when I use Norton 360.  Is there some kind of conflict between the two? </p>,desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",crarja
