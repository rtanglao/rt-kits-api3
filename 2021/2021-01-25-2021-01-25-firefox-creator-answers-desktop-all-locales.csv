I assume this is done in the browser?  There is an answer to this question from 2014, but that answer does not work anymore (I tried it). All the other answers seem to be for mobile devices.  I would like to fit a certain amount of text from a website on one page. This is difficult in portrait mode. I am forced to zoom out to 50%, and it is then difficult to read the text. This is because I need to fit all the text on one page, for a screenshot.  Please note that I don't want to switch permanently to landscape. I just want landscape for one website. So it should preferably be easy to switch back and forth between portrait and landscape.  I have looked for this setting in my computer, and I can't find it.  Sorry if this is a dumb question. But I have been unable to find the answer myself. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",rose402
