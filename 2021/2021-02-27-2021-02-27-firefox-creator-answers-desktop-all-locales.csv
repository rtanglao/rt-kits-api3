Unfortunately, Android phones won't accept a text with a TIFF image, causing a delivery failure. There's more reasons why this is annoying, but that's the main one.

He utilizado otros navegadores como Chrome o Safari y esto no ocurre así que debe ser problema del navegador de Firefox. Llevo tiempo bastante tiempo intentando solucionarlo y aún no lo he conseguido. He probado de todo, he reinstalado firefox 100 veces, he eliminado todo el cache y las cookies otras 100 veces, he eliminado todas las extensiones e incluso he probado el modo seguro. Nada de esto ha solucionado mi problema. Mi dispositivo es un MacBook Pro (Retina, 15 pulgadas, mediados de 2015) con procesador Intel Core i7 de 4 núcleos 2,5 GHz, gráficos Intel Iris Pro 1536 MB y 16GB de RAM. Utilizo el sistema operativo macOS 11.2.2 (Big Sur). He probado versiones más antiguas de Firefox y en estas sí que funcionan los videos a pantalla completa. Concretamente, probé la versión de Firefox 79.0 y en esa sí funcionaba la pantalla completa pero a partir de la 80.0 creo que ya no funciona pues ahora estoy usando la última versión de Firefox (86.0) y sigue sin funcionar.
