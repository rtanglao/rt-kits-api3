This was a tremendous surprise, because I have totally forgotten <strong>account#2</strong> !!!. </p><p>Then I started some research to understand what was the history of <strong>account#2 </strong> and if it was in fact using the secondary email. After digging in old emails, I realize that in fact there was an <strong>account#2</strong>, and it make sense that I forgot about it, because the primary email linked to it, I no longer have access to. However, I do still have access to the secondary email in <strong>account#2</strong>. </p><p>Here is where it gets interesting. It seems that I am in some sort of lockout situation with the <strong>account#2</strong>, because the primary email no longer being available. When I attempt to follow procedures to:  <em>reset password</em>, I do received the email with the reset link (through the secondary email linked to account#2, that I still have access), but when I attempt to reset the password through the:  <em>reset link</em>, it reject this action and display popup error : ""Your email was just returned. Mistyped email?"". I am guessing because the primary email address is no longer available and it returns a not valid address from the server. </p><p>So what now?! To be clear I am not interested in saving<strong> account#2</strong> and regaining access. My only interest is to remove/detach the <em>secondary email address</em> from <strong>account#2</strong>, so I can used in<strong> account#1</strong>. If that makes sense. I know pretty OCD, I am not proud of it. </p><p>I understand that this will be very easy to do, if I could just log in into account#2 and removed the secondary email config, under manage the account, but of course i don't remember the password. So, what if I can't log in? Am I out of luck or can I do something through the secondary email address? If so so how? Which again, I have had access to that email all this time. </p><p>I did further research and in this <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/ive-lost-my-firefox-sync-account-information"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a> it says something promising about having a secondary email still accessible, even though primary is not: </p><p><em>Note: If you lost access to your Firefox Account email address, it's possible to change the primary email address, but only if you previously registered a secondary address for that account. That's because you are sent an email to your primary email address to confirm it, when you add a secondary address. </em> <em> </em> Regardless, I am assuming that it is referring to once you log in, of course. Is there any workaround to this or I am doom to just try to remember the password of no longer available primary email. </p><p>Please, help me. I understand that they maybe a slight change to detach my secondary email from account#2 and make it available to be used in account#1, but I am not sure how to do it and I have tried everything. </p><p>Thank you so much in advance and thank you for your patient if you make it to here, </p><p>Regards, </p><p>Alejandro </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,sync,en-US,1465921;1465923;1465924;,alestarrr01

Rád bych tedy věděl: 1. Je možnost předchozí relaci ještě nějak obnovit? 2. Proč mi opakovaně po některých aktualizacích předchozí relace mizí a jak tomu eventuálně předejít? 3. Proč (mně, či vůbec - to nevím) zmizela funkce Obnovit předchozí relaci? Děkuji moc za pomoc a radu! </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-950;,firefox,other,cs,"",stribrnak

It seems Firefox might be the app that's struggling the most post-update, causing the fans to run nearly constantly.  Never had this problem until upgrading. I've already been communicating with Apple about it and none of their suggestions for fixes have worked yet. I just saw someone post that they don't have problems watching videos in Safari, but now watching in Firefox with Monterey causes the fans to run like mad. I don't know that there's anything you guys can do about this, but I'm wanting to share that I think there's some kind of issue here.  I would prefer to keep using Firefox if possible, but I won't be able to if it keeps taxing the hardware like this.  I don't know how much you communicate with Apple, but something's up. </p><p>Thank you for all you do! </p>",mac-os;desktop;macos;,firefox,basic-browsing-firefox,en-US,"",mekabra
