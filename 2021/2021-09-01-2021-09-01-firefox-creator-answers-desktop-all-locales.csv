We really can’t afford to be involved with computers, and had to go to Linux when support ran out for Windows XP. Since writing this I found the Disks utility, (when searching for how to give a name to flash drives), which has buttons for “Check Filesystem” and “Repair Filesystem”. A check confirmed corruption, but trying “Repair”, twice, each time brought, “Error while repairing filesystem”. </p><p>It all started with downloading a large, 709.5 MB, Zip archive of FLAC audio files, (from the Internet Archive). With our slow connection, and the horribly underpowered old Compaq NetBook I was using, it took an hour and a half. (Compaq Mini CQ 10-100, originally Windows XP, now running Linux Mint Debian Edition4 32 bit.) I was downloading to a flash drive, and extracted the folder with files to the same flash drive. It said, “Error extracting files”, something it often says, and I haven’t been able to find an explanation of what that really means and what to do about it. I’ve simply been checking that the files are all there, and if not, fetching the missing ones singly. I don’t know why the downloaded files have larger MB numbers than are given on the dropdown lists for FLAC and VBR MP3 files under “Download Options”. I figure perhaps the error message is triggered by the MB discrepancy. </p><p>In this case, the two files, two sides of an LP, were there, with the usual larger MB count, but when I tried to Rename them, and when I tried “Properties”, I was told that I didn’t have the permissions to do that, and “Error setting permissions: Read-only file system”. Same thing when I tried to Delete the Zip archive, the folder with its two files, or the files separately. I tried Rename and Delete also on our better computer with the same result. </p><p>So the 64 GB flash drive with 11.8 GB space is now Read-only, and I can’t find what could have caused it, and how to, or if it’s possible to, undo that. (Micro Center 3.1 64 GB, five for $27. on Amazon, where the top reviewer neatly explains how they are, in effect, “factory seconds”.) </p><p>I hope it’s even safe to use it, to play all the music I’d downloaded to it, and copy files to disc. Would it be safe to play those two sides of that last record, or should it be avoided? I wonder, if I were to copy everything, except that last Zip archive and the folder and files extracted from it, off the now read-only flash drive, if it would even let me erase-reformat it, and if it did, if I should use it, or is it defective? </p><p>Another consequence, it would seem, of that download, is that there are 5.3 MB in the Firefox browser cache that will not clear. I found instructions in Mozilla support for how to delete the Firefox cache folder, but the file manager can’t find any such folder. I tried uninstalling and installing Firefox, but it kept my settings, and also that 5.3 MB of something in the cache. Why would something in the cache not clear? Can it be cleared? </p><p>So, to reiterate the questions: 1. Why would a flash drive – USB stick – suddenly become read-only? 2. Would that be an indication that the flash drive is defective? 3. Can it be restored to read-write? 4. Could it have been caused by a corrupt file, presumably corrupted in the long download? 5. Would the corrupt file also be what is refusing to be cleared from the Firefox browser cache? 6. Can that cache ever again be cleared to “0 bytes”? 7. Will the flash drive allow itself to be reformatted? 8. Is it safe to use the flash drive, either as is - read-only, for the files on it, or if it were to be reformatted? And would it be safe to play the two files of that last record, sitting there, undeletable? 9. What do you do when you get the message, “Error extracting files”? Do you extract again, and do you have it overwrite whatever files were extracted the first time, or “Skip” those? Do you just check that the files are all there and seem to be alright, and figure the error message was a false positive, perhaps caused by Checksum discrepancy? </p><p>Sorry for submitting such a long set of different but related questions, which include probably wrong notions misinterpreted from answers to similar searched-up questions, and are not necessarily LMDE-centric.

When i download a file with an extension unfamiliar to firefox, the download prompt opens, as it should be. What's missing is the option to select ""Do this automatically for files like this from now on"" before choosing an action. This means i can not ""teach"" firefox how to handle unfamiliar files which gets tedious when downloading them en masse. How do i get this option backin the prompt? Alternatively, is there another option to add file extensions and what to do with them to the Applications list in general settings? </p><p>Thank you very much! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-910;firefox-9102;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",nathalie-kiss

Then it started doing it more and more frequently, until last week when it started doing it every time I closed the session. I tried researching the problem, but I didn't find much. One source suggested closing the session by clicking Exit at the bottom of the Application Menu. No luck. I'm not sure if it has anything to do with having the box for Remember browsing and download history in Settings ticked; I hope not because I need to keep the browsing history. I can't think of anything else I've tried, and I really hope someone can help me with this.
