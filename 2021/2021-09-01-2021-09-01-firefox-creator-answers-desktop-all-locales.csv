I  have tried  2 - 3 times , to get the browser up and running correctly .  I  end up having to go through a 3 step process to be able to access the browser window .  I  have to go into the finder section on the  iMac , select firefox  ,  then a firefox window comes up and  I  double click on it .  Then , another window comes up and states that in order to use firefox ,  the program has to be downloaded from the internet ,  I  then go about and this option gets selected . Then at this point , the browser start page / window , and privacy statement page / window , become available to use .  I  have been unable to keep the firefox icon , on the iMac's home page / in the dock  .  The system at work on the iMac seems to be slowly disabling the ability for me to use firefox and even to install it properly in the first place . </p><pre>Thanks , for you anticipated help  Eddy  M . . . . . </pre>",desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1439728;,mrphy_edward

Also the thing on the left side where you can see who's in the movie is gone. </p><p>I did a ""Refresh"" of Firefox where it resets everything back to the original installation, and Amazon Prime works great.  </p><p>The problem is, all of my settings are gone, all my passwords, extensions, search engines, bookmarks, everything.  </p><p>I know how to reset many of these one by one, but not all. I went through the Profile items and folders one by one and could not get Amazon Prime to work and keep my settings.

Then it started doing it more and more frequently, until last week when it started doing it every time I closed the session. I tried researching the problem, but I didn't find much. One source suggested closing the session by clicking Exit at the bottom of the Application Menu. No luck. I'm not sure if it has anything to do with having the box for Remember browsing and download history in Settings ticked; I hope not because I need to keep the browsing history. I can't think of anything else I've tried, and I really hope someone can help me with this. I know a lot of other people have had this problem. </p><p>Thanks La Belle Otero </p><p>Windows 10 Windows Defender CCleaner Dragon NaturallySpeaking 15 </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-910;firefox-9102;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1439718;1439730;,Hamsterina

Of course I have a lot to learn, but is there a place that specifically explains the dev tools or presents them in the form of a lesson?
