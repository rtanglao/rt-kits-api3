It's the wierdest issue i have ever seen as it's random and there isn't a way to really reproduce it to as far as i know. </p><p>I am sure it's some setting that is synced with my account as i didn't have the problem before i have had this issue for a few years now i think and it's really annoying and have looked if there was anything similar to this issue and couldn't find anything. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-910;firefox-9102;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1439701;,pieter23

I haven't found any other way.  </p><p>I'm sure this must be possible but I'm not getting it. Of course I have a lot to learn, but is there a place that specifically explains the dev tools or presents them in the form of a lesson? My inability to figure out this highlight thing has been humbling, and searching specific questions has proven a dead end that just leads me back to this community site. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,"",skyhook1
