Also the thing on the left side where you can see who's in the movie is gone. </p><p>I did a ""Refresh"" of Firefox where it resets everything back to the original installation, and Amazon Prime works great.  </p><p>The problem is, all of my settings are gone, all my passwords, extensions, search engines, bookmarks, everything.  </p><p>I know how to reset many of these one by one, but not all. I went through the Profile items and folders one by one and could not get Amazon Prime to work and keep my settings. If I copied an entire old profile into the new profile, Amazon Prime works but my settings are gone again. </p><p>Any ideas? </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",dahixe6884

Then it started doing it more and more frequently, until last week when it started doing it every time I closed the session. I tried researching the problem, but I didn't find much. One source suggested closing the session by clicking Exit at the bottom of the Application Menu. No luck. I'm not sure if it has anything to do with having the box for Remember browsing and download history in Settings ticked; I hope not because I need to keep the browsing history. I can't think of anything else I've tried, and I really hope someone can help me with this. I know a lot of other people have had this problem. </p><p>Thanks La Belle Otero </p><p>Windows 10 Windows Defender CCleaner Dragon NaturallySpeaking 15 </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-910;firefox-9102;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Hamsterina

It's the wierdest issue i have ever seen as it's random and there isn't a way to really reproduce it to as far as i know. </p><p>I am sure it's some setting that is synced with my account as i didn't have the problem before i have had this issue for a few years now i think and it's really annoying and have looked if there was anything similar to this issue and couldn't find anything. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-910;firefox-9102;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1439701;1439709;,pieter23

I haven't found any other way.  </p><p>I'm sure this must be possible but I'm not getting it. Of course I have a lot to learn, but is there a place that specifically explains the dev tools or presents them in the form of a lesson? My inability to figure out this highlight thing has been humbling, and searching specific questions has proven a dead end that just leads me back to this community site. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,1439714;,skyhook1
