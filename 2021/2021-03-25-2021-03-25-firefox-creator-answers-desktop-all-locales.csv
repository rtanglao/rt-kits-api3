El motor de búsqueda que yo ocupo es Google, hasta ahí todo bien. Yo puedo estar de lo más normal usando Firefox haciendo mis búsquedas, pero en algunas ocasiones se cambia todo el formato de Google y la pestaña en vez de mostrarme el texto de lo que yo había buscado, por ejemplo, ""Firefox - Búsqueda con Google"", me pone ""Programmable Serch Engine"" y me busca como si fuera un formato algo antiguo de Google (adjunto imagen), no me agrega imágenes o referencias visuales a mis búsquedas y me pone muchos anuncios. Es algo molesto estar trabajando con esto y ya busqué en toda la configuración de Firefox si hay alguna forma para que deje de buscar con el Programmable Serch Engine y que haga mis búsquedas de manera normal, pero no encontré nada relacionado con el tema.  </p><p>Si alguien me podría ayudar con eso, se lo agradecería mucho. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,other,es,"",valentingreco

So I have tried to be carefull when setting up and using Firefox browsers. I thought I had delebritly set it up to NOT RECORD any email, username, or password EVER ! To prevent my info from leaking out. </p><p>Today I downloaded a free copy of  NordPass from their main website. Part of the set up is an option to import from other browsers, etc all emails/usernames and passwords to store them in one location under one password in NordPass. </p><p>When I seclected the ""Secure Notes"" for firefox I got a BIG SUPPRIZE ! There were 11 entries. Yes there was  my bank account password and username my firefox account password and username my google account password and username etc and two entries I am in the proccess of trying to locate and find out who they are ! just two urls and usernames and passwords that I never did create or visit thoses urls. </p><p>I am requesting your help in deleting this info from my account and keeping all my book marks intact. </p><p>I am also interested in preventing this from ever happening again. </p><p>Any ideas ? </p><p>William okillydokilly@tutanota.com </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",okillydokilly

Naturally that would involve disabling and reenabling the 2FA setting in my Firefox account. However after scanning the QR code, the Firefox setting keeps refusing ALL the codes generated by Authy.

It seems the problem is with Firefox as the Authy codes never had any problem with other 2FA logins. I hope it's not something like ""Firefox does not support Authy"".
