I have used various Firefox Browsers over the past few years on many different devices. </p><p>I have used the same  firefox account and password and username/email during that time. </p><p>My background was in electronics, E.E., Sci, etc. When I was in the Mil-Intel-Indust complex I came to know all electronic systems starting in the 1950's where backdoored. So I have tried to be carefull when setting up and using Firefox browsers. I thought I had delebritly set it up to NOT RECORD any email, username, or password EVER ! To prevent my info from leaking out. </p><p>Today I downloaded a free copy of  NordPass from their main website. Part of the set up is an option to import from other browsers, etc all emails/usernames and passwords to store them in one location under one password in NordPass. </p><p>When I seclected the ""Secure Notes"" for firefox I got a BIG SUPPRIZE ! There were 11 entries. Yes there was  my bank account password and username my firefox account password and username my google account password and username etc and two entries I am in the proccess of trying to locate and find out who they are ! just two urls and usernames and passwords that I never did create or visit thoses urls. </p><p>I am requesting your help in deleting this info from my account and keeping all my book marks intact. </p><p>I am also interested in preventing this from ever happening again. </p><p>Any ideas ? </p><p>William okillydokilly@tutanota.com </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",okillydokilly

STILL NO BOOKMARKS.,"<p>The bookmarks toolbar isn't showing any bookmarks.  I searched for help documents and did everything I was instructed to do but the icons are still not showing.  If I attempt to right click the toolbar, it doesn't recognize and doesn't give me a pop up menu to choose from.  I'm baffled. </p>",mac-os;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-870;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1401099;1401103;,keoatalig

Naturally that would involve disabling and reenabling the 2FA setting in my Firefox account. However after scanning the QR code, the Firefox setting keeps refusing ALL the codes generated by Authy. Entering the key manually in Authy also still producing the same error (""Incorrect two-step authentication code""). </p><p>I have tried searching the help articles here and browsing similar questions by other users but still could not find any working solution (going back to Google Authenticator is not the kind of solution I'm looking for). It seems the problem is with Firefox as the Authy codes never had any problem with other 2FA logins. I hope it's not something like ""Firefox does not support Authy"". No thanks to that now I'm left with unprotected account. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",halfey
