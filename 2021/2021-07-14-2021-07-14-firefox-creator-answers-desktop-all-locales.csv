We record a sequence of clicks as a 'flow' or 'task'. i.e. After the first click is invoked, we wait 5 s for the page to load and then invoke the 2nd click. </p><p>setTimeout(function(){UDAPluginSDK.showhtml();}, 5000); </p><p>Now, instead of waiting for 5s, we want to explore if we can invoke the 2nd click as soon as the page is loaded. We tried using ""onPageLoad"" but we realised that this does not work for modern single page (responsive) applications. i.e. we don't know when the js has finished executing. </p><p>window.addEventListener('load', (event) =&gt; { </p><pre>  setTimeout(function (){      UDAPluginSDK.modifybodyhtml();   },2000); </pre> <p>}); </p>",desktop;websites;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",yureshwar

Some pages take a second or longer to load, and I don't want to wait to click a different shortcut. I can also click the X to stop the current page loading and then other shortcuts work fine. It's when the current page is still loading which ANY other bookmark is clicked that Firefox merely reloads the page that I'm already on. This is really annoying. It will do it continuously if I keep clicking on any shortcut when the page loads. The same page, the original page. Forever. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1427431;1427438;,fidothree

During this time, I can interact with websites, but it doesn't change the visuals or show that anything has changed. new tabs open but don't show up, youtube video audio plays but the screen remains fixed. Firefox usage for just 7 tabs is well over 5 gigatybes of ram and  10-20% cpu at all times. </p><p>I attempted everything on the help page, including: killing and restarting firefox, updating firefox, updating windows, restarting my computer, killing firefox and rebooting again, disabling extensions, and updating graphics drivers. </p><p>after rebooting with the new windows update, firefox ran smoothly for a brief minute and showed normal cpu/ram usage, but quickly climbed back up to pre reboot numbers. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1427442;,ametueraspirant

I have not been with Norton for over 20 years due to the issues of Norton and earlier Mac applications. However, now, it's like old times -- when I add the Mac El Capitan to be protected by Norton everything looks ok however, when I go to open a page in Firefox, it just becomes a blank page. It won't load. </p><p>So, in other words:  HELP! </p><p>Should I request a refund?  Please advise. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,"",hblaswilson
