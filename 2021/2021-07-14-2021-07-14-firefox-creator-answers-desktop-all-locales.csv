When I updated to 90, they disappeared and only one (current) tab shows up at bottom right (second screen shot). I cannot find a way to see all open tabs as before - only when I close the current tab will the entire lineup of open tabs show for a moment and then go back to the single current open tab. I can't work this way and it's driving me crazy. I've searched online, tried changing settings in about:config and nothing seems to want to put all open tabs back up top where they were. What am I missing?  (More - I am trying to upload a screen shot and just get the spinning gear. The file is below the upload size limit.

In pratica i caratteri appaiono speculari. Questo è successo dopo che ho installato un font di mia creazione che avevo chiamato Times New Roman Mirror che mi serve, abbastanza raramente, per riprodurre delle scritte speculari.  Ovviamente ho disinstallato il font in questione ma il problema permane solo con Firefox mentre su Chrome tutto funziona correttamente come peraltro in tutte le altre applicazioni come Word, Excel ecc.  Prima di procedere con una nuova installazione di Firefox, che essendo il mio browser preferito, ha ormai al suo interno moltissimi dati personali memorizzati, con la perdita dei dati stessi, volevo chiedere se qualcuno ha suggerimenti per risolvere il problema.  Tra l'altro non sono nemmeno sicuro che una nuova installazione risolverebbe il problema. Premetto che ho provato a sostituire il font predefinito nelle preferenze ma non ho ottenuto alcun risultato e qualsiasi font metta Firefox mantiene sempre il TNR. Da notare che l'anomalia si presenta solo con il TNR normale mentre invece (come si può notare nell' immagine allegata) il Grassetto sembra non avere problemi. Ho provato a creare nuovi profili sulla base di vecchi dati salvati in precedenza ma nulla è cambiato. La prova finale è stata quella di cercare anche con about:config ma ho lasciato tutto inalterato dato che non saprei nemmeno come o cosa cercare. Un ringraziamento anticipato per qualsiasi suggerimento. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,it,"",freddy.furlan

Frequently, if I take time out to do some other pressing task (in response to email etc.) and that task opens a new window, sometimes closing my main window without my knowledge, this appears to cause a problem for FF in that if the new window is closed after I've finished the task and now find that my main window has already been closed, the restore tabs procedure restores the last session tabs and appears to have dumped my main session tabs. As you will readily understand, this makes it a long drawn out problem trying to restore my working point from history when I can't remember exactly which tabs were still open or which page I had landed on. I do hope you follow all that. My question is how can I prevent this from messing me up again in future? Is there a way to retain session details so I can select them again after other windows have been opened and closed?
