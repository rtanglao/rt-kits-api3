I was a long time xmarks user. However today it went off the rails. I booted a virtual machine for the first time in years and while on that vm I used firefox. That copy of firefox had never had sync enabled and the bookmarks were very old. I uncautiously turned sync on, thinking that it'd favor the current bookmarks over years old bookmarks. Nope. Now I find all of my active instances of firefox (all windows flavors) have bookmarks from 2016. Two things.  </p> <ol><li>1 What's the best way to restore my current bookmarks? I have backups from last night and maybe even more recent. I know how to restore bookmarks...but I'm concerned that sync will just repeat the same error and adjust to the 2016 set.  </li><li>2 How did this happen? I have gotten to trust sync so much that I just enabled on the old firefox without taking any precautions. That was probably a mistake plain and simple - sync is complex and that sort of gap in dates could be unanticipated. But still it seems odd that sync would favor an ancient set over the current set. </li></ol> <p>Firefox is a great browser and sync is part of that greatness.

Ich habe keine Ahnung was ich nun noch tun könnte. </p><p>Hello, I recently started having problems with Firefox + Youtube. When I watch a video, the video stops for a short time and the round loading symbol appears. Then the sound has disappeared. The sound stays off even when I reload the video. The problem occurs at completely different times. Sometimes after 2 minutes and sometimes only after 15 minutes. Other browsers work and otherwise I have no problems with the sound. I cleared the cache and cleaned Firefox. Unfortunately, the problem still persists. I have no idea what else to do now. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",schlingel78

In pratica i caratteri appaiono speculari. Questo è successo dopo che ho installato un font di mia creazione che avevo chiamato Times New Roman Mirror che mi serve, abbastanza raramente, per riprodurre delle scritte speculari.  Ovviamente ho disinstallato il font in questione ma il problema permane solo con Firefox mentre su Chrome tutto funziona correttamente come peraltro in tutte le altre applicazioni come Word, Excel ecc.  Prima di procedere con una nuova installazione di Firefox, che essendo il mio browser preferito, ha ormai al suo interno moltissimi dati personali memorizzati, con la perdita dei dati stessi, volevo chiedere se qualcuno ha suggerimenti per risolvere il problema.  Tra l'altro non sono nemmeno sicuro che una nuova installazione risolverebbe il problema. Premetto che ho provato a sostituire il font predefinito nelle preferenze ma non ho ottenuto alcun risultato e qualsiasi font metta Firefox mantiene sempre il TNR. Da notare che l'anomalia si presenta solo con il TNR normale mentre invece (come si può notare nell' immagine allegata) il Grassetto sembra non avere problemi. Ho provato a creare nuovi profili sulla base di vecchi dati salvati in precedenza ma nulla è cambiato. La prova finale è stata quella di cercare anche con about:config ma ho lasciato tutto inalterato dato che non saprei nemmeno come o cosa cercare. Un ringraziamento anticipato per qualsiasi suggerimento. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,it,1427553;1427640;,freddy.furlan
