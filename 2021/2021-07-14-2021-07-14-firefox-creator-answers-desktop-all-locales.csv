For example sometimes youtube tells that there is a connection problem, when loading gmail I get "" has experienced a network protocol violation that cannot be repaired"". When I use other browser I can access to that services with no problem. I am in linux, and I have tried disabling all the add-ons, starting in ""safe-mode"" and rebooting my computer. At the beginning everything works fine, but after some time starts failing. I have tried with different Firefox versions, and the problems persists. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-890;firefox-8902;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",inaki6martinez

We can find the same recordednode by comparing the json attributes and matching to the original node on the page. We have one problem here when we search for the nodes sometimes we get similar nodes via json which has same property names. In that case we are trying to match the node position that we have recorded. When we try to match the node position in different screen resolutions, it gives us the wrong node. How do we solve this.

Some pages take a second or longer to load, and I don't want to wait to click a different shortcut. I can also click the X to stop the current page loading and then other shortcuts work fine. It's when the current page is still loading which ANY other bookmark is clicked that Firefox merely reloads the page that I'm already on. This is really annoying. It will do it continuously if I keep clicking on any shortcut when the page loads. The same page, the original page. Forever. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1427431;1427438;,fidothree
