I have not been with Norton for over 20 years due to the issues of Norton and earlier Mac applications. However, now, it's like old times -- when I add the Mac El Capitan to be protected by Norton everything looks ok however, when I go to open a page in Firefox, it just becomes a blank page. It won't load. </p><p>So, in other words:  HELP! </p><p>Should I request a refund?  Please advise. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,"",hblaswilson
