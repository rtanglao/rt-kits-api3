I would like to know how to turn it off. It is a good try.  My printing off the web usually involves only selected pages, i.e. not All pages. With the new Firefox feature, I don't like having to click on All, then click on Custom, then select pages to print.  I would much prefer using the system dialog box where I can just immediately enter pages, 2-3 for example, and print. Edge has this same printing issue, too many clicks to do the simple task of printing only specified pages. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,customize,en-US,1386258;,Quenchoo
