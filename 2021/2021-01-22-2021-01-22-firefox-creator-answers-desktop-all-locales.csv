Now it freezes on the initial screen every time I run it.  The only time I solved it was rebooting the machine...which worked...once.  It locked up the very next time.  Reloading Firefox doesn't fix it.  Just a reboot.   </p><p>Most of the answers I saw said Version 84.0.2 was the fix for that...but that's what I'm running.  Any further suggestions?   With my rookie status on the MAC. it could well be operator error.   Thanks everyone! </p>,desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-840;firefox-8402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",geno404
