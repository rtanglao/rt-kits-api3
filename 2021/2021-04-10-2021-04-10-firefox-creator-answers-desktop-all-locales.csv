I've found that this page's ""Next"" button works correctly (that is, it loads the page on which the user would then indicate the amount to be transferred) on Firefox 40.0.2, but it works incorrectly (that is, it only underlines the word ""Next"" and does not load a new page) on Firefox 52.9.0 and Firefox 87.0.2.

And I discovered that the page source displayed by Firefox 40.0.2 contained content that was absent from the page source displayed by either of the other two Firefox versions. Some of this content appeared to define a function that returns content to the server when ""Next"" was clicked. If true, this could certainly account for why clicking the button didn't do what it should. </p><p>I noticed that the page source uses as many as 12 nested levels of &lt;div&gt;-&lt;/div&gt; elements, which  seems counter to the advice I read at an HTML standards page (at <a href=""http://whatwg.org"" rel=""nofollow"">whatwg.org</a>). But I don't know whether this could be a factor in the behavior I described. </p><p>I've copied the page source for each Firefox version and pasted them into text files, but I wasn't sure it would be appropriate to post them publicly.

I think that <strong>ALL inherited or default properties of elements ought to be clearly shown in the inspect tool's styling listings.</strong> You could spend hours maddeningly trying to find the cause of some of these offsets to what you expected to display.  The curious thing is that <strong>some</strong> inherited or default property values are shown on the inspect tool - which leads us to assume that what is seen on inspect is all that there is . . .
