A hotkey toggle would be preferred. Currently I am using some old CSS I found online but it's got some pretty glaring issues such as search suggestions being cutoff. Supposedly this was possible back in 2011 with an extension and something called ""zombie mode"" but the extension is no longer available (and most likely wouldn't work anymore). Thanks. </p> <ol><li>navigator-toolbox { </li></ol> <pre>   position: relative;    z-index: 1;    height: 3px;    margin-bottom: -3px;    opacity: 0;    overflow: hidden; </pre> <p>} </p> <ol><li>navigator-toolbox:hover { </li></ol> <pre>   height: auto;    margin-bottom: 0px;    opacity: 1;    overflow: show; </pre> <p>} </p> <ol><li>content-deck{ </li></ol> <pre>   position:relative;    z-index: 0; </pre> <p>} </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,customize,en-US,1404800;,dodosssssssssssssss
