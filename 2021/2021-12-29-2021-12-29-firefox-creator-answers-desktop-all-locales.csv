So I immediately closed yahoo window to avoid issues and tried to upload the screenshot below. But Firefox said the ""image was too large""....really?  I crop it down and try again and it's just spinning below for 5 minutes...so forget it.  Now I can't post this with that image upload spinning endlessly.

This issue started a few months ago and I have posted this problem in other forums but with no help at all so let´s try here. When I go to Youtube and start scrolling down, the page refresh itself, and when I scroll up again to the top, the fourth video on the first row is gone, it´s just a white field. I have used Firefox for many years and this have never happened. Youtube is the only page I have problems with. This is what I have done/ tried so far: </p><p>Sign out from Google and Youtube, did not help.  Erased all cookies and browser data, did not help. Disabled all extensions (add-ons), did not help. Removed all extensions and add-ons, did not help. Uninstalled Firefox and installed it again, did not help. Tried MS Edge, much smoother browsing and no issues at all. Tried Opera, the page (Youtube) is refreshing sometimes but no more issues than that. Tried Vivaldi browser, no really issues but that´s not for me. Tried Tor browser, no issues. And the last one I´ve tried, Brave, when I open Youtube the fourth video is already missing but it does not refresh the page when I scroll down. </p><p>Firefox version 95.0.2 64Bit. Windows 10 Home 21H1. </p><p>With all that said, I really hope there is someone here that can and will help med with this, I would appreciate so much. </p>",desktop;websites;youtube;windows-10;firefox-9502;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",Rexxo
