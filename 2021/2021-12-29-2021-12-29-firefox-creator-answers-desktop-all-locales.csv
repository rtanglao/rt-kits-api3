This is a major problem with banking websites. Example: I go to log on to my banking website which requires two Factor authentication. The phone call comes in with the authentication code and auto minimizes Firefox when the phone app launches. I go back to Firefox, and it has stepped back to full web pages back to the credentials entry page which requires another authentication call from the website! This leads to an endless cycle of redirects which cannot be circumvented currently.  Firefox needs to remember AND STAY where it was with all entered field data; 1)when minimized, 2)when selecting an alternate tab or window, 3)when selecting an informational link on the date of field entry page (selecting an info link should not erase my data that I'd already entered), 4) when selecting the Share Data button on this very support page (which I can't actually use right now because it'll erase what I just typed when it tells me it can't access my data) </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",steveaaayyy

This issue started a few months ago and I have posted this problem in other forums but with no help at all so let´s try here. When I go to Youtube and start scrolling down, the page refresh itself, and when I scroll up again to the top, the fourth video on the first row is gone, it´s just a white field. I have used Firefox for many years and this have never happened. Youtube is the only page I have problems with. This is what I have done/ tried so far: </p><p>Sign out from Google and Youtube, did not help.  Erased all cookies and browser data, did not help. Disabled all extensions (add-ons), did not help. Removed all extensions and add-ons, did not help. Uninstalled Firefox and installed it again, did not help. Tried MS Edge, much smoother browsing and no issues at all. Tried Opera, the page (Youtube) is refreshing sometimes but no more issues than that. Tried Vivaldi browser, no really issues but that´s not for me. Tried Tor browser, no issues. And the last one I´ve tried, Brave, when I open Youtube the fourth video is already missing but it does not refresh the page when I scroll down. </p><p>Firefox version 95.0.2 64Bit.
