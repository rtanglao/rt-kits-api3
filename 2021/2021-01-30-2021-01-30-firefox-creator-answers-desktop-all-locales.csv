I always use my browser in maximised windows and in other browsers like Brave or Chrome, I can easily move my mouse pointer all the way to the right on the screen and click the mouse to snap to a particular place on the scroll bar, since the scroll bar extends all the way to the right edge of the window. </p><p>However, in Firefox it seems that there is padding on the right side of the scroll bar meaning that I 'overshoot' the scroll bar itself and accidentally click on the padding, which sends the scroll bar flying all over the place. </p><p>How can I remove the padding on the right of the scroll bar and get a functionality similar to other browsers?
