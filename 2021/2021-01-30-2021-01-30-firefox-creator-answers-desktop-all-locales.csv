So I wonder about all of the extensions. </p><p>I see Password Managers, Anti trackers, Anti Virus, Ad blockers, pop-up blockers, and other extensions that don't seem to fit into any category.   There are also proxy managers and alternative search sites, not to mention VPNs.  I understand that some password managers offer different features than Firefox.  And I understand that one might choose to select an anti-virus program or have a standalone.   </p><p>But the others seem to offer features that Firefox offers and are recommended by Firefox.  Is it that Firefox is good at many of these and there are some specialists to offer greater security? </p><p>I've got an ad blocker, a password manager, as well as HTTPS Anywhere, Privacy Badger.  I use Cloudfare's DNS Server, a VPN when traveling, have a standalone virus checker, Ghostery, DuckDuckGo Security Essentials, a dead bolt lock and a laser defense system.  I change my route to work each day, have removed my amalgam fillings, change my hair color weekly band am known for my collection of tin-foil hats. </p><p>But seriously, I do recognize the need.  But I wonder if redundancy is a problem.  I see things recommended and ask, ""But doesn't Firefox do that already?"", ""Does this duplicate what the other add on does?"" and ""Won't all these add ons conflict, use up more memory, or cause problems?""   </p><p>It feels as if I'm getting on a boat that promotes the security features that offers to sell me extra life preservers as I enter. </p>",desktop;other;firefox-850;,firefox,other,en-US,"",RyqWA

Is that safe, i.e., is the credit card information encrypted (even without a Primary Password)?   </p><p>And if so, would anybody be able to explain the differences between these two approaches and why it's not possible to use OS authentication with logins/passwords in a safe way but it is with Credit Cards? </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-850;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",jdhauck
