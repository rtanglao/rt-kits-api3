Suddenly after I installed Firefox 85, if I clicked on the Mafware Solutions link at page bottom, it went to a scrambled version of the current allenstown-alt page looking like it lost the css file that controls page elements but the address bar shows <a href=""https://www.mafware.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mafware.com/</a> If I added index.html to the URL, it correctly went to <a href=""http://mafware.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mafware.com</a> </p><p>I tried using Edge and got the same weird results. Even after a Windows 10 Restart, I get the same weird behavior. Has anyone else had this problem?

I had this issue on the same forms one year ago, as well. The reports had a label at the top that read: STMT Retriever.aspx_MozillaFirefox. I printed those forms instantly with my phone. When it happened again just today, I gave it further thought; so I brought up the Microsoft Edge browser, brought up my investment account, and brought up the first page that was blacked out with the Firefox browser. The page printed perfectly, just as it had with my phone. </p><p>This occurred on both my laptop and my desktop computers. Can someone please tell me why this is happening and if there is a way to make this work with Firefox? </p><p>thank you, Ralph Bohannon </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",rjbohannon
