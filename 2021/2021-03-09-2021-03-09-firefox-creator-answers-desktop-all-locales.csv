My firefox sometimes, specifically when opening a second tab (doesn't happen on a third, fourth, fifth, etc. tab) and pressing F (like starting to type Facebook), makes my entire screen to fade to black for 1 second, and then comes back. If I do type facebook, it shows ""acebook"", ignoring the F entirely. It doesn't seem like a crash, it seems a lot like a functionality of sorts that's acting up, because it doesn't go black just like that, it fades. And it always takes the same amount of time with that fade. </p><p>What's worse, it doesn't always happen. If it happens once I can replicate it and keep doing it, but as I use the browser and it stops doing it, I can't do it again. Until, well, it does. </p><p>This is the weirdest thing.

I suspected that it was my nvidia 3080 card as I read it is having some problems, but reinstalling drivers/everything did nothing. </p><p>What solutions I have tried: Proper reinstall of firefox. I wiped all the files of my pc, registry, everything. Scoured as much as I could find. Installed, got my passwords off my laptop, seemed promising and ...nop, problem still here. </p><p>Disabled hardware acceleration. Didn't help at all. Disabled all add-ons when starting firefox normally. Still same problem. Wiped the cache again, kept addons and acceleration disabled, disabled firefox updater (and some system check-thing as some recommended) and still the problem is there.  </p><p>I outright started to fully wipe and reinstall stuff like my nvidia drivers with specialized software, but that also didn't help.  What on earth could it be? Is windows somehow messed up? But then why does it work in safe mode and all other browsers work fine?

I have a bit more information now, but not much.  If I start FF, every web page that I go to pauses for ~8 seconds, and then begins to load.  After about 2-3 days of this happening, FF starts working properly and loads web pages instantly instead of just sitting there doing nothing for the 8 seconds.  FF will then work properly until I have to quit the program.  When I restart, the same process happens again.  This is frustrating as I have no idea why this would be happening.  From my previous time asking this question, I was asked to disable my addons (didn't help), start FF in safe mode (did help), but nothing concrete came out of the discussion.  I'm hoping someone else has had this problem in the meantime and has figured out what could be causing this problem. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-860;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1397541;1397542;1397546;1397615;1397686;1397698;,bgula
