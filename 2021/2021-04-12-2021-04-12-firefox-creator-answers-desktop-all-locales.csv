I open the task manager and I see that Firefox is running and using a huge amount of the CPU and apparently consuming a lot of the battery as well.  Firefox is not there in my startup list.  I have reinstalled and installed multiple times.  I have tried changing toolkit.winRegisterApplicationRestart to false. I have tried changing browser.tabs.remote.autostart to false. </p><p>If I do open Firefox now, without ending the task that is already running, and then close it later, it is still running in the background. Only way to stop this task running is to end task and I have to do it every time I switch on my Laptop. </p><p>I hope I have described the problem well, please let me know what other details I can provide. I am putting a screenshot of the task running as well. Thanks in advance </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",anupambhaskarb

Please try again. IDID-1060 --. this is going on for 3? weeks now. i have called tech support through spectrum with no help. they could get in on their end and we changed pw's but it didn't help me. also--and i have no idea if this matters at all, but it disturbs me... the padlock right beside the address box says -verified by amazon-. why is that? at times when i have hovered that at websites, it says verified by, and the name of my security service. i can't 100% say that i have checked it when signing into spectrum tho, but still i don't understand why it would say amazon! i much prefer using firefox! but i also feel like i shouldn't have to use chrome part time to get to certain sites or do certain things. PLEASE PLEASE help me figure this out. </p><p>P.S. i am already forced to use chrome to play games on facebook for years now. except bingo blitz, which is odd to me. i can play that through firefox. sighs. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1405273;,bebomije

Glad someone is here to help! </p><p>Last week I was signed out of my Hotmail account. Which is now technically Outlook, but I still have a Hotmail email address. I did not sign out. Just came home to discover that I was signed out. I found the main Outlook sign up page, which also had ""sign in"" on it, which I clicked.  </p><p>The next thing that showed up was a mostly blank page with  the Microsoft squares, my email address, and password filled in in the upper left corner of the page. Underneath it said ""next"" which I clicked, and nothing happened. I tried to chat with Microsoft about it, and in the end I downloaded Chrome, which instantly let me into my account. I truly don't want to use Chrome. But so far my ability to access my account via Firefox has not been successful. I would be so happy if anyone could help me understand what is gong on, and how to fix it. Thank for reading this!!!!!!  ps I have Linux as my operating system.  I had someone who knows Linux well come to help me, but he couldn't figure it out either. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-870;,firefox,other,en-US,"",vkrull
