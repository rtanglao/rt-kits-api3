Glad someone is here to help! </p><p>Last week I was signed out of my Hotmail account. Which is now technically Outlook, but I still have a Hotmail email address. I did not sign out. Just came home to discover that I was signed out. I found the main Outlook sign up page, which also had ""sign in"" on it, which I clicked.  </p><p>The next thing that showed up was a mostly blank page with  the Microsoft squares, my email address, and password filled in in the upper left corner of the page. Underneath it said ""next"" which I clicked, and nothing happened. I tried to chat with Microsoft about it, and in the end I downloaded Chrome, which instantly let me into my account. I truly don't want to use Chrome. But so far my ability to access my account via Firefox has not been successful. I would be so happy if anyone could help me understand what is gong on, and how to fix it. Thank for reading this!!!!!!  ps I have Linux as my operating system.  I had someone who knows Linux well come to help me, but he couldn't figure it out either. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-870;,firefox,other,en-US,"",vkrull
