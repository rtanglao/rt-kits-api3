Please try again. IDID-1060 --. this is going on for 3? weeks now. i have called tech support through spectrum with no help. they could get in on their end and we changed pw's but it didn't help me. also--and i have no idea if this matters at all, but it disturbs me... the padlock right beside the address box says -verified by amazon-. why is that? at times when i have hovered that at websites, it says verified by, and the name of my security service. i can't 100% say that i have checked it when signing into spectrum tho, but still i don't understand why it would say amazon! i much prefer using firefox! but i also feel like i shouldn't have to use chrome part time to get to certain sites or do certain things. PLEASE PLEASE help me figure this out. </p><p>P.S. i am already forced to use chrome to play games on facebook for years now. except bingo blitz, which is odd to me. i can play that through firefox. sighs. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1405273;,bebomije

Glad someone is here to help! </p><p>Last week I was signed out of my Hotmail account. Which is now technically Outlook, but I still have a Hotmail email address. I did not sign out. Just came home to discover that I was signed out. I found the main Outlook sign up page, which also had ""sign in"" on it, which I clicked.  </p><p>The next thing that showed up was a mostly blank page with  the Microsoft squares, my email address, and password filled in in the upper left corner of the page. Underneath it said ""next"" which I clicked, and nothing happened. I tried to chat with Microsoft about it, and in the end I downloaded Chrome, which instantly let me into my account. I truly don't want to use Chrome. But so far my ability to access my account via Firefox has not been successful. I would be so happy if anyone could help me understand what is gong on, and how to fix it. Thank for reading this!!!!!!  ps I have Linux as my operating system.  I had someone who knows Linux well come to help me, but he couldn't figure it out either. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-870;,firefox,other,en-US,"",vkrull
