I use to be able to simplify, change background and have more options.  This looks like the printing options on Microsoft Edge. I started using Firefox to get away from that.  I mean if your going to mimic edge then why not use that browser instead??? Stop changing things.  You update every 5 minutes and then it crashes, is to slow or just doesn't work. Slow the hell down and remember people like Firefox because it isn't like the big companies out there. It's a good browser.  Leave it alone. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,other,en-US,1395910;,theladymoonstone

I'm redirected to the first screen (screen 3), I did not just rename image 1 as image 3 and re-upload it. Image 3 is the actual 3rd window I'm redirected to. I have cleared cookies and caches and histories and deleted possibly corrupt cookies.sqlite files. I have cleared the startup cache and disabled add-ons and logged in in safe mode. I have uninstalled and reinstalled firefox. It's not all sites with logins, either. just certain sites, and it remains consistent which sites I can or can't log into. I have googled this problem with as many different re-wordings as I can come up with and no one else seems to quite have this exact problem.

My bookmarks, plugins, login and password data are just gone. Years of data are gone. There is no ""old profile data"" and oddly enough none of the profiles have anything in them anyways. I have tried everything suggested and NOTHING has worked. Most people have no clue about the files and folders and definitely shouldn't be moving stuff around as most of the threads have suggested. What is a key3 or 4 file? Why should I have to move it? Where does one move it to? None of the threads on this topic are helpful and there's no way to just ask a person who works here? Considering this seems to happen to a lot of people it should be made much easier to do. I can't even import my old logins from Safari. Is years of my data just gone? If Im signed into my Firefox account shouldn't it be there, or what is the point of having one? I need a very easy solution to this extremely frustrating issue. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;escalate;needsinfo;dataloss;firefox-860;,firefox,other,en-US,1395911;1395922;,AJ2222
