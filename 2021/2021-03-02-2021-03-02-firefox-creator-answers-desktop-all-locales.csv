Absolutely the opposite - in a world where every app is now a cloud web app, we need to be able to separate different apps within windows, not just have multiple indistinguishable windows or tabs for each of the apps. So yes this was a seriously retrograde decision, and one which is sending firefox in a backward direction. SSB was the future.
