My bookmarks, plugins, login and password data are just gone. Years of data are gone. There is no ""old profile data"" and oddly enough none of the profiles have anything in them anyways. I have tried everything suggested and NOTHING has worked. Most people have no clue about the files and folders and definitely shouldn't be moving stuff around as most of the threads have. This has happened one other time and it was far from being this difficult.  I can't even import my old logins from Safari. Is years of my data just gone? If Im signed into my Firefox account shouldn't it be there, or what is the point of having one? I need a very easy solution to this extremely frustrating issue. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-860;,firefox,other,en-US,"",AJ2222
