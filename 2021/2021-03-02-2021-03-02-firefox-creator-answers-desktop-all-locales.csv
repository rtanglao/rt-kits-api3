Also, I erroneously drag ""Bookmark menu"" and firefox create a copy of it inside ""Other bookmarks"" folder.

I can start the DAW and have sounds there. It worked perfectly. </p><p>But now suddenly no sound in Firefox. I just starts, no errors or anything, but no sound. I had a look a some of the FAQ's but nothing changed. Reinstall etc. Well short story, Edge works, so now firefox sadly have to go. </p><p>Thx for the good work.

(In my environment, although the default font is set to sans-serif, the serif font is used for printed pages.) Can we specify default fonts for printing?

I use to be able to simplify, change background and have more options.  This looks like the printing options on Microsoft Edge. I started using Firefox to get away from that.  I mean if your going to mimic edge then why not use that browser instead??? Stop changing things.  You update every 5 minutes and then it crashes, is to slow or just doesn't work. Slow the hell down and remember people like Firefox because it isn't like the big companies out there. It's a good browser.

My bookmarks, plugins, login and password data are just gone. Years of data are gone. There is no ""old profile data"" and oddly enough none of the profiles have anything in them anyways. I have tried everything suggested and NOTHING has worked. Most people have no clue about the files and folders and definitely shouldn't be moving stuff around as most of the threads have suggested. What is a key3 or 4 file? Why should I have to move it? Where does one move it to? None of the threads on this topic are helpful and there's no way to just ask a person who works here? Considering this seems to happen to a lot of people it should be made much easier to do. I can't even import my old logins from Safari. Is years of my data just gone? If Im signed into my Firefox account shouldn't it be there, or what is the point of having one?
