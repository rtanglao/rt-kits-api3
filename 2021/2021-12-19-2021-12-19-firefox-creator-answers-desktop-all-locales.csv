I have a site that I visit frequently but these past two updates have now broken my ability to sign into the site at all, even in private mode. All I get is the shield and human icons with the strike-through and the error message on the user name/password field that says: This Connection Is Not Secure. Logins Entered Here Could Be Compromised. Learn More.  </p><p>I've hit the escape button, tried private windows, done everything I can including resetting which was my last resort and which I hate doing, there's no more whitelist, no way to bypass anything, this is totally unacceptable that I cannot get past this. Firefox is becoming more useless to me as they try to become more and more in control of what I can and cannot do. If there is no override to this, then I have to find a different browser because it's pretty useless to use one browser for some sites and another for other sites, don't you think? So if someone has a workaround for this problem, can you please tell me what it is? </p>",desktop;beta;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",tigrisan

When I want to print a yahoo email all that comes up in the print option is the headers and footers but not the body of the text. I spoke with Yahoo. They suggested trying Google Chrome.  So, I opened Yahoo in the Chrome browser and tried to print the same email text. It worked perfectly. So  the problem  was not Yahoo, but Firefox.  </p><p>I very much prefer to use Firefox as my browser, but I can not continue with it if I am unable to print out my Yahoo emails when using Firefox. </p><p>Can you help me solve this problem please? </p><p>Carl Warsowe ... </p><p><br> edited email from public and search/spam bots view on this community forum. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,other,en-US,"",carlwarsowe

Of course, I’m not *certain* it’s Firefox causing the crashes, but it seems like it.  </p><p>Using Firefox &gt; seemingly on click (no specific type of object that I’ve discerned) but once in a while just if I have the browser open in the background &gt; computer freezers &gt; fans whir at max for about a second &gt; computer crashes &amp; automatically restarts </p><p>This happened once before. I’m assuming by the version number that it might be due to a new update. Before, I put up with it for a couple days then it went away on its own. This was months ago but fewer than 6 months. My computer is in good condition (no falls or rough treatment, it’s a 2019, the hard drive isn’t anywhere near full, etc) so it really SHOULDN’T be something failing, but the sequence of events is so weird.  </p><p>Anyone else experiencing this on 95.0.1? Has anyone else experienced this before? Already tried a fresh install. Going to see if I can revert to 94.something to test my theory that it is Firefox… and save me from having to use some other browser. I have a text file of the crash output that gets sent to Apple but I do not see a good way to attach it here. </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-950;firefox-9501;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",spacekidariel
