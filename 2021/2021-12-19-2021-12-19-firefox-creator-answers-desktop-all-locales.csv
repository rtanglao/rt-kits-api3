1361702,2021-12-18 16:11:20 -0800,2021-12-18 16:11:20 -0800,Firefox 95.0.1 seemingly crashing Mac (Big Sur 11.6) computer?,"<p>Writing this feels a little like having a time bomb open as I'm using the Firefox browser. Of course, I’m not *certain* it’s Firefox causing the crashes, but it seems like it.  </p><p>Using Firefox &gt; seemingly on click (no specific type of object that I’ve discerned) but once in a while just if I have the browser open in the background &gt; computer freezers &gt; fans whir at max for about a second &gt; computer crashes &amp; automatically restarts </p><p>This happened once before. I’m assuming by the version number that it might be due to a new update. Before, I put up with it for a couple days then it went away on its own. This was months ago but fewer than 6 months. My computer is in good condition (no falls or rough treatment, it’s a 2019, the hard drive isn’t anywhere near full, etc) so it really SHOULDN’T be something failing, but the sequence of events is so weird.  </p><p>Anyone else experiencing this on 95.0.1? Has anyone else experienced this before? Already tried a fresh install. Going to see if I can revert to 94.something to test my theory that it is Firefox… and save me from having to use some other browser. I have a text file of the crash output that gets sent to Apple but I do not see a good way to attach it here. </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-950;firefox-9501;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",spacekidariel
