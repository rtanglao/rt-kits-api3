Now, following a recent Firefox update, it doesn't load the list with thumbnails, instead it jumps to saying 'of 0 documents' and nothing else happens, just blank window where the list &amp; thumbnails should be. </p><p>I have rebooted my computer, checked to see if another programme was interfering somehow....nothing changed.
