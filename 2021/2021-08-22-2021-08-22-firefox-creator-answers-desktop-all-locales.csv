I downloaded an app to enable me to switch between bookmark sets, which immediately messed up my bookmarks.  My previous bookmarks are backed up both as html and as json, but importing the bookmarks has proved impossible, as all 3 Firefox installations freeze.  I should explain that my bookmarks set is very large.  Uninstalling and re-installing Firefox does not help, partly because Firefox only gives me the choice of importing bookmarks from other browsers such as Chrome, and not directly from backup. What to do? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1437337;1437339;,matthewmontagupollock

In fact these threads apply to me as Win 7 / 64 bit apply to me.  This started probably about 1.5 years ago.  </p><p>I too have this problem and yes, it is random.  BUT once locked in with this condition, it may ""get stuck"" for another 5 attempts for the same link.  BEST Example, I do surveys every Friday and Saturday night.  I use my netscape (AOL) email account.  At random, while clicking on the survey link the tab will come up blank and no matter what you do, you CANNOT get this tab to do ANYTHING.  No reload, no clicking on a new bookmark, no clicking on home, or typing in the address bar and pressing enter on THAT particular tab.  How often does it happen?  Maybe 12 times a month (during survey time: maybe every other weekend). </p><p>One step further on this.  My wife's account on the PC actually does this on a DAILY BASIS REPEATEDLY EVERY DAY when she opens FireFox.  In her case, it can ONLY be solved by closing and reopening FireFox after waiting like...say...2 minutes after previously opening it?  I have tried opening new tabs etc as mentioned above (including the old right clicky trick and using the ""Open in new tab"" function).  Kinda silly when you have like 27 tabs of blankness.   Considering it is her account on the Pc, ok, maybe the ""refresh"" function might work on her?  BZZZT!  Nope. </p><p>Current version.  I can attest that a PC at my 2 jobs that both have Win 7 and at least one, if not both, have 64 bit versions and do NOT display this malady.  Also, I did re-install FF about 2 years ago for some other problem. I just ran the troubleshooting more...no go.

I'm asking this question, because I would like to start cleaning up this mess of mine. It probably spans about 4 years worth of Bookmarks, so it would turn out to be useful (come in handy) to be able to regroup them as to keep things more tidy.  </p><p>I'm still a ""noob"" using this amazing extension, so thanks for the understanding in advance. I uploaded an image to help illustrate what I'm asking. </p><p>So as a brief description, I entered the word ""Screeps"" on Bookmark Search Plus 2 extension in order to perform an extensive search of all my ""Bookmark Folders"" and ""Bookmarks"" that are related to that specific search keyword. And now that I found them, I would like to dump them all in a newly created folder, namely, ""Screeps Master - 2021"". However, I can't seem to drag and drop them on to a new folder location. If this extension doesn't offer this capability, is there another extension that perhaps allows this? </p><p>Any tips or suggestions are more than welcome, who knows, perhaps there's an even better solution that I didn't even think of, but which I'm more than open and willing to try out. </p>",mac-os;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-910;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",christopherdoryan
