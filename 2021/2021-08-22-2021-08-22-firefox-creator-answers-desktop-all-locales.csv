But, before, it wasn't much of a problem - I'd just do a restore from a bookmarks bu file that had the bookmark that had been deleted. </p><p>But not this time. </p><p>Clicked on the day I wanted, and got the usual warning that it would replace all the existing bookmarks. But when it was run, it deleted all the bookmarks, but did not replace them with the ones from the bu file. </p><p>I then had _no_ bookmarks. There were none displayed, except for the star, something else I don't remember, and 'Other Bookmarks'. But clicking on these showed no content - they were empty. </p><p>At one point, and sometimes, a small window appeared saying 'Unable to process the backup file'. But this was after the current bookmarks had been deleted. </p><p>I'm on 91.01, 64bit. I found other, earlier 9x versions, dl'd and installed them. The attempt to restore bookmarks also failed running them </p><p>I then dl and installed a 89.x. But of course when I tried to run it, I got the warning about potential problems and the only choices to create a new profile or to exit. I chose to exit, and reinstalled the current version from a fresh dl. </p><p>After a few more attempts and system reboots, after the last reboot the current bookmarks reappeared, w.o. the deleted bookmark (as expected). I have no idea why. </p><p>Bottom line: I can no longer depend on FireFox. Fortunately, the deleted bookmark had relatively little content, so it can be recreated with 2 or 3 hours work. But what happens when a bookmark with lots of content gets deleted? I have bookmarks that have content going back at least 10 years. There is no way I could recreate them. Years of work would be lost. I don't understand why, if the backup file couldn't be processed, the operation wasn't aborted w.o. making any changes. This is what a failed process should do by default. </p><p>I find myself incredulous that the FireFox development team let such an egregious bug slip through.

Just a hobby, nothing serious. At a certain point I would like my App to get the URL of an already running Firefox window. I already can get the Window Title of the Firefox Window, but not the URL of the page currently being displayed in that window. I believe the way to do this would be to somehow connect to the process of the Firefox Window, and ask Firefox to provide the current URL. A thorough webserch led me to some old solutions using DDE, but these seem to be no longer supported and discouraged.

BUT once locked in with this condition, it may ""get stuck"" for another 5 attempts for the same link.  BEST Example, I do surveys every Friday and Saturday night.  I use my netscape (AOL) email account.  At random, while clicking on the survey link the tab will come up blank and no matter what you do, you CANNOT get this tab to do ANYTHING.  No reload, no clicking on a new bookmark, no clicking on home, or typing in the address bar and pressing enter on THAT particular tab.  How often does it happen?  Maybe 12 times a month (during survey time: maybe every other weekend). </p><p>One step further on this.  My wife's account on the PC actually does this on a DAILY BASIS REPEATEDLY EVERY DAY when she opens FireFox.  In her case, it can ONLY be solved by closing and reopening FireFox after waiting like...say...2 minutes after previously opening it?  I have tried opening new tabs etc as mentioned above (including the old right clicky trick and using the ""Open in new tab"" function).  Kinda silly when you have like 27 tabs of blankness.

If this extension doesn't offer this capability, is there another extension that perhaps allows this? </p><p>Any tips or suggestions are more than welcome, who knows, perhaps there's an even better solution that I didn't even think of, but which I'm more than open and willing to try out. </p>",mac-os;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-910;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",christopherdoryan
