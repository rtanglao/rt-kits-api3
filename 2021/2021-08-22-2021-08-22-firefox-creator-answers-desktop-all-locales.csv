The last time I did log into the account was Last month. Had no problem at all. This is a table top Dell Inspiron 3253, Win 10, firefox.  Running Win defender and firewall. I did try logging in with Edge, and could get on without a problem. On another computer, Asus X55a, laptop, Win 8.1, firefox, same DSL cable.  I can log in with no problem.   So must be something with firefox. I have it set to auto-download any updates.  I know there was one because it loaded when I turned on the computer a few days ago.  I have cleared the cookies and cache. I have the same setting in both computers.  I did run a DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth, to see if anything was wrong. Nothing.  I'm not very good with the technical part of computers and language. So many suggestions I've found are way over my head. Pleas help me. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",digorok
