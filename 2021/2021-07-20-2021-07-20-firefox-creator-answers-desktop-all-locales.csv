For searching with search engine I always use an advanced search providing options (never the address bar search engine suggestion of FF). Thus the engine suggestion, located on the 1st line of the drop-down list of suggestions, is just annoying due to its uselessness and its location before my helpful bookmarks and browsing history. </p><p><em>It's just a detail but the clearer the visual information are (without any interference, noise), the faster the right choice is made.</em> </p><p>I tuned FF configuration as neatly as possible about this topic but the phenomenon persists. Privacy &amp; security -&gt; Address bar: 'Search engines' is unchecked. Search -&gt; Search bar: 'Search bar in tool bar' is preferred to avoid it to operate in the type field (no option for no search at all). </p><pre>           -&gt; 'Provide search suggestions' is unchecked.            -&gt; 'Search Shortcuts' are unchecked for search engines. </pre> <p>Please see screen shots attached. </p><p>Could FF experts provide any help ?

If an application is set to be the default file handler for a certain type of file, Firefox will allow you to open such a download directly in the application. To do this, it saves the file in a temporary location, and then hands over to the application. The problem is that the location firefox uses under Linux is /tmp and modern snap and flatpak desktop apps are not allowed to see /tmp. </p><p>For instance, a .deb file is an installable software package. Ubuntu naturally uses the Software app to handle .deb files. But Software is a sandboxed snap app, and it won't open files in /tmp  </p><p>The workaround of saving files and opening them from the app works, but it defeats the purpose of having registered file handlers.  </p><p>And I do not know how to get firefox to save temporary download files somewhere else. I can't find any relevant configuration option. </p><p>I tried editing the firefox launcher: </p><p>env TMPDIR=/home/tim/tmp_firefox firefox </p><p>but it still uses /tmp </p>",linux;desktop;beta;other;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,"",timrichardson
