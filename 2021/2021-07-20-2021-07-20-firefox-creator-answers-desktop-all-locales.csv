Not just YouTube but any site that uses a video. It's very annoying. I've tried disabling ad blocking, various features in Firefox, my AV, plugins, and anything else I can find to no avail. Using the Developer tools doesn't see anything where the white bar is. It's driving me nuts! What would be causing this white bar and how do I remove it? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,other,en-US,"",raymor

Works fine in Chrome. Somehow after loading in Chrome the links worked, however going to another page the links became unresponsive again. Want to stay with Firefox but am nearly about to dump and return to Chrome. have had other issues with Firefox not rendering buttons for continuing form completion on other sites, and then transfer to Chrome and all is good, with no change or additional information needing to be provided (just in case the page was asking for info but Firefox didn't recognise need). Very frustrating. Have attached screen shots of buttons eBay page in Chrome &amp; Firefox. </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;firefox-900;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",abes1

If an application is set to be the default file handler for a certain type of file, Firefox will allow you to open such a download directly in the application. To do this, it saves the file in a temporary location, and then hands over to the application. The problem is that the location firefox uses under Linux is /tmp and modern snap and flatpak desktop apps are not allowed to see /tmp. </p><p>For instance, a .deb file is an installable software package. Ubuntu naturally uses the Software app to handle .deb files. But Software is a sandboxed snap app, and it won't open files in /tmp  </p><p>The workaround of saving files and opening them from the app works, but it defeats the purpose of having registered file handlers.  </p><p>And I do not know how to get firefox to save temporary download files somewhere else. I can't find any relevant configuration option. </p><p>I tried editing the firefox launcher: </p><p>env TMPDIR=/home/tim/tmp_firefox firefox </p><p>but it still uses /tmp </p>",linux;desktop;beta;other;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,"",timrichardson
