The preview and all information on the printer seem fine.  If I try to print the same document from Chrome, it works fine.  When I tried about:config and typed in paper_data I get a new box open with three options: boolean, number or string.  I never get anything beyond that.  No list of paper sizes.  Nothing. Any help would be most appreciated.  Thank you! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-940;firefox-9401;,firefox,other,en-US,"",sbarnes1915
