When I try to open any PDF file, I have to Browse to find my pdf viewer (Flexipdf 2022). I do that and also check your ""Do this automatically"" option. Every time I try to open a pdf after that I still have to go through all the same Browse steps. I also set up Flexipdf 2022 in the Applications section of General Settings (Portable Document Format (PDF) (application/pdf)) and it is just deleted or never saved.  The next time I look or try to use it, itâ€™s gone.  This is obviously a bug in your system, please correct. Thank You. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ddavissci

I've been a happy FF user for many years but, ever since I updated to Firefox 93, I've been facing an odd problem. </p><p>When I start FF (usually using my system launcher or the command line), the first window that opens will not allow me to open a new tab.  Press the '+' button does nothing; trying to open links in a new tab does nothing; etc.  Not only this, but it seems like there are other problems (e.g. my adblocker does not seem to be working in YouTube), but I can't confirm this.  </p><p>When I open a new window from the menu, all functions work normally in the new window.  But the original window continues to have these problems.  </p><p>This isn't a major inconvenience, but it just seems like an odd bug. </p><p>One factor that might have something to do with this - I run FF inside <a href=""https://firejail.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Firejail</a>. I start FF via a one line script: </p><p>`firejail /opt/firefox/firefox` </p><p>Maybe this has something to do with it? </p><p>Thanks so much to Mozilla for this wonderful piece of software, and to all of you for helping out with it! </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-940;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",shankargopal2008

It had a much better balance of colors and was more pleasing to the eye! The present default grey/white theme is terrible -- no contrast between tabs etc. There are thousands of Firefox themes to choose from, many are very fancy and some very dark (including the photon theme). Who has the  time to go through and try them all or to build a new theme. The Firefox group had the perfect theme already built! </p><p>Is it so difficult to place the original simple Firefox theme as a selection in the theme library labelled ""Original"" and make the theme library searchable by name? At the very least it should have been left as an option in the themes category! </p><p>In future, updates should give the option of keeping the present default theme.  </p><p>Very frustrating not to be given the option of the original theme!!

The preview and all information on the printer seem fine.  If I try to print the same document from Chrome, it works fine.  When I tried about:config and typed in paper_data I get a new box open with three options: boolean, number or string.  I never get anything beyond that.  No list of paper sizes.  Nothing. Any help would be most appreciated.  Thank you! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-940;firefox-9401;,firefox,other,en-US,"",sbarnes1915
