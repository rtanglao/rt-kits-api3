It had a much better balance of colors and was more pleasing to the eye! The present default grey/white theme is terrible -- no contrast between tabs etc. There are thousands of Firefox themes to choose from, many are very fancy and some very dark (including the photon theme). Who has the  time to go through and try them all or to build a new theme. The Firefox group had the perfect theme already built! </p><p>Is it so difficult to place the original simple Firefox theme as a selection in the theme library labelled ""Original"" and make the theme library searchable by name? At the very least it should have been left as an option in the themes category! </p><p>In future, updates should give the option of keeping the present default theme.  </p><p>Very frustrating not to be given the option of the original theme!!

The preview and all information on the printer seem fine.  If I try to print the same document from Chrome, it works fine.  When I tried about:config and typed in paper_data I get a new box open with three options: boolean, number or string.  I never get anything beyond that.  No list of paper sizes.  Nothing. Any help would be most appreciated.  Thank you! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-940;firefox-9401;,firefox,other,en-US,"",sbarnes1915
