The ""X"" on the current tab is too large (pic).  When there are multiple tabs open it occupies a third of the tab width. </p><p>And lastly, I'd like it as I had it before where during a hover of any tab the ""X"" would show if I wanted to close a particular tab besides the current tab. </p><p>I've found and used and was thankful for the css files I found in the past. They seemed to fix the issue without TOO much hassle. I've been messing with this firefox-nonsense for several days. </p><p>I don't understand the css code to modify things. What I do make changes to doesn't seem to do anything, or it gives unexpected results that don't seem to make sense (to me). </p><p>I'll share the code I'm using. I found it form a post in here somewhere. </p><p>Thanks to anyone that can help. I'd sure appreciate it.

I'm on a Mac (OS 11 Big Sur) and am using the OpenSC PKCS#11 module which I added to Firefox manually. </p><p>Up until recently, this worked in Firefox: When I visited the login page, I was prompted to select a certificate to use for the login. I chose the one from my SmartCard, and the login worked. </p><p>However, after Upgrading to Firefox 94, this stopped working. Now there is no longer a prompt when I visit the login page, so I cannot select a certificate. The login then always fails. </p><p>I checked the ""cryptography devices"" settings (the OpenSC PKCS#11 module is loaded and working, I can activate the SmartCard) and ""certificates"" settings (deleted saved authentication decisions &amp; cached certificates etc). On the macOS level, I cannot see the SmartCard in the keychain app (I never could, even when it was still working), but using the Terminal command ""pcsctest"" I can confirm that the SmartCard is recognized and working. I tried completely reinstalling OpenSC and Firefox, but to now avail. No other components were changed when it stopped working (no updates of macOS/OpenSC, all certificates are still valid, network hasn't changed). The only thing that works, is going back to Firefox 93 where the login works as usual. </p><p>So I'm pretty sure that this is a Bug introduced in the upgrade from 93 to 94. </p><p>Has anyone else experienced something similar, or does anyone have any suggestions regarding this issue? That would be much appreciated. </p><p>Best Regards </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-940;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jeremias.lubberger
