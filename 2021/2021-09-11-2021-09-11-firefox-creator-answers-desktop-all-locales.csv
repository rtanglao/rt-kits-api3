Several months ago Firefox crashed while it was in use - void of any update process. Upon reopening, the main window would launch and before any tabs could load it would crash again.  I attempted to open in troubleshoot mode with the identical result. I gave it a break and used Chrome but in returning to this issue today the same has occurred. This time after the troubleshoot mode crash, I uninstalled Firefox and re-installed fresh (this was an upgrade from v89 to v92). Upon opening post update the browser crashed again.  Each time this happens I have received a crash report screen which I accepted and it was reported as successfully submitted. However, when I open the crash report folder only two appear to have been saved - one old from the first occurrence (6/2021) and one from today(8/10/21). Both of these are linked below for review.  </p><p>This is on an older Windows 7 machine that honestly I know should be updated but this is only used for light gaming and web surfing and I am not interested in an OS upgrade as I disagree with with the business practices of Microsoft - I find their policies are rather intrusive as a consumer.    </p><p>I hope I've given enough information about the issue here and my system, thanks in advance for any help! </p><p>-J </p><p>System Info Intel I7 4770K 16gb RAM Geforce GT1060 Gigabyte Z97 Motherboard </p><p>Early instance of crash report in June 2021: Crash ID: bp-1fce2514-da15-4ff1-9e4c-7d0510210622 Most recent crash report from earlier today (8/10/21): Crash ID: bp-e888ef81-491c-42ae-9878-124970210810 </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;escalate;bug_1;wontstart;startup-issue;firefox-9002;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1442474;1442477;,jalbyx
