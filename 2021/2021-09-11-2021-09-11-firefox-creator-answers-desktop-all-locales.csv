In addition, the favicon associated with any links within the Bookmarks tab does not populate either during this lengthy delay.  To sum up, there is substantial delay in being able to access one’s bookmarked links or folders with this latest version of 92.0.  I would ask the Mozilla team to fix this matter as soon as possible.  It’s very annoying.

Each time this happens I have received a crash report screen which I accepted and it was reported as successfully submitted.
