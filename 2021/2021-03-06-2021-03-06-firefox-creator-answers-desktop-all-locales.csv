What do you want to do?' It then gives the option of clicking on a tab to either 'stop this' or something else which I no longer recall. This message doesn't stay there long and on the times where I have managed to click on the tab 'stop this' it has no effect whatsoever. I looked up this problem by typing something about it into a google search space and came across information which says that it is an apparently known problem with Firefox. I cannot account for the testament of this answer though. I don't know who wrote it. Is this true? Is there anything I, or you, can do about this problem regardless of whether or not this is true? When this happens my computer sounds like it is about to launch itself into space and there is a distinct and lengthy lag between entering information and the website responding. It can take over a minute to move from one action to the next. eg. scrolling the page up to view the next items on the page. I really would be forever grateful if you could identify the problem and come up with a solution for this. Thank you for giving this your attention.

Several times a day when I return to the browser, it will have become completely unresponsive to clicks and or typing. In this state, I can't click on web pages, or controls in the tab bar. However, the app is not beach-balling. I can quit by right clicking on the dock icon and choosing quit from the menu (I don't have to force quit). Relaunching fixes things. Also, if I have, for example, clicked on the ""new tab"" button in the tab bar, once I've quit and launched again, the new tab will be in the window, indicating that the command was processed, but the result was not visible. Sometimes, but not always, when in this state the page display looks like it has been scaled to about 50%. (As if I'd hit ""Zoom out"" five times). One clue that may relate to this is, I'm running in scaled mode on the monitor (The monitor is capable of 3840x2160, but I'm scaling things in the Display control panel to 2560x1440.) Apps are running in Retina mode.  I have tried running Firefox in Safe mode, but that didn't help. I have a lot of tabs that I don't want to lose, so running in a fresh user profile is kind of difficult, unless there's a simple way to transfer open tabs between profiles. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-860;,firefox,other,en-US,"",glenn_hughes
