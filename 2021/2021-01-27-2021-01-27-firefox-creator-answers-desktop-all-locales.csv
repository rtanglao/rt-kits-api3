I set up keyboard shortcuts for moving windows between my macbook display and an external monitor using the in-built keyboard options to add shortcuts.  </p><p>These target the Window&gt;Move to [DISPLAY NAME] menu entries at the top of the screen. For some reason Firefox windows don't have this menu entry and therefore my shortcuts don't move Firefox windows between my screens. </p><p>I've included a couple screenshots to demonstrate. It's not a huge deal but I wonder if it's an issue with my machine or just a quirk of Firefox? </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",totzo
