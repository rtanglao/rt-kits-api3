But for some reason, when I hold Ctrl and press the back button on my mouse, it doesn't do the same. This is quite annoying, as sometimes I need to navigate back, but keep the current page open as well, and this forces me to move my mouse cursor all the way to the top left and back again </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1405591;,jurifurer

I have noticed that FireFox browser shows (very briefly) webpage sites being accessed from within websites that I do visit. I noticed a number of Google Services flashing through the list of site connections. Is FireFox BYPASSING my Firewall settings and allowing Google connections? And If so, are there browsers that do NOT use chromium-based code, that honor my firewall settings? Should I just write my own browser code so I can validate that Google is NOT violating my privacy and committing espionage for the Chinese Military? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1405583;,virg.unger
