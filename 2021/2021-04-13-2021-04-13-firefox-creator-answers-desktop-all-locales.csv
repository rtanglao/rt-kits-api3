I got a message  ""We can't automatically get your browser's troubleshooting data, please try these manual steps. "" Without thinking, I clicked the link to the ""manual steps."" Unfortunately, instead of opening a new tab, which would be the expected behavior, clicking the link took me off the get help form page (the page I'm on as I write this). What's worse, when I used the back button to return to the previous page, everything I'd written was gone. Obviously, the expected behavior would be to not take the user off the page in the first place, but if for some reason it did, to autosave the writing so it can be restored when the user returns. </p><p>This kind of bug used to be a lot more common in the early days, when I first started using the web, 25 years ago. I used to have a boilerplate describing the problem because I was sending reports of the bug so frequently. I've only encountered it twice, to my recollection, in the last 5 years. Firefox's website would have been one of the last places I'd ever expect to find a bug this glaring and elementary. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;escalate;bug_1;firefox-870;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",morelli1

I have noticed that FireFox browser shows (very briefly) webpage sites being accessed from within websites that I do visit. I noticed a number of Google Services flashing through the list of site connections. Is FireFox BYPASSING my Firewall settings and allowing Google connections? And If so, are there browsers that do NOT use chromium-based code, that honor my firewall settings? Should I just write my own browser code so I can validate that Google is NOT violating my privacy and committing espionage for the Chinese Military? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1405583;,virg.unger
