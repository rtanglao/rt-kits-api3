So obviously this is a known problem with FF, and hopefully with Mozilla.  </p><p>With me it happens on Facebook. Clicking ""wait"" basically does nothing, clicking ""stop it"" it basically stops the page from loading, so you can't post a message or have any interaction with the site whatsoever.  </p><p>All along I'm watching the CPU at a constant 50%-60%, and memory <strong>for one tab of FB</strong> going up steadily from 400 MB to 1.2 GB (almost like a memory leak).  </p><p>Now, my laptop has really limited specs, 3 GB RAM, Win 7, 10 years old. So I thought the laptop is probably to blame. Till I did the following experiment: Let's try Edge, with the exact same tabs, exact same sites.  </p><p>So, one tab of the same FB page + one tab of Yahoo Mail -&gt;  FF: 60% of CPU, 1.5 GB of memory (and counting). Edge: 10%-15% of CPU, 500-600 MB of memory, and FB smooth as silk.  </p><p>Any suggestions/solutions are welcome. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-600;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",elzach

I can click the top of the column to sort and I can add other columns (tags, visit count etc.), I just can't adjust the size. </p><p>Has anyone else encountered this problem and found a solution? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",tsubasa9455
