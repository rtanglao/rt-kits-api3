My provider, Bell Canada, has an option via their website for me to view anything from live Bell TV or even my PVR on any device with a browser (in my case latest Firefox on win10). The problem is it is taking up most of my ram, and as I'm sure many will attest to, when Win10 has less than a couple of GB of ram, it just grinds to a halt (30-40 seconds to open a tiny 10kB spreadsheet, etc.). </p><p>I did a memory measurement from the about: thing. Perhaps one of you wizards can tell me if it's a firefox issue or a problem with the Bell website/scripts/whatever? I just cannot believe that it takes 8 GB to watch a video stream. That's more than an entire DVD movie - with all the alternate-language soundtracks and special features! </p><p>10,369.05 MB (100.0%) -- explicit ├───8,475.00 MB (81.73%) -- window-objects │   ├──8,473.59 MB (81.72%) -- top(<a href=""https://tv.bell.ca/watch/recording-"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tv.bell.ca/watch/recording-</a> (deleted info) │   │  ├──8,257.39 MB (79.63%) -- active │   │  │  ├──8,254.29 MB (79.61%) -- window(<a href=""https://tv.bell.ca/watch/recording"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tv.bell.ca/watch/recording</a> (deleted info) │   │  │  │  ├──7,967.99 MB (76.84%) -- js-realm(<a href=""https://tv.bell.ca/guide"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tv.bell.ca/guide</a>) │   │  │  │  │  ├──7,932.14 MB (76.50%) -- classes │   │  │  │  │  │  ├──6,769.33 MB (65.28%) -- class(ArrayBuffer)/objects │   │  │  │  │  │  │  ├──6,767.27 MB (65.26%) ── malloc-heap/elements/normal │   │  │  │  │  │  │  └──────2.05 MB (00.02%) ── gc-heap </p><pre>  (deleted info, small memory elements) </pre> <p>├───1,703.55 MB (16.43%) ── heap-unclassified </p><p>Ouch.
