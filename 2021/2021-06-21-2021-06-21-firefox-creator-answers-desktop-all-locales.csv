How can I make operative a non working older Firefox installation so I do not loose any logins and bookmarks? 2.If that is not possible, how can I find out what is the older profile? I checked and I have three, all with the date of the new installation, no the older one, I do not know how to find the older one  OS: W10, laptop installed.  Some weeks ago, Firefox did not load anymore (nor Thunderbird and all the laptop windows were constantly freezing) it did not open at all. It has Bitdefender installed, did not find any infection but I am suspicious it might have some.  Anyway, I cannot give you the release number because it is not accessible. I downloaded a new update and installation and installed it. Now I have two icons, but the new installation did not update the previous one and did not transfer logings, bookmarks and the like.  The non working Firefox is installed on ""C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"" The current working one is a 89.0.1 (64-bit) installed on ""C:\Users\ username\AppData\Local\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe </p><p>Thank you very  much, Mer </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1422947;1422950;1422951;,merli

I've had no luck in undoing anything that was blocked, as mentioned in another thread. I'm trying to figure out if resetting Firefox would be a good idea. My problem is that one of my extensions is directly tied to my antivirus program, so my question is basically this; would the extension be able to be turned back on as is, or would I have to reinstall the antivirus program to get it back? I've never seen it come up in a basic search for add-ons without it. So it sounds like I'd have to reinstall it. Can anyone confirm this? If so, I'll have to wait a day or two to get this reset done.  </p><p>Alternatively, I'm debating just deleting the current cookies and the like from the browser. Would this be a better alternative to a full on refresh/reset of Firefox? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,1422910;1422924;1422993;1423058;1423059;1423060;1423061;1423062;1423083;,Marc7

I started katalon with the recorder and also tried selenium IDE for FF - the locator was located, the login button itself is highlighted, but not clicked.  After that, I already started looking at what was happening in the called browser. It seems that the browser is launched with JS turned off - no any pop-ups are opened. No errors or JS messages are dropped into the console. I go into the settings of the called browser - there is no need to disable the JS checkbox. The elements for the HeaderButton do not have an event, but when the browser is normally launched, the event is labeled on the HeaderButton element. Use geskodriver v.0.29.1 Please help me understand what is wrong in the FF browser caused by autotests? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,"",proxorova1992

My provider, Bell Canada, has an option via their website for me to view anything from live Bell TV or even my PVR on any device with a browser (in my case latest Firefox on win10). The problem is it is taking up most of my ram, and as I'm sure many will attest to, when Win10 has less than a couple of GB of ram, it just grinds to a halt (30-40 seconds to open a tiny 10kB spreadsheet, etc.). </p><p>I did a memory measurement from the about: thing.
