I use python, selenium. </p><p>The case is simple - you need to open the page and click on the button for a pop-up with fields for registration to appear. Here's the whole test function: def auth_user(self): </p><pre>   wd = self.wd    wd.delete_all_cookies()    try:        close_town_pop_up = wd.find_element_by_css_selector('#app &gt; div.overlay-wrapper &gt; div &gt; button').click()  #закрываем поп-ап с городами    except ex.NoSuchElementException:        pass    time.sleep(1) </pre> <pre>   try:        auth_button = wd.find_element_by_css_selector('.SideToolbarContainer &gt; div:nth-child(1) &gt; div:nth-child(1) &gt; div:nth-child(1) &gt; div:nth-child(1)').click()   #нажимаем на кнопку входа </pre> <pre>   except ex.ElementNotInteractableException or ex.NoSuchElementException:         auth_button = wd.find_element_by_css_selector('#app &gt; div.body__header &gt; header &gt; div &gt; div.LowerPanelsContainer &gt; '                                                      'div &gt; div.LowerPanelItem.LowerPanelItem--login &gt; div &gt; div &gt; a &gt; span.HeaderButtonIcon &gt; svg').click()  #нажимаем на кнопку входа при адаптивной вёрстке </pre> <pre>   time.sleep(2)    input_phone = wd.find_element_by_css_selector('input#authorizer-input-username') #ищем элемент, чтобы кликнуть    input_phone.send_keys('***********')   #передаём номер телефона в поле    input_password = wd.find_element_by_css_selector('input#authorizer-input-password') #ищем элемент, чтобы кликнуть    input_password.send_keys('****') #передаём пароль в поле    time.sleep(2)    press_auth_button = wd.find_element_by_class_name('AuthorizerForm__submit').click() # нажимаем на кнопку авторизации    time.sleep(9) </pre> <p><br> When I run the test in chrome, opera - the test passes, the user is authorized. </p><p>When executing the test in FF (version 89.0.1 (64-bit)) - problem with the login button (auth_button). At first I thought I needed some kind of delay - added webdriverwait. After it didn't work - thought the button locator was not located. I started katalon with the recorder and also tried selenium IDE for FF - the locator was located, the login button itself is highlighted, but not clicked.  After that, I already started looking at what was happening in the called browser. It seems that the browser is launched with JS turned off - no any pop-ups are opened. No errors or JS messages are dropped into the console. I go into the settings of the called browser - there is no need to disable the JS checkbox. The elements for the HeaderButton do not have an event, but when the browser is normally launched, the event is labeled on the HeaderButton element. Use geskodriver v.0.29.1 Please help me understand what is wrong in the FF browser caused by autotests? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,"",proxorova1992

My provider, Bell Canada, has an option via their website for me to view anything from live Bell TV or even my PVR on any device with a browser (in my case latest Firefox on win10). The problem is it is taking up most of my ram, and as I'm sure many will attest to, when Win10 has less than a couple of GB of ram, it just grinds to a halt (30-40 seconds to open a tiny 10kB spreadsheet, etc.). </p><p>I did a memory measurement from the about: thing. Perhaps one of you wizards can tell me if it's a firefox issue or a problem with the Bell website/scripts/whatever? I just cannot believe that it takes 8 GB to watch a video stream. That's more than an entire DVD movie - with all the alternate-language soundtracks and special features! </p><p>10,369.05 MB (100.0%) -- explicit ├───8,475.00 MB (81.73%) -- window-objects │   ├──8,473.59 MB (81.72%) -- top(<a href=""https://tv.bell.ca/watch/recording-"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tv.bell.ca/watch/recording-</a> (deleted info) │   │  ├──8,257.39 MB (79.63%) -- active │   │  │  ├──8,254.29 MB (79.61%) -- window(<a href=""https://tv.bell.ca/watch/recording"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tv.bell.ca/watch/recording</a> (deleted info) │   │  │  │  ├──7,967.99 MB (76.84%) -- js-realm(<a href=""https://tv.bell.ca/guide"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tv.bell.ca/guide</a>) │   │  │  │  │  ├──7,932.14 MB (76.50%) -- classes │   │  │  │  │  │  ├──6,769.33 MB (65.28%) -- class(ArrayBuffer)/objects │   │  │  │  │  │  │  ├──6,767.27 MB (65.26%) ── malloc-heap/elements/normal │   │  │  │  │  │  │  └──────2.05 MB (00.02%) ── gc-heap </p><pre>  (deleted info, small memory elements) </pre> <p>├───1,703.55 MB (16.43%) ── heap-unclassified </p><p>Ouch.
