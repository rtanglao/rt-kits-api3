As soon as I try it, a pop-up window titled ""Manage Your Privacy"" asks me to ""Accept All"", ""Reject All"" or ""Manage Settings"". (See attachment.) When I click ""Accept All"", nothing happens. When I click ""Manage Settings"", the pop-up window just turns grey and I can't do anything but close the tab and start over. Clicking ""Reject All"" only produces a warning, but does not close the pop-up either. I have cleared the browser cache and the cookies. I am using the latest version of Firefox. Any suggestions how this problem might be resolved are welcome. I can still access the homepage using other browsers, but I would prefer to do it with Firefox... </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-900;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",lukoch

I tried downloading a website, a public youtube playlist in fact, using the right click - ""save page as"" command, but when I then click the downloaded page, it loads in firefox for a moment, then switches to a different (private) playlist on youtube.  What? It's offline, right? And it aborts loading the saved website and instead loads another site? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",marc.baum

It will load the outline of a image, but not load the actual image thumbnail at times until anywhere between 5 seconds to upwards to 20-30 seconds before they pop in. Other times I'll notice it seems like they just don't want to load regardless and I'll even try right clicking on a invisible thumbnail image and clicking ""Reload image"" for it not to work, sometimes it does. </p><pre>I have tried nearly everything that I could think of to fix this, I don't know if it's a recent issue with windows 10 maybe? I don't think it's our internet causing the issue since everything else seems to load and stream just fine, these websites work just fine on other devices within our home and I swear it was working just fine on my computer a little over 2-3 weeks ago. </pre> <p>Below is a list of fixes I've tried to rule out. </p><p>Clear cookies/cache data, run firefox in safe mode, dev mode, etc. </p><p>Completely delete firefox and any old folders, reinstall 100% fresh without any previous data or addons/extensions. Still didn't fix it. </p><p>I've tried turning off many of the settings for firefox like hardware accel, smooth scrolling, etc. Nothing. </p><p>I then tried doing stuff outside of firefox to see if anything else would work. I have made sure my graphics driver is fully updated and that didn't do anything. </p><p>I've tried to see if the thumbnail images were doing the same thing in other browers like chrome and I thought at first that chrome was handling these websites just fine, but after testing it a bit. I noticed the same thing was happening with chrome too. </p><p>Since it's also affecting chrome I know it's pretty pointless to post and ask what I should do or what could be the problem here. But I don't know where else to turn and just checking if anyone has had this problem before. </p><p>The attached image is a example for one of the websites I'm having this issue with, but like I said. It's loading these websites just fine on other devices from the looks of it. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",chaos01123
