I couldn't figure out why, but I happened to run my mouse over an invisible add on. It was unlabeled as well so I have no idea what is was. I deleted it and reported it but after closing firefox it did the same thing upon repopening it. Now the address bar is red and I don't understand why, how do I make it go back to normal. Also I have refreshed firefox a couple times but after each refresh it is the same thing. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jason.t.langdale
