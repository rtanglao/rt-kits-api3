Any prior issues were minor and easy to deal with.  Two months ago, I downloaded the Avast VPN application, which I was happy with. (hang with me here, please.)  But, a week ago, I started seeing this internet connection message, ""unidentified network internet access"" along with my internet connection notation.  When I turn off the VPN all is well for while.  I can open Firefox, even get into my AOL mail.  But beyond that when I try to clink on a link or bookmark or type in a URL on Firefox, it never opens.  Just sits there.  I have tried every suggestion on mozilla help pages and Avast (that I understand) and still no fix.  Wit's end here.   </p><p>I also have the Edge browser and this does not happen with Edge; all work.  So I'm thinking the issue has to be with Firefox.  I'm thinking I should just delete Firefox browser from laptop and then load it back on my laptop.  I'm not a techie and am not comfortable with that.  Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  I don't want to quit Firefox.  Thanks. </p>",desktop;websites;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",kptpcin

Safari doesn't show the tab bar unless multiple tabs are being used.  This leaves more space to show webpages.  I'd like to hide the tab bar permanently or when only one page/tab is used.  I guess that means the red, yellow and green mac circles in the upper left would have to be moved to the lower bar, by shifting the back and forward arrows slightly to the right, as is done on Safari.   </p><p>I looked online for suggestions.  chrome.css files were mentioned. But they didn't explain what those were or how to create/access them.  So the guidance was not helpful to those who didn't understand those files, like me.   </p><p>Can you please let me know how to hide the tab bar? </p><p>Based on all the comments I saw on threads, it seems many others think the tab bar wastes space.  It would be great if Firefox preferences provided an easy option for hiding the tab bar.   </p><p>Thanks, Frank </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,1428398;,fd87

Two days ago, Firefox stopped loading some (but not all) pages. It tries for a long time, then an error is given ""The connection was reset. The connection to the server was reset while the page was loading."" I have refreshed Firefox (tried multiple times). I have run in troubleshoot mode (tried multiple times). I have disabled all of the extensions I was using. I resorted to uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox (have done this twice now). Still, some websites are not loading. Examples include <a href=""http://weebly.com"" rel=""nofollow"">weebly.com</a>, <a href=""http://pandora.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pandora.com</a>, <a href=""http://dictionary.com"" rel=""nofollow"">dictionary.com</a>, and other websites that I have built with weebly.
