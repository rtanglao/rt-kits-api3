Two days ago, Firefox stopped loading some (but not all) pages. It tries for a long time, then an error is given ""The connection was reset. The connection to the server was reset while the page was loading."" I have refreshed Firefox (tried multiple times). I have run in troubleshoot mode (tried multiple times). I have disabled all of the extensions I was using. I resorted to uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox (have done this twice now). Still, some websites are not loading. Examples include <a href=""http://weebly.com"" rel=""nofollow"">weebly.com</a>, <a href=""http://pandora.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pandora.com</a>, <a href=""http://dictionary.com"" rel=""nofollow"">dictionary.com</a>, and other websites that I have built with weebly. These websites load fine if I use Chrome. I am using Firefox 90.0 (64-bit) and Windows 10 Home that is completely up-to-date. </p><p>Does anyone have an idea of what happened?
