I've just now upgraded to latest version (v. 89.0b3 64 bit). </p><p>Everything is fine except the tab title of the current tab. The color is right but the shape is wrong. It should be rectangular but instead all four corners are rounded. Moreover, it's not connected to the rest of the page so there is a gap between the background color of the current tab (grey) and the background color of the page (black) making the whole thing look like it's floating around the browser space (see attached screenshot).  </p><p>I've also noted that the top bar, the ones containing the title tabs and the main icons (close, enlarge, minimize) has become huge! </p><p>So my questions are:  </p><p>-  Is there a way to have rectangular tab titles again? If not possible through options, is there an add-on I can use? I search the add-ons page but the themes I found are for changing colors, they do nothing for the shape of the tabs.  - How can I shrink the top bar? </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;beta;tabs;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",digirolamolucia

I understand that people unfamiliar with today's technology may not know about the uses of the Ctrl button, but adding this new option shouldn't come at the sacrifice of the old better option. I wouldn't consider myself a ""power user"" or anything like that, but through the years of sometimes large updates, I was proactive enough to customize my toolbar to something more comfortable for me and I think, once I got used to them, the de-cluttering that came with the new updates was mostly better than the previous version. But the problem here is that I can't seem to figure out how to get the better functionality back. I know an add-on exists to put a 'View Image' button back onto the menu, but I want the option to be at the top of the menu because it is just about the only option I ever use with images and also the add-on 'View Image' seems to take just a bit longer to load. I don't seem to have the option to easily re-arrange the menu to remove the redundant 'Open Image in New Tab' and move 'View Image' to the top. Why keep clutter like 'Email Image...' and 'Set Image as Desktop Background' while removing genuinely useful features? I've used this browser since childhood. The developers literally did not need to change a thing besides keeping up with security updates and I would have been very happy. Every interface-changing update prior to this one has been frustrating and nothing I ever asked for, but I ultimately adapted. It's like I'm living a quiet life in a house in a neighborhood where the homeowners association is constantly invading your home to adapt it to what they think new homeowners want. You're able to easily change the layout mostly back to what it was before and, on some introspection, some of those changes were actually good for the flow of your home. One day, they install a ramp in your home where the stairs to your basement used to be. Sounds great, now people have easier access your basement. But wait, the ramp doesn't even lead to your basement, it instead leads to some kind of wine cellar and you don't even drink. You can reinstall the stairs to your basement- no problem- except now you have to squeeze past the junk in the hallway to get to the new stairs and you might trip and accidentally stumble your way down the ramp and into the strange basement anyway. I'm sure this analogy falls apart in some ways, but I hope you get the picture. Also, does anybody who works at Mozilla even look at user feedback? I'm skeptical about this volunteer help system. It just feels like it's just in place so Mozilla can say it listens while it's just giving more experienced users ""hall monitor"" status so they can tell less knowledgeable users ""Here's a half-measured solution to the problem the developers added in the most recent update. Problem solved!"" I don't mean to talk down to the volunteers, but every time I've desperately searched for a way to get things sorted back out after a big update tears through my careful browser organization like a tornado through a trailer park, I've rarely found any advice that made things significantly better. As I've said, I've been using Firefox since childhood. It just really sucks to see it regress to the point where essential features are removed and I'm really considering my options with different browsers. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,1408544;,mnchrisrm
