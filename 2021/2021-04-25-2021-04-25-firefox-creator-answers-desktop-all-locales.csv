Every time it crashes I need to reset my proxy settings to have internet connection. Safari and chrome has no issues. Problem started when I upgraded my macbook from High sierra to Catalina. I'm running version 87 64bit, I tried downgrading to 82 and worked my way up in different version. Problem persisted, the I tried running Firefox on safe mode and clearing Cache. Problem still persist, I do not know what else to do. Someone please help. I'm running Catalina 10.15.7, I attached a screenshot of my crash reports for some insight. </p><p>I appreciate anything anyone can do. </p><p>Rudy </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",staind9491

If I restart my laptop, all my dock apps work as they are supposed to. I can click on any of them and they will open up. If open Firefox, the first 6 dock apps freeze up. I cannot open them from the dock or even drag them off the dock. All other dock apps operate fine from the 7th one on to the right. This is all new as I have used Firefox as my main browser for years. i can use Safari and everything works properly. I prefer Firefox. </p><p>Any suggestions or ideas are appreciated.

I have found i can export/import through Firefox but one problem: i need go to about:config and add something for import or export. What are programmers doing??

I am stuck in the middle of the download process.  I got to the point of changing apps or using the defaults and I'm very nervous that i have caused an issue.  I changed the ones I new I wanted to, but there was nowhere to click done, submit, etc.  I really need an agent that can come on remotely and see what I have done.  I attempted to reach Norton, but I couldn't get through to their AI contact person.  I need help immediately. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",cheri.adcock
