If I restart my laptop, all my dock apps work as they are supposed to. I can click on any of them and they will open up. If open Firefox, the first 6 dock apps freeze up. I cannot open them from the dock or even drag them off the dock. All other dock apps operate fine from the 7th one on to the right. This is all new as I have used Firefox as my main browser for years. i can use Safari and everything works properly. I prefer Firefox. </p><p>Any suggestions or ideas are appreciated.
