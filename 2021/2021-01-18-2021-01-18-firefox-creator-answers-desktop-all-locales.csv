I copied prefs.js and removed all items beginning with <strong>print</strong> and replaced existing <strong>prefs</strong> file.  Curiously that change worked at least twice before trying <strong>PDF print preview</strong>.  After trying the preview the print function went back to taking 30 to 60 seconds to respond. </p><p>Print and print preview work fine in Chrome and Safari. </p><p>I have a macbook air and a new macbook pro.  The macbook pro works well.  I compared the  config print items and found no obvious discrepancies.  Both macbooks are on Firefox 84.0.2 </p><p>My significant other blames Apple.  I am convinced the problem lies with Firefox. Oh -- print screens are not worthwhile since we're talking a major time delay. </p><p>MikeDos </p>,mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-840;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",MikeDos

It's to do with the fact that I didn't understand how to create/data into emails &amp; such in the first place properly...now it's a big mess, plus for the life of me I couldn't remember how to fix up my emails, plus I had that problem of the long string of data that I have 'nursed' &amp; that has now totally disappeared! Not very easy to explain, sorry! I had about 5 years worth, Hmmmmm... But I can't explain where my emails have gone! I do still have a few listed 'bookmarks' in alphabetical order but I don't know how to restore them, (she said hopefully)! I still cannot find out where the emails 'live'.....they seem to have located themselves into a new format! (Oh yeah, about 9 months ago I figured out how to insert a 'NEW FOLDER' ..lol... that really helped.) Sigh...this has taken me about 6 hours to sort out.....I am so very grateful, I hope this time who knows, I might get to flex my Wings!!

Percebi que ficou assim depois de uma atualização porém não sei qual, faz muito tempo talvez uns 3 anos eu acho ou mais. e dez de então nunca mais voltou ao normal esse detalhe no navegador! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-8;firefox-840;,firefox,privacy-and-security,pt-BR,"",cccpaes

I added the bookmark toolbar to try re-add my bookmarks, but nothing sticks.  There is a sentence on the bookmark line saying it would be easier for me if I put bookmarks on the line and a link to manage bookmarks.  Nothing sticks to the  bookmark toolbar and nothing happens when I click the link.  Other  than switching to a new browser, which I am now seriously considering, how can I  fix this?  It took me a long time to get many of the important bookmarks in the folder </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1384789;,kendp

I have deleted and reinstalled the program and was able to retrieve 6 passwords (that are more than 8 months old) the rest are missing. I have read and attempted to follow the instructions about the logins.json code without any luck. My system won't allow me to rename the file, there are as far as I can see no other corrupt versions of such a file. I have already spent fruitless hours on this. I have lost all my social media access as a consequence, lost my access to on-line learning and numerous other important access points. Can anyone help? Please! Yes, I am running AVG and something similar happened last year but on that occasion a fix from AVG solved the problem quickly. What can I do? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,1384768;1384792;1384793;1384795;,catmcdonald
