I added the bookmark toolbar to try re-add my bookmarks, but nothing sticks.  There is a sentence on the bookmark line saying it would be easier for me if I put bookmarks on the line and a link to manage bookmarks.  Nothing sticks to the  bookmark toolbar and nothing happens when I click the link.  Other  than switching to a new browser, which I am now seriously considering, how can I  fix this?  It took me a long time to get many of the important bookmarks in the folder </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",kendp

I have deleted and reinstalled the program and was able to retrieve 6 passwords (that are more than 8 months old) the rest are missing. I have read and attempted to follow the instructions about the logins.json code without any luck. My system won't allow me to rename the file, there are as far as I can see no other corrupt versions of such a file. I have already spent fruitless hours on this. I have lost all my social media access as a consequence, lost my access to on-line learning and numerous other important access points. Can anyone help? Please! Yes, I am running AVG and something similar happened last year but on that occasion a fix from AVG solved the problem quickly. What can I do? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,1384768;,catmcdonald
