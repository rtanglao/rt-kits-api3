Why I can't sync it to Firefox for Desktop (Mac in my case)? Or why I can't use collections on Firefox for Desktop? Would be another feature which Chrome and Co. doesn't have but makes the life much more easier. </p><p>Best, gummipunkt </p>",mac-os;desktop;beta;sync;firefox-850;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",gummipunkt

I'm pretty sure the problem happens because my computer is in Hebrew (I also set Firefox to Hebrew but this problem also happens in the English language of Firefox) </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1384837;,twmrsmy125

As a result, when the URL/search bar is focused, the bottom bar with ""This time, search with..."" is not displayed.  This is the expected behavior. </p><p>Starting about a month ago, it started exhibiting a bug: at random times, the search settings are getting reset.  So whenever I open a new tab and focus the URL/search bar, the bottom bar with ""This time, search with..."" is appearing and displays four icons.  When I go to search preferences, I see the same search engines that I removed a while ago. </p><p>This pattern has repeated about five times, and I'm getting tired of it.  Is there a way I can make sure that Firefox remembers my preferences and doesn't reset them? </p><p>Thank you, Alex </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",alexander.rymashevskiy
