Right, I have a win10 desktop(DT1) and 2 laptops (LP1 AND LP2). All win10 fully patched up &amp;Firefox 84.02. This morning I noticed my network share from LP1 to DT1 wasnt working and found LP1 powered down. Powered it up &amp; it looked to be completing a patch (KB4598242) so let it finish successfully and logged in.  It wouldnt take the 2 master pw prompts although definitely typing them correctly. Poked around the forum that talks of key4.db, key3.db and logins.json. Only had key4db but had a loginsbackup.json. deleted logins.jason and renamed loginsbackup. reloaded. Same, so am stuck. Did notice as LP1 loaded after powering on  that a Firefox update occurred. Could one have messed the other? Anyway these things seldom happen on their own so what  went on yesterday. On LP2 I noticed that on each reboot I got 2 identical FFox windows. I tried refresh, uninstalling ffox &amp; mainteneance service, same. So I searched for the word firefox and deleted everything I could find and reinstalled FFox. Same, so switched off &amp; gave up. Perhaps I have sync between my devices, not sure. However I have never at any stage changed my master passwords which is the same on all 3 pc's. Any ideas?  Shame to lose over 120 passwords if I have to somehow start over again by uninstalling FFox and reinstalling..that'll take ages.
