It implies that you can at the same time peruse different pages while watching a video. Here, we're demonstrating how to empower and utilize Picture-in-Picture mode on Firefox. </p><p><strong>What Is Picture-in-Picture Mode? </strong> </p><p>Picture-in-Picture mode is a Firefox include that has been accessible for Windows since adaptation 71, and for macOS and Linux since variant 72.  </p><p>When observing most recordings, you can tap the Picture-in-Picture symbol to pop the video out of the site page. That video at that point turns into its own skimming window, which you can resize and move anyplace on your screen, and it'll generally stay on top. You can even control the video playback without expecting to explore back to the first page. </p><p><strong>Step by step instructions to Enable Picture-in-Picture Mode </strong> </p><p>Picture-in-Picture mode is a standard Firefox highlight that is empowered naturally. Nonetheless, you can shroud the symbol that enacts it, so adhere to these directions to check its status:  </p> <ul><li>  Snap the Menu Button (three even lines).  </li></ul> <ul><li>  Snap Options.  </li></ul> <ul><li>  Underneath Browsing, guarantee that Enable picture-in-picture video controls is checked. </li></ul> <p><strong>Step by step instructions to Use Picture-in-Picture Mode </strong> </p> <ul><li> To utilize Picture-in-Picture mode, drift over a video and snap the Picture-in-Picture symbol. It would seem that two square shapes on top of one another. This will pop the video out from the page.  </li></ul> <ul><li> On the other hand, you can right-tap the video to open the setting menu. From here, click Picture-in-Picture. A few sites like YouTube supersede the Firefox setting menu, so you should right-click twice to get to it (don't right-tap on a menu thing or it will not work)  </li></ul> <ul><li> You can likewise press Ctrl + Shift + ] and Firefox will dispatch the most significant video on the page into Picture-in-Picture.  </li></ul> <ul><li> There are a few recordings that Picture-in-Picture mode isn't accessible for. This incorporates those without a sound track and those that are excessively little or short. For instance, loads of recordings on Twitter fall into this class.  </li></ul> <ul><li> When utilizing Picture-in-Picture mode, you can snap and delay the video to move it anyplace on your screen. Additionally, snap and drag the sides of the video to resize it. To go full screen, double tap the video.  </li></ul> <ul><li> Float over the video, and you will see three symbols. The upper right X symbol stops and shuts the Picture-in-Picture video. Then again, the Picture-in-Picture symbol will keep the video playing and return you to the first website page. </li></ul>",desktop;tips;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",LeviDua

I frequently need to save e-mail attachments from the Outlook e-mail (app version, not browser version) into Sharepoint in a browser tab. Firefox will let me drag-and-drop files from my desktop into Sharepoint in a browser tab, but it will NOT let me drag-and-drop files directly from an Outlook email attachment into Sharepoint in a browser tab. I tested this in Chrome, and Chrome allowed it. This sounds like a minor thing, but dropping to my desktop first then into the browser is an annoying step that adds up to valuable minutes over the course of a work day. Is there a setting or anything I can change to get Firefox to allow the drag-and-drop directly from an Outlook e-mail?
