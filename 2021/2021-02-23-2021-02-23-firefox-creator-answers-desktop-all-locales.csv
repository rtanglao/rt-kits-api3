But when I want to close the tab group windows I get a warning like: ""You are about to close 37 tabs. Are you sure you want to continue?"" What? How do I close the windows without closing all the tabs and loosing them? Isn't the purpose of using STG to help you organize all of your open tabs so that you CAN close the windows? Or, when I close the STG Group and close the tabs, will they still be accessible through the STG Manage Groups window? Thanks for the help! </p>",mac-os;desktop;tabs;firefox-840;firefox-8402;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1394006;1394011;,sandzbox

I tried to switch out to my personal account, but after clicking my personal account, the page refreshes and my account is still my brand account. I tried this with Youtube in Firefox and it's producing the same problem. I'm able to switch in and out of my accounts in Chrome, but yields differently when I tried it with Firefox. I figured I can maybe get some help to what I am supposed to do if I still want to use Firefox and able to switch account more easily. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-850;firefox-8502;,firefox,websites,en-US,1393998;1393999;1394003;,klaustin.wijaya

I always use Firefox. My company uses Sharepoint for all internal files. I frequently need to save e-mail attachments from the Outlook e-mail (app version, not browser version) into Sharepoint in a browser tab. Firefox will let me drag-and-drop files from my desktop into Sharepoint in a browser tab, but it will NOT let me drag-and-drop files directly from an Outlook email attachment into Sharepoint in a browser tab. I tested this in Chrome, and Chrome allowed it. This sounds like a minor thing, but dropping to my desktop first then into the browser is an annoying step that adds up to valuable minutes over the course of a work day. Is there a setting or anything I can change to get Firefox to allow the drag-and-drop directly from an Outlook e-mail? I'd very much like to not have to use Chrome for this functionality. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1394020;,egyles
