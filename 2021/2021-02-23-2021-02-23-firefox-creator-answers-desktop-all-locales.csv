I always use Firefox. My company uses Sharepoint for all internal files. I frequently need to save e-mail attachments from the Outlook e-mail (app version, not browser version) into Sharepoint in a browser tab. Firefox will let me drag-and-drop files from my desktop into Sharepoint in a browser tab, but it will NOT let me drag-and-drop files directly from an Outlook email attachment into Sharepoint in a browser tab. I tested this in Chrome, and Chrome allowed it. This sounds like a minor thing, but dropping to my desktop first then into the browser is an annoying step that adds up to valuable minutes over the course of a work day. Is there a setting or anything I can change to get Firefox to allow the drag-and-drop directly from an Outlook e-mail? I'd very much like to not have to use Chrome for this functionality. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",egyles
