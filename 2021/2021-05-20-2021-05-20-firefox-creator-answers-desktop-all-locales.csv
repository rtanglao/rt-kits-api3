I've already copied a bunch of the files from it so I'm not shut off completely. When I try to use the Mozilla feature to transfer them, it appears it want's to re-install &amp; rewrite Firefox on the D:/ drive. NOT good.

Now I keep typing my searches in the address bar by accident. could it be that the 'Zoom Page WE' which I set to 150% might be hiding the option? I reversed to the default 100% but still it did not avail the option. It seems to have disappeared. Maybe the developer forgot to put it in? Doe anyone have this same problem?
