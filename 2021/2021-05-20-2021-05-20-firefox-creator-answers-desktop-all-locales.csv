My storage area is about 1.5Gb and when I manually removed anything older than the last 3 months it dropped down in size considerably.  I've seen a few addons that do the opposite, you can delete from newest up to older cache/history, but I would like something that keeps the last 3 months and gets rid of anything older. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",markandlyndon

The 16TB and 8TB add-in raid cards survived thank god. Also salvaged was the 250GB Samsung EVO SSD ""C"" drive.  It was cloned to a duplicate the 1st day of every month. (No, it hasn't been overclocked in 8+ years, and even then I had the shut down temps set @ 50c). New m/b, processor, video card, memory, and unfortunately, Win10 Pro x64. All do in Friday. :-(.  This old (76) man is gonna have to learn all over again:-(  ( 'cept this time it's air-cooled and VERY conservative :-) ) </p><p>My problem is the several hundred bookmarks I had in Firefox (I'm a LONGTIME user. I DON'T want to loose them. I've got the salvaged ""C"" drive SSD in a mini-dock (D:/ in the laptop) and I'm looking at them on my laptop (also Win7 Pro  x64 based) ALL the files appear to be there at the time of the failure. I've already copied a bunch of the files from it so I'm not shut off completely. When I try to use the Mozilla feature to transfer them, it appears it want's to re-install &amp; rewrite Firefox on the D:/ drive. NOT good. Isn't there a single (even multiple) file(s) that can be copied to C:\ so I can disconnect the mini-dock and THEN ""import"" them? </p><p>THANK YOU !!!! </p>",windows-7;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-880;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",my61cat

Yes, it can sometimes be a cookie database issue, but this time, <strong>MAY 2021</strong>, it's a problem with YouTube's ad loader. This has happened before [1]. The work around until they fix it is to click on any suggested video on the same page. As soon as it starts to load, hit the browser's back button, and the error producing video will load.  </p><p>[1] <a href=""https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/10329866/consistently-getting-an-error-occurred-please-try-again-later-playback-id-on-all-videos?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/10329866/consistently-getting-an-error-occurred-please-try-again-later-playback-id-on-all-videos?hl=en</a> </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,cookies,en-US,"",eckman

I don't know what happened.  I left the computer for a couple hours this afternoon.  I opened Windows and found a ""new desktop"" which I didn't want.  I clicked on it and it took me back to my normal desktop.  I had left Firefox minimized.  Maybe this is what has removed my settings in Firefox.  Now when I open Firefox, my saved tabs are gone.  I've tried twice putting them back in.  I check Options to make sure that restore session is checked.  Each time I close, I get  a single tab and have to re-open all of my favorite pages all over again.  My Windows 10 version is 20H2. </p><p>What can I do in options that will allow my open tabs to stay saved? </p><p>Please reply. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1413773;,Mitzee

Eu gosto muito do Firefox, mas no meu trabalho fica um pouco complicado o uso dele pois no minha estação de trabalho há vários certificados digitais instalados, o Firefox não utiliza o repositório do Windows, mas o seu próprio repositório, existe alguma extensão que permita o Firefox visualizar os certificados no repositório do Windows? Seria interessante para futuras versões a possibilidade do Firefox utilizar o repositório do Windows como padrão, pois só não uso o Firefox como padrão no meu trabalho por esse motivo. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,pt-BR,"",w.uill

I can not find out why this option has disappeared ... Is it because of a combination the latest version of firefox and the May 19'th update of the addon? this option really was handy for me ... Now I keep typing my searches in the address bar by accident. could it be that the 'Zoom Page WE' which I set to 150% might be hiding the option? I reversed to the default 100% but still it did not avail the option. It seems to have disappeared. Maybe the developer forgot to put it in? Doe anyone have this same problem? Are there alternatives for a 'new tab' that set the focus on the webpage instead of the address bar? </p><p>Greetings MMori </p><p>SS001 Shows the current situation  SS002 shows the former situation </p>,desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1413768;1413774;,MrMori
