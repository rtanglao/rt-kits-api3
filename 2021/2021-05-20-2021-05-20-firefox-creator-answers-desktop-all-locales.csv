I don't know what happened.  I left the computer for a couple hours this afternoon.  I opened Windows and found a ""new desktop"" which I didn't want.  I clicked on it and it took me back to my normal desktop.  I had left Firefox minimized.  Maybe this is what has removed my settings in Firefox.  Now when I open Firefox, my saved tabs are gone.  I've tried twice putting them back in.  I check Options to make sure that restore session is checked.  Each time I close, I get  a single tab and have to re-open all of my favorite pages all over again.  My Windows 10 version is 20H2. </p><p>What can I do in options that will allow my open tabs to stay saved? </p><p>Please reply. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",Mitzee

Eu gosto muito do Firefox, mas no meu trabalho fica um pouco complicado o uso dele pois no minha estação de trabalho há vários certificados digitais instalados, o Firefox não utiliza o repositório do Windows, mas o seu próprio repositório, existe alguma extensão que permita o Firefox visualizar os certificados no repositório do Windows? Seria interessante para futuras versões a possibilidade do Firefox utilizar o repositório do Windows como padrão, pois só não uso o Firefox como padrão no meu trabalho por esse motivo. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,pt-BR,"",w.uill

I can not find out why this option has disappeared ... Is it because of a combination the latest version of firefox and the May 19'th update of the addon? this option really was handy for me ... Now I keep typing my searches in the address bar by accident. could it be that the 'Zoom Page WE' which I set to 150% might be hiding the option? I reversed to the default 100% but still it did not avail the option. It seems to have disappeared. Maybe the developer forgot to put it in? Doe anyone have this same problem? Are there alternatives for a 'new tab' that set the focus on the webpage instead of the address bar? </p><p>Greetings MMori </p><p>SS001 Shows the current situation  SS002 shows the former situation </p>,desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1413768;,MrMori
