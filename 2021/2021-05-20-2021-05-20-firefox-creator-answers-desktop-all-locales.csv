I also use ""Adblock plus"" and ""YouTube enhancer"". When I watch a YouTube video, it almost always forces the highest resolution. I don't mean ""default"", I mean ""force"". When I change the resolution to 480p (or anything else) it immediately reverts to the highest setting. Then it buffers (preloads) the video, using much more bandwidth than just the ""per minute"" toll for 1080p, because it is using bandwidth for the preloading as well. Is anyone else experiencing this (I think it started just this month, May 2021, or not long before that)? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",dem.nisbet

The system notification at the time of installation asking me if I wanted the app to make changes on my PC did state the publisher was Mozilla Corporation.  However when I went into MS App list in settings, I noticed Mozilla Maintenance Service had also been installed without asking me for my permission. </p><p>Even more concerning when I tried to uninstall Mozilla Maintenance Service a system notification asking me if I wanted the app to make changes to my PC stated the digital certificate for that app had an unknown publisher.  I also checked the newly installed Mozilla Firefox browser app and the system notification again stated its digital certificate had an unknown publisher. </p><p>I left both apps installed and today I tried to view the certificates via the MS Management Console, the certificate store (accessed by pressing the windows key and R and typing certmgr.msc into the pop up search box). MMS could not find the certificates for either the Mozilla Firefox browser or Mozilla Maintenance Service apps.  I've now managed to find copies of the digital certificates for both apps in my C drive under Program Files and Program Files (x86) but I am still concerned that the apps could be trojans.  If anyone can answer some or all of the below questions I would be very grateful. </p><p>Has anyone had similar problems with Mozilla Firefox browser and Mozilla Maintenance Maintenance: 1) Not being able to find their digital certificate using the MS Management Console?  2) The apps list in settings stating publisher unknown when you try to uninstall either app? 3) Mozilla Maintenance Service automatically being installed when I only selected to download the Mozilla Firefox browser app?

To someone with no programming skills this doesn't sound like it would be hard, though of course I have no idea how the Firefox Sync system works. Still, I'm not asking for a function to restore entire sessions across systems, for example (I can see how that would cause conflicts with the current session) but rather just something that would a) sort tabs by window in the synced tabs list, and b) delineate the windows somehow, either by just a separator line or by some heading (""Window n""?). Given that this information clearly exists in the local session (it's able to restore all windows, after all), I hope it will be possible to add this in some form. To reiterate, I don't want/need it to automatically open synced tabs in the ""correct"" window or anything like that (I can handle that myself easily enough), but simply to keep them visually sorted and separated in the sync list. This way I can avoid spending 30 minutes sorting tabs that I had previously sorted in case of a system crash or working on a new PC. </p><p>In addition to this, I hope the sync system can move to match tab order in the browser rather than the current jumbled mess, which ... might be sorted by whatever was last active? I frankly can't tell, but for those of us with many tabs open at once and working across several devices this is a serious obstacle. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",kraaketaer
