To someone with no programming skills this doesn't sound like it would be hard, though of course I have no idea how the Firefox Sync system works. Still, I'm not asking for a function to restore entire sessions across systems, for example (I can see how that would cause conflicts with the current session) but rather just something that would a) sort tabs by window in the synced tabs list, and b) delineate the windows somehow, either by just a separator line or by some heading (""Window n""?). Given that this information clearly exists in the local session (it's able to restore all windows, after all), I hope it will be possible to add this in some form. To reiterate, I don't want/need it to automatically open synced tabs in the ""correct"" window or anything like that (I can handle that myself easily enough), but simply to keep them visually sorted and separated in the sync list. This way I can avoid spending 30 minutes sorting tabs that I had previously sorted in case of a system crash or working on a new PC. </p><p>In addition to this, I hope the sync system can move to match tab order in the browser rather than the current jumbled mess, which ... might be sorted by whatever was last active? I frankly can't tell, but for those of us with many tabs open at once and working across several devices this is a serious obstacle. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,sync,en-US,1413862;,kraaketaer
