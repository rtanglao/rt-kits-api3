There are also times when a link within a news site will not go to the news story I expect it to go.  There are other times when my screen saver has been removed and just the blue Windows default screen is there.  I have to go into [Control Panel] and re-select the picture file I wish it to draw images from for display.  There are other anomalies too that seem to be not of my doing.  These are all recent, within a couple of months. I use Avast Virus software and Malwarebytes software too.  Also, as of two days ago there are ads popping up on every news site I watch.  I did have an ad blocker program running but it would appear to not be working. </p><p>However, that statement 'Your browser is being managed by your organization.' is making me concerned.  Can you explain statement that to me? </p><p>Also, while I'm here I have another question.  I have been using Firefox since the end of Netscape Navigator and once upon a time any desktop shortcut icons were all Firefox's icon.  Then for years they turned into Internet Explorer icons.  When I clicked on the shortcuts Explorer would open and I don't like that program.  So now I click on an icon's [Properties] and copy the url and paste it into Firefox's search window.  But within the last month the icons are now Google's Chrome image.  I don't understand why, if Firefox is my default browser, these icon changes occur.  And why Chrome?  Is it because I have Google's search engine as the default search engine? </p><p>I appreciate any help you can provide to me.

The ""Site information for <a href=""http://website.com"" rel=""nofollow"">website.com</a>"" menu that appears when you click the lock icon in the address bar is basically unusable for me. The menu's header, ""clear cookies"" button, and arrow button are all fine, but the text in between is covered in globe icons. The ""Connection Security"" sub-menu that the arrow leads to has a similar case. (See screenshot.) </p><p>Huge disclaimer: I am using Shadowfox, which modifies a Firefox install to make UI elements darker. It has made text difficult to read for me at times, but it has never produced any really strange artifacts like this one as far as I can tell. I do have a Developer Edition install with no Shadowfox and it doesn't have the issue. However, maybe this is a common Nightly issue. (I guess this wouldn't make sense since DE is even more experimental than Nightly? I think?) </p><p>Maybe this is a problem for the Shadowfox team. Ultimately, the solution I <em>really</em> want is native support for a full-fledged dark mode, with black or gray color for UI elements such as the context menu. If this isn't going to happen and Shadowfox is indeed the source of the issue, I'll gladly let them know. But I thought it would be good to share with Mozilla, and why not the community, too.

I've noticed a problem recently in some websites where certain elements (e.g. logos and icons) completely disappear and get replaced by strings of text, which I'm assuming is the code that is used to create them. Usually, it's just one icon, typically a search or menu icon, but there have been more drastic cases, such as the screenshot of the Encyclopaedia Britannica website that I attached. Notice that many buttons, while still functional, are covered with strange text. One thing I'm suspecting is that I intentionally or inadvertently disabled an element (or something of that sort, sorry for my ignorance in the specificities) ages ago that was supposed to make these work, but I don't remember what I disabled, if I ever did. But other than that, I have no clue what causes this. In Tor, where I don't have an account and never interfered with the setup or settings, everything seems to work just fine; the buttons are right there. Hope someone can be of help. </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-860;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1401565;1401582;1401628;1401630;,halvecius

All menus and surrounding UI is working too, but, for example, if I try to open Preferences page from menu - it will not open, even new tab isn't created. </p><p>If I start firefox with MOZ_DISABLE_CONTENT_SANDBOX=1 all works fine. Problem appeared after I accidentally used all of my laptop RAM with other app. Firefox didn't crashed, but after reopening this issue is began appearing. </p><p>I use Linux Mint 20, and apt-upgraded all packages (including firefox) right after this issue first appeared. I tried to: - restart browser (didn't work) - restart laptop (didn't work) - use different profile (didn't work) - use browser safe mode (didn't work) - clear caches (didn't work) - disable all extensions (didn't work) - use different versions: 75.0, 87.0, 82.0, freshly-compiled by myself (didn't work) - refreshing firefox (didn't work) - run firefox with MOZ_DISABLE_CONTENT_SANDBOX=1 (worked, but it's obviously unsafe and don't fix the root problem) </p><p>I found some issues and bugs that looks pretty similar to mine: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1245935"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1245935</a> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1235332"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1235332</a> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1279656"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1279656</a> <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1433065"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1433065</a> </p><p>Also, after closing firefox, it stays running in processes, and I can't open new window for 30 seconds or more after closing old window. </p><p>I think it's bug and problem is somewhere in firefox sources.
