I don't know why, since I didn't access the server files or changed anything around. </p><p>Over the course of troubleshooting, I figured out that it seems like the monospaced font is at fault. So I tried to change the font Firefox uses for *serif fonts* to MS Gothic (instead of standard TNR). This is despite using *monospaced font* in my user settings on the wiki. </p><p>I also opened FF on my laptop where it is still on 84.0.2 and everything looks as it should, with the same standard settings applied everywhere. So I'm 80% sure the last FF updated changed something. The missing 20% are because I only noticed this yesterday, but the update happened four days ago, right? </p><p>Also, on the old FF the fonts used are Courier New and Microsoft YaHei. On the new FF it's Courier New and SimSun. In the settings I have ""Fonts for: Latin"" and the standard fonts, so I don't know where YaHei and SimSun come from. When I change Serif: TNR to YaHei, it changes from SimSun to YaHei... </p><p>Edit: This thread solved it, actually: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1277075"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1277075</a> </p><p>Short answer: Add Japanese to the preferred languages, leave everything else as it is. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",denito666
