After the freeze or stutter, the video never gets out of sync with the audio but actually jumps ahead to where tit is. Meaning I'd lose out on 1-3 seconds of visual footage which I have to rewind to watch again. After the rewind the video doesn't get stuck on the same spot but further down it happens again.  It sometimes never happens on some videos I watch but the ones that it does happen, If I went back to watch it again (refreshing tab or finishing the video then coming back) It happens again. Usually repeats within 5 minutes of it happening at minimum. Which is very annoying. </p><p>At first I thought this could be a issue on my display drivers. I went searching for solutions all over the web. Common reasons I got for this was that my internet might be slow. Which is bit true ig. But I can view up to 1080p videos without buffering or any problems. So Idk how that's the case. Another reason I got was that it might be hardware acceleration, which I turned off before I got the problem again. Another suggested add ons might be the case. So I turned some off and under more advice used a completely new portable app of firefox (no logins, addons or settings changes) and I got the same results. I also reinstalled display drivers. Disabled the hardware acceleration of the new clean app. And still got the issue. The only time I didn't get the issue was when I was using Chrome. Or Edge.  </p><p>I've cleared cache and all data,history as well. So I'm really stumped. Someone asked me to make a completely new windows local user admin account and try again. And it happened there as well.  </p><p>Edit : While trying to get evidence of this, I've discovered that sometimes if I rewind twice or go back more than I usually do the stutter tends to usually repeat on the same place. You can see it in the video. </p><p><a href=""https://youtu.be/oZZ4OgPLtB8"" rel=""nofollow"">leads to youtube</a> </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-910;firefox-9102;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",empsi
