Utilizo Firefox para trabajar. El problema es que, cuando utilizo Firefox para visitar alguna página, en los textos de la página hay palabras que deberían aparecer en negro y aparecen en azul, entonces, no puedo distinguir cuáles son las palabras que contienen un enlace y cuáles no. Además, cuando abro Outlook, no se ve bien cuáles son los correos que tengo sin leer, pues deberían el asunto de esos correos debería aparecer en azul, pero aparece en negro. Esto no me pasa con otros navegadores, sólo con Firefox. Para que se vea cuál es el problema, he adjuntado varias capturas de pantalla de cómo se ve mi LinkedIn (en Firefox vs. Microsoft edge) y de cómo se ve mi Outlook (en Firefox vs. Microsoft edge). </p><p>Muchas gracias de antemano por su ayuda :) . </p><p>Un saludo, </p><p>Marta </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-910;firefox-9102;,firefox,websites,es,"",mnovalf
