It's popped up a few months ago and hasn't resolved itself in between updates. </p><p>I'm guilty of having many (well over 20) tabs open at the same time and around the 20th or 30th tab even, usually one of the (newly opened) tabs, simply never loads. If I open the same link in another tab, the link (any url) does load. See the screencap below. </p><p>This is on a windows 64 bit machine OS build: 19043.1165 (21H1) Windows Feature Experience Pack 120.2212.3530.0 </p><p>I'm running Norton 360 Antivirus software. </p><p>Will try running in safe mode, to see if it still happens and confirm in a reply to this message. </p><p>Hoping you guys might have some suggestions. </p><p>BTW: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1317506"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1317506</a> is probably the same problem, unfortunately the thread has been archived.
