Please note, it's only a tab crash, no Firefox crash at all. I'm having crashes inside Gmal or any other site. </p><p>Previous version 95.0.1 or 95.0 have no issues at all (no tab crashes). IMHO it could be related to the fix introduced in 95.0.2 related to AMD CPUs (even if Ryzen 7 1700 is not listed). </p><p>Hope you can troubleshoot this issue soon. I'm sending reports on each tab crash I have for now. </p><p>All the best </p><p>Simone </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-950;firefox-9502;,firefox,fix-problems,it,"",Spulci

Parts of the types are white (refer to the screenshot). I'm using Mac OS 10.15.17. Is this a known issue - and is there a remedy?
