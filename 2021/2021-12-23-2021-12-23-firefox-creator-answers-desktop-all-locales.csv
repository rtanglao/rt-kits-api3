I have indicated, when offered, to ""never save"" logins from certain sites. I have gone to the saved logins area in firefox and verified that the login information is not saved there. However when I go to a site, the login information is in the browser somewhere and shows up under the form blank as I type the correct information in. Obviously this is a security issue. I once got rid of this data by deleting EVERYTHING but of course I lost a lot in the process. The first time I did that I hadn't fully configured the settings for form filler so I hoped for better the second time around. But no, alas and alack it is back. I am hoping someone out there knows how I can go in and surgically remove this data.  </p><p>NOTE I have already tried every solution in the firefox help area and in the firefox forums and on all help sites on the first ten pages of google so PLEASE do not fill up the answer area telling me to try that stuff. It did not work. The only thing that worked was deleting EVERYTHING (Ctrl+shift+del clear everything for all time) I have spent hours on trying different things because 1) these logins should not be saved and 2) I don't want to delete everything again 3) I didn't want to have to write this essay here.  </p><p>TLDR Alternately if you know how I can export and then import my cookies and site settings, I could delete EVERYTHING and then add those 2 back in.
