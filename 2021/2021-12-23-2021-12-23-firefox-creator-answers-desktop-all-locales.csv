Their site is <a href=""http://asia.nikkei.com"" rel=""nofollow"">asia.nikkei.com</a>.  </p><p>I get regular e-mails from them with headlines. If I click on these to 'READ MORE' I cannot because the login box doesn't appear.  </p><p>To access the content of the publication I have to log in, using the login box that appears on the first page of the site. BUT using Firefox, which is my regular, default browser NO login box appears. </p><p>If I use another browser (e.g. Safari) the login box appears automatically.  </p><p>So what's the problem. This is an important news site for me so if I can't solve this, I will probably switch my default browser to Safari. </p><p>Any idea what's wrong? </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;firefox-950;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",rbmcarthur
