(Some windows may be more frozen than others, but all become slow.) Other programs on the computer are unaffected. I usually have to kill the Firefox processes, which often results in loss of the 10-30 tabs I had open (no restore session prompt on restart). The issue does not self-resolve over a period of ~30 minutes after wake. On the most recent occurrence, I noticed one of the Firefox subprocesses sitting at ~20% CPU usage (one full core on a six-core machine, probably using single-core boost; CPU does not have hyperthreading) continuously. That's about the only clue I have. </p><p>Although I don't know if it's specifically related to hybrid sleep, this does not appear to happen on my laptop, which does not use hybrid sleep. It only happens after waking from sleep (not during normal use). There was no power loss in any of these cases, so the computer ought to be (and I believe is) waking from RAM rather than hibernation. Both machines are Windows 10 (and the desktop has significantly superior specs in all hardware; it's a cheap laptop vs. a workstation). The main SSD is nearly full, so the hiberfile is probably written to one of the HDDs, if that factors in at all. I use Google Docs and Drive quite a bit, and I've noticed some slowdowns on Firefox due to that in the past (years ago, different machine, when leaving the same tabs open for long periods of time), but that doesn't seem to be a consistent problem here.

I am not sure when this happened, because I hadn't opened my OneTab in some time, but today I tried it because I wanted to file and categorize tabs I had saved, and they are sadly all gone! </p><p>Searching around I discovered this probably has to do with recent Firefox updates, but I haven't been able to find any backup of my extension data. I followed directions from this issue <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1260116"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1260116</a> and this <a href=""https://www.tenforums.com/software-apps/176858-how-i-export-my-profile-data-firefox-extension.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.tenforums.com/software-apps/176858-how-i-export-my-profile-data-firefox-extension.html</a>. </p><p>But no success. Any ideas if/where OneTab data could be? Or even which update could have broken the extension, if that could help? </p><p>Thanks so much for any help :) </p><p>Edit: I also wanted to add, because I saw it in some of the replies I found, that I have no Old Firefox Data folder, as I have never used the Refresh Firefox option. In fact, I remember getting a notification by Firefox some time ago to do this, but since it would involve having to reconfigure extensions etc, I chose not to (probably a bad idea!). </p>",linux;desktop;tabs;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",starborn05

So Firefox is the only browser - on several OS's - that does not allow e-mails/attachments to be dropped from Microsoft Outlook. We have tested multiple users on different workstation and we have tested drop-fields from several web applications. </p><p>Surprisingly I cannot find any solution to this. The only similar cases I was able to find are from a couple of years ago but are about the other way around (so drag/dropping files FROM Firefox to another application). </p><p>At this moment I am advising my colleagues to use another browser. But we really want this to work properly with any browser of choice. Hope this community can help us out. </p><p>Note: UAC is enabled on the workstations. Disabling does not affect anything.
