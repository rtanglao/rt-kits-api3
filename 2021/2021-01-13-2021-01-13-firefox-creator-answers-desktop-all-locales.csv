On this particular website, I keep getting automatic downloads of coupons that open up a PDF on my Mac. How do I stop the website from doing automatic downloads? I don't have this issue on other websites. In Chrome, I don't have this issue and only get the download if I specifically click on the coupon link. The website customer support said it's an issue with Firefox, not their website.

However, when i click on web links outside of FF, it loads Chrome.  So in FF I go to options and set it as a default.  In ""default apps"" it shows up there.

That is not what I would like to happen.  </p><p>Is there a way to set it up so that when I click a link in an email, it will load the FF from the portable instance?  using the profile within the portable directory.

The address autofill options disappeared entirely from Firefox ""Privacy &amp; Security"" section. I checked about:config, which had ""services.sync.engine.addresses"" and ""services.sync.engine.addresses.available"" set to ""False"". I set them to ""True"", but that only restored the address synchronizing setting in Firefox ""Sync"" section, not in ""Privacy &amp; Security"" section. Syncing did not restore the address autofill options for ""Privacy &amp; Security"" section and neither did changing other autofill and address-related entries in about:config. Starting a fresh new profile yet again didn't help.  </p><p>Could this be caused by network-wide block of ""<a href=""http://location.services.mozilla.com"" rel=""nofollow"">location.services.mozilla.com</a>"" ? That domain became blocked a while back and there was no way around it, not even with DNS-over-HTTPS, but back then address autofill was working just fine without accessing that domain. </p><p>How can I bring back the address autofill portion of ""Privacy &amp; Security"" section??? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1383535;,SpektorCyrax
