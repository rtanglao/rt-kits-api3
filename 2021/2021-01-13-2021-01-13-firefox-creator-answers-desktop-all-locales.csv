The address autofill options disappeared entirely from Firefox ""Privacy &amp; Security"" section. I checked about:config, which had ""services.sync.engine.addresses"" and ""services.sync.engine.addresses.available"" set to ""False"". I set them to ""True"", but that only restored the address synchronizing setting in Firefox ""Sync"" section, not in ""Privacy &amp; Security"" section. Syncing did not restore the address autofill options for ""Privacy &amp; Security"" section and neither did changing other autofill and address-related entries in about:config. Starting a fresh new profile yet again didn't help.  </p><p>Could this be caused by network-wide block of ""<a href=""http://location.services.mozilla.com"" rel=""nofollow"">location.services.mozilla.com</a>"" ? That domain became blocked a while back and there was no way around it, not even with DNS-over-HTTPS, but back then address autofill was working just fine without accessing that domain. </p><p>How can I bring back the address autofill portion of ""Privacy &amp; Security"" section??? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1383535;,SpektorCyrax
