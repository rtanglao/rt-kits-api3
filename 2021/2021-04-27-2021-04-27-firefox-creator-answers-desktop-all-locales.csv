Usually when it does that it becomes solid white and shows HD at 1080. I'm using Win 10 64-bit Pro 20H2. </p><p>When I try watching the same videos in Chrome I have no issues and the content plays fine in HD 1080p.  </p><p>I tried removing all history, refreshing FF, uninstalling and re-installing my NVIDIA drivers but same issue. I am on 88.0. No add ons or themes. Just default FF after refresh. Nothing helps.  </p><p>I have seen other reports of widevine crashing but I dont have that issue. FF just wont play Amazon video in HD anymore. </p><p>Edit: </p><p>After trying some things and completely uninstalling firefox from system and all folders I finally got Amazon to play HD 1080p content again, but only a short while.  </p><p>For some reason on refreshed or completely new installs of FF 88 amazon would have issues and only play SD. Even if all folders were deleted before install. When I installed the previous version of FF to 87 content was once again playing back at HD 1080p. I than updated to 88 and it was ok but only for a bit.  </p><p>Even though FF 87 installed and updated widevine, FF version 88 would update it again a short while later but the version numbers of widevine (4.10.2209.1) stayed the same. Whatever version 88 is doing to widevine it seems to cause a conflict preventing Amazon from playing videos in HD content. </p><p>Edit 2:  </p><p>From my other computer which had not updated to 88 yet had widevine version 4.10.1582. I took all those files and replaced the ones in the folder for 4.10.2209.1. I have updates disabled for widevine now and Amazon is playing HD 1080p once again with no issues.

I can see the back button history drop down is a great tool for this, however the history entries seem limited to the past 15 pages or so. Is there a configuration value that one can modify to increase this limit? Alternatively, what are some good resources for overriding this menu with an addon that presents a custom control instead? I'm not afraid to write my own if need be, however I believe that one already existed for a previous version of Firefox (maybe even older than FF 4!!!), and never was updated. </p><p>Attached is the menu I am referring to in case it has a specific name in the codebase that may make it hard to find. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,1409002;1409011;1409155;,nickmaxx
