How can I get it to go back to WYSIWYG? </p>",windows-7;desktop;websites;firefox-880;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",valeriehawke

I can see the back button history drop down is a great tool for this, however the history entries seem limited to the past 15 pages or so. Is there a configuration value that one can modify to increase this limit? Alternatively, what are some good resources for overriding this menu with an addon that presents a custom control instead? I'm not afraid to write my own if need be, however I believe that one already existed for a previous version of Firefox (maybe even older than FF 4!!!), and never was updated. </p><p>Attached is the menu I am referring to in case it has a specific name in the codebase that may make it hard to find. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,1409002;1409011;,nickmaxx
