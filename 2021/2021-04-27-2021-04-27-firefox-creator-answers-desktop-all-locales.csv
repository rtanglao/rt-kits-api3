So when I search something on the URL bar, I have to also open another tab and type <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a>, or straight just go to <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> and search for something. </p><p>I have already tried clearing the cache.
