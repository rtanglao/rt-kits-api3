None of the answers there where helpful to me. </p><p>If I go fullscreen on my MacBook, Firefox still shows the tab- and addressbar. ""browser.fullscreen.autohide"" is TRUE in about:config. Deletion of Firefox and associated data followed by a fresh install won't change that.  </p><p>I see this behavior since the first install of Firefox on this device, but now I'd like to ask if this is ""way it works"" or if it's kinda bug.  </p><p>Fullscreen on my device looks like the image attached to this post. </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-880;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1409039;,plausibel

I sat up my MacBook to automatically enter light or dark mode. Firefox enters dark mode as expected but won't leave. Even if I restart the MacBook the next day, while the system boots with light mode enabled, Firefox will remain in dark mode.  </p><p>To change this temporarily, I have to open the macOS settings and enable light mode. Firefox now change to light mode and stays in light mode, even if I again re-enable the automatic changing in the macOS settings.  </p><p>Later those days, Firefox enters dark mode as expected but won't leave, like described before.  </p><p>Is this a known bug?

The issue is whenever I try to stream video and/or music, the page shuts down and a little yellow bar appears at the top saying, "" The WidevineCdm Plugin has crashed."" And I'm not sure how to fix this. This happens when I am trying to stream certain things such as Hulu, Spotify, and Crunchyroll. I have tried various options like switching DRM on and off, submitting crash reports, and even restarting my my computer. But those don't work. </p><p>If anyone knows how to fix this, please let me know. Thank you, and have a good day! &lt;3 </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-109;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,"",beesophia72

I can see the back button history drop down is a great tool for this, however the history entries seem limited to the past 15 pages or so. Is there a configuration value that one can modify to increase this limit? Alternatively, what are some good resources for overriding this menu with an addon that presents a custom control instead? I'm not afraid to write my own if need be, however I believe that one already existed for a previous version of Firefox (maybe even older than FF 4!!!), and never was updated. </p><p>Attached is the menu I am referring to in case it has a specific name in the codebase that may make it hard to find. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,1409002;1409011;,nickmaxx
