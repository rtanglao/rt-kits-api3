However, today I headed to one of my favourite sites - Imgur - only to find a blank page.  Well, not entirely blank - all the words and frames and bits are there but no photos or videos - nothing visual. I had to ignore it during the day and then this evening I asked Imgur if they knew what the problem was.   They replied:  ""It looks like your ISP may be blocking access. I was able to confirm your ISP as TalkTalk which has had this issue occur in the past. I'd recommend reaching out to them directly or using an alternative connection to the site, if possible."" </p><p>Fair enough - it's TalkTalk's problem - or is it? </p><p>Soon afterwards I looked at a comment in Reddit and they gaive a link to Imgur - so, not really expecting much, I clicked on the link. <em>Secure Connection Failed </em> An error occurred during a connection to <a href=""http://i.imgur.com"" rel=""nofollow"">i.imgur.com</a>. PR_CONNECT_RESET_ERROR </p><pre>   The page you are trying to view cannot be shown because the authenticity of the received data could not be verified."" </pre> <p>Please could you add your comments so that I can be assured that it is indeed my server's fault and not a browser problem - so that I can get to the bottom of this unwanted security query. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-840;firefox-8402;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1384442;1384443;,leo9ine

Things like the red bar along the bottom of video thumbnails that indicate a video already watched, the video duration on the bottom right of the thumbnails, as well as the 'vertical three dots' â¢â¢â¢ menu button underneath thumbnails that contained the ""not interested"" option no longer appear on the YouTube main page.  The three dots menu still exists in the side bar list of recommended videos while actually watching a video, so it's only affecting the main page. </p><p>I have confirmed that those UI elements work in a different browser and, bizarrely, they seem to work when I use a Firefox private window. This led me to believe that one of my extensions was causing the issue, but even disabling all of them did not bring the missing UI element back in normal browser windows. I have also tried clearing all of my cache, cookies, and site data to no avail. </p><p>I am on Windows 10 Pro (Version 20H2 OS Build 19042.746) with an up-to-date Firefox (Version 84.0.2 64-bit). Current extensions: BetterTTV, FrankerFaceZ, uBlock Origin, and Facebook Container. </p><p>Attached image shows the lack of the three dots button on the top normal Firefox window and the presence of that button on the bottom private window. </p><p>I would appreciate any suggestions as to what may be causing this and possible solutions. Thanks for your time. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-840;firefox-8402;,firefox,websites,en-US,1384301;1384302;1384307;,plaguedone
