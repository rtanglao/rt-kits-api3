This problem began in late February/early March (FF 86&amp;87). </p><p>The tech support at <a href=""http://EveryAction.com"" rel=""nofollow"">EveryAction.com</a> said she thought they need Javascript to open, but I couldn't find any setting or add-on in FF to enable/disable Javascript.  I don't know why all of their action pages have been opening fine for years--maybe it's related to FF's new versions.  I tried adding Policy Control because it supposedly enables/disables Javascript but it didn't solve my problem. </p><p>The tech support at Earth Justice wrote this in response to my report about their action pages not displaying: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:87.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/87.0; <a href=""https://earthjustice.org/action/investigate-troubling-payments-that-threaten-the-florida-panther?contactdata=8D8RgJTCUXwiDCjeWPHh7wQ1fwDy7YSqjRoUFBMLj9iH2tXUofJiQ1CKU%2fIhkHfdjY8KsFkiYme4BhD4yp%2bpJ9S13ALo6NdUs4CtwLA2KaAhIZ0GP2%2bWq9ZUYNwtkHNEKC%2bxUF4VNRJ1XirXG00WayYuwLGnnHVzRWtCwf3s%2fqtR64TlcMwKx0w2e3AyPLspJ8xDw1TQNs%2fSBpWztf%2fNBkvDKFTrC6fsKAvY54zt13IfVVPcfU%2byEdneTMzDaYIN&amp;ms=email&amp;utm_source=crm&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=action&amp;utm_campaign=2102_Action_Panthers_Haaland&amp;%3butm_content=HTMLTakeActionButton1&amp;emci=5a0f473e-c881-eb11-85aa-00155d43c992&amp;emdi=01870d6d-d68b-eb11-85aa-00155d43c992&amp;ceid=962627"" rel=""nofollow"">https://earthjustice.org/action/investigate-troubling-payments-that-threaten-the-florida-panther?contactdata=8D8RgJTCUXwiDCjeWPHh7wQ1fwDy7YSqjRoUFBMLj9iH2tXUofJiQ1CKU%2fIhkHfdjY8KsFkiYme4BhD4yp%2bpJ9S13ALo6NdUs4CtwLA2KaAhIZ0GP2%2bWq9ZUYNwtkHNEKC%2bxUF4VNRJ1XirXG00WayYuwLGnnHVzRWtCwf3s%2fqtR64TlcMwKx0w2e3AyPLspJ8xDw1TQNs%2fSBpWztf%2fNBkvDKFTrC6fsKAvY54zt13IfVVPcfU%2byEdneTMzDaYIN&amp;ms=email&amp;utm_source=crm&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=action&amp;utm_campaign=2102_Action_Panthers_Haaland&amp;%3butm_content=HTMLTakeActionButton1&amp;emci=5a0f473e-c881-eb11-85aa-00155d43c992&amp;emdi=01870d6d-d68b-eb11-85aa-00155d43c992&amp;ceid=962627</a> ""We are still investigating this problem, but it appears to be concentrated among Firefox users.
