In principle, this should remain that way. Now, however, I would like a few PDF files <strong>from my own disk</strong> to be opened directly instead. I have thought up a workaround for this - which unfortunately (STILL?) doesn't work properly: </p><p>1) The files in question (so far only one, as a test) are renamed *.PXX. 2) In Win I have defined that these *.PXX files should NOT be opened with my generally used PDF programme, but with Adobe Acrobat. This WORKS. 3) Now I had to define in FF that PXX should be treated differently from PDF. I haven't managed to do that yet - the files are still written to the download folder - RENAMED *.PDF 4) Meanwhile I found some (as far as I know) ""unused"" extensions in FF, amog them *.IRC. So, I renamed my *.PXX-file *.IRC and defined in FF that *.IRC-files should be opend by Adobe Acrobat. 5) NEVERTHELESS - disregarding this definition - the *.IRC-files are NOT opened but ""downloaded"" to the download-folder AND renamed *.PDF </p><p><strong>Does anyone haven an idea?</strong> </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,tips,en-US,1402436;1402449;,Skeptiker

Since the most recent update, our online circulation website which we use to check out books, receives a pop-up blocked message every time we try to print a hold receipt for an item. The website has always been added as an exception to our pop-up blockers, and until just after the most recent update, the blocker had no problem allowing the website through. Now it does. I have tried clearing the browser caches, removing and adding the website to the exceptions list again, and restarting the browser, as well as adding different variations of the website to the exceptions list. In the end, we just had to turn the pop-up blockers off. I searched online for anyone else who had this issue, but the ones I found dated back to 2014-2015, and the solution they came up with no longer seems to exist in the Firefox settings.
