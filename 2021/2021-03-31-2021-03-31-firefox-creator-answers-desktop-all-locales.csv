When I open it, it shows a tiny, blank window for a fraction of a second and does nothing. I did some digging and this is what I found. </p><p>- Firefox Safe Mode doesn't start - Profile Manager doesn't work - Opera has the same problem - Restarting my computer didn't work - Reinstalling didn't work - Restarting and Reinstalling didn't work - I don't have CCleaner so that's not an issue - I went into my OSDrive to hunt and delete every folder labelled Mozilla I could find and that didn't change anything on reinstallation - The link I used to download the installer is: <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/</a> </p><p>Any suggestions? I saw a forum post that suggested a faulty value somewhere in the Windows Registry (<a href=""http://kb.mozillazine.org/Browser_will_not_start_up#No_Mozilla_applications_will_start"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kb.mozillazine.org/Browser_will_not_start_up#No_Mozilla_applications_will_start</a>), but the link it cites doesn't work anymore and I would prefer not to go Registry diving if I don't have to.

Often when I am on a website screen at a point where I am supposed to press Enter to click an item, pressing Enter or Spacebar (as a blind person would do to click an item) causes the Firefox screen to change to some kind of search screen that shows items such as Calculator, Ask Cortana, Voice Input, and other items that appear to be part of the Windows search system and not part of the website on which I was working.  In order to get back to the website where I was working, I have to press Alt-Tab, then hunt for the item on which I originally wanted to click in order to continue to the next screen of the site where I had been working.  This annoying problem has often happened on several different websites often enough to be quite annoying.  It began with the update just before this last update, which installed a day or so ago.  So the problem began on installation of the version just before the most current one.  I suspect that there is now a problem on how JAWS interacts with the last two ""builds"" or ""versions"" - whatever you folk call them.  , </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,other,en-US,"",knobman

For example, If I focus a input field, Firefox changes the input source to Hangul. So I changed the input source to English manually and then if I focus other input field, Firefox changes the input source to Hangul again.  I have two input sources on my mac. ABC (English) and 2-Set Korean and English is higher priority. I checked this on Chrome and Safari, both browser keep the input source. </p><p>This is my environment.
