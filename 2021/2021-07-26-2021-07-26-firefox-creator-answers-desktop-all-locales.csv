Ich habe zwei Probleme: Ich wollte Lesezeichen und angelegte Ordner löschen. Diese sind dann auch für sehr kurze Zeit verschwunden, tauchen aber dann wieder wie aus dem nichts auf. &gt; Wie kann ich Lesezeichen und Ordner dauerhaft löschen? Ein weiteres Problem ist die Sortierung der Lesezeichen und Ordner. Nach jedem Öffenen von Firefox ist alles unsortiert geordnet. &gt; Wie kann ich das einstellen? Alle beiden Probleme tauchen erst seit kurzer Zeit auf. Vorher lief das reibungslos. Vielen Dank, Dirk Baltes </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",dirkbaltes

I have used FIREFOX since VERSION 1.0. IT USED TO BE THE BEST BROWSER EVER CREATED. BUT NO LONGER.  WE use Firefox to accomplish things, not to debug BETA versions all day. One day I wake up and you FORCED rel 89.0 on us and it turned the whole WEEK to crap. I had 6 consecutive crashes the other day. Today I had 5 consecutive crashes. I had to turn my PC off and give it and me a rest.  I did not ask for a BETA, even to leave rel 88.  YOU 'forced' it on us with your ""you have no other chooses if you want to continue using FIREFOX attitude. And all you can say is: Go BACK to 'stable rel 90 AND CREATE A NEW PROFILE? DO you have any idea how hard it is for us, a USER to CREATE A NEW PROFILE FROM SCRATCH?  </p><p>THIS MAKES NO SENSE, YOU CRAM A ""BETA"" ON US, IT CRASHES A HALF DOZEN TIMES A DAY and your answer is to go back to a stable version YOU FORCED ON US? Then we spend a day or two creating a NEW PROFILE until you force ANOTHER BETA on us to test for you? You can't let us stay on a STABLE version like rel 88 until you work out the bugs then ""tell us"" there is one available and advise us to INSTALL IT? THIS IS CRAZY, let alone ""Professional"". </p>",desktop;beta;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jagman55

When Firefox added the screenshot functionality, it was very useful to me since i didn't have to open snip &amp; sketch every-time I want to take a screenshot. I did notice that the ability to access the screenshot from the address bar was removed and moved to the mouse's right click options instead. I work with Microsoft azure and have to create documents for clients and by default, right clicking doesn't work on azure and some other sites. Because of this, i can't take screenshots using Firefox. Is there a way to put the screenshot option back to the address bar or maybe have it show up in the toolbar options? Thanks. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-900;firefox-9002;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",TemmyD1

Firefox keeps asking me to enter my Primary password at random and this all started about 2 weeks ago. Most time it pops up the next day and sometimes every 2-4hrs.

It doesn't route all my traffic through the VPN, only the ones destined to the office.) What can i do to resolve this? I do plan to uninstall and reinstall Firefox but I want that to be the last solution if all else fails.

I can no longer find out how to change this default behaviour (presumably I'd used an addon that has been deleted).  This is extremely inconvenient - many archives have large numbers of filenames like ""&lt;number&gt;.txt"", e.g. ""234567.txt"", but all with the same title.
