Lo extraño es que esto no ocurría con anterioridad y tampoco pasa con otros navegadores , por lo que deduzco que el problema debe ser de firefox. He mirado posibles soluciones , pero no he dado con ninguna . Gracias </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-900;firefox-9002;,firefox,privacy-and-security,es,"",arg5171

ALSO THIS. After ""Refresh""ing Firefox, it now by default saves a file with the page title, not the filename.  I can no longer find out how to change this default behaviour (presumably I'd used an addon that has been deleted).  This is extremely inconvenient - many archives have large numbers of filenames like ""&lt;number&gt;.txt"", e.g. ""234567.txt"", but all with the same title.  I don't understand why keeping the old Firefox default was not made an option when you changed to saving by title! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",westchester5

However, this doesn't seem to work. I open firefox with work profile and see my work bookmarks, then I close and reopen with private profile and see my private bookmarks, then I close and reopen again with work profile and now I still see my private bookmarks instead of my work bookmarks. Firefox just unsolicitedly takes the private bookmarks over to the work profile. This can't be how it's supposed to be, right? Because what would be the point of having different profiles?
