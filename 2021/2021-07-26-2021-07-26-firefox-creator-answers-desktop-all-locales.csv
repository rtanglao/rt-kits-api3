I got a solid red screen alert on Mozilla Firefox, which says FIREFOX CRITICAL ERROR and says that someone tried to get access to my personal account. Adding with my personnel data that was stored on hard disk is also in danger<a href=""https://allpcsolottoresults.com/stl-results/"" rel=""nofollow"">.</a> . So, I shocked up and at that moment the only thing I can do was ran a scan with Windows Defender, but it did not fix the problem. Kindly help me out with what steps or suggestion I need to apply. Thanks in Advance   Regards: Eva Abion </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",aboineva

This started with your new update 90.0.2 64 bit. I am not technically  savvy what do I do to stop these emails and let them know it is fire fox mozilla browser. Fire fox is my main browser and has been for years but, unless there is some way to let websites know this is a new update to fire fox Mozilla I will be forced to remove this browser from my computer. Please advise me what I can do. Thank you.  Katisam3@cox.net </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-900;firefox-9002;,firefox,websites,en-US,1430297;,Katisam3
