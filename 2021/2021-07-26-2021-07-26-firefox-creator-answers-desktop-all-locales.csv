I have been a dedicated Firefox user but these recent updates have made Firefox extremely slow and some of the useful functionalities are no longer there...

Now, I can do it, but only to well-known sites such as Amazon, Facebook, Ebay and so on. I cannot do it with my own-interest websites. My own-preferred websites do occupy a space above the browser, but I cannot add a name to them. The little transparent square is just empty and I am unable to give it a name. </p><p>And, what is worse, when I open the new Firefox, all those pinned sites are being opened in the background and all the same time, and thus it is taking ages for me to get to my Home page.

I had to turn my PC off and give it and me a rest.  I did not ask for a BETA, even to leave rel 88.  YOU 'forced' it on us with your ""you have no other chooses if you want to continue using FIREFOX attitude. And all you can say is: Go BACK to 'stable rel 90 AND CREATE A NEW PROFILE?

When Firefox added the screenshot functionality, it was very useful to me since i didn't have to open snip &amp; sketch every-time I want to take a screenshot. I did notice that the ability to access the screenshot from the address bar was removed and moved to the mouse's right click options instead. I work with Microsoft azure and have to create documents for clients and by default, right clicking doesn't work on azure and some other sites. Because of this, i can't take screenshots using Firefox. Is there a way to put the screenshot option back to the address bar or maybe have it show up in the toolbar options?
