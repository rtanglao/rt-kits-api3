I'm trying to switch over to Firefox from Chrome but I'm encountering issues when it comes to getting Sharepoint from MS Office 365 to work on Firefox. Word, Exel, Outlook, Teams, and One Drive work fine. When it comes to Sharepoint, Firefox gives me a Secure Connection Failed message. Sharepoint works fine on Chrome, Safari, and Edge. Is there a setting I need to change on the Firefox browser that allows me to use Sharepoint cloud without it telling me? </p><p>Thanks in advance for all advice and assistance. </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-910;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",MrActionscript

So, I have created a keyboard for Firefox, the <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bislama-dictionary/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=search"" rel=""nofollow"">Bislama Dictionary for Firefox</a>. I was wondering if someone could add it to <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/language-tools/"" rel=""nofollow"">the list of dictionaries</a>. The local name for Bislama is just Bislama. Again, nobody on Discourse answered and it hasn't been added yet either. Could someone please add it? It would be helpful if it was done soon.
