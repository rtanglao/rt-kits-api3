On some news websites, and sports websites, I can no longer open articles just by clicking on them, but right-clicking works. If this sounds strange - it is! </p><p>The issue is exactly as it sounds like. I can hower the mouse over the title of an article and Firefox will recognize that it's a link, showing me the path at the very bottom left of the browser. But when I click it, it simply won't do anything. My mouse works fine before you ask. It's only when I right-click the same article and choose ""open in new tab"" that the article opens. This is happening on some major sites as well, like the BBC. </p><p>At first I thought this was Windows-specific, but I have also had the same issues with my Firefox for Android. And again, long-pressing on the article and selecting open in new tab will open the link, but not normal tapping. </p><p>I have restared Firefox in Troubleshooting mode to disable any addons but the problems persist.  </p><p>Anyone else having the same issue or is there a known solution? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-910;firefox-9102;,firefox,websites,en-US,1439337;1439341;1439400;,nucnik
