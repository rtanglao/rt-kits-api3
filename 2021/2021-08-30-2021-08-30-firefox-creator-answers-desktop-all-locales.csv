(And all our bookmarks and passwords, too!) At the about:profiles page, the only profile showing is the one I created to be able to launch Firefox. Under ""Users"" ..... ""App Data"", there are 3 profiles: the new one just created, another profile with same name and the Default profile. Can not access either of the old profiles. Both old profiles have last changed date the same as Firefox update. I hope there is a fix for this. This is almost as bad as the entire computer crashing. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-910;firefox-9102;,firefox,other,en-US,"",lorio56701
