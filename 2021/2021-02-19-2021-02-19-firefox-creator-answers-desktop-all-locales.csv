Now here is the fun part. If you close the new window with just the home tab, that will now become the latest session, so your previous one will be deleted. </p><p>How to get around that? Move your home tab into your session instead of closing the window, it works 100% of the time...  But can we, not start a new session if you close the home screen, or if you close just 1 tab it doesn't count as a different session. I dunno, just throwing ideas out there. </p><p>Hope this reaches those with the same issue, or people in positions to fix the issue, if anyone wants to use session saving add-ons, I took fancy to Tab Session Manager and Easy Session Manager, though not perfect, I don't advise for over 150 tabs. </p><p>I'll try to be as active on this thread as I can be, thanks for reading through! :&gt; </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",Nuyu

Confetti pouring down the screen.... The incentive was a *chance* to get a prize. So I proceeded cautiously and answered a few questions that seemed legit. Then, I won a prize... A Samsung Galaxy said to be valued at $1100 for $1. I was not on a page at https://easemastereight-15.life/....  Even more cautiously and suspicious moved forward using the click here, and it redirected to a different site, where of course they wanted a credit card to pay for the $1. At this point I bailed, especially because I was offered the same deal a year ago.  What I want to do now is to alert Mozilla about this, and after a lot of searching, this form was the only way I could find. If anyone knows how to route this to the people who should investigate this, please do it.
