I used sync to sync bookmarks from an ubuntu install  (85.0.1) onto the Mac. </p><p>The bookmarks arrived.  They are visible on the <em>bookmarks toolbar,</em> <em>bookmarks menu</em>,  and <em>bookmarks / show all bookmarks</em>.   I can add new bookmarks using drag and drop, or by the bookmarks menu options.   These bookmarks can be seen in the <em>Bookmarks / Show All Bookmarks</em> menu.    But they do not appear in the bookmarks toolbar.   It's as if there are 2 sets both started from the same sync.    </p> <ul><li> Bookmarks added by drag and drop visible through the toolbar     </li><li> Those added with <em>add bookmark </em> or <em>show all bookmarks </em>within the toolbar folder do not appear on the toolbar. </li></ul> <p>I've now got what looks like 2 sets that are drifting out of sync on the same latptop. </p><p><br> thanks for any help. </p>",mac-os;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-780;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",alastair.newson

I do see a folder in which these should be, but when I try to import the bookmarks it shows me an error (photo 1). Also trying to restore to previous dates shows errors (same result as photo 1). </p><p>So instead of importing them I try to do the long work around of putting them all back in place. However, when I try to bookmark webpages again, they are not shown in the bookmarks at the top of my browser (photo 2) or in the bookmarks when I open the menu (photo 3) </p><p>My question: How do I restore my old passwords and bookmarks? And how can I get bookmarks at the top of my screen again? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",marcoth

Confetti pouring down the screen.... The incentive was a *chance* to get a prize. So I proceeded cautiously and answered a few questions that seemed legit. Then, I won a prize... A Samsung Galaxy said to be valued at $1100 for $1. I was not on a page at https://easemastereight-15.life/....  Even more cautiously and suspicious moved forward using the click here, and it redirected to a different site, where of course they wanted a credit card to pay for the $1. At this point I bailed, especially because I was offered the same deal a year ago.  What I want to do now is to alert Mozilla about this, and after a lot of searching, this form was the only way I could find. If anyone knows how to route this to the people who should investigate this, please do it. Meanwhile we should all remember that if it looks too good to be true, it almost certainly is. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-850;,firefox,other,en-US,1393226;1393237;,clobban
