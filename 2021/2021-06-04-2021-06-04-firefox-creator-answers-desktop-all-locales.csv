Talán már több mint másfél évtizede használom a Mozilla termékeit, több platformon/operációs rendszeren (jelenleg win10). Ez a frissítés egy hatalmas csalódás, tekintettel arra, hogy ez az új design, illetve struktúrája a felhasználói felületnek (lapfülek elhelyezkedése, stb.) nem képezi integráns részét az operációs rendszerek felhasználói felületének. Nem tudom ki volt az a munkájához (ergonomia, felhasználhatóság) nem értő, aki ezt engedélyezte. Hogy juthat valakinek eszébe, egy olyan böngészőt ráerőltetni a felhasználókra, ami teljesen más logika alapján kezeli a lapokat, menüket funkciókat elrendezését tekintve, mint az az operációs rendszer amin használják. Lehet hogy a GTK környezetben linuxon ez még nagyjából elmegy, de windowson egy agyrém. miért kell szívatni a felhasználót? miért kell egy a rendszerbe nem illeszkedő designt néznem egész nap? Igen irritáló. Mi ez a szar? Ez egy böngésző, munkaeszköz, stb nem egy idióta játék, amit tökmindegy milyenre faragnak, mert úgy is csak játék és legtöbbször fullscreenben futtatják. Nekem olyan böngészőre lenne szükségem, ami integráns külsőt, és funkció/menü rendszert képez azzal a környezettel, ami a GUI-t jellemzi az adott operációs rendszeren, hogy az egységesítés hatékonyabbá tegye az életet. Hatalmas csalódást okoztak. Ez így használhatatlan szar (nem tudok finomabban fogalmazni, mert sokkal durvábbra gondolok mint amit ide írtam) valószínűleg az alapítványnál pár embernek más munka után kéne néznie. Kérdésem, hogy hogyan lehetne visszaváltani a régi felhasználói felületre, ami egységes egészet képezett a windowséval. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,hu,"",szabojpeter

I also noticed that if I click on a link a single tab appears down there and if I click a link in that page a new tab appears (the previous one disappears) and I can keep doing that. As I click the ""X"" on each to close it the one just before it reappears at the bottom of the page. I share all of this because it may offer clues. I, however, remain clueless.

It also means I cannot quickly switch to the desired tabs muting and unmuting as I prefer.  </p><p>While this is a specific problem which I hope you can solve readily, it is a part of a pattern I have seen over some of the more recent updates, where useful features are removed in favor of aesthetics.
