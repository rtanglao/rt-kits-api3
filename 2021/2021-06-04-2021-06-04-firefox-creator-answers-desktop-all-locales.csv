I originally set it NOT to auto update, but for whatever reason that changed. My bookmarks and passwords are just gone... is there any way I can get them back? This is a catastrophe...  From 89 to 88 on mac. OSX 10.13.6 - No time machine. Thanks for any advice - This is devastating for all my work stuff. I can't even begin to explain... Not sure why it decided to auto update all of a sudden either. </p>",mac-os;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-880;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",arris88
