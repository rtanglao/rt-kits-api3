My other installed theme options are light, dark, and alpenglow.  Actually the light theme looks like the system theme which states ""follow the operating system settings for buttons, menus, windows.""  I can make no sense of that looking a my display  settings.  Dark is much too dark, and alpenglow resembles an unappealing fruit salad.  I have no time to be creative as another theme option that's offered.  Any idea how I can revert to default 1.1?

The problem is as follows: 1. Firefox installs an update in the background while still in use. 2. I open a new tab. 3. That's it. After an update finishes downloading, new tabs refuse to open, some citing a crash (if opened by active tabs, such as YouTube), most stating the browser needs to restart. It is not a networking problem, since already active tabs function normally, even YouTube playlists function as intended (despite the fact that they nominally refresh the entire page); and, as mentioned, the browser itself says it needs to restart. Q1: Is this intended behaviour? If so, Q2a: what purpose does it serve? If not, Q2b: what causes it? Additionally, after an update, Firefox (again, only for Linux) has rendering problems when first booted up, causing tiling, and needing Alt+f4 to close. I may revisit this issue later in a separate thread. </p>",desktop;tabs;ubuntu;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1417798;,trabantkedvelo

I use TranslucentTB to make my taskbar transparent both on my desktop and start screen and so if my Firefox is full-screen I get a disgusting line overlapping with my taskbar. The line even stays visible if Firefox is in full-screen, and I open up my Windows's start screen as shown in second picture.

And then some extensions reinstalled themselves automatically and the problem came back. So I did that a couple more times to replicate, and yes, if I do a refresh, I can make the colored box problem go away until whatever is happening where these extensions reinstall themselves. I've tried completely removing them and restarting my computer, and that doesn't make the colored box problem go away. I tried renaming the Firefox folder in Program Files and reinstalling Firefox and I still ended up with all of my bookmarks and settings and extensions, so that didn't help. </li></ul> <p>I'm open to any suggestions. Right now I'm thinking it might not even be an extension issue, but some other setting that's getting imported at the same time as these extensions are reinstalling themselves, which is why it doesn't help that I disable/remove them.

Talán már több mint másfél évtizede használom a Mozilla termékeit, több platformon/operációs rendszeren (jelenleg win10). Ez a frissítés egy hatalmas csalódás, tekintettel arra, hogy ez az új design, illetve struktúrája a felhasználói felületnek (lapfülek elhelyezkedése, stb.) nem képezi integráns részét az operációs rendszerek felhasználói felületének. Nem tudom ki volt az a munkájához (ergonomia, felhasználhatóság) nem értő, aki ezt engedélyezte. Hogy juthat valakinek eszébe, egy olyan böngészőt ráerőltetni a felhasználókra, ami teljesen más logika alapján kezeli a lapokat, menüket funkciókat elrendezését tekintve, mint az az operációs rendszer amin használják. Lehet hogy a GTK környezetben linuxon ez még nagyjából elmegy, de windowson egy agyrém. miért kell szívatni a felhasználót? miért kell egy a rendszerbe nem illeszkedő designt néznem egész nap? Igen irritáló. Mi ez a szar? Ez egy böngésző, munkaeszköz, stb nem egy idióta játék, amit tökmindegy milyenre faragnak, mert úgy is csak játék és legtöbbször fullscreenben futtatják. Nekem olyan böngészőre lenne szükségem, ami integráns külsőt, és funkció/menü rendszert képez azzal a környezettel, ami a GUI-t jellemzi az adott operációs rendszeren, hogy az egységesítés hatékonyabbá tegye az életet. Hatalmas csalódást okoztak. Ez így használhatatlan szar (nem tudok finomabban fogalmazni, mert sokkal durvábbra gondolok mint amit ide írtam) valószínűleg az alapítványnál pár embernek más munka után kéne néznie. Kérdésem, hogy hogyan lehetne visszaváltani a régi felhasználói felületre, ami egységes egészet képezett a windowséval. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,hu,"",szabojpeter

There are no tabs there - clicking in the space does nothing. As I sought a fix for hours by disabling all add ons etc I did notice that when I opened ""Customize Toolbar"" that the tabs appear at the bottom of the page... I also noticed that if I click on a link a single tab appears down there and if I click a link in that page a new tab appears (the previous one disappears) and I can keep doing that. As I click the ""X"" on each to close it the one just before it reappears at the bottom of the page. I share all of this because it may offer clues. I, however, remain clueless.

The bookmark list is now vertically spaced much wider so I have to scroll up and down the list rather than point and click.   The tabs at the top of the screen which used to be easy to differentiate now blur into one.   Worse still there was no easy way to back out this upgrade while I found a workaround to correct these problems?   I have spent a couple of hours now, researching, exporting bookmarks, uninstalling Firefox, restarting computer, re-installing the old version (v88), Importing bookmarks, finding the icons that were on the bookmarks have disappeared, kicking the cat (metaphorically speaking), reinstalling the new tab add-in, making sue auto update is OFF.  Basically a huge pain. </p><p>Is there no easy way to rollback updates? especially when the user interface changes are so invasive? </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1417556;,chris388
