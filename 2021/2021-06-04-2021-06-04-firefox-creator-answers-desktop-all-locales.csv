This means if multiple tabs are playing I have to search all the tabs individually. It also means I cannot quickly switch to the desired tabs muting and unmuting as I prefer.  </p><p>While this is a specific problem which I hope you can solve readily, it is a part of a pattern I have seen over some of the more recent updates, where useful features are removed in favor of aesthetics.
