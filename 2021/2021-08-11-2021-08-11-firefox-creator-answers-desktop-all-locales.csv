While customizing the toolbar, the firefox account icon was dragged out of the firefox window instead of back into the extra toolbar icon area that pops up when customizing the toolbar. This seems to have killed the firefox account icon. I have tried reinstalling firefox, even deleting all the the firefox and mozilla settings but the firefox account icon does not come back. </p><p>On other machines (mostly VMs) the firefox account icon shows right up when using the firefox sync feature to configure firefox on a new installation. </p><p>Can I get the firefox account icon back somehow? </p>",desktop;customize;firefox-900;firefox-9002;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",tehringo+firefox

Can't tell what is on or off with 91.0!,"<p>None of the boxes in my setting are changing when I click on them. I have never had this problem before, and only since the 91.0 update today. I can't see what I've turned on or off, and it took me more than 20 minutes of experimenting to discover which choice I accidentally checked when my cat jumped onto my arm (the mouse button clicked before he stepped on the scroll wheel). I can't adjust anything if I can't see which choices I'm making, or which I don't think need to be changed. I did a fresh reinstall after, but having the same problem. The image was taken afterward. In it, I have tried to activate three choices. Can you tell me which ones? I can't tell, because none of the boxes have changed. And where did my separate tabs go? Having inactive tabs not separated, while the active tab is just floating there - literally, it is not just a floating sign acting as a tab - is seriously distracting. Is there a way to change this to, at the very least, make the inactive tabs separate again so the active one isn't such an independent eyesore? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,customize,en-US,1433957;1433958;1433960;1433961;1433962;,Bing1952

While I can see a symbol there is nothing to click on that is visible but clicking above the audio symbol on pure white will turn the audio for the video on. There is no slider visible. If I click on a video to make it  larger there is not minimize button in the upper left like there used to be. This is entirely broken. I don't want to downgrade as it is my understanding I would have to create a new account and then try to resync my other devices. I will have to abandon FF  if this isn't fixed or until I learn how to fix this. I tried turning strict privacy off to no avail and changing the them to no effect. </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;firefox-910;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",santa
