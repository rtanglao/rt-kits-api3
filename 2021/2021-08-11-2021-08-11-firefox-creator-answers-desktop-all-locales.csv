The latest version of Firefox 91.0 (20210804193234) still has not fixed this problem.  This is on a windows 10.

1346610,2021-08-10 17:14:23 -0700,2021-08-10 17:14:23 -0700,FF 91 white background with no borders,"<p>After FF 91 installed when I go to something like the Watch page on Facebook, there is no border around content to define it and as a result (?) on my videos the controls such as the Audio button is nearly invisible off to the side of the content. While I can see a symbol there is nothing to click on that is visible but clicking above the audio symbol on pure white will turn the audio for the video on. There is no slider visible. If I click on a video to make it  larger there is not minimize button in the upper left like there used to be. This is entirely broken. I don't want to downgrade as it is my understanding I would have to create a new account and then try to resync my other devices. I will have to abandon FF  if this isn't fixed or until I learn how to fix this. I tried turning strict privacy off to no avail and changing the them to no effect. </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;firefox-910;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",santa
