I went and used the workaround. The workaround is now Dead. Here are my thoughts on the current design (which, for full clearance, I find useless and abhorrent) </p><p>1. Tab separation - not clear. There is no clear way to differentiate tabs from each other without hovering over them. I preferred the old look for this. 2. Tab size - Too tall. I don't need that many pixels of useless empty space. I preferred the old look for this. 3. Pinned tab size - Too much empty space. They now take more space than they used to. I had them pinned for a reason, and may now have to unpin some. Preferred old design for this. 4. Rounded corners - I will probably get used to this, but I do not like it. Again, preferred the old design for this. 5. Tab ""scrolling speed"" - Too fast/too many tabs at one. Two/three was enough for me. I will probably get used to this, but still prefer old design. 6. Can't close a tab without selecting it - While sometimes I accidentally closed a tab, it was less of a problem than being unable to close a tab without navigating to it. Unnecessary time sink. </p><p>Overall - old design is better. I've seen statements of ""better tabs"" or whatever, but those statements don't change the fact that workflow is slowed, and everything feels floaty and spacey.  </p><p>'What am I asking for?' Very simple. Options. Allow users to choose their preference without difficult workarounds involving code and actually needing to know how to do complicated things like that. A lot of people like the old look. I doubt it to be impossible to offer those as selectable options. That way you, Firefox, can still offer the new tab look, but also please those who do not want it, are unable to use it, or whatever reason a user might have for reverting back to that old look. </p><p>Do not force users into a ""new, sleek, modern"" look. It may be ""sleek"", but it is nigh unusable to some. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1434057;1434064;1434074;,OnlyHereForOneQuestion
