A long time ago (like years at this point) I used a previous email address. I've since changed the main email and the back up email to different ones. I'm trying to sign in and it sends an email to my main email. I get the email, use the code, but it jumps to ""incorrect password"" and displays the very, very old email as the account I'm attempting to login to.  </p><p>I've tried clicking on ""use a different account"" but it just restarts the entire process. I also tried to add a recovery key but it just keeps saying ""try again in 15 minutes"" even though I tried about 5 hours apart. I don't know why my sync still thinks I'm using an old email address when I've had it changed for years. This has happened before but I was always able to somehow get in and sign in.  </p><p>Is there some way I can fix this? </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",globalmeg
