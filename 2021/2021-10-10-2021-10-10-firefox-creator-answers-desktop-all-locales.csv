I have a 1Gbs FTTH connection. In practice, often, when I open Facebook the images are not loaded correctly and the loading wheel of the browser tab rotates indefinitely for a few minutes and then stops without loading anything ... Instead of the loaded image, there are only white boxes with writing describing what the image should represent. I enclose example.  I have already tried everything to try to solve. First of all, since yesterday I switched to Windows 11 (installed after formatting everything!) But the problem persists! Before I had windows 10 and I had done several tests to try to solve ... Uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox several times, never had add-ons, disabled hardware acceleration from the browser, updated all drivers from GPU to CPU etc., changed DNS directly from the router with those of Google. I don't know what to try anymore. I repeat that I have this problem only with Firefox while with Edge it works perfectly. I have no more ideas to try to solve. Can someone help me?

This could be enhanced by having a system of whitelist/blacklist instead. And this feature would actually make more sense than using a private window. </p><p>Another way would be to have this feature on per container, instead of per website, than would work well too. </p><p>People have different activities, and some requires useful plugins, that are very specific. I mean Keepass's add-on (for example) is useful everywhere, but many add-ons are related to one activity at a time. </p><p>For example, if I'm a marketer and want to analyze website, I'll use add-ons for having stats on metadata or keywords or even real time reports from Alexa or from AliExpress, etc... </p><p>But when I'm reading my email, I'm not happy those add-ons can see my data. </p><p>That would be tedious to disable all those plugins every time I change activity, especially since we are productive humans so obviously we need to alternate those activities doing multitask all the time. </p><p>And the private window option is not flexible enough for that kind of multitasking, when containers are. </p><p>I hope this helps everyone understand clearly why I think my request is not only a real user need, but also currently a flaw in users privacy since most people will not trade the comfort of their add-ons for some privacy concern they don't always understand... </p><p>I know this is some kind of feature request more than ask for help, but <a href=""https://qsurvey.mozilla.com/s3/FirefoxInput/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://qsurvey.mozilla.com/s3/FirefoxInput/</a> is out of service so I don't know where to address my concern here. </p><p>Thanks for helping me pushing this idea forward. </p>",linux;desktop;add-ons;privacy-and-security_1;escalate;hardquestion;firefox-780;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1449829;1449849;,mozilla65
