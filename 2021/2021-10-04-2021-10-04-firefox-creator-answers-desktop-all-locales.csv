It happens every once in a while with me being mindless, but would be nice QoL when its a loaded webpage from an app on the phone I then send to the computer that gets lost and has no form of history. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-920;firefox-9201;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",jacobschlimmer

I'm using also Chrome and Opera browsers and this is Firefox-issue only. Changing resolution does not work, it going back to 4K immediately. My PC is capable only for 1080p and my internet connection is not fast enough either. This makes Firefox mostly useless for watching Youtube because most new vids are 4K. I have looked at the settings from both Youtube and Firefox and I can't see anything wrong there. </p>",desktop;other;windows-81;firefox-920;firefox-9201;,firefox,other,fi,"",jyrimtlaitinen
