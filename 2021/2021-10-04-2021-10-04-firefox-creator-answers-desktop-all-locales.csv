Then I went to Firefox where I wanted to search for a particular piece of text in a webpage. When I clicked command-F the text search box opened, but the search term I'd input in mail was already there. (I didn't copy and paste at any stage in this). Concerned I went back to mail and changed the search term. Returning to Firefox the search term was also updated there.  I can think of no reason why a search term from Mail would be passed to Firefox so I'm concerned my Mac has been hacked in some way.

I am also a Supporter and have been for many years. I love using Firefox! </p><p>I am not by any means a techie, so all I am able to do is give you certain examples of what I have experienced and sadly (for me), I have been forced to use other browsers.  </p><p>I have a MacBook Pro 16"" 2020 with the latest software Updates.  </p><p>I use Gmail for all my email and have done so for the pst 20 years. I have recently noticed that when I am replying to Gmail recipients using Firefox, there is a noticeable delay when typing each letter of the words. I am not that quick as a typist, but it is infuriating and distracting as the error appears, I correct it, and then the corrected word also appears. In other words, the delay is so long the word appears twice until I delete one of the words which now appears twice. I was advised to try a browser other than Firefox and I did this. The delays disappear when I switch to Google Chrome and with Safari.  </p><p>I also subscribe to several news media editions most mornings. These editions also have Premium content articles which I used to be able to read without having to login to each premium article I wanted to read. These editions come from a newspaper group in South Africa which is a PLC. I read most morning newspapers from the UK, which is where I used to live and now recently from South Africa. The name of the Group is Arena Holdings and they own and publish most of the newspapers in South Africa. </p><p>I have been in contact with their IT department for the past two months, and after extensive investigation, they asked what browser I was using. It was of course Firefox. I was asked to change my browser to either Chrome or Safari and when I tried Chrome and Safari, the problem was solved.  </p><p>Here I am as a last resort appealing to you for assistance. I don't want to leave Firefox, but the odds are not in my favour.  </p><p>I have no idea if this is an iOS problem, an Apple problem or the providers. I was saddened to discover that when I used Chrome and Safari, the problems I experienced, which are detailed above, disappeared.  </p><p>Please help me with what seems to be a compatibility issue problem. I do not want to end my long association   with Firefox. </p><p>With sincere thanks  </p><p><br> Edward Kahn </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",tedkahn
