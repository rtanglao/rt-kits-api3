Unfortunately this Mega file hosting web site downloads the file into a temporary location through the browser instead of downloading it like a normal download. </p><p>Anyways, while I was downloading, at 54% the download got interrupted saying transfer quota exceeded and I need to wait 4 hours to continue download again. and my girlfriend didn't know this so she thought my download already completed and deleted the file :( After 4 hours of waiting I was unable to continue the download since the file is no longer avaliable anymore :/ </p><p>Now my question is, where this 1.5 GB file gone? I have already checked %AppData%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\myprofile\storage\default\https+++<a href=""http://mega.co.nz"" rel=""nofollow"">mega.co.nz</a> but it's not there, the folder size is 102 KB. I checked %AppData%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\myprofile\storage\temporary too but that folder is completely empty. Also checked AppData\Local\Temp as well but it's not there either. The size of my Temp folder is just 10 MB. </p><p>While I was searching this, I saw some people saying (if I understood correct) the temporary download location of Mega isn't in hard drive, but in the RAM instead. I want to ask can anyone confirm is this actually true? and if so what happens to that space in RAM when download interrupts like this? Does it delete it from RAM automatically when I close Firefox? </p><p>Can anyone with knowledge in this regard please help me with this problem :( I am on SSD and already have a very few space left and I don't want to clutter my SSD with 1.5 GB unusuable file :(( Neither want 1.5 GB space got occupied in my RAM :(( </p><p>Thank you so very much in advance. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-940;firefox-9402;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",partycat35

Also do not track only works if the host website supports it as far as i know. To get this to an end, the question is 1, how to make us of do not track policies, 2 how can i make my fingerprint less unique?
