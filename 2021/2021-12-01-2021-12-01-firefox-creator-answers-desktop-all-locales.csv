This is to organize existing bookmarks under new categories that help in finding them more easily. </p><p>Until some time ago, I used the Library (Ctrl + Shift + O) to first <strong>select a batch of bookmarks</strong> (whether or not filtered after an existing tag or another criterion); and typed the new tag in the field Tags: at the bottom of the Library dialogue window.  If I had to change the tag, I simply wrote the new one; the old one was replaced.  If I had to add a tag, I could repeat the old tag and add the new one. </p><p>Now, instead, my new tag is <strong>appended</strong> to each and every bookmark in the batch. This makes it impossible to delete the old tags, <strong>unless you do it one at a time</strong>. Both doing and undoing become unwieldy when you have tens or hundreds of bookmarks. Also, it defeats the purpose of streamlining, because the number of tags grows. </p><p>So, there is a difference in behavior between editing the tag of a single bookmark and the tag of a batch of bookmark. Is this intended? If so, how to work around that? If not, I presume this is bug. </p>",linux;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-940;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",Xavierstuvw

After several minutes of using pages start be loading very slow. Loading slowness increases until it becomes blocked continuously. Reload button has no effect. I tried everything from here: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-cant-load-websites-other-browsers-can"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-cant-load-websites-other-browsers-can</a>    - No effect. </p><p>Work around done: When windows is loading in Safe Mode the problem disappeared.  If I disable Windows Defender Firewall the  the problem disappear and appear after firewall enabling again in several minutes (same as after FF restarting) When I go to &lt;current network settings&gt; and switch Network Profile from Public to Private or from Private to Public the problem disappear but goes back just in several minutes (same as after FF restarting). Windows 10 Restorehealth  has no effect, and reports that everything is OK with system files (DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth ) The most strange thing Windows 10 In-place Upgrade has no effect. </p> <hr> <p>I found out the core of problem is that Windows Firewall is blocking FF internal interprocess communication on local TCP ports. Yes, you would say it is not possible and firewall doesn't affect local port communication but in my case it is a fact. I used the ProcessMonitor from Windows Sysinternals, and Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security log. Screenshots shows this fact. On first two lines from  Firewall log you see a Local Port Communication blocking, on ports 1401 and 1400. Next Screenshot from ProcessMonitor shows (see blue colored lines) that it was exactly FF communication, where I was trying to reload a page several times. </p><p>Any ideas what to do with it?
