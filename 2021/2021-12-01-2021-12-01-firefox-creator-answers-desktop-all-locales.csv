When i visit <a href=""http://firstpartysimulator.org"" rel=""nofollow"">firstpartysimulator.org</a> and complete the test, the result claims i do have a decent protection against tracking while my ""software"" is not checking for ""do not track policies"". By software im not sure if this is ment to be the operatingsystem or the browser, firefox. The result also shows i do have a nearly unique fingerprint. If i remove one of my current extensions -&gt; canvas blocker, i do have a unique fingerprint. This is not good as i see it. </p><p>How can i make firefox (or windows if so) check for do not track policies? I noticed the duckduckgo addon claims to always check for do not track policies but im not sure if i really need this extension. Also do not track only works if the host website supports it as far as i know. To get this to an end, the question is 1, how to make us of do not track policies, 2 how can i make my fingerprint less unique? I only changed a couple settings in about:config and use a total of 3 browser extensions, this shouldnt be to much unique, or? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Firefox_Beginner

Now all *.pdf files have Firefox icons and open as .html pages, I think! Seen some solutions, but for older versions of windows and followed procedure: go to Adobe, Edit, Preferences, General, 'Select Default PDF Handler', as dialog Does not have Adobe Reader XI, step two was Change to Adobe Reader DC, clicked continue, but NO Windows Configuration Screen appears. Using Version 94.0.2 (64bit) with Windows 10.  Also, help answer said not necessarily a Firefox problem, also within Adobe Reader. Not comfortable with changes to be made in the registry.
