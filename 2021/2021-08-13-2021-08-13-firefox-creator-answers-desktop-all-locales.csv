They're still functioning, but the backgrounds aren't loading in right and that makes navigating them a little tedious (e.g: floating my mouse around where I think navigational buttons are until the hovertext pops up because the lack of backgrounds are hiding the buttons). It looks kind of what I'd imagine the outline of a website would before the background and images loaded in. I've tried disabling/resetting Firefox add-ons/extensions, refreshing Firefox, restarting Firefox, uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox, I've even restarted my computer a couple times, but nothing seems to help. I've also tried seeing if it was a problem on the websites' end, but I've opened them on safari and it has no problem loading any of them. Has someone else experienced something like this? </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;firefox-910;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",pcoimbrasanabria

My question arises from the following experience.  </p><p>I connected to a website and the Firefox browser didn't recognize the certificate that the website provided. The following message then popped up: "" Potential Security Risk Ahead. "" and the user was provided a button to ""Accept the Risk and Continue"", adding this unsafe website into the exception site list. I think that this is quite insecure. Is it possible that in the future Firefox won't support the button to ""Accept the Risk and Continue"" to unsafe websites and cease supporting the exception site list to the user? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",z526537

1346900,2021-08-12 18:01:02 -0700,2021-08-12 18:01:02 -0700,Amazon customer images,"<p>Today when I started up, I got a notice from Mozilla about a 'new' feature for Pocket.  I already use Pocket frequently, so I figured, why not?  I said 'OK"" (or whatever it was, it was too fast to really remember).  Then it wanted to sign me in using what I suppose is my Firefox login (using my Google credential).  Well, when I was logged in, I realized the my Google credentials are not what I used to sign into Pocket, since there were no saved items.  So, I logged out, and then logged in using my original credentials.  Everything was there.  OK.  Or so I thought. Now, when I go to Amazon pages, I cannot view the customer images in the reviews.  If I click on one, I get a very tiny popup that I can't read (because the full text cannot be displayed in this tiny box).  If I click on the popup, all I get is an 'x' to close the box.  Then if I click on that, the popup disappears and I still can't view the customer images. I don't know how those two could be related, but your Pocket link is the only thing that has changed in this regard.  I used to have the Pocket Add In that I used, but that has disappeared from my toolbar.  I want to go back to my old add in.  And I want to be able to view the customer images on Amazon. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,"",GaijinSue1
