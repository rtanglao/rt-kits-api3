I shouldn't have to append userChrome.css with code copy-pasted from some forum. And this is to say nothing of the users that are inexperienced enough or unwilling to make such changes. Most just switch to Chrome. Sure, some of it is personal preference. ""Do you like large tabs or small tabs? Do you like square tabs or rounded tabs?""

I already use Pocket frequently, so I figured, why not?  I said 'OK"" (or whatever it was, it was too fast to really remember).  Then it wanted to sign me in using what I suppose is my Firefox login (using my Google credential).  Well, when I was logged in, I realized the my Google credentials are not what I used to sign into Pocket, since there were no saved items.  So, I logged out, and then logged in using my original credentials.  Everything was there.  OK.  Or so I thought. Now, when I go to Amazon pages, I cannot view the customer images in the reviews.  If I click on one, I get a very tiny popup that I can't read (because the full text cannot be displayed in this tiny box).  If I click on the popup, all I get is an 'x' to close the box.  Then if I click on that, the popup disappears and I still can't view the customer images. I don't know how those two could be related, but your Pocket link is the only thing that has changed in this regard.  I used to have the Pocket Add In that I used, but that has disappeared from my toolbar.  I want to go back to my old add in.  And I want to be able to view the customer images on Amazon. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,"",GaijinSue1
