The system encountered a problem (#001)""). The problem usually seems to occur for periods of many minutes, with occasional gaps where the sites work properly. Also, it seems to be site-specific: sometimes it will load <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> normally while Gmail is still having problems. This is really frustrating, I'd like to use Firefox for all my browsing but I also need to use Google services regularly and that doesn't work if Firefox won't load them properly most of the time. </p><p>I'm pretty confident it's a problem with Firefox itself, and not with my network or computer, because I get the same issue across multiple Firefox installations and versions (Firefox 90 and 91 on Windows 10, and Firefox 78.10.0esr and 90 on Linux), and while the problem is happening I can access the same sites successfully from a different browser on the same computer (Chrome or Edge). I've tried refreshing my Firefox profile, working in a private browsing window and using a completely new profile, but the problem still occurs. I've also made sure I'm using ""Standard"" protection in Firefox's security settings and disabled Enhanced Tracking Protection for the sites I'm trying to access. </p><p>I've tried to look at what's going on using Firefox's Network Monitor, and the key thing that seems to happen when this problem occurs is that one or more network requests to a google address (<a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a>, <a href=""http://mail.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.google.com</a> or <a href=""http://ssl.gstatic.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ssl.gstatic.com</a>) appear with ""0 B"" in both the Transferred and Size columns (see screenshot attached). Sometimes the failed network request has a simple padlock icon as in the screenshot, and sometimes a red error symbol with mouseover text that says a security error prevented the resource being loaded. There's also occasionally an error message in the Console: ""A ServiceWorker passed a promise to FetchEvent.respondWith() that rejected with 'TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource.'."". Removing the relevant service workers in about:serviceworkers doesn't make any difference. On Linux, I've tried using tcpdump to check the actual network traffic and it looks like nothing is actually sent across the network for these requests, so whatever the problem is seems to be happening inside Firefox itself. </p><p>Ticking the ""Disable Cache"" box in the network monitor doesn't help. If I manually resend the same request using the menu in the network monitor, a normal response is received (but the content is not actually displayed in the browser).  </p><p>It looks to me like some kind of caching or security problem, where Firefox somehow gets in a state where some network requests are blocked or fail to load from a cache, but after a while whatever is causing the problem is cleared and it works normally for a minute or two before the problem recurs. I would simply report this as a bug on Bugzilla, but I can't offer steps for anyone else to reproduce the problem because it only happens when I'm logged into my own Google account. I've run out of ideas for how to diagnose or fix this. Can someone suggest anything else I should try?

With every update I am sent to google various solutions posted by other users trying to remedy problems caused by the latest update.  I shouldn't have to dive into about:config every time the FF developers decide to play with the source code.  I shouldn't have to install UI addons to maintain intuitive workflow.  I shouldn't have to append userChrome.css with code copy-pasted from some forum. And this is to say nothing of the users that are inexperienced enough or unwilling to make such changes. Most just switch to Chrome. Sure, some of it is personal preference. ""Do you like large tabs or small tabs? Do you like square tabs or rounded tabs?""  But when I LITERALLY CANT READ THEM, that's not something ANY user should have to google or fix on their end. That is the developers dropping the ball.  Fix this. Firefox developers, YOU fix this.

Well, when I was logged in, I realized the my Google credentials are not what I used to sign into Pocket, since there were no saved items.  So, I logged out, and then logged in using my original credentials.  Everything was there.  OK.  Or so I thought. Now, when I go to Amazon pages, I cannot view the customer images in the reviews.  If I click on one, I get a very tiny popup that I can't read (because the full text cannot be displayed in this tiny box).  If I click on the popup, all I get is an 'x' to close the box.  Then if I click on that, the popup disappears and I still can't view the customer images.

I used to have the Pocket Add In that I used, but that has disappeared from my toolbar.  I want to go back to my old add in.
