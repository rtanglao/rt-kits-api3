I already use Pocket frequently, so I figured, why not?  I said 'OK"" (or whatever it was, it was too fast to really remember).  Then it wanted to sign me in using what I suppose is my Firefox login (using my Google credential).  Well, when I was logged in, I realized the my Google credentials are not what I used to sign into Pocket, since there were no saved items.  So, I logged out, and then logged in using my original credentials.  Everything was there.  OK.  Or so I thought. Now, when I go to Amazon pages, I cannot view the customer images in the reviews.  If I click on one, I get a very tiny popup that I can't read (because the full text cannot be displayed in this tiny box).  If I click on the popup, all I get is an 'x' to close the box.  Then if I click on that, the popup disappears and I still can't view the customer images. I don't know how those two could be related, but your Pocket link is the only thing that has changed in this regard.  I used to have the Pocket Add In that I used, but that has disappeared from my toolbar.  I want to go back to my old add in.  And I want to be able to view the customer images on Amazon. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,"",GaijinSue1
