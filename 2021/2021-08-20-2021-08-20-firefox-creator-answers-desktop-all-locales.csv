Right now I prefer to open it in a tab and then switch tabs while it loads, then switch back when it is finished loading. </p><p>This may work to some extent, but I think even when I change back to that tab it takes Firefox some time to load up the web content in some way and display it, even though the page is not still loading over the internet. </p><p>Is there some way I can get the page in that tab loaded actively in the background so that when I switch to it it's completely ready to go, as if it had just been open the whole time? There must be some Firefox setting or command to trick Firefox in a way that that tab is open and active and should be treated as such. </p><p>Thanks very much, Julius </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",julkhami
