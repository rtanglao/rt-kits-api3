On most, it remains a light grey, but on some sites, most notably Youtube, it has turned a darker color, with the scrollbar turning outright <em>black</em> on videos now from Youtube, but only if I'm not signed in. Meanwhile if I'm signed in, it's a darker shade of gray, but not outright black. Does anyone know what's causing this? I will include screenshots, with the scrollbars circled. The first shows the scrollbar in its normal coloration, and the following three showing Youtube, first on its main page, then one with me signed in, another with me signed out, growing progressively darker.  </p><p>Is this a glitch, or something to do with their coding, or what? If someone can answer this, I'd love to know what I'm dealing with here. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-910;firefox-9101;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Marc7

Many sites today uses your e-mail addy for its name. When Firefox sees this it will ask should it update the pw. It doesnt seem to realize that this name is used across many sites.

This is the repair.
