I see other people have had a similar issue and the answer seems to be along the lines that the font size is a universal and that there is some, somewhat complicated, workaround. But I ain't done nothing! They have just shrunk! What gives and how to I get them back to a readable size please? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",tonyrutt1

Solo la puedo quitar si selecciono algun texto pero si le doy a reproducir el video de nuevo vuelve a aparecer. </p><p>No afecta el funcionamiento de youtube y hasta donde se no aparece en otras paginas de videos, pero es lo suficientemente molesta como para darme un toc y hacer que deje de querer ver videos. </p><p>Intente iniciar en modo seguro para ver si era algun tema o complemento y funciono un rato pero despues simplemente volvio a aparecer (sin salir del modo seguro ni cambiando nada). Tambien intente borrando y reinstalando todo pero la linea sigue apareciendo y me es demasiado molesta aaaaaaaaaaa </p><p>En la imagen medio que se alcanza a ver, welp </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,other,es,"",justgray.dagr

Many sites today uses your e-mail addy for its name. When Firefox sees this it will ask should it update the pw. It doesnt seem to realize that this name is used across many sites. If someone mistakenly updates the pw, you wont know until you log in, which site had its PW mistakenly updated.  </p><p>How do you disable / fix this feature. </p><p>There is also a auto fill in that seem to only rely on the site. This is the repair. If it were to be possible to make firefox use the sites info, it should alleviate the problem of mistaking every email address name on a sites password verification list as the same as evey-other. </p><p>Is there a switch for this feature. </p><p>thanx, </p><p>Jerome </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1436792;,romeemore

Right now I prefer to open it in a tab and then switch tabs while it loads, then switch back when it is finished loading. </p><p>This may work to some extent, but I think even when I change back to that tab it takes Firefox some time to load up the web content in some way and display it, even though the page is not still loading over the internet. </p><p>Is there some way I can get the page in that tab loaded actively in the background so that when I switch to it it's completely ready to go, as if it had just been open the whole time? There must be some Firefox setting or command to trick Firefox in a way that that tab is open and active and should be treated as such. </p><p>Thanks very much, Julius </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",julkhami

Installed downloaded file which has extension .dmg and Firefox does not appear as an .app.   Set it as the default browser and checked permissions. Whenever click a link I receive the error message ""The application cannot be opened"" 10826, see image below.
