Having a lot of grief with it. </p><p>For context; On most of our PCs the profile folder is NOT in the %APPDATA% folder. It lives on a different drive, typically drive F:\ </p><p>This allows us a lot of freedom to restore a users C:\ drive without messing up the Firefox profile, or losing recent information, for example. We do the same for Thunderbird and several other applications. </p><p>The profile.ini file does live in its default location and points to the relavant folder path=F:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\profiles\&lt;profilename&gt; IsRelative=0 </p><p>We backup a users PC with a comprehensive script which copies the profile.ini and Profiles folder. The group policy is also backed up, and in that policy we have set to use legacy profiles. </p><p>When we build a new PC for a user we restore those backups in the hope that the user will take up where they left off. For example, their browser history will be at the point is was when they left the PC.  </p><p>The whole process is pretty automated. However, with FF91esr I cannot get it to use the folder we backed up. It ignores what's in the profiles.ini file and creates a new profile in the default location, set's it as default and of course sets IsRelative=1. </p><p>I tried several combinations of things to try to stop this, but in the end the ONLY way I could get it to use the restored profile was to go to about:profiles, create a new profile, point it to the folder where the restored profile is located, restart using the new browser, then via about:profiles, delete the bogus profile (of course having set the restored profile as default).  </p><p>I'm not going to sit at 250 PCs doing that. It's crazy.  </p><p>How can I get FF to use the restored profile folder and stop it endlessly creating new profile folders? </p><p>So far I've only tested with clean installs of FF91esr, so this is not an issue with different versions of profiles. But I am concerned over what's going to happen when I update Firefox on a PC... </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",citizen1138x
