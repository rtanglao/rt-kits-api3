I just want to give advice to mozilla, why not make a cloud business or server for the mozilla blog website business?. </p><p>I mean, like bloggers from google products, or wordpress and so on.  Why not make it for mozilla, later it will sound cool ""Mozilla Blog"". </p><p>I will tell you a little, nowadays all technology is getting more sophisticated, where generally most people will look for information from a video, but there are still many who look for it from website sources, so, many people rely on their advertising through an ""Ads"".  Many also become ""Publishers"" to earn economic income in this day and age, survey facts are increasing.  But there are also many obstacles, especially regulations that are getting crazy from blog providers or advertising providers they work with. </p><p>For that why Mozilla does not just make a blog for all webmasters?.  My advice is to make it, but it's different in terms of the ads itself, it will be more interesting and of course Mozilla will be more successful.  believe me. </p><p>I give an example, create a cloud or server for a mozilla blog, when members or bloggers create a website they have a choice between free and premium.  (it's mandatory).  when they make an ad, they automatically become a ""Mozilla Ads Publisher"" and can immediately make money for them.  This is the point, surely many will switch to Mozilla, I guarantee it. </p><p>For the difference between a free mozilla blog and a premium mozilla blog, you know, the order 1-10 or something like that belongs to the premium one and below it belongs to the free one, and there is also a calculation about CPM/CPC or CPA, which is of course bigger for the Premium blog.  mozilla. </p><p>For the problem of income from advertising, he calls it ""Mozilla Advertiser"", I guarantee that there will be very many who want to work with mozilla ads, I guarantee that, given the uniqueness, ads will spread more quickly to existing webmasters because the regulations are not too strict  will produce a boom.  You just have to manage, the rules are minimal, minimal, but still for the clear and not cheating, that's all. </p><p><br> That's all my advice, considering technology is getting more advanced, why not just make it. The main key is: The more tightened the regulations, the more they will be abandoned. </p><p>If you need something for example about managing a blog server or blog cloud, I am ready to help. </p><pre>Thank you. </pre> <p><em>[Personal information removed by moderator.
