I basically don't store any security sensitive data on disk at all, not in clear nor encrypted.

I want to maximise screen real estate by getting rid of the address bar. Getting rid of tabs too would be great, because I can use option-cmd-arrow to tab through them. And I can close the window from the menu. I tried to follow this post: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1288181"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1288181</a> I did everything in that post, but the custom userChrome.css is having no effect. It's mentioned there that you have to use ""window.open(...)"" but I don't know what that means. The full screen function on MacOS is no good. It messes with my ability to swiftly switch between apps. So I cannot use it. </p><p>This is what I have in my userChrome.css file: </p> <ol><li>main-window[chromehidden*=""toolbar""] #nav-bar { </li></ol> <pre> visibility: collapse; </pre> <p>} </p><p>/*** Tighten up drop-down/context/popup menu spacing (8 Sep 2021) ***/ </p><p>menupopup:not(.in-menulist) &gt; menuitem, menupopup:not(.in-menulist) &gt; menu { </p><pre> padding-block: 4px !important; /* reduce to 3px, 2px, 1px or 0px as needed */  min-height: unset !important; /* v92.0 - for padding below 4px */ </pre> <p>} </p> <dl><dd>root { </dd></dl> <pre> --arrowpanel-menuitem-padding: 4px 8px !important; </pre> <p>} </p>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,1443229;,ian.robert.douglas
