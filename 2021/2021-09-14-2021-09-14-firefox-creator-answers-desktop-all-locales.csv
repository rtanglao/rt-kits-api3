I think now I'm making it even slower than it already is. What I did: - reinstalled 2 versions of FF (FF sre v78 latest, FF92 latest) (no plugins/extensions installed) - enabled/disabled DNS prefretch - enabled/disabled IPv6 - new profile created </p><p>Regardless of the above (and some other things) that I tried, in developer tools I see that each request is blocked for a couple of seconds. If a page has hundreds of requests, like amazon website, you can imagine that it takes minutes before the page completely loads. </p><p>In Safari on the other hand, the same website loads in a few seconds (bellow 8s lets say for amazon website). </p><p>Any idea how can I debug the issue? </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",danyel_a

If I download them I have to use an external converter to change them to a giff file so I get the animation. There is a add on to Firefox that was supposed to convert it ti giff - this did not work at all. I cannot understand why other browsers automatically download the file as webp and it is animated. Why is firefox so behind. </p><p>peter </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,other,en-US,1443262;,peter.wilshire
