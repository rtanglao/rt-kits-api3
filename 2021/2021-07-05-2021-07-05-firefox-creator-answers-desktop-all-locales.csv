When I first log into my PC and open Firefox, an MSN window opens up instead of my homepage.  </p><p>My homepage setting has not changed.  It's still <a href=""http://www.duckduckgo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.duckduckgo.com</a>.  If I close the Firefox and re-open it, my homepage appears.  As soon as I log in the next time; however, the first thing that opens is the MSN window again, and the cycle continues.   </p><p>I'm running Windows 10, which is up-to-date.  Firefox is up-to-date too.  I haven't done anything.  I haven't changed any settings or installed anything.   This happens with my wife's user account starting today as well.   </p><p>The closest archived topic I could find was the one below.   None of the recommendations work.  How do I stop this from happening?   </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1267862"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1267862</a> </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,"",eddiejoe67
