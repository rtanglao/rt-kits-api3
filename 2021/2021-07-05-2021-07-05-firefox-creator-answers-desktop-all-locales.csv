Not so long time ago I started noticing  that Firefox starts randomly ""freezing"" when switching between tabs (most often) and clicking on links within webpages. I put ""freezing"" in quotation marks, because it's not really frozen - I can click on the tab and interface would respond, but showing new tab wouldn't happen. I made a video and shared it on Google Drive. <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IBVhYru58l5xlfkz7GrvYuscWqCoC_gH/view?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IBVhYru58l5xlfkz7GrvYuscWqCoC_gH/view?usp=sharing</a> </p><p>Few things to consider: 1) Bug present in both latest stable and beta versions 2) Bug still present in completely clean installation of Firefox, without any add-ons and not signed-in in the account 3) I use v2ray and Qv2ray to bypass internet restrictions of a country where I am currently at. It seems that ""freezing"" has to do with poor internet connection.
