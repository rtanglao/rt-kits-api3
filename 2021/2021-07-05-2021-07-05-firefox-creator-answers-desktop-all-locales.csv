Often (not always) when I use google maps and click on ""Satellite"" view, the map tries to update a few times over 20-30 secs, goes black, and after a delay, a system error pops up saying ""Application firefox.exe has been blocked from accessing video hardware"".  If I tap F5 to refresh the google map tab, then it works fine until the next time I start FF. </p> <hr> <p>I found nothing current in FF community about this.  I just go finished refreshing Firefox (Windows Apps, FF Uninstall, Refresh) with no improvement.  I have an HP laptop about a year old, with all drivers up-to-date and Windows 10 up-to-date.  This problem started several months ago, after no problems like this during the first year with this laptop.  Suggestions? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",dale.gunns
