So if we want to copy a link, for example, we have to be careful to move the mouse before releasing the button or that link will immediately be opened in a new tab. </p><p>What some of us have done in the past is to create a userChrome.css file setting a top (and/or left) margin for that menu, which fixes the issue. </p><p>In the latest version(s?) of Firefox, this no longer works (but other userChrome.css rules I have set up continue to work), so I'm assuming that the ID of the context menus has been changed.

Thank you. I do wish, however, that you would eliminate the articles from the sources that require a subscription, such as The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. As an alternative, require them to allow viewing of any of their articles posted in Pocket. It is very frustrating to see the teaser, only to be denied access. I might add that I do subscribe to the NY Times Crossword app, but that gives me no access to other parts of the newspaper app. i know they are in business to make a profit, but there is a greed factor here too, in my opinion.

I use two monitors and I use lots of tabs. It has been easier for me until now to organize like that. I have 3 Firefox windows on my main monitor - one of them has like 10 tabs open. The other has 5. And the third one had maybe around 100. On the other monitor I have the last 4th Firefox window that has around 500 tabs open. I do this all the time where I get to a point in which I review them all in a day or two, filtrate thru the content I saved thru this method and after that reset the browser. So today I started this cleaning process with the 3rd window that had over 100 tabs. Was going great when suddenly I clicked the X button on the whole window and without any warning it instantly closed. I restarted the computer and nothing happened. All my information from over 100 tabs now gone forever and honestly this might sound funny to you but I'm literally having a panic attack right now having difficulties breathing. Before when it happened at times that I click the close button on these windows it always asked me a warning message if I want to close the window with these X tabs. No matter if the tabs are 10, 100 or 800. Always. No matter how many windows I have opened with different tabs in them. I immediately checked my settings and I see that ""Confirm before closing multiple tabs"" wasn't turned on which like NO WAY IN HELL did I go in the settings menu and turned that thing off. I haven't been in the settings menu since I installed firefox on this PC which was after I got my Windows OS like 2 years ago. And as I said I remember multiple times in these past months where I clicked the close button and it asks me if I want to close these X multiple tabs. So I dunno how that happened. Also I had the ""Open previous windows and tabs"" TURNED ON but that also didn't work apparently for some reason. So I'm not really sure what question I want to ask here, I guess I want some explanation why these things happened when clearly they shouldn't have and it wasn't my fault/mistake (from my point of view considering the facts). And also if there is any way to restore that window with the closed tabs. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-950;firefox-9501;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1467431;,d.kovachev8
