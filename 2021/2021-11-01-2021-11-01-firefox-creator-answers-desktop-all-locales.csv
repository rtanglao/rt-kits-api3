(Windows 10 PC) I want BOTH Nightly and Firefox on my computer; however my Firefox profile became corrupted in the process. Things like: the Bookmarks not appearing despite all the settings for them being correct; Firefox crashing when importing bookmarks. Fed up, I decided I wanted a completely new installation of Firefox. I could use my sync to my Firefox account to get most of what I needed back easily... I thought. I don't want to detail every step, they are too many.  The important part, I think, is this. Installing Firefox, I need for it to create a new profile. Beause the old one had NUMEROUS corruptions, I got rid of it, thinking that Firefox can create a new profile when installing the software from scratch. But guess what? It will not do that. THE PROBLEM is that Nightly and Firefox share the same Roaming/Profiles folder, which means that the .ini files contain references to BOTH profiles in a single file.  Profiles.ini contains both. Installs.ini contains references to both. If I delete - or try to alter the contents of - either .ini file, then Nightly loses its profile as well. I have restored those two files to where Nightly now starts up normally, thank god. But there is NOTHING I can do so far to get the new installation of Firefox to start up without trying to find the now missing profile which was corrputed to the point that it was more trouble than it was worth.  It used to be possible to install Firefox and make whatever fixes were necessary before starting up the browser. Now it is not; it starts up automatically, or not at all. WHY is the setup designed this way? Really large error on the part of Mozilla developers to put the profiles info and installs info into the same file, so that upon uninstalling Firefox, you must either find the old corrupt profile again, or start from scratch with BOTH Nightly and Firefox.  We waste SO MANY HOURS trying to work around the careless / thoughtless things that developers do! Please can someone help me? For now I have Nightly, but it looks like I will never have Firefox again after using it and its ancestors for 25 years.
