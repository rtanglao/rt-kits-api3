Now, I'm wondering how I can save all that work so that if something goes awry (Say WHAT??), I won't have to recreate it again (which I probably wouldn't have the willpower to do).  I've done lengthy searching on the internet looking for this answer but have not found one.  I have ""Saved This Page"" under ""File"" but will that will save all the formatting, the layout, the links, logos, etc. of the New Tab page?  I don't know that nor am I confident of that.   ''''<em><strong>Does anyone know if there a way to save all the user customization of the ""New Tab"" layout?   Also, why can't I take a screenshot of a New Tab page?
