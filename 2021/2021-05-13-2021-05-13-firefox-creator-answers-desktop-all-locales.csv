Something that I've relied on quite heavily in the past was the use of the address bar's autocomplete function to get me to frequently used websites - in this case, the Subscriptions page from YouTube. I have attempted to fiddle with the options available to me, but it seems that no matter what I do on this browser, I am unable to have said page show up when I type in ""y"" - instead, the homepage for YouTube is the first thing to show up, which I explicitly do not want. I cannot permanently remove this by way of pressing Shift + Del, as it always reappears. I am positive that I have visited the target page (Subscriptions) enough that it should show up as the top result, and I am also positive that I have not visited the YouTube homepage, as I intentionally remove it from my browsing history if I ever accidentally access it. I have tried turning on/off different combinations of settings in the Address Bar options menu under Browser Privacy, I have attempted bookmarking the page to have it rise to the top of the search settings, and I have attempted the use of an add-on which blocks websites from appearing in search results (which unfortunately did not extend to the search results directly from the address bar). </p><p>I am grateful that this minor irritant is one of my only outstanding gripes with the browser at the moment, though nevertheless, I would like to know if there is any way to further customize the address bar dropdown results to prioritize websites I have actually accessed before over their root domain. </p><p>Thank you for your assistance. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ludicrine

Menschen die wirklich für die Mündigkeit und Freiheit des Menschen stehen und diese respektieren, bauen nicht in eine Software von der sie zuvor Menschen abhängig gemacht haben Zwangsupdates ein und erklären sie ohne den Einzelnen zu kennen pauschal für zu dumm selbst zu bestimmen und auf die eigen Sicherheit zu achten. Das ist abwertend und menschenverachtend arrogant. Schlimmer noch das schafft bestenfalls abhängige Menschen, die verlernen auf ihre Sicherheit zu achten. Der Große Bruder macht es ja.
