I cannot restore Bookmarks from the <em>.json</em> backups, and I do not have an HTML backup.</strong> </p><p>Firefox would not load any pages this morning, even after updating to most recent version (89) and restarting the app then the entire computer, so I refreshed Firefox. Good news is, pages load now! Bad news is my bookmarks all disappeared, and they were still gone even after I made the Bookmarks Toolbar visible. The Import Bookmarks button only gives me the option to import from Internet Explorer or Chrome, but not from previous version of Firefox. </p><p>I went to Manage Bookmarks, and the Import and Backup seems to have some recent bookmark back-ups, giving me options for back-ups from today (Monday) then Saturday (last new bookmark), etc. But when I try to import bookmarks this way, it says Unable to process the backup file. My Firefox profile has backups, but only as .json files, no HTML bookmark files, which is the only other importing option. The rest of my profile seems to have imported fine - when I go to my inboxes or regularly visited websites, I'm still logged in. </p><p>Strangely, Firefox also seems to have forgotten my browsing history. In the URL bar, it'll show my search history, but <em>not</em> my visited pages, which makes the lack of Bookmarks even more aggravating and harder to deal with. </p><p><strong>Edit: I restarted the app <em>again</em> and this time, my bookmarks were in place, and my browsing history is back when I type into the URL bar.

I have just created an account here as I have been unable to get much sense from people in IT (retail mainly) or general tech forums which has led to a certain degree of frustration regarding FF bookmarks. But first, I want to say that I have been using FF browser for sixteen years and love it - I am aware of Chrome but prefer Fox; I dislike IE. Thank you for all you are doing. </p><p>A little background: in March my old pc suddenly packed up and it felt like an old friend had died. It was running Win-7 (Pro) which I knew was no longer supported but I liked it, and the pc was reliable for ten years. I was told that the motherboard (ASUS) had gone, and after numerous questions and delays, the computer has been rebuilt with a new z590 mb (also ASUS), a gen 11 cpu and a SS drive running Win-10 as it was time to upgrade. I don't like Win-10 at this point because W7 seemed easier to use - I am not a gamer, just a browser. I still have the Win-7 Pro disc but have been told that this new MB will not boot Win-7. I will try to get around this somehow. </p><p>The main issue is this: over the years I had collected a large number of bookmarks, and although I was not using many of them, I think it's useful to save things and with FF it is easy to do. The old C drive from the computer (the 3.5 type - by WD) is now in a drive-reading enclosure and I can see Programs and Folders. I feed it into the computer I am using atm - an older pc running Win-7 Home. I found the Mozilla Firefox folder and another one named 'bookmarks' but I cannot see any reference to the bookmarks I saved or any option to Export Bookmarks. I know what this means as I have used it successfully before. </p><p>So, please tell me if it is possible to find then Save and/or Export those bookmarks from the enclosed C drive to either THIS computer or preferably the other (rebuilt) computer, bearing in mind that the other one is operating as described with a z590 mb. Will it be possible? Many thanks in advance! </p><p>Btw, I really did NOT like Win-10 when I finally got that other pc back - LATE JUNE!! - after weeks of waiting. The first thing I did was install Firefox and it felt better immediately. Again I thank you! Michael. </p>",windows-7;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-890;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",goldfish117

The workaround for fixing that is to resize window and then make it maximized again. I am not quite sure, is it a problem of browser, video driver, or desktop environment, but it occurs for me only on firefox. </p> <ul><li> Appeared several versions ago, present on current version I use: <strong>89.0.2 (64-bit)</strong> </li><li> Does not appear when i load windows 10 on this PC. </li><li> Video card: <strong>Nvidia 1660S driver ver.460</strong> </li></ul> <p>Does anyone heard of that problem?

It's become more regular lately, happening every Monday. I can't use the restore tabs function for some reason, either. Whenever this happens, Bing also becomes my default search engine, and I have to switch it back over to Google. Is there any way to stop this? It's driving me nuts.
