If i keep spamming the enter key to force it, it eventually loads after maybe 20 tries. If i close and reopen firefox the search will work reliably again for a short time before the issue happens again. All of the other search engines (amazon, duckduckgo etc) work fine. </p><p>Have tried reinstalling firefox but issue persists. Seemed to start happening after a recent update a week or so ago. </p><p>Can you assist? </p><p>Many Thanks </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mdubrich
