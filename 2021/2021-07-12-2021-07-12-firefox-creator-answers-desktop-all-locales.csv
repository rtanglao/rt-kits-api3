I got that, extrated it and placed it in the/opt folder, made an application shortcut, added an icon, and now it's working like a normal app.  The problem arises when it tries to auto-update. Firefox Nightly updates very frequently, sometimes more than once per day, and on windows, I used to get a notification saying that a new update is released, and if i wanted to install it. Clicking yes, Firefox would update and restart within moments, and restore all my tabs and windows seamlessly.  Here on Linux, I have to manually download the new tar.bz2 file, extract it, replace it in the specified folder, and launch Firefox Nightly again, and again and again usually once per every alternate day, whenever the new update comes. Is there a solution for this? Will Firefox someday release a .deb file for easy installation and updates?
