There is a link that brings the test up in PDF, which I think is necessary as the link itself seems to be only a picture. </p><p>Other photography sites have pointed this use of the word ""system"" out for, in my case, Safari and Chrome for instance.  I tried Safari and ran the PDF test.  It passed.  I tried Firefox again (and again) it failed every time.  Other people have had the same result, as in the following quote, ""...Houston we have a problem..."". </p><p>One of the most helpful websites I have found for this, mostly from fine photography sites, was <a href=""https://gregbenzphotography.com/photography-tips/how-to-setup-proper-color-management-in-a-web-browser"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gregbenzphotography.com/photography-tips/how-to-setup-proper-color-management-in-a-web-browser</a>.  This website had six tests for browsers.  Firefox passed every test except test #6.  Using Safari, it passed all including test #6.  You could try it with Chrome. </p><p>This website, and many others, suggested a Firefox enabling correction that starts with typing into a Firefox address bar about:confg click, and after some scary warnings, type in gfx.color_management.mode (set to 1), click, then gfx.color_management.enablev4 (set to true), click, then gfx.color_management.rendering_intent. (set to 1 relative colorimetric--or to 0 for us Philistines).  Restart Firefox. </p><p>Didn't work, Firefox still failed.  I tried this many times, same result.  Read the last sentence of the Summary on that website. </p><p>I'm sad to do this, but sending my even relatively elementary images to an outside printer, using PDF/X1a to KDP or IngramSpark for instance, I'll use Safari because I don't trust what Firefox might do.
