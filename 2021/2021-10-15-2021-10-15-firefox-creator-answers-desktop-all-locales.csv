Now, in order to save an e-mail to a folder on my PC I have to save it as an html document to be opened by my browser, i.e. Firefox. For a while now when I try to open any saved e-mail it will open for a few seconds and then it is covered by a Blerk 5 error notice. The  following information accompanies it:  ERR1800   Report ID: 0ca992e91cc1f7c63-20211015-124427. I would greatly appreciate a fix for this problem. I assume all the data are there safely saved because I can read the e-mails even if only for a few seconds. I need the fix to allow me to open all my old saved e-mails.
