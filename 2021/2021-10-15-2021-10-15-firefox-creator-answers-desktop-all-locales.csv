Problem appears only on my pc when using Google Calendar in Firefox (when I use Chrome, everything is fine).  In two months (so far, Oct 2021 and January 2022) NO EVENTS SHOW UP.  If I enter an event in either of these months, it will show in Chrome, my android, and Kindle.  BUT those 2 months are completely blank when using calendar in Firefox.  Clearing cache, disabling Adblock for the calendar page(s), reloading has not helped. I would really appreciate any possible solutions/help.

(I'm a psychotherapist). I tried everything to fix it, but nothing worked. I finally had the idea to switch browsers, and behold! it worked! So there is something about Firefox that suddenly disabled the video function for this particular site. The camera light is on, but the image does not load. It is not a problem with another video-conferencing platform I use (Webex) via Firefox, just a problem with  Psychology Today. Please advise. I want to keep using Firefox for Pso Today, too, if possible. </p><p>Thank you. MBSwett </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,other,en-US,"",mbswett

I have noticed with the current Nightly 95 install that the minimize &amp; maximize buttons are completely gone, only the close button is there. Even when I click on the area where the 2 missing buttons are nothing happens. When I double click the same area, the area behaves the same way as the rest of the top bar, it either makes the current window become a smaller window or a full window. </p><p>I have also installed Firefox 93 and 94 Beta 6, they both behave as normal with the minimize and maximize buttons visible and usable, just like any other program or Firefox version ever on Windows. Also, before I clean installed Windows 11, I used Nightly 95 on Windows 10 within the last day or so and I don't recall ever having this behavior happen there either. </p><p>Is this behavior on Nightly 95 on Windows 11 intentional or an error? I know Firefox has and is going through a massive GUI update and other user facing changes with Proton, but wasn't sure if this had anything to do with the trouble I am experiencing. I also understand that Nightly may have a lot of changes and features that are unique to it. I honestly just wasn't sure about this issue. </p><p>Thank you in advance for any and all help! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1451233;1451235;,7apple7
