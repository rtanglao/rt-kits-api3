All the rest of her bookmarks give this error, and typing anything into the Firefox browser also gives us the error. We do have Internet connection because she is getting her emails.  But. trying alternative browser Microsoft Edge gives the same error. I have tried cleaning out the cookies and cache, have tried the about.config to change the security ssl enable to false - no help there. I did change it back immediately. I've also rebooted completely several times. </p><p>Can't understand why the two bookmarks can access online when the rest don't.
