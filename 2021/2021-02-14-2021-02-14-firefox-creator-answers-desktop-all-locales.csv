I'm completely at a loss to what is causing this issue, but when I have Firefox open, and go to enter a voice call on Discord or a video call on Signal, I get a severe (upwards of 5 seconds) lag on the call that makes it impossible to communicate. <strong>I am using desktop clients for both Discord and Signal,</strong> so my guess is that something about Firefox is severely taxing my internet (bandwith I think?), but I have no clear indication as to what is doing it or how to fix it. </p><p>This has only started happening since making the switch to Firefox (i.e. doesn't occur on Chrome). I thought it might have something to do with some of the anti-tracking extensions I had installed, but even with only Firefox Recommended extensions, and also with no extensions enabled at all, the issue persists. <strong>Starting a call after quitting Firefox encounters no lag issues.</strong> </p><p>The weird thing is that I can enter a video call on Signal, and then open a link to YouTube sent by someone I'm talking to, and I am able to navigate that specific website and watch videos perfectly fine with no lag on the video call, but the second I click the 'New Tab' button or navigate to any other kind of website, the lag spike starts. Closing the tab doesn't fix the issue, only closing the browser does.  </p><p>I tried doing a refresh of Firefox to see if that would resolve the issue, but it has made no difference to the problem. <strong>The only way I am able to be on a call in other programs is if I have Firefox closed.</strong> </p><p>I'm currently going to have to go back to Chrome in order to be able to play DnD with my online friends next week, but I was really starting to enjoy using Firefox so I'm hoping someone has an answer for what is going on so that it can be resolved. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-850;firefox-8502;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1391894;1391923;1392023;,ithinkler
