So now I can't watch BBC iplayer. </p><p>I looked at other simliar threads but none of the solutions I read there works. I've cleared cache, switched to offline mode and online mode again, etc. Nothing. </p><p>I'm on Windows 10, 64-bit, desktop browser. Any tips on how to solve this would be great. </p><p>Best Aris </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,other,en-US,1391828;,arism74

You have to ""sign up"" to even ask a question. And woe betide that you want to enjoy a stable browser that doesn't force you to accept changes that break websites you rely upon, because some faceless, nameless do-gooder developer in Wisconsin decided ... </p><p>Engage me.

Nor accuse you *as an individual* of anything; but I will debunk your (the Mozilla collective) idea that ""You know best"". </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,other,en-US,1391827;,iDontWantAnAccountISimplyWantToAskAQuestion.20.browseruk
