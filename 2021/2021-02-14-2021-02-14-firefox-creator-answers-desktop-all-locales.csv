Problem is now they are taking up too much space in my Bookmarks, so I am trying to work out how to set up in Bookmarks a generic Folder called Gold Stuff which will allow me to hoard all of these videos in just 1 spot.

Within the last few days going to full screen mode leaves me with narrow black bars on both sides and the bottom, with none at the top. This happens on my desktop and twp laptops that I use.  This is happening in Firefox but Microsoft Edge is still showing these same videos with absolutely no borders, like Firefox used to do. I love Firefox but will be using Edge to watch my sports until this is resolved.  I ""sync"" Firefox with all three computers so may some inadvertent setting is affecting them all. Strangely, this doesn't seem to be affecting You Tube </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-850;firefox-8502;,firefox,other,en-US,"",sigsky

So now I can't watch BBC iplayer. </p><p>I looked at other simliar threads but none of the solutions I read there works. I've cleared cache, switched to offline mode and online mode again, etc. Nothing. </p><p>I'm on Windows 10, 64-bit, desktop browser.
