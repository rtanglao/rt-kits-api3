I'm completely at a loss to what is causing this issue, but when I have Firefox open, and go to enter a voice call on Discord or a video call on Signal, I get a severe (upwards of 5 seconds) lag on the call that makes it impossible to communicate. <strong>I am using desktop clients for both Discord and Signal,</strong> so my guess is that something about Firefox is severely taxing my internet (bandwith I think?), but I have no clear indication as to what is doing it or how to fix it. </p><p>This has only started happening since making the switch to Firefox (i.e. doesn't occur on Chrome). I thought it might have something to do with some of the anti-tracking extensions I had installed, but even with only Firefox Recommended extensions, and also with no extensions enabled at all, the issue persists. <strong>Starting a call after quitting Firefox encounters no lag issues.</strong> </p><p>The weird thing is that I can enter a video call on Signal, and then open a link to YouTube sent by someone I'm talking to, and I am able to navigate that specific website and watch videos perfectly fine with no lag on the video call, but the second I click the 'New Tab' button or navigate to any other kind of website, the lag spike starts. Closing the tab doesn't fix the issue, only closing the browser does.  </p><p>I tried doing a refresh of Firefox to see if that would resolve the issue, but it has made no difference to the problem. <strong>The only way I am able to be on a call in other programs is if I have Firefox closed.</strong> </p><p>I'm currently going to have to go back to Chrome in order to be able to play DnD with my online friends next week, but I was really starting to enjoy using Firefox so I'm hoping someone has an answer for what is going on so that it can be resolved. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-850;firefox-8502;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1391894;,ithinkler

Everything was working fine until half-an-hour ago when I got an error message TT602 when attempting to send an E-mail. ( previous E-mails sent earlier had worked OK ) I checked my in-coming and out-going server settings and they are all as recommended by Talk Talk. Also went on-line to check the Talk Talk connection and all showing up as OK. Does anyone know what the problem can be ? Many thanks. SG PS. I already posted this question on the Forum about a week ago but no-one has responded yet. The problem does not happen all the time - just occasionally. But it means I can't send any E-mails for a couple of hours. Then, eventually, it seems I can send them again. But it keeps happening. Can anyone help ? Thanks.

I run at a pretty high res with small fonts, and I find it very tricky to drag a new bookmark from the address bar into nested bookmark folders. If I stray past the edge of the folder listing for even a brief moment, Firefox opens a different sub-folder, or if I'm completely out of bounds it closes the folder and I have to start over. This is extremely frustrating, especially on bookmark folders where the starting hit-box is tiny (like my programming bookmarks called ""dev""). </p><p>I am aware of the about:config setting <strong>ui.submenuDelay</strong> which fixes this problem when browsing through bookmark folders and sub-folders (at the cost of slower response-time initially opening any sub-folder), but for whatever reason, it doesn't apply to drag-drop for bookmarks. </p><p>Is there an equivalent for drag-drop operations? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",mcguirev10

So, when you can easily define what kind of info you actually want and need to display on a printout, it is really useful and helpful. But a simple ON/OFF approach definitely is not any helpful! For example, when I need no page count informations, I still may pretty much need to have date and time as it is not viewable otherwise from the (PDF or paper) printout. <strong>Please implement these features to the new print preview modal, too!</strong> Before that, I and loads of people stick to the classic experience. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,customize,fi,"",sami2
