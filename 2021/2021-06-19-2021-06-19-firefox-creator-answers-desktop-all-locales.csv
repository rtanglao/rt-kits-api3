Why?","<p>I don't mean to be rude, but if you could get the decision-makers who authorize drastic changes to the appearance of the browser when a new release comes out to just stop ""fixing"" things that aren't broken, that would certainly satisfy me.  I'm not picky about color schemes and ""themes"", but now the browser is difficult to read, and it wasn't before.  I need to know how to restore the appearance of my browser to be the same as in the previous version, or I'll finally have to quit Firefox after all these years and switch to a different one.  I don't want to have to do that, but I don't think I can manage to deal with this new hard-to-read low-contrast version.  I'm sure someone thought this design looked ""cool"", and was therefore an improvement.  I don't want to stifle anyone's creativity, but the browser I use has to be easier to read.  Maybe the next release will offer a choice between the ""look and feel"" of the previous version versus this one.  Thanks for considering my problem (and it is a problem for me), and I'll keep my fingers crossed. </p>",windows-7;desktop;tabs;firefox-890;firefox-8901;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",uhbc300
