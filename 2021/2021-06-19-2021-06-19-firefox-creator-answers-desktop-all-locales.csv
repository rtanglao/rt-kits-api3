After the last Firefox update this week I will be browsing a webpage and all of a sudden a Bing page is loaded over the top with a preformatted search term as though I was searching for that term. It's really annoying as I've always preferred Google anyway. When I search for something in the address bar, it loads a Bing page, but when I open a new tab it loads my preferred page, Google with Firefox. I don't have Bing selected as a search engine in my options. How can I get rid of it please? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",eva37

Other browsers display the same windows normally. This has been going on for a couple of months now. I really like(d) Firefox befo0re this happened.
