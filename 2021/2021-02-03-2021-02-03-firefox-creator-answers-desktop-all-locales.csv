It goes wel for a few times, and then  suddenly it starts downloading it again instead op opening it. I have tried to go back to standard settings and again change my preferences, but no result. I also made a sync account for Firefox (I thought it would synchronize my settings in a good way each time) but also no result. It is no issue with updating firefox to a newer version, because my settings change even in between updates. </p><p>I am clueless. Anyone having a good idea?
