Long time Firefox user, recommended by a friend in the IT business a long time ago.   </p><p>I am using Firefox 85, 64 bit.  Over the last several years, I've noticed that I can't view twitter posts or most videos on Firefox, but I can if I copy+paste the link to Chrome.   I recently bought a new desktop PC (for other reasons), I thought that would fix the issue, but it didn't.  Note that I didn't ""start anew"" on the PC, the company that sold me the PC transferred most of the ""stuff"" on my old PC to the new one.  That might be part of the problem. </p><p>Also, certain websites won't operate properly on Firefox, but they operate fine on Chrome.  I have two sites I visit frequently that I won't open in Firefox because of these issues. </p><p>I tried to reset Firefox (after saving the plethora of links and saved logins on my PC), but that didn't fix the problem.

For instance if I open a PDF containing a single page invoice from GMail and then print it using the print dialog in Firefox's PDF viewer, I will get the second blank page displayed in the print preview, even though the document clearly only contains one page. If I use the option to use the Windows print dialog menu instead, and I print with that, the document will be printed correctly and only one page will be dispensed. This is A4 format, nothing was changed and all computers started to have this symptom after some recent Firefox update. This happens in two separate buildings both on two computers with Windows 10 and one computer with Windows 7, also two completely separate printers, one being a network laser printer and other standard USB inkjet. This doesn't make much sense to me, is there any solution to this? I have switched from the built-in PDF viewer to Acrobat Reader directly, but it was much more convinient to just have a PDF displayed in a Firefox tab rather than opening a separate program to display and print. Of course Acrobat Reader prints just as correctly as the windows dialog. The problem seems to be purely to do with the Firefox PDF viewer. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,other,en-US,"",maciek4477

Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions? Could there be some kind of TLS or certificate problem on the machine itself? Like could Windows be set to only support TLS 1 and 2 but not 3 and Firefox is inheriting that setting? Idk I'm kinda reaching here but I just don't know what the issue is now. </p><p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1389165;1389166;1389168;1389170;1389172;1389173;1389174;,ek-dyoder
