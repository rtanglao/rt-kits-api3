I did that and Firefox loads, but it does nothing. When I hit ""Home"" it tries to work but it's apparently not accessing the internet. I can't access options either. I didn't uninstall because I don't want to lose any current settings, bookmarks, history, etc. I use Windows 10 on my laptop. </p><p>I did and automatic restart-- same result. I did a total shut down and restart-- same. </p><p>I checked with McAfee firewall and Firefox has access. No note comes up regarding any issue when I load Firefox. </p><pre>I'm using Brave to write this, and there's no problem with internet access, obviously.  </pre> <p>So, which files or folders do I need to back-up so I can reinstall with bookmarks and history intact? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",rdjenkins

Its info says to use Chrome, IE, or Safari.  (I do have an i-phone but don't think I can type into it fast enough to beat the clock.)  I did get into the queue once, but no farther than that step.  Does that mean Firefox will work?  I don't have any other browser and I'm not tech savvy.  Thanks.

One of them is <a href=""http://www.performance.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">www.performance.gov</a> the site loads fine on other computers on the same network, the problem computer can successfully ping the site and correctly resolve DNS. Furthermore, Edge, Internet Explorer, and Chrome on the same computer can also load the site perfectly fine - it's only Firefox that can't. </p><p>I've tried to refresh Firefox, starting Firefox in Safe Mode, reinstalling, completely wiping Firefox from the computer (removed all of Mozilla's install, %AppData%, and %LocalAppData% directories; as well as removing all of the Mozilla and <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a> registry keys), then I installed a clean copy of Firefox 85 - still won't load the site. I've also tried changing Firefox's proxy setting to ""No proxy"", as well as disabling DoH - no dice. </p><p>The problem computer is running Windows 10 x64 20H2, is patched to today (2/2/2021), and has been restarted several times between all the attempts to get Firefox working correctly. </p><p>I'm really at a loss here. Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions? Could there be some kind of TLS or certificate problem on the machine itself? Like could Windows be set to only support TLS 1 and 2 but not 3 and Firefox is inheriting that setting? Idk I'm kinda reaching here but I just don't know what the issue is now. </p><p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ek-dyoder

I first thought it was my printer and uninstalled and reinstalled both the printer and Firefox, then I realized it also freezes when I try to print to PDF, and just now realized it's already frozen even if I cancel out of the print menu. I don't print from Firefox often, but I just found this problem, I'm not sure if it's related to a recent update.

The Firefox icon in the Dock at the bottom of the Mac screen still shows a lighted dot below it, indicating that it's running, but I cannot open the browser. </p><p>I gather this 11.2 Big Sur update is brand new (like in the last couple days, I guess.)
