Troubleshoot mode works, but I don't know why.","<p>As I described in my subject, I can't download ANYTHING through Firefox, unless it's in troubleshoot mode. I know that troubleshoot mode disables multiple things, including all of your themes and extensions and add-ons. For example, I can't open my own files in my AOL or Gmail email and download them. I also can't download things from my Google Drive. (Unless I'm in troubleshoot mode.) </p><p>However, thinking that it must be one of my add-ons, such as my adblock or any other one (and I mostly just have an adblock), I opened Firefox normally and completely disabled all of my add-ons, but that did not fix the problem. </p><p>I also tried downloading things while I had my Antivirus briefly paused, but that didn't work either. </p><p>The only time I can download things is in troubleshoot mode, and I don't know what's causing the problem. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1464837;1464839;,jxinf
