I'm using Firefox 94.0.2 and I have become a big fan of the ability to pin shortcuts/bookmarks to tiles in the New Tab screen. I customized my New Tab with 9 rows of tiles, 72 pinned sites, a very useful &amp; convenient feature.  </p><p>I got a new laptop for work, installed Firefox and logged into my Firefox account. I ran Sync to copy some open tabs over to the browser in my old laptop. Somehow the sync picked up the setting of having 72 tiles on the New Tab page, on the new laptop, which was great; but instead of my pinned sites, the 72 tiles were populated by random sites (presumably pulled out of browsing history). No worries; I'd expected that I'd have to manually configure the new laptop's browser anyway.  </p><p>But then when i logged into my old laptop this morning I was dismayed to see that the pinned sites were gone! The 72 tiles are still there, but the pinned sites have been replaced by random ones. Now I'll have to reconfigure my old laptop's browser as well. :-(  </p><p>My question: is there any way to restore the previous pinned sites without having to re-pin them all manually? And once they're all back in place, is there some way to export/save/lock them, so this won't happen again? If having Sync enabled across my two devices is going to randomly wipe out my pinned sites, then I suppose the New Tab tile functionality is not so useful and I'll just use an old-fashioned Bookmark list.  </p><p>Thanks in advance for any insights! </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",ghost2270
