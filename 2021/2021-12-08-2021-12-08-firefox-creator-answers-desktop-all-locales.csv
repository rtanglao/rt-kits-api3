I have TMetric integration for JIRA Software enabled - you can see it in the picture 1.png </p><p>I use the Mozilla Firefox (95.0) web browser. Always the current version. The problem is that TMetric correctly calculates the measured time 1:04 as the sum of the measured times for the given issue, but the time is not logged in the JIRA system (Work log). Watch the picture 2.png and 3.png.  This is a problem for me because it is not possible to get the measured time into JIRA reports and the reported capacities do not fit. </p><p>I did not have a problem with this before, and when measuring time, the time was reported as Log Work to the JIRA system after the end of the measurement. There was no problem with back-editing the time, which also manifested itself in the log work. It doesn't work at all right now.  I tried it in another browser (Microsoft Edge) and I realized that it works. </p><p>Please tell me if the problem is with you and can be fixed, or if I should contact TMetric Support and what I can tell them to inform them that it is wrong. Or if you don't have a tip on how to fix it? I don't know what the problem might be.  </p><p>Thank you.
