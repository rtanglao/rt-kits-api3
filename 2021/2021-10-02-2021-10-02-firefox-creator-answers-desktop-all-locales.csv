Example: ""Iâ™m glad I pursued an elaboration of this report. It was mildly comforting as it says âœhas low malignant probability but does require follow-up."" I donâ™t see a way to do an attachment so Iâ™ll cut and paste.""   The part I cut and pasted was fine.  I am on Firefox 92.0.1 and a Mac Laptop.  The previous version of Firefox did this too.  In this message, it appears not to like apostrophes or quotation marks specifically.  My doctor doesn't appreciate trying to decipher them and I am not happy that he can't read them without a problem since we are talking about a potentially serious problem causing me a lot of anxiety. What is the solution? And when will Firefox fix it so I don't have to each time?  Thanks! </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-920;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1447732;,barbarahunt
