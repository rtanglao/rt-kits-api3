Sometimes, I have to click 3 or 4 times for the bookmark to open.  It is not dependant on which bookmark I'm choosing.  When I click on the bookmark (and it doesn't open), it either shows no indication, or sometimes ""winks"" in brightness.  This is the only situation in Firefox where mouse clicks don't function properly every time.  That is, clicking in the address bar or search window always places a text cursor therein; clicking on an existing tab always selects that tab and brings it to front; clicking on a menu bar item always works; etc. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-920;firefox-9201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",fridaymanyfeathers

It wasn't and I corrected that.  Now I have the icon in the toolbar and on the right click menu but when I attempt to use them all I get is a popup menu with a large black X in it and nothing can be done with it. Also, on the toolbar items that are added to it all appear in the overflow and there is no way of getting them to appear on the screen by reducing the size of the search bar. I've been using firefox ever since it first appeared and I've never had problems like this before. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",zzzallan
