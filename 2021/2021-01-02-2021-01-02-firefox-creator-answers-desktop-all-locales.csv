When I type in some text boxes, the cursor gets very slow and unresponsive to move around by the keyboard _if_ the text in the box is long enough so that a scrollbar appears on the right hand side.  Sometimes. It doesn't happen at all sites -- it's not duplicating in this textbox that I'm typing in right now -- but it happens all of the time in the message boxes at <a href=""http://playdiplomacy.com"" rel=""nofollow"">playdiplomacy.com</a>, and sometimes on <a href=""http://GitHub.com"" rel=""nofollow"">GitHub.com</a> when posting issues. Sporadically and unreliably. </p><p>As far as I can tell, the cursor is still moving quickly and responsively, but the blink itself isn't happening so I can't see it. If I hold down the left cursor key, it looks like the cursor isn't going anywhere, but if I hit a letter key that letter appears instantly at the location where the cursor has apparently moved to, with no delay. </p><p>The problem does not occur when I hold down shift (to highlight) while moving the cursor via the arrow keys, which further suggests that it is somehow related to the cursor blinking. </p><p>Restarting in safe mode makes the problem go away instantly. Disabling all add-ons myself does not. Starting with a brand new profile does _not_ make the problem go away either. So there's something safe mode is doing that a new profile doesn't. </p><p>Any idea what might be causing this? </p><p>(Ubuntu 20.04, Firefox 84.0). </p><p>Thanks! </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-840;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1380756;1380761;1380788;,Vultan

There are several addons that meet the need, but I am reluctant to install any addon that I don't find essential.) </p><p>Searches for solutions to this need also reveal that finding duplicate bookmarks is an equally important need for many FF users. </p><p>So... trying to ""think outside of the box"" and experimenting, I found that when using <strong>the bookmarks sidebar search feature</strong>, the search results can be treated just like bookmarks within toolbars and bookmarks folders.   </p><p>While its impossible to divine <em>where</em> the found bookmark is located, you can drag the found bookmark out of the search results to a location that works with your current memory rather than the location you can't remember.  Doing so will remove it from the original location just as dragging it from one bookmark folder to another does. </p><p>The same is true for duplicate bookmarks.  Duplicates show up in a bookmark search, and, you can delete a duplicate from the search results which removes the duplicate from FF bookmarks...  </p><p>...obviously, it's wise to look at properties to confirm that the urls match. </p><p>Hope this approach is helpful, Beverly Howard </p>",desktop;tips;windows-81;firefox-840;,firefox,tips,en-US,1380591;,bevhoward
