There are several addons that meet the need, but I am reluctant to install any addon that I don't find essential.) </p><p>Searches for solutions to this need also reveal that finding duplicate bookmarks is an equally important need for many FF users. </p><p>So... trying to ""think outside of the box"" and experimenting, I found that when using <strong>the bookmarks sidebar search feature</strong>, the search results can be treated just like bookmarks within toolbars and bookmarks folders.   </p><p>While its impossible to divine <em>where</em> the found bookmark is located, you can drag the found bookmark out of the search results to a location that works with your current memory rather than the location you can't remember.  Doing so will remove it from the original location just as dragging it from one bookmark folder to another does. </p><p>The same is true for duplicate bookmarks.  Duplicates show up in a bookmark search, and, you can delete a duplicate from the search results which removes the duplicate from FF bookmarks...  </p><p>...obviously, it's wise to look at properties to confirm that the urls match. </p><p>Hope this approach is helpful, Beverly Howard </p>",desktop;tips;windows-81;firefox-840;,firefox,tips,en-US,1380591;,bevhoward
