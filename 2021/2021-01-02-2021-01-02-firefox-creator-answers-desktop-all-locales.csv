Manually created bookmark list from other browser. Closed other browser and completely trusted bookmarks to be saved and for firefox to be stable. I did move installer from desktop to trash bin but did not empty bin. Next day after computer restart, Firefox completely gone. Reinstalled firefox and no bookmarks. Fresh profile created. Went to find old file backups and I get error message: There is no application set to open the document"". I search app store for program to open and I am told no program exists. These are important bookmarks for a mental health charity and we desperately need them! Can anyone help? Thank you </p>",desktop;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",drowssap72

There are several addons that meet the need, but I am reluctant to install any addon that I don't find essential.) </p><p>Searches for solutions to this need also reveal that finding duplicate bookmarks is an equally important need for many FF users. </p><p>So... trying to ""think outside of the box"" and experimenting, I found that when using <strong>the bookmarks sidebar search feature</strong>, the search results can be treated just like bookmarks within toolbars and bookmarks folders.   </p><p>While its impossible to divine <em>where</em> the found bookmark is located, you can drag the found bookmark out of the search results to a location that works with your current memory rather than the location you can't remember.  Doing so will remove it from the original location just as dragging it from one bookmark folder to another does. </p><p>The same is true for duplicate bookmarks.  Duplicates show up in a bookmark search, and, you can delete a duplicate from the search results which removes the duplicate from FF bookmarks...  </p><p>...obviously, it's wise to look at properties to confirm that the urls match. </p><p>Hope this approach is helpful, Beverly Howard </p>",desktop;tips;windows-81;firefox-840;,firefox,tips,en-US,1380591;,bevhoward
