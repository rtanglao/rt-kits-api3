Ive made sure my video driver is up to date. I've tested in internet explorer and google chrome and those do not have the same issue. I currently have Mozilla Firefox 84.0.1 x64 installed on a windows 10 pc. I do not have flash player installed if that makes any difference. It does not matter what kind of tab is moved from one screen to the other i.e. it can be video or not - still crashes firefox. There is no crash report, firefox just seems to freeze infinitely and the only way to close it is through taskmanager. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",tolver40

I sort the websites in multiple browser windows about topics which i need for different tasks. So far no problem. I also managed, that when i close Firefox it will restart that different sessions. But - there is no need to have all them sessions open at the same time, which also costs a lot of RAM and CPU power. </p><p>My idea was to have different desktop shortcuts to start them different sessions only when i need them. </p><p>Up to now this is not common. But it seems to become a common need. A lot people work with lot's of tabs at the same time and struggle with their resources. As admin i can see that very often. </p><pre>I assume, that it is possible to handle that with a script. But then i would have to change the script with every change of a single url.  </pre> <p>Does anyone have a simple and smart solution? </p><p>Thank you all in advance and happy new year for everybody! :-) </p>",desktop;tips;windows-81;firefox-840;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",info4396

I see in the about us, Firefox is braging about their collaboration with Ford Foundation, omidyar network, color of change and consumers international and ford foundation even referred to it as a match made in heaven.  How ever how can screwing up every day of the week be a good thing  or heaven ? How is it these ' people ' think their of any help at all ? The issue with the usps OIC  portal issues was never fixed, then it was several banks and credit card company's, now it is home depot corporate log in [ not <a href=""http://homedepot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">homedepot.com</a> ] also the apple icloud issue, with some hidden page command that causes the courser to no longer work when viewing pictures. So I am wondering how a bunch of deliberate screw ups can brag about how their making it ' better'  by making the web browser no longer compatible with high security web sites then trying to say the issue is with them is not good, helpful, or even a step forwards. </p><p>So now the only work around is fire fox has to be abandoned as a joke junk web browser and all of those web sites can only be accessed by google chrome. </p><p>I'm not sure if it is firefoxs new so called clown high security, how ever forcing users to go to a different web browser is not more security , it is a deliberate screw up, like making a car that breaks down when you drive it out of your driveway and calling it safer as it can not get into a accident if you can not drive it. </p><p>and just so that we are crystal clear for years I have run computers on line with NO anti virus or malware protection, yet my computer does not get infected, but how can that be ? the answer is simple, people are morons that do stupid things that cause their computers to be infected, if your IQ was higher then a bug you would not have all of the issues your all having. So what do you do ? you change the browser thinking it is going to protect you from your selfs, when the problem is not with the browser its with you the users. </p><p>So how are all of your continuous changes that cause the web browser to no longer function properly a help at all ? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-81;firefox-840;firefox-8401;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1380680;1380703;,RNARC1

There are several addons that meet the need, but I am reluctant to install any addon that I don't find essential.) </p><p>Searches for solutions to this need also reveal that finding duplicate bookmarks is an equally important need for many FF users. </p><p>So... trying to ""think outside of the box"" and experimenting, I found that when using <strong>the bookmarks sidebar search feature</strong>, the search results can be treated just like bookmarks within toolbars and bookmarks folders.   </p><p>While its impossible to divine <em>where</em> the found bookmark is located, you can drag the found bookmark out of the search results to a location that works with your current memory rather than the location you can't remember.  Doing so will remove it from the original location just as dragging it from one bookmark folder to another does. </p><p>The same is true for duplicate bookmarks.  Duplicates show up in a bookmark search, and, you can delete a duplicate from the search results which removes the duplicate from FF bookmarks...  </p><p>...obviously, it's wise to look at properties to confirm that the urls match. </p><p>Hope this approach is helpful, Beverly Howard </p>",desktop;tips;windows-81;firefox-840;,firefox,tips,en-US,1380591;,bevhoward
