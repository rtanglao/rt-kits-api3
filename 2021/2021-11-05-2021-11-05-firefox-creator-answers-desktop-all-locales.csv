Under Applications, I have PDF downloads set to ""Save File."" When I download a PDF, it saves it to my downloads folder.

This process repeats EVERY TIME I download a PDF from Firefox (which I do almost every day). And before you ask, I already checked my computer settings, which have Adobe as my default program for opening PDFs. The opening-in-browser problem still occurs every time I download from Firefox. </p><p>Please let me know how to resolve.
