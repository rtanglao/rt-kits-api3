It gives you 3 different time lengths to use.  Then it warns that all data will be lost.  You press the key at the bottom and signs you out and then immediately right back in.  This just disappeared. </p><p>Also where are all the apps that were grouped together I think they were under command?  I could just click on one (like the printer) and drag it to my task bar.  I can't find it either. </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jelitch
