The theme I am using is called Blackwood. In fact, the fact that THIS page is also no longer able to be dark is ALSO a major issue for me. The fact that you've disabled about:config being able to be made dark using accessibility extensions that help people like me to be able to use the internet is DISCRIMINATION against people with visual disabilities. Pleas rectify this issue, because I need to be able to do my work, and your changes have made it so that I can't do it without risking an acute attack and severe consequences due to my condition, meaning I'm more disabled and less able to work because your changes have REMOVED my disability accommodations. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-940;firefox-9401;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",Phaewryn1

There is only one thing that could be much better, which are major performance issues on specific cookie-laden websites such as Reddit. I'm not sure to what degree extensions influence this, but browsing Reddit on Firefox is really clunky. Loading times are unusually long, there's this weird lag when click&amp;dragging text to hightlight. Specific bug: when I write a comment, click&amp;drag newly written text, use CTRL+C and spam CTRL+V, not text is pasted, backspace stops working and no text can be written again. Currently the performance issues are the only reason why I even consider Chrome or Edge. </p><p>If you want more info on the specific setup like what extensions are on please contact me. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-940;firefox-9401;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",pieter.john.schumacher

I am especially focusing on the point: Encryption – standard, in-browser HTTPS – is now always required when communicating with remote services. In the past, this was only required when transporting sensitive information. While I am supporting this new rule, I would like to ask, if there is any chance to be excluded from this policy. I am the developer of Domain Country, an add-on which allows you to retrieve the geographical information (and other data) about a given domain. To retrieve this data, Domain Country uses the API <a href=""https://ip-api.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ip-api.com/</a>. Unfortunately, this API requires a paid key to be accessible via HTTPS (Example URL: <a href=""https://ip-api.com/json/mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ip-api.com/json/mozilla.org</a>). While I am very frustrated about this solution, I still decided to implement it, because I could not find another free API service. To still ensure that users are protected against Man-in-the-middle-attacks, I decided to manually validate the data after it is received (the code for Domain Country is open-source. This is the line, I'm talking about: <a href=""https://github.com/Myzel394/domaincountry/blob/master/src/apis/fetchDomainInformation.ts#L94"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Myzel394/domaincountry/blob/master/src/apis/fetchDomainInformation.ts#L94</a>). Domain Country will also be continuously updated to ensure the user's safety. As a student with only low income it is also impossible for me to pay for <a href=""https://ip-api.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ip-api.com/</a>. </p><p><br> I hope you understand my problems and consider excluding Domain Country from the new add-on policy. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,1456826;,Myzel394

Adding all sorts of things to the userChrome CSS but 95% of the suggestions have no effect at all [I'm seriously non-technical, so I have no idea if I'm doing it correctly though...probably not] The only thing that I can change is the Tab Height...nothing else changes regardless of what numbers I put in there.  The only way I've been able to make the Bookmarks folders usable at all is to enable Compact mode via about:config. But that actually makes it way too compact now...from one extreme to the other. At least it's usable now...so not the end of the world, but the right click menu still has way too much space between every entry [Compact mode made no difference to that at all]. I don't know how to make a screenshot of those menus :) so I took a couple of pics of the screen...can someone please show me what to add to the CSS file to make these ridiculously big spaces between the menu items way smaller...like they used to be before this Proton came in? I tried tons of things that people said to add to the CSS to fix this menu spacing thing but none of them changed anything.  I'll include the CSS file that I have below.

Set the 'dark' theme or or the new Colorways themes when the background is dark. </p><p>The menus (in the menu bar, context menus, and select drop-downs in web pages) display as dark text on a dark background, so they're barely legible.  The highlighted menu item shows as light text on a light background.  Attached an example showing the bookmark menu. </p><p>Has anyone got this?
