However, on my Mac Catalina every website I view has a barebones look, too much white where there should be colors and pictures.

I am especially focusing on the point: Encryption – standard, in-browser HTTPS – is now always required when communicating with remote services. In the past, this was only required when transporting sensitive information. While I am supporting this new rule, I would like to ask, if there is any chance to be excluded from this policy. I am the developer of Domain Country, an add-on which allows you to retrieve the geographical information (and other data) about a given domain. To retrieve this data, Domain Country uses the API <a href=""https://ip-api.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ip-api.com/</a>. Unfortunately, this API requires a paid key to be accessible via HTTPS (Example URL: <a href=""https://ip-api.com/json/mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ip-api.com/json/mozilla.org</a>). While I am very frustrated about this solution, I still decided to implement it, because I could not find another free API service. To still ensure that users are protected against Man-in-the-middle-attacks, I decided to manually validate the data after it is received (the code for Domain Country is open-source. This is the line, I'm talking about: <a href=""https://github.com/Myzel394/domaincountry/blob/master/src/apis/fetchDomainInformation.ts#L94"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Myzel394/domaincountry/blob/master/src/apis/fetchDomainInformation.ts#L94</a>). Domain Country will also be continuously updated to ensure the user's safety. As a student with only low income it is also impossible for me to pay for <a href=""https://ip-api.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ip-api.com/</a>. </p><p><br> I hope you understand my problems and consider excluding Domain Country from the new add-on policy. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Myzel394

I will be using it just fine and then all the sudden when I put a new address or search in the address bar and hit enter,  it will do nothing. If I hit refresh it will do the refreshing animation for about 1/4 of a second and stop without loading anything. I usually keep multiple windows of Firefox open during the week and clear them on Friday and the problem happens on every one of them when it happens to one. It forces me to switch to Edge for about 10 minutes when the problem suddenly fixes itself and I can switch back to Firefox. This happens ever couple of hours and it's really getting to me but I have no clue why it's happening. </p><p>Any ideas? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1456815;,ghoshvictor215

Adding all sorts of things to the userChrome CSS but 95% of the suggestions have no effect at all [I'm seriously non-technical, so I have no idea if I'm doing it correctly though...probably not] The only thing that I can change is the Tab Height...nothing else changes regardless of what numbers I put in there.  The only way I've been able to make the Bookmarks folders usable at all is to enable Compact mode via about:config. But that actually makes it way too compact now...from one extreme to the other. At least it's usable now...so not the end of the world, but the right click menu still has way too much space between every entry [Compact mode made no difference to that at all]. I don't know how to make a screenshot of those menus :) so I took a couple of pics of the screen...can someone please show me what to add to the CSS file to make these ridiculously big spaces between the menu items way smaller...like they used to be before this Proton came in? I tried tons of things that people said to add to the CSS to fix this menu spacing thing but none of them changed anything.  I'll include the CSS file that I have below.
