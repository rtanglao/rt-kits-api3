Is there any way to change this back easily? Honestly, I can probably get used to it but it's just an annoying change, and a curiously illogical one. There's nothing else that uses that particular letter in the standard right-click menu so the change seems bizarre. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,other,en-US,"",arb.clarke

Firefox worked ok when I first set it up. But a couple days later, it would open but would notload any web pages. It would open in settings and other topics on the menu but no pages. At first I got the roor code vcruntime140_1.dll. I did the steps to fix that. I have run scandisk and chkdsk and any other solution suggested. Nothing has fixed it. It runs fine on my desktop pc. When I download it, I get the 0xc00000ba code and application cannot start. </p>",desktop;websites;,firefox,websites,en-US,1429490;1429510;1429513;,jmartin_
