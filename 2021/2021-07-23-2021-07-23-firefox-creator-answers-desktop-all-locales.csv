Reinstalled Firefox 90.0.2 and now Firefox Plugins section is  is telling me that ""Widevine Content Decryption Module provided by Google Inc. will be installed shortly."" but it doesn't seem to change. I have always stayed updated on MacOS and Firefox versions, and suddenly in early 2021 this has become an issue that persists to date. </p><p>Is the current status of Widevine for Firefox on MacOS BROKEN? </p><p>There are no roll backs that seem to work, and I can't find anyone else with my MacOS and Firefox versions that are reporting the same problem. Streaming is not only the way of the future, it has been the standard for media viewing for over 5 YEARS. Firefox needs to figure how to make widevine work from the get go or it will quickly go the way of the dinosaur. </p><p>I don't WANT to use Chrome (thought I currently do for Netflix), please don't suggest that as a solution. </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-900;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1429546;,pMa1

(see attached screen capture) </p><p>If Firefox is opened in a window inside the right screen, it proeprly recognises the right edge of the screen as the limit and acts accordingly. </p><p>This is quite a problem for me: I make intensive use of the toolbar with bookmarks inside folders and subfolders and this heavily affects my everyday work. </p><p>Is there a way to get back to how it used to be? ie: Firefox using the right edge of the screen it is opened in as the limit to open a drop down menu. </p><p>Thanks in advance, </p><p>S. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-780;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",sawbona1
