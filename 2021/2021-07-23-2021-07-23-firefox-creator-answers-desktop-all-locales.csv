It redirected me to a duplicate page, that is designed exactly like Firefox Addons. Now that site automatically loads whenever I open my Firefox browser and keeps installing an addon without any permissions, even if the ""Get addon"" button isn't clicked. The URL of the site is <em>https://black-mode-for-browser.site/Dark%20Fox%20%E2%80%93%20Get%20this%20Theme%20for%20%F0%9F%A6%8A%20Firefox%20(en-US).php</em>.

(see attached screen capture) </p><p>If Firefox is opened in a window inside the right screen, it proeprly recognises the right edge of the screen as the limit and acts accordingly. </p><p>This is quite a problem for me: I make intensive use of the toolbar with bookmarks inside folders and subfolders and this heavily affects my everyday work. </p><p>Is there a way to get back to how it used to be? ie: Firefox using the right edge of the screen it is opened in as the limit to open a drop down menu. </p><p>Thanks in advance, </p><p>S. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-780;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",sawbona1

Is there any way to change this back easily? Honestly, I can probably get used to it but it's just an annoying change, and a curiously illogical one. There's nothing else that uses that particular letter in the standard right-click menu so the change seems bizarre. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,other,en-US,"",arb.clarke
