(see attached screen capture) </p><p>If Firefox is opened in a window inside the right screen, it proeprly recognises the right edge of the screen as the limit and acts accordingly. </p><p>This is quite a problem for me: I make intensive use of the toolbar with bookmarks inside folders and subfolders and this heavily affects my everyday work. </p><p>Is there a way to get back to how it used to be? ie: Firefox using the right edge of the screen it is opened in as the limit to open a drop down menu. </p><p>Thanks in advance, </p><p>S. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-780;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",sawbona1

Is there any way to change this back easily? Honestly, I can probably get used to it but it's just an annoying change, and a curiously illogical one. There's nothing else that uses that particular letter in the standard right-click menu so the change seems bizarre. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,other,en-US,"",arb.clarke
