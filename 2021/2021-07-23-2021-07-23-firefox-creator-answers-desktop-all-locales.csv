I have a few different installations of Firefox for different purposes and I'd like them each to display the custom name I've given them by renaming their filename (e.g. changing Firefox.app to something like YouTubeViewer.app). This causes the installation of Firefox to show in my app switcher and elsewhere in the OS as ""YouTubeViewer"", however when I run YouTubeViewer.app, Firefox still displays ""Firefox"" in the upper left-hand corner as the application name. </p><p>I tried editing the .plist file for each installation to change the value for key CFBundleName from ""Firefox"" to ""YouTubeViewer"", but that causes that installation of Firefox to no longer run. I believe this is due to the code-signing and pre-run validation done by the OS. </p><p>So, is there any way to get the custom name to display or is just not possible? </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-900;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",zstei001

One day, while various FireFox updates were happening, I noticed something, I think it was a popup, saying something to the effect that all your bookmarks will be deleted.  Huh!?  Couldn't click on anything to stop the install.  And after computer restarted, all the bookmarks were gone from FireFox, meaning when I go to the bookmarks button, nothing shows anymore. What happened?  They are really gone or where to find a backup to get them back again?  I don't recall ever backing them up on purpose, so if there was a backup, it would have been an automatic thing.  Please give input.

How to hide or disable it?,"<p>Hi everyone. </p><p>There's a behavior with the ""search suggestions"" feature in the address bar that works differently than I'd expect. I show a real example below:  </p><p>1 - I did a search with the phrase ""mercado livre"" using the address bar suggestions 2 - I visited the website <a href=""http://www.mercadolivre.com.br"" rel=""nofollow"">www.mercadolivre.com.br</a> 3 - I close the window and open I new one 3 - When I start typing the word ""mer"" with the intention of opening the site again, the address bar suggests as the first option the URL ""<a href=""https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=market"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=market</a> +free"". This is the URL of the search done in step 1. You can see thin in the image attached. </p><p>What I really hope is that in step 3, it lists the URL ""<a href=""http://www.mercadolivre.com.br"" rel=""nofollow"">www.mercadolivre.com.br</a>"" (my history), and below that, the other search suggestions. It doesn't make sense to me to list the full Google search url as a suggestion, as in step 3. </p><p>Is there any way to hide or disable this kind of suggestion? Note that I don't want to disable all suggestions from previously visited sites, just the old searches´ full URL types from step 3. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",francismorelli

(see attached screen capture) </p><p>If Firefox is opened in a window inside the right screen, it proeprly recognises the right edge of the screen as the limit and acts accordingly. </p><p>This is quite a problem for me: I make intensive use of the toolbar with bookmarks inside folders and subfolders and this heavily affects my everyday work. </p><p>Is there a way to get back to how it used to be? ie: Firefox using the right edge of the screen it is opened in as the limit to open a drop down menu. </p><p>Thanks in advance, </p><p>S. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-780;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",sawbona1
