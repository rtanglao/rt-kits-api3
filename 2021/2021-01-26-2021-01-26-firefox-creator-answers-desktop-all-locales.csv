My company gives employees the Cisco AnyConnect SW for establishing the VPN access to the company's infrastructure. </p><p>Are you able to ""fix"" this please, as I haven't experienced this behavior at other browsers as well (Opera, IE)? </p><p>BR </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-840;firefox-8402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",xsound

It came in a box with T2Mobile on it but is not a locked phone. </p><p>7 years later, it's 2021, and I've been using an Apple iPhone for 6 years and I wondered if Firefox OS was still going as I couldn't find a reference to it on the Mozilla Support page and I'd like to try using the phone again if possible. I know it's specs are very basic compared to phones today but I don't mind. It only supports 3G but I am on Vodafone Australia and as far as I'm aware they still support 3G even if it might be slow. </p><p>Appreciate any thoughts on if I can still use the phone and if Firefox OS if still going and has a recent version that might be able to install on my phone. </p><p>Here are the specs from the back of the box it came in plus a few other photos. </p><p>Cheers Cel </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",celwyne
