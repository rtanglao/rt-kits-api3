Note: This happens on the same computer! My browser is Firefox (84.0.2). When using Edge or Chrome the arrows are displayed properly.<em> </em> </p><p>And got the following answer: </p><p><em>This appears to be a bug in Firefox. The two characters have the same Unicode value, 00E0, but the arrow is in the Wingdings font while the à is displayed in most non-symbol fonts. Although the font box on the ribbon in Word Online says the font of the character is Wingdings, Firefox fails to show it in that font.</em> </p><p>Given that both Edge and Chrome seem to be able to display the document correctly, it seems to me that this is a Firefox bug? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",swabianeagle
