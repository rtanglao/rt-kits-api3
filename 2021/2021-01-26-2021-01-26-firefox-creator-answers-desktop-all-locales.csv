That means Messenger, commenting posts on Facebook, creating new posts etc. But even other stuff is slow as it is scrolling down, going through photos etc. </p><p>This is happening on my both PCs, my CPUs are Ryzen 5 3600, and Intel I7-4770, and GPU GTX 1660S, GTX 1050Ti, so I don`t see that hardware should bottleneck this in any case. In the meantime, I did restart with Safe mode, refreshed Firefox, even reinstalled which does not help. I have tried with other browsers, Facebook works fine there. Currently I am using latest Firefox 84.0.2 64bit on both PCs, and Windows 10 is 20H2 version. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-840;firefox-8402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jovantanasic1

The manual says : Ctrl + Shift + End - requires the currently selected tab to be ""in focus"" for instance, by hitting Alt + D to focus the address bar, and then Shift + Tab until you reach the browser tab bar ... This doesn't seem to work, or it doesn't work when you have 1.000 tabs open ... Trying to open the right-click menu using the keyboard doesn't work either (or cannot be done ?).  If I could open the right-click menu of the tab, then I would be able to navigate to Move Tab -&gt; Move to End, but that can't be done either ...  :-(  Any help ?  Would this be inspiration for a feature request ?  Or defect fix ?  (short-cut key doesn't work) </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",antonieeland

It only supports 3G but I am on Vodafone Australia and as far as I'm aware they still support 3G even if it might be slow. </p><p>Appreciate any thoughts on if I can still use the phone and if Firefox OS if still going and has a recent version that might be able to install on my phone. </p><p>Here are the specs from the back of the box it came in plus a few other photos. </p><p>Cheers Cel </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",celwyne
