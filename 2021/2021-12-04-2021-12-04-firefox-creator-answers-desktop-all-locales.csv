It made me feel productive as it was the app store of an OS ,which was also there back then. But why was it discontinued? If there is any reason, please reply and If possible, please try recreating it. Here are the new firefox marketplace icons I suggest which I got from the web archive. Each icon is larger than the previous one. And if possible, please work on firefox OS too. </p>",linux;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-940;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",user110

Every time I try to play a feed or a recording it takes a little bit to load then a message appears saying ""Sorry, there was an error licensing the video."" I've checked my Youtube TV account and everything checks out, restarted my browser, started browser in safe mode. I tried using Internet Explorer and it worked on that, then it worked on Firefox. I closed the Internet Explorer then the Firefox stopped working. Not sure what's going on. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-940;firefox-9402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",eric_mots35
