Once I've begun to type the missed stroke happens and then all is fine until I pause typing for around 30 seconds then the missed stroke happens again, otherwise I can continually type with no issues. This began a couple months ago and I assumed it was the old keyboard I was using so I bought a new one and the problem still persists.  This issue is exclusive to Firefox and no other program or browsers on Windows 10.  Firefox is fully updated, Version 94.0.2 (64-bit) at the time of writing this.  I have ""refreshed"" Firefox and removed all add-ons etc. and the problem still exists.
