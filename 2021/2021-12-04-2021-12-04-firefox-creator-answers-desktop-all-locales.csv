Příklad: když scroluji stěnu na FB, tak tam mám místo obrázků jen prázdné rámečky. Někdy když píši do chatu, tak chvilku trvá, než se to tam dopíše. Na jiných stránkách, když kliknu na nějaký odkaz, co by měl otevřít nový panel nebo mě posunout na stránce jinam, tak to prostě nefunguje. Otevřít odkaz v novém panelu taky nejde. Nejde kliknout na křížek u reklamy a tak ji zavřít (na jiném prohlížeči to jde) Viz obrázek. A nevím co s tím. Když zapnu PC, tak to chvíli funguje normálně, ale postupně, jako by se unavoval to začne blbnout.  </p><p>Nic v daném okamžiku nestahuji a všechna minulá stahování mám smazaná. Nemám otevřeno hodně panelů. (co je hodně že?) Na disku C mám volných 770 GB. Počítač starý cca 5 let. Firefox aktualizovaný. Žádné doplňky. </p><p>Ram 15,8 GB. Procesor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4790 CPU @ 3.60GHz 3.60 GHz.

Once I've begun to type the missed stroke happens and then all is fine until I pause typing for around 30 seconds then the missed stroke happens again, otherwise I can continually type with no issues. This began a couple months ago and I assumed it was the old keyboard I was using so I bought a new one and the problem still persists.  This issue is exclusive to Firefox and no other program or browsers on Windows 10.  Firefox is fully updated, Version 94.0.2 (64-bit) at the time of writing this.  I have ""refreshed"" Firefox and removed all add-ons etc. and the problem still exists.
