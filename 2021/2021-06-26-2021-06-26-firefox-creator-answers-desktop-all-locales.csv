Da qualche giorno ho notato che quando avvio Firefox, avendo impostato Google come pagina iniziale, in quest'ultima mi compare un popup che mi chiede di esplorare i ristoranti nei dintorni di casa mia. Se accetto, Google indica esattamente la mia posizione sulla mappa ed evidenzia dei ristoranti nei dintorni (cfr. immagini allegate). La cosa è alquanto irritante, perché ho impostato Firefox con il massimo delle restrizioni sulla privacy e sull'antitracciamento, incluso il blocco della posizione (cfr. immagini allegate). Se aggiungo il fatto che utilizzo anche AdGuard e che alla chiusura di ogni sessione di Firefox eseguo CCleaner per eliminare qualunque cookie e/o cronologia, il problema diventa seriamente preoccupante... Capita solo a me o c'è qualcun altro che ha riscontrato la medesima anomalia? Sto sbagliando qualcosa nelle impostazioni della privacy e sicurezza di Firefox?

Bevore i had the WIN 7 64 N version and everythink was nice. The win version on the istall-usb stick ist downloadet fresh from microsoft and my hard drive is formatted. The version of Firefox is 89.0.2 (64-Bit). </p><p>With Win 10 Pro N firefox couldn't play Videos on most platforms (vimeo, twitter, all player from <a href=""http://bs.to"" rel=""nofollow"">bs.to</a>...) youtube is the only page that works. </p><p>The videos don't run in save mode. I have look for a lot of help-pages for this proplem, nothing works(e.g. download file xxx from mikrosoft, install program xxx, disable addons, reinstall firefox; change xxx in firefoxsettings...). I have ask some friends to look and they didn't found anything (because of EIFOK/ PEBKAC/ PICNIC [choose yourself] ^^).  I have test same pages in Edge and there the videos work perfect. </p><p>Vimeo says: ""Fehler im Player Beim Player gibt es ein Problem. Wir werden versuchen, ihn so schnell wie möglich wieder betriebsfähig zu haben."" </p><p>Some other pages shows me: ""The media playback was aborted due to a corruption problem or because the media used features your browser did not support."" </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;firefox-8902;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1424133;,gaoth24

This is highly tedious because I use the miniplayer very frequently, and I have to close the miniplayer (I suppose I could skip this step), reopen Firefox, press play, reopen the miniplayer, and then repeat the cycle when a new video plays. I tried this with Microsoft Edge (which I hate with a passion), and didn't have this happen, so I'm pretty sure this is something with Firefox. Every time I tried to look this up, i never found someone with this issue, so I'm pretty sure it's something I did, and I can't figure out how to undo it ahah. </p><p>If anyone knows what I can do to fix this, help is appreciated. </p><p>Respect </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",tylerjohns7

I did not sign into any accounts on the website and I did not purchase the items.  I then cleared my cookies, cache, and offline data.  Later on I went back to the website and wanted to put items back in the cart to re-price everything and discovered that the items were still in the cart from before.  I cleared cookies, etc. again and the items were still in the cart.  I then went to the website on Chrome and the items were still in the cart.  Again, I did not sign into any accounts or anything.  I never use Chrome.  Just went straight to the website on Chrome and went to the cart and the items were there even though I didn't use Chrome to put anything in the cart.  I then cleared cookies, etc. on Chrome and the items were still in the cart.  I tried this on Edge and same thing.  I have used Bitdefender, Malwarebytes, Hitman Pro, and CC Cleaner and no program is finding the malware or spyware or trojan or whatever this is.  This is a well-known website that even has a facebook page.  I messaged the webmaster and I posted on their facebook page and I'm being ignored.
