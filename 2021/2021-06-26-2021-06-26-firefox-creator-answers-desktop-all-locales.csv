Da qualche giorno ho notato che quando avvio Firefox, avendo impostato Google come pagina iniziale, in quest'ultima mi compare un popup che mi chiede di esplorare i ristoranti nei dintorni di casa mia. Se accetto, Google indica esattamente la mia posizione sulla mappa ed evidenzia dei ristoranti nei dintorni (cfr. immagini allegate). La cosa è alquanto irritante, perché ho impostato Firefox con il massimo delle restrizioni sulla privacy e sull'antitracciamento, incluso il blocco della posizione (cfr. immagini allegate). Se aggiungo il fatto che utilizzo anche AdGuard e che alla chiusura di ogni sessione di Firefox eseguo CCleaner per eliminare qualunque cookie e/o cronologia, il problema diventa seriamente preoccupante... Capita solo a me o c'è qualcun altro che ha riscontrato la medesima anomalia? Sto sbagliando qualcosa nelle impostazioni della privacy e sicurezza di Firefox?
