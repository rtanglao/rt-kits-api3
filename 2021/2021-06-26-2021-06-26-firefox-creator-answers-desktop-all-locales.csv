I did not sign into any accounts on the website and I did not purchase the items.  I then cleared my cookies, cache, and offline data.  Later on I went back to the website and wanted to put items back in the cart to re-price everything and discovered that the items were still in the cart from before.  I cleared cookies, etc. again and the items were still in the cart.  I then went to the website on Chrome and the items were still in the cart.  Again, I did not sign into any accounts or anything.  I never use Chrome.  Just went straight to the website on Chrome and went to the cart and the items were there even though I didn't use Chrome to put anything in the cart.  I then cleared cookies, etc. on Chrome and the items were still in the cart.  I tried this on Edge and same thing.  I have used Bitdefender, Malwarebytes, Hitman Pro, and CC Cleaner and no program is finding the malware or spyware or trojan or whatever this is.  This is a well-known website that even has a facebook page.  I messaged the webmaster and I posted on their facebook page and I'm being ignored.  What is this and how do I get rid of it? </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,cookies,en-US,"",trueheiressofslytherin
