Unable to retrive and paste in a Finder Window,"<p>Where is the screenshot saved on an iMac? I have a Firefox webpage and I used thr scissor over a paper icon Add-on that is in my Toolbar and it seems to work correctly as it opens the Add-on. I use the save whole page option. I am unable to locate the screenshot to place in a Finder window, I have checked all of the Screenshot folders and the Dropbox trying to locate the file with negative results. I tried both the Download and the Copy options but neither work. </p><p>It used to work ok when there was an icon to press next to the Add a Bookmark icon in the Title Bar. It appears to do the samething except place it somewhere I can find it. </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",andyhutch1947

This is highly tedious because I use the miniplayer very frequently, and I have to close the miniplayer (I suppose I could skip this step), reopen Firefox, press play, reopen the miniplayer, and then repeat the cycle when a new video plays. I tried this with Microsoft Edge (which I hate with a passion), and didn't have this happen, so I'm pretty sure this is something with Firefox. Every time I tried to look this up, i never found someone with this issue, so I'm pretty sure it's something I did, and I can't figure out how to undo it ahah. </p><p>If anyone knows what I can do to fix this, help is appreciated. </p><p>Respect </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",tylerjohns7

I did not sign into any accounts on the website and I did not purchase the items.  I then cleared my cookies, cache, and offline data.  Later on I went back to the website and wanted to put items back in the cart to re-price everything and discovered that the items were still in the cart from before.  I cleared cookies, etc. again and the items were still in the cart.  I then went to the website on Chrome and the items were still in the cart.  Again, I did not sign into any accounts or anything.  I never use Chrome.  Just went straight to the website on Chrome and went to the cart and the items were there even though I didn't use Chrome to put anything in the cart.  I then cleared cookies, etc. on Chrome and the items were still in the cart.  I tried this on Edge and same thing.  I have used Bitdefender, Malwarebytes, Hitman Pro, and CC Cleaner and no program is finding the malware or spyware or trojan or whatever this is.  This is a well-known website that even has a facebook page.  I messaged the webmaster and I posted on their facebook page and I'm being ignored.  What is this and how do I get rid of it? </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,cookies,en-US,"",trueheiressofslytherin
