Switch to Firefox -&gt; Ctrl+L -&gt; type search-term is the fastest way i found to search for whatever I need. Problem is: now my browser clutters itself by always opening new tabs instead of just reusing the one i don't need anymore. </p><p>So my questions would be this: </p> <ol><li> Is it possible to restore the old behaviour of staying within your one tab? </li><li> If there is some other shortcut that allows for searching without moving to a new tab? </li></ol> <p>(I also tried Ctrl+K and Ctrl+J.

Da qualche giorno ho notato che quando avvio Firefox, avendo impostato Google come pagina iniziale, in quest'ultima mi compare un popup che mi chiede di esplorare i ristoranti nei dintorni di casa mia. Se accetto, Google indica esattamente la mia posizione sulla mappa ed evidenzia dei ristoranti nei dintorni (cfr. immagini allegate). La cosa è alquanto irritante, perché ho impostato Firefox con il massimo delle restrizioni sulla privacy e sull'antitracciamento, incluso il blocco della posizione (cfr. immagini allegate). Se aggiungo il fatto che utilizzo anche AdGuard e che alla chiusura di ogni sessione di Firefox eseguo CCleaner per eliminare qualunque cookie e/o cronologia, il problema diventa seriamente preoccupante... Capita solo a me o c'è qualcun altro che ha riscontrato la medesima anomalia? Sto sbagliando qualcosa nelle impostazioni della privacy e sicurezza di Firefox? Un grazie anticipato a chi mi fornirà qualche suggerimento in merito.

This is highly tedious because I use the miniplayer very frequently, and I have to close the miniplayer (I suppose I could skip this step), reopen Firefox, press play, reopen the miniplayer, and then repeat the cycle when a new video plays. I tried this with Microsoft Edge (which I hate with a passion), and didn't have this happen, so I'm pretty sure this is something with Firefox. Every time I tried to look this up, i never found someone with this issue, so I'm pretty sure it's something I did, and I can't figure out how to undo it ahah. </p><p>If anyone knows what I can do to fix this, help is appreciated. </p><p>Respect </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",tylerjohns7
