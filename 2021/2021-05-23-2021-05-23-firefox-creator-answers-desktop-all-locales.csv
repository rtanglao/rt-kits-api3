I'll admit I can have 80 or 90 tabs open sometimes, but using chrome on my laptop this really isn't a problem in the way of memory.  </p><p>Firefox on the other hand will gradually open more processes and use up to 11gb of memory before I have to close it. I've checked the built-in performance graph (image attached) and it doesn't show any of my tabs using anywhere near that amount of memory. However, when I open the Windows Task Manager (image also attached) Firefox is using a baffling amount of system resources. </p><p>I can't simply close a few tabs, either. If I close all but three tabs the memory usage will hardly drop, only when I fully restart the program does it return to a 'normal' state for a while. </p><p>Would appreciate any help anybody can provide. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",cacawki

I want to have Panorama back because It'll make my basic browsing easier and also that feature was useful. I don't want to have Add-ons, only having internal Panorama feature back if Mozilla can bring it back. It's also kind of difficult to use Mozilla Firefox because of Panorama feature removed. And now, it's not useful for those who work in schools/offices. Because they can't organize their tabs by default in Mozilla Firefox version 45+, it also becomes difficult to use other extensions because the browser then gets Heavier because they have been using other extensions along with tab management, and some of them requires access to your Google &amp; Microsoft Account and they become privacy concerns + most of them aren't even updated. I was using older versions (43.*) on Windows 10 Dev Insider build 21382 (21H1) just to organize some of my tabs, and I don't want to use any other extensions because they sometimes get/is heavier and it slows down my computer. I request Mozilla to Bring back Panorama feature. It was useful to me as I can split my tabs between work and fun. Not only version 43.0 I was using but also experimenting on other older versions that can handle the webpages, like (40.*) didn't loaded YouTube and it got stuck on white page, while the version (43.*) is better, because it at least supported modern web browsing (except Screen Share), I was also be able to use my microphone in (43.0) with Bing search. But only thing is, that the browser doesn't support screen sharing, Microsoft Office Online, and Gmail Standard View. Besides that, I can use OneDrive, OneNote, Outlook, Google Mail basic view, and Google Drive, Google Docs, other google services. Besides that, I can be using One-tab, and so many other tab managing Add-ons. But they won't save my tabs, besides, Panorama feature doesn't require sign in or other extensions. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-560;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",aryannarotra2007

For the last two or three versions, pages won't load without stopping the page and hitting reload. Also, especially on Yahoo, when I open a new pop-open.  most if not all of the pages will not display images unless I reload the page, and more often than not, it's a whole new page, not up a pop-open. I've open the exact same pages using edge and the pages pop right up and images are displayed. The same problem exists on my Dell Optiplex 7070 at work. So, which  coder decided to fix something that wasn't broken or use the microsoft method of code testing?  I've been using FF since the early 90s but I'm about to junk it. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",RealGomer
