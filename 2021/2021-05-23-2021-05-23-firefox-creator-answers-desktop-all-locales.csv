I want to have Panorama back because It'll make my basic browsing easier and also that feature was useful. I don't want to have Add-ons, only having internal Panorama feature back if Mozilla can bring it back. It's also kind of difficult to use Mozilla Firefox because of Panorama feature removed. And now, it's not useful for those who work in schools/offices. Because they can't organize their tabs by default in Mozilla Firefox version 45+, it also becomes difficult to use other extensions because the browser then gets Heavier because they have been using other extensions along with tab management, and some of them requires access to your Google &amp; Microsoft Account and they become privacy concerns + most of them aren't even updated. I was using older versions (43.*) on Windows 10 Dev Insider build 21382 (21H1) just to organize some of my tabs, and I don't want to use any other extensions because they sometimes get/is heavier and it slows down my computer. I request Mozilla to Bring back Panorama feature. It was useful to me as I can split my tabs between work and fun. Not only version 43.0 I was using but also experimenting on other older versions that can handle the webpages, like (40.*) didn't loaded YouTube and it got stuck on white page, while the version (43.*) is better, because it at least supported modern web browsing (except Screen Share), I was also be able to use my microphone in (43.0) with Bing search. But only thing is, that the browser doesn't support screen sharing, Microsoft Office Online, and Gmail Standard View. Besides that, I can use OneDrive, OneNote, Outlook, Google Mail basic view, and Google Drive, Google Docs, other google services. Besides that, I can be using One-tab, and so many other tab managing Add-ons.
