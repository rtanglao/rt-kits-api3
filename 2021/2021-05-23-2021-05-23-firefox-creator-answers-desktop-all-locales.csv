Then, when you click on said element, everything is suddenly jerked, like visual scrolling ""catches-up"" with actual scrolling. This makes everything unusable. Should I downgrade firefox? Or is there some about:config options that can help? </p>",windows-7;desktop;beta;fix-problems;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",iimouse

An example is a youtube video, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb0FCQug48c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb0FCQug48c</a> which produced an error something like unable to play video no mater how many times I try yet other youtube videos would play. After closing FF then reopening it played. </p><p>Can the running configuration of FF be captured for evaluationÂ ? </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-870;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",mace2

For the last two or three versions, pages won't load without stopping the page and hitting reload. Also, especially on Yahoo, when I open a new pop-open.  most if not all of the pages will not display images unless I reload the page, and more often than not, it's a whole new page, not up a pop-open. I've open the exact same pages using edge and the pages pop right up and images are displayed. The same problem exists on my Dell Optiplex 7070 at work. So, which  coder decided to fix something that wasn't broken or use the microsoft method of code testing?  I've been using FF since the early 90s but I'm about to junk it. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",RealGomer
