I think I'm being bully to get Edge.,"<p>Today I found out that Many apps on my system work in the background and slowing down my machine. I enlisted the consulting assistants of an expert and was told that the biggest are Adobe and Microsoft.  I had a cleaning done to my system and the results were amazing. I disable Apps I didn't need, uninstall App I did not use in a long time and disable services that did not provided me with any substantive experience or improvement in productivity. The results were amazing. My system was running faster than I have ever seen it run, including the first year after I purchase it. Well, about 2 hours later, I got this notification from Microsoft saying that I have to enable these optional services because Edge would make it better for me to serve the web and have a custom experience and get tailored adds based on my activity. If I had a choice I would pick No Adds. After I read their notification that I had difficulty reading and understanding little of it, I felt pressure to signed up with Edge as my browser. These services were eating my resources like there was no tomorrow and were effecting my productivity level. Microsoft's notification included a screen shot of the changes I did today in my settings with the disable buttons in Privacy and Personalization areas. I have all the required setting about diagnostics, etc. enabled, is there anything I can do to prevent them from using me like a cheap prostitute? Can they shot my account down for that? Is there any other OS providers I could get? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",d1313k

So, there is no exchange of data, so no avenue for any security breach or for damage to be done to either my website any visitors computer or the server upon which my websites resolves.  </p><p>My first website was published in 1998 even way back then we all knew that you approached any website with caution.
