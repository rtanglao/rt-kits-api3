I thought it was probably a known issue or a conflict with any of my extensions but I still haven't figured out a way to solve it. </p><p>Have tried re-installing the browser, I even switched to a new linux distro and everything was reset, I still have the issue. </p><p>The problem is - everything works but the ability to select/copy multiple blocks when using WordPress editor (tested it on three sites with the latest WordPress version where I write) does not work only when utilizing the mouse/cursor. </p><p>However, it works when using Brave or Google Chrome. </p><p>In either case, when I try to select multiple text blocks using <strong>CTRL+Shift+any arrow key</strong> on Firefox, it works no matter what. But, using the cursor/mouse, I can't achieve doing that... </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-870;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ankushdas91

Instead I get search results.  This is SOOOOO annoying.  I tried putting the search bar separate in the options, but that just gets you 2 search bars, which makes zero sense.  Is there a way to change this behavior?  I am completely frustrated.
