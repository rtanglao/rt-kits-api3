However, unfortunately Firefox has been caught up in the hysteria of the planet over security issues with the Internet.  </p><p>Undoubtedly there are such issues, just as they currently are with Covid 19 such issues, but the solution to Covid 19 is not to carpet bomb the whole of the planet - but, in actual fact that is what Firefox is now doing with websites security. </p><p>I build websites for a hobby and currently have published about 50 over the last 20 years , many of those are informational only sites. So, there is no exchange of data, so no avenue for any security breach or for damage to be done to either my website any visitors computer or the server upon which my websites resolves.  </p><p>My first website was published in 1998 even way back then we all knew that you approached any website with caution. However with a bit of due diligence it was possible to make a reasonable judgement as to the nature of validity of the website and those that constituted some risk and those that constituted none. </p><p>One of the websites I publish is <a href=""http://goofygoogle.com"" rel=""nofollow"">goofygoogle.com</a>. I have had this website since I purchased the domain in 2001. The website is informational only, however despite the fact it has been around for that period of time and you can find out who the domain owner in any WHOIS search, for the first time ever Firefox is now telling their browser user/visitors  “Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead”. </p><p>This, is in spite of the fact there is NO potential security risk 'Ahead' -AT ALL, in visiting this site. </p><p>Can we please wind back the hysteria or egotism or whatever else is the basis for this overreaction OR if we don’t want to do that, can we please get even smarter so that we actually can interrogate the site properly to determine if there actually is a “Potential Security Risk Ahead” before we ‘slander’ it? </p><p>I’m in your hands </p><p>Thank you </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1403717;,OzWaz

I thought it was probably a known issue or a conflict with any of my extensions but I still haven't figured out a way to solve it. </p><p>Have tried re-installing the browser, I even switched to a new linux distro and everything was reset, I still have the issue. </p><p>The problem is - everything works but the ability to select/copy multiple blocks when using WordPress editor (tested it on three sites with the latest WordPress version where I write) does not work only when utilizing the mouse/cursor. </p><p>However, it works when using Brave or Google Chrome. </p><p>In either case, when I try to select multiple text blocks using <strong>CTRL+Shift+any arrow key</strong> on Firefox, it works no matter what.
