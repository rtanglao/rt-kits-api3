A couple weeks ago, I was having major computer problems that required me to completely delete and recreate my user profile. I apparently hadn't logged into Google Voice since then, but decided to try and call a friend from that number today. When I tried to call her though, she couldn't hear me. Subsequent testing revealed that the problem is that Firefox isn't using my computer's microphone as the input, but rather it's taking the input from Stereo Mix, despite the default input device on my computer being the microphone. How do I change this within Firefox? I also have a wireless headset that I use sometimes, but when I plug that in, none of the audio switches to it. If desired, is there a way to get Firefox to use this device for audio output? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,other,en-US,"",cavbob1993

That page appears even without an Internet connection. 2.  Address bar does not allow a keyed or pasted URL. 3.  Colors at top of screen blot out the min, max, and close buttons and make the open page buttons unreadable.except for active page button. 4.  Moving to a new, or even a follow-up, page is slower. </p><p>I have been with Mozilla ever since the early days with the Netscape browser, and have always been happy with the many updates, that is, until this one.  Get rid of the colors, and make the address bar functional again.  I found the solution to the ""mystery page"" in Tools/Settings and reclaimed my home page, ""homepage.""
