A couple weeks ago, I was having major computer problems that required me to completely delete and recreate my user profile. I apparently hadn't logged into Google Voice since then, but decided to try and call a friend from that number today. When I tried to call her though, she couldn't hear me. Subsequent testing revealed that the problem is that Firefox isn't using my computer's microphone as the input, but rather it's taking the input from Stereo Mix, despite the default input device on my computer being the microphone. How do I change this within Firefox? I also have a wireless headset that I use sometimes, but when I plug that in, none of the audio switches to it. If desired, is there a way to get Firefox to use this device for audio output? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,other,en-US,"",cavbob1993
