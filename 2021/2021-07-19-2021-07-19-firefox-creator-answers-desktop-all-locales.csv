[Big Sur]","<p>Hi guys, </p><p>I've been trying for a couple weeks to make the switch from Chrome on Big Sur but am having trouble ironing a few things out. I work in research and view a ton of pdfs, so I like them to (1) open in browser, and (2) specifically, open in a new tab. I haven't been able to get Firefox to do these things. </p><p>For (1), I get the ""What should Firefox do with this file?"" every time I download a pdf from Researchgate (even the same exact pdf). I select the options in the image (""open with Firefox (default)"" and ""do this every time."" But it shows me the popup every time. I've gone to Preferences-&gt;Applications-&gt;PDFs-&gt;Open in Firefox but the behavior persists. </p><p>For (2), I'm at a loss - when I open downloaded pdfs, they always open in a new window. I don't even know if it's possible to get them to open in a new tab, but it would be nice and save me a lot of time. </p><p>Thanks in advance if anyone can point me in the right direction! </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-900;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",logan.robert.bingham

For example, looking at my schedule on Google Calendar, before I could set the scale to 50% or so, print just the first page as the second is always blank, and get several days of appointments fit neatly to the page. Now, it's cutting off almost 1/2 of the page on both the bottom and the right of the page, sometimes showing this in print preview and sometimes not showing but still printing this way. This is happening on both my old and new HP computers and only in FF (I just printed as described above in Edge with no issues). I've tried all the troubleshooting I could find as well as a print wizard add-on without luck. This is the first issue I've had in years of printing from FF other than when print preview seemed to disappear for a little while. Attached is an example of using Print To PDF on Google Images using ""Fit to page width"", sending to either of my printers shows the same result and adjusting scale also chops it on the bottom and right. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,other,en-US,"",nikki14

A couple weeks ago, I was having major computer problems that required me to completely delete and recreate my user profile. I apparently hadn't logged into Google Voice since then, but decided to try and call a friend from that number today. When I tried to call her though, she couldn't hear me. Subsequent testing revealed that the problem is that Firefox isn't using my computer's microphone as the input, but rather it's taking the input from Stereo Mix, despite the default input device on my computer being the microphone. How do I change this within Firefox? I also have a wireless headset that I use sometimes, but when I plug that in, none of the audio switches to it. If desired, is there a way to get Firefox to use this device for audio output? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,other,en-US,"",cavbob1993
