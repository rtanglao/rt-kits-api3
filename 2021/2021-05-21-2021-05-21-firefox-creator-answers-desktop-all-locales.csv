The data files that I have been working with are .doc, .docx, and .rtl(?) and have even tried  .html.  But so far I haven't found a format that seems to work with Firefox.  Has any body any ideas? This area that I'm working in is rather new to me, and for that reason I seem to keep going around in circles. </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,tips,en-US,1413910;,warp4dennis

Sometimes the context menu stays frozen on the screen, sometimes it does not. There is no ability to switch tabs or cancel the context menu. The image itself never saves to disk. I have reformatted and installed Firefox several times fresh out of the box and it still has this behavior. Running Firefox from the console and having Firefox freeze gives no indication or error or message about what is going on. I would say this happens 1 out of 20 images saved. I can easily reproduce this behavior, even though it is inconsistent. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1413905;,biggestsonicfan
