However, I noticed that the other widget.non-native-theme.gtk.scrollbar.* settings that allow scrollbar appearance customization inside Firefox are ignored as well. If I set widget.non-native-theme.enabled back to true, then the other scrollbar settings work as expected. This tells me that widget.non-native-theme.enabled does work, but the system scrollbar theme is not picked up as expected.
