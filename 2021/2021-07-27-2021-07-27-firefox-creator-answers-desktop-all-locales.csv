The issue is intermittent. </p><p>When I scroll down a page using the wheel on my Logitech M510, parts of the page will refresh at different speeds. Usually this is noticeable as the illusion of a diagonal line and disappears as soon as scrolling stops. Sometimes part of the prescrolling display will remain rather than changing with the rest of the screen, usually as a rectangle. I've also started getting only partial display of dialog boxes when editing in Wikipedia, in which only part of the image changes. </p><p>The rectangular area not updated is usually near the centre of the screen. The Wikipedia box issue has the opposite issue - the only part of the box that appears is in the same spot that fails to refresh when scrolling. </p><p>If I tap on an arrow key, the unrefreshed portion of the screen gets back in sync with the rest. </p><p>The issue seems unrelated to website, occurring on Wikipedia, Facebook, and Google. </p><p>I disabled the Proton interface within a week of its appearance because it wasted so much vertical screen space, if that's any clue. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",OilCanHarry
