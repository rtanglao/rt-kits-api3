The microphone DOES work on this site however. </p><p>Here is what I have done so far:  I've reset the pram and smc on my macbook Granted permissions to these websites in firefox Granted permissions to my mic and camera to firefox in mac security settings  Restarted firefox in safe mode, without add ons Cleared the cache, cookies, etc in firefox Reinstalled firefox and tried it all again </p><p>Nothing has worked so far and this is beyond frustrating. This problem cropped up at some point after updating from firefix 89 I believe. All help would be super appreciated, I rely on voice/video because typing is very difficult for me. thanks! </p><p><br> Device: Macbook pro 2019 Browser: Firefox 90.0.2 </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;firefox-900;firefox-9002;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",barinthus
