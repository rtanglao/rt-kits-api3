I even had to use Google Chrome to access this support page, as I couldn't get past the login page using Firefox. When I first opened the new version, Firefox told me that I had to enable cookies for it to work. I went to Preferences and checked that cookies were definitely enabled. I quit and restarted both Firefox and the entire computer, checked that cookies were still enabled and it still doesn't work. Why is this happening? I don't want to change my default browser permanently, but I need it to work for me. Can anyone help? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",lordwhybro

Why in the world would anyone think it wise to make the default browser setting automatically ""upgrading"" by wiping out all accumulated user data without any warnings to the user to first do a manual backup of personal data, such as by exporting all existing FF bookmarks into another browser first and then manually making whatever additional transition or re-import FF wanted? Had I known I needed to have made a lot of notes in order to have backup at all, I would have... or would have picked a safer browser to rely on, if auto-update wipe-out risk is to be the ""normal"" given environment now.
