The only time which I have ever used Zoom on Firefox, the same issue happened when I tried to use my webcam, except that the lines rapidly changed colours. </p><p>I apologize if this issue has been solved in another thread, but this is a <em>bit</em> hard to describe without the picture, so my attempts to search for said thread were unsuccessful. </p><p>The issue is not present when I upload the images in question via mobile. Turning off my extensions has no effect. </p><p>The image attached is taken directly from attempting to upload a profile picture to my Firefox account, but I have experienced this issue with websites like Twitter and Ebay for example. I have never had this issue with Imgur, for example, even though I am doing nothing different (uploading images). I do not know why this only occurs for a select few websites. </p><p>Any responses or help is appreciated! </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-940;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Nyxified

I have 2 email accounts: Johannes2922@outlook.de and regeneration35@Mailfence.com. regeneration25 is the primary e-mail from my synch account.  I don't know if I should give this information here and therefore I changed the numbers a bit  but the problem lies between these 2 emails. I also deleted another Firefox Synch account which had regeneration35 as primary e-mail. So I can use this e-mail as my primary e-mail for my current account.  This might be little details that could be useful for the problem.  </p><p><br> If I try to sign up with regeneration into my synch account, I get incorrect password error and  can't login at first but then I click on ""use different account"" and it looks like on picture 1 I put in images. I type regeneration35@Mailfence.com again into the text field and use the same password to get the authentication e-mail with the code.  So now I get 2 authentication e-mails on my regeneration35@Mailfence.com  and Johannes2922@outlook.de, 1 for each.  The authentication code used from my primary e-mail doesn't work.  </p><p>Here lies the problem. It brings me back to the login screen window as you see in picture 2.  What can I do? If I try to use the authentication code sent to my secondary e-mail  I get the same result.
