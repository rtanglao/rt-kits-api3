My download speed is ~85Mbps and I use Ubuntu 20.04. </p><p>Installing a download manager extension only improved the speed to ~300KB/s (I tried Multithreaded Download Manager. I also tried increasing the number of threads in preferences to no effect).  </p><p>The problem has persisted over time and across multiple restarts. This problem does not persist in other applications (Steam, for example).Neither disabling my VPN or running sudo UFW disable affected the speed (didn't restart because UFW disable doesn't require a restart [I think] and due to the above paragraph). </p><p>All solutions I have found have been related only to Windows users, hence why I am asking this even though there is a plethora of threads on this same issue. Any responses and help is appreciated! </p>",linux;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-940;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1462103;,valerieobrien64
