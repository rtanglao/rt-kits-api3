So for example, when I open a .pdf in the file explorer it opens up in the Edge browser. When I open a .pdf in the download menu in Firefox the file does open in a pdf-explorer version of Edge. That is Edge will kinda open a new application just to show the .pdf, with no options for tabs or in general work as a web browser, it will only be a .pdf viewer.  I would prefer for Firefox to open the .pdf in the normal Edge browser. Is there any way I can fix that? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,other,en-US,"",trygveruud

Ads do not play either, and instead after about 15-30 seconds of buffering the ""skip ad"" button appears in the lower right hand corner of the video. Videos play normally on both Chrome and Edge, and all other media content appears to load correctly (music/spotify, videos on social media websites, etc.) </p><p>So far I have tried: - Running Firefox in troubleshoot mode - Refreshing Firefox - Clearing the cache - Disabling and re-enabling hardware acceleration (didn't work either way) - Uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox - Rebooting my machine - Waiting for the problem to fix itself (it's been two weeks on my main desktop/tower and it's still not working).  </p><p>At this point the only thing I haven't tried is messing with advanced config settings, and I'm avoiding that since I have no idea what any of them actually do (despite what certain reddit threads recommend).  </p><p>As far as I'm aware, no specific update to either of my machines or Firefox has preceded the issue appearing. It's been going on on my desktop computer for about two weeks, the problem just started on my laptop last night.  </p><p>It's worth nothing that I usually use UBlock Origin, Simple Tab Groups, and Facebook container. Those extensions are not currently installed since I had to reset my browser in the process of trying to fix the issue.  </p><p>I can also confirm it's not an internet issue; speed tests show normal download/upload speeds for my wifi, and those have not varied since the issue began.
