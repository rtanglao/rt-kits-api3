When I pop out inspect element to its own window, it looks like the first image attached. However, dragging it and maximizing it on my second monitor makes it look like the second image. Obviously, this is less than ideal for this layout. As far as I'm aware, this is purely a responsive layout, with no user overrides (<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/3-pane_mode"" rel=""nofollow"">3-pane mode's docs</a> only say ""At narrower browser window widths, the tabs appear below the CSS Rules pane.) My question then, is if there is a way to override this? If so, I'm all ears, and if not, I do think that's something that should be considered. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ShawnShyGuy

There should be a checkbox that asks: ARE YOU SURE ? There must be an EASY way to get the articles back. While I'm here I'd like to say that a lot of the help files or comments don't have any pictures. A picture IS worth a thousand words so it would be nice to have more of that. Someone could ask you what someone else looked like and you could sit there and type a long time or (so much faster) show them a picture if you have one, right ? Let's go a step further and use a dismantled car engine. Even more complex. Are you starting to get it ?  :-) </p>",desktop;customize;firefox-860;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ComputerPain

For some reason, Firefox no longer seems to keep me logged in to Lastpass and Pushbullet. More than half of the time I load a new session, Lastpass will give me a cookies notice but does remember my details in the fields, whereas Pushbullet shoves a login screen in my face and I have to go through the hassle of signing in with Google. </p><p>My browser has always been set to erase everything on close, but this has never effected extensions, so I'm surprised it suddenly does so. I don't think my settings are any different than they have been previously. I've tried making the lastpass and pushbullet websites as exceptions and playing with various privacy settings but am unable to replicate the 'correct' behaviour I had before. </p><p>Am I missing something here please? Has something changed in recent versions of Firefox? </p><p>Settings are: Standard tracking protection Always do not track Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed is checked with <a href=""http://Lastpass.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Lastpass.com</a> and <a href=""http://Pushbullet.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Pushbullet.com</a> as exceptions All options under 'Logins and passwords' unchecked Always use private browsing mode, remember browsing and download history, and remember search and form history are all unchecked Clear history when firefox closes is checked, and in settings, all boxes are checked </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,customize,en-US,1396296;1396297;1396300;1396301;,Lewis7247

I've posted them on MS message boards but no one is experiencing them (don't notice?  Don't care?).  I use Firefox, and while I don't believe Firefox is the problem, I thought I'd post some of them here (the short version).  </p><p>Links open by themselves without me clicking or tapping on them.   When I'm in a Hotmail email or message board compose screen, or a web page with fields to enter personal information, very often when I click to a spot, the screen scrolls up by itself (happens in Chrome too).  Sometimes, writing an email, when I click to a spot, the cursor will instead appear a few lines up (not where I clicked).  Even if I don't click, the cursor might, all of a sudden, jump somewhere else while I'm typing, or paused typing (even in a Google search field).   At times, when I hit the backspace - to remove characters, text - I'm taken back to the previous web page instead.  I have seen this complaint when I searched it.  But I don't want an Add On that disables the backspace. I just want it to work as it should, not take me back a page. </p><p>And no, it's not malware.   And I didn't have these issues with my old Windows 8 and 8.1 laptop. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,other,en-US,1396298;1396303;,Steve09
