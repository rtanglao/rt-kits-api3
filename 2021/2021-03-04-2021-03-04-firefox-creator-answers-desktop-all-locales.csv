The worst is my current case where you lose your gmail password and try to locate it with a search of the passwords but since gmail address is the user name for 100's of websites there are 100's of results to try to find the gmail password.   When it comes to Microsoft website there is zero results to Microsoft in the Firefox password search even though Firefox easily logs me in.  Why did Firefox stop allowing the user to see the current password being input to websites.  if they did not stop that access then I do not know how to do it anymore.

Someone could ask you what someone else looked like and you could sit there and type a long time or (so much faster) show them a picture if you have one, right ?

For some reason, Firefox no longer seems to keep me logged in to Lastpass and Pushbullet.

I've posted them on MS message boards but no one is experiencing them (don't notice?  Don't care?).  I use Firefox, and while I don't believe Firefox is the problem, I thought I'd post some of them here (the short version).  </p><p>Links open by themselves without me clicking or tapping on them.   When I'm in a Hotmail email or message board compose screen, or a web page with fields to enter personal information, very often when I click to a spot, the screen scrolls up by itself (happens in Chrome too).  Sometimes, writing an email, when I click to a spot, the cursor will instead appear a few lines up (not where I clicked).  Even if I don't click, the cursor might, all of a sudden, jump somewhere else while I'm typing, or paused typing (even in a Google search field).   At times, when I hit the backspace - to remove characters, text - I'm taken back to the previous web page instead.  I have seen this complaint when I searched it.  But I don't want an Add On that disables the backspace. I just want it to work as it should, not take me back a page. </p><p>And no, it's not malware.   And I didn't have these issues with my old Windows 8 and 8.1 laptop. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,other,en-US,1396298;1396303;1396316;,Steve09
