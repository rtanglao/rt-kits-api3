I'm currently using Firefox 86.0 in Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 64-bit) and for aeons I've been using Ctrl+Shift+ PgUp/PgDn to move tabs left and right, but a couple of updates ago I lost the ability to do so. Actually, I should say using the LEFT Ctrl and Shift buttons no longer works, as I ended up trying the right ones and I can still re-order tabs that way. However, I'm just so used to having my left hand working on that side of the keyboard, I always automatically press the left Ctrl+Shift, so I'd really like to get back to how things were until very recently. I was hoping doing another update to 86.0 yesterday would fix it, but it hasn't so here I am. </p><p>I've searched all over the web for a remedy, but all I see is people repeating the key combo, people recommending extensions that no longer exist (and I don't really want to install addons for something that used to be the default). I have not installed any addons for ages, have not tinkered with any settings (I can't even find any for key bindings) - all I did was let my system update Firefox, and that key combo was gone. (Note: since my system and apps get updated together, I can't actually be certain with was updating Firefox that did this, but I see no changed keyboard behavior elsewhere). </p><p>If anyone knows how to fix this, like a key in about:config or whatever, please let me know. PS: While searching the web, I've seen a lot of talk about related (Ctrl+Shift) combos I've never used - like Ctrl+Shift+ End to move the tab to the very end - and none of them work; the only Ctrl+Shift combo that works, and only with the right Ctrl+Shift, is Ctrl+Shift+ PgUp/PgDn for moving tabs left and right. I thought I should add that just in case it's related. </p>",linux;desktop;tabs;firefox-860;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1396452;1396474;1396476;1396504;,frank173

That is no longer possible it seems so now you have to search the passwords for that website to locate it and then display it that way.  But many times the current website is not saved under an obvious name.  This makes it next to impossible to locate what used to be right in front of you (current website logon password).  The worst is my current case where you lose your gmail password and try to locate it with a search of the passwords but since gmail address is the user name for 100's of websites there are 100's of results to try to find the gmail password.   When it comes to Microsoft website there is zero results to Microsoft in the Firefox password search even though Firefox easily logs me in.  Why did Firefox stop allowing the user to see the current password being input to websites.  if they did not stop that access then I do not know how to do it anymore.  Used to be a simple right click on the password field.  Then you could go direct to the password manager location of that website. </p>,desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1396939;1397039;1397046;1397102;,alanduq
