That is no longer possible it seems so now you have to search the passwords for that website to locate it and then display it that way.  But many times the current website is not saved under an obvious name.  This makes it next to impossible to locate what used to be right in front of you (current website logon password).  The worst is my current case where you lose your gmail password and try to locate it with a search of the passwords but since gmail address is the user name for 100's of websites there are 100's of results to try to find the gmail password.   When it comes to Microsoft website there is zero results to Microsoft in the Firefox password search even though Firefox easily logs me in.  Why did Firefox stop allowing the user to see the current password being input to websites.  if they did not stop that access then I do not know how to do it anymore.  Used to be a simple right click on the password field.  Then you could go direct to the password manager location of that website. </p>,desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",alanduq

Yet, moderator Cor-el said the <em>app.normandy</em> preferences will install new features and 'shield studies' anyways. I stopped downloading FF updates after v.84.

Nevertheless, Firefox installed this unwanted print 'update.' So my question is whether it is safe to turn off or delete all the app.normandy preferences in about:config ?

I've posted them on MS message boards but no one is experiencing them (don't notice?  Don't care?).  I use Firefox, and while I don't believe Firefox is the problem, I thought I'd post some of them here (the short version).  </p><p>Links open by themselves without me clicking or tapping on them.   When I'm in a Hotmail email or message board compose screen, or a web page with fields to enter personal information, very often when I click to a spot, the screen scrolls up by itself (happens in Chrome too).  Sometimes, writing an email, when I click to a spot, the cursor will instead appear a few lines up (not where I clicked).  Even if I don't click, the cursor might, all of a sudden, jump somewhere else while I'm typing, or paused typing (even in a Google search field).   At times, when I hit the backspace - to remove characters, text - I'm taken back to the previous web page instead.  I have seen this complaint when I searched it.  But I don't want an Add On that disables the backspace. I just want it to work as it should, not take me back a page. </p><p>And no, it's not malware.   And I didn't have these issues with my old Windows 8 and 8.1 laptop. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,other,en-US,1396298;1396303;1396316;,Steve09
