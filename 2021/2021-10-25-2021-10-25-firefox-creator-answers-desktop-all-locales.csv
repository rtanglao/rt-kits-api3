Whenever I go to a login page, and the username and password fields are auto populated because Firefox has remembered them, the cursor is positioned at the end of the username. Directly beneath the cursor is what looks like a droplet, blue in colour. Clicking on it does nothing. Clicking anywhere else on the page makes the droplet disappear, as does bringing up another app and then coming back to Firefox. I am using version 93.0 64 bit on Windows 10. I can't do a screen shot of it as bringing up snip and sketch causes it to disappear. </p><p>Thanks for your help, </p><p>Paul </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,tips,en-US,1453607;,p.ryan20
