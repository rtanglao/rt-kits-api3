Makes it easier to log in to different sites. I have found a situation that has been overlooked. Multiple sites use a persons e-mail address for identity. Different sites then would all use the one e-mail address for identity. Each site however would have a different password. So we have one ""name"" but multiple passwords connected to that name. Firefox doesnt realize that the one name has multiple passwords so everytime you login to a site that uses your email address as your identity, it asks if you may want to update your password. You have to refuse everytime because the different sites have a different password. If you update the password, each site will now have the password of the last updated password. Its a issue that needs to be fixed so Firefox recognizes how a Email address=Name can have multiple passwords because different sites are using the same name. It looks like Firefox isnt making the connection that different sites are being visited by the same person so some information will be consistent among different sites visited. Thus not realizing that its correct that the ""same"" name has a password that is different for this new site. </p><p>Is there a workaround? thx. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1446643;,romeemore

However, I keep getting a pop-up every once in awhile to upgrade to the newer version, which I deny because of the background color changes, and I have continually asked the support team to keep the color changes the same but have heard nothing back from them concerning this issue and when I try to change the colors back to their previous settings I cannot find the means to do so and I have tried to go into the themes/color options to no avail.

Here is what happens: </p><p>Most of the websites I visit, if they have more that 1 language, Firefox loads different language when I load a new page on that site. </p><p>For Example: I go to <a href=""http://prestashop.com"" rel=""nofollow"">prestashop.com</a> and the site loads in Russian. Then I click Templates in the main menu, and the page is loaded in Polish. Then I click on Modules in the menu and that page is loaded in German. And this happens randomly, not every time. </p><p>Second problem: I try to open a product on some online store and it redirects me to the previous page I was in. I try to login in other site and when I click on the login button it redirects me to the previous page again. That happens on many sites I visit, but not all. </p><p>I tried cleaning the Cache, Cookies and etc - nothing changed. Reinstalled Firefox and logged with my profile, the problems are still there. If I do not log with my profile Firefox is working normally. </p><p>Is there a way to fix this and not by creating new profile, because I have a ton of bookmarks and logins that I don't want to loose? </p><p>This is not happening in private mode. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-920;firefox-9201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",service104
