Here is my quandary:  When I update to the newer version (92.0.1) of Firefox on my Windows 10 Laptop it changes the background &amp; Menu Bar to a white-ish/gray color and I cannot get my menu bar color back to the black background with white text that was in the 86.0.1 (64-bit) version.   The bookmarks toolbar remains a white-ish/gray color &amp; with the Menu bar the same color it all blends in and I do not like that.  I would rather have the Menu bar remain as a black background with white text &amp; the bookmarks toolbar remain the white-ish/gray color.  Is there a way to change the colors back to what they were in the 86.0.1 version?  I have currently uninstalled the 92.0.1 version and reinstalled the 86.0.1 version and that is what I am working with now.  However, I keep getting a pop-up every once in awhile to upgrade to the newer version, which I deny because of the background color changes, and I have continually asked the support team to keep the color changes the same but have heard nothing back from them concerning this issue and when I try to change the colors back to their previous settings I cannot find the means to do so and I have tried to go into the themes/color options to no avail.  Is there a way to keep the colors in the 92.0.1 version the same as they were in the 86.0.1 version?
