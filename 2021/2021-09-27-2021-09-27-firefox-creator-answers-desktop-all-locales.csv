PDF file is displayed properly but when we copy text from it and try to paste it somewhere then text is not correct.

Here is what happens: </p><p>Most of the websites I visit, if they have more that 1 language, Firefox loads different language when I load a new page on that site. </p><p>For Example: I go to <a href=""http://prestashop.com"" rel=""nofollow"">prestashop.com</a> and the site loads in Russian. Then I click Templates in the main menu, and the page is loaded in Polish. Then I click on Modules in the menu and that page is loaded in German. And this happens randomly, not every time. </p><p>Second problem: I try to open a product on some online store and it redirects me to the previous page I was in. I try to login in other site and when I click on the login button it redirects me to the previous page again. That happens on many sites I visit, but not all. </p><p>I tried cleaning the Cache, Cookies and etc - nothing changed. Reinstalled Firefox and logged with my profile, the problems are still there. If I do not log with my profile Firefox is working normally. </p><p>Is there a way to fix this and not by creating new profile, because I have a ton of bookmarks and logins that I don't want to loose? </p><p>This is not happening in private mode. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-920;firefox-9201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",service104

While working in non-private mode I checked, that the setting for removing the cookies on closing is set to off. Then I tried adding some websites to the exception list for this setting, no luck. I made sure that cookies on those websites are persistent, not session only, and they are working in other browsers. I tried disabling the plugins, but it didn't help either. It's somewhat annoying, because now I have to adjust cookie preferences every time I visit my favourite websites.
