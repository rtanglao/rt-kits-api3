This article <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/import-login-data-file"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/import-login-data-file</a> explains how to import passwords from file, but this option is missing. The only option available is Import from another browser. </p><p>From here  <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1702336"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1702336</a> it looks like the feature was disabled 9 months ago. It is not clear what is the workaround in interim and what is the current state of resolution. For example, how do I use passwords CSV file to load into Microsoft Edge or Chrome and then import this data from that browser back to FireFox? </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",iskovalev
