This means that the spellchecker continually attempts to change my correct spelling to incorrect USA spelling.  eg gaol to jail, colour to color, cheque to check, paedophile to pedophile, anaesthetic to anesthetic, and on and on.  Its absolute crap!  Changing to the correct spelling is a pain in the neck! </p><p>There are any number of English English dictionaries available. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",alanh99

This article <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/import-login-data-file"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/import-login-data-file</a> explains how to import passwords from file, but this option is missing. The only option available is Import from another browser. </p><p>From here  <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1702336"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1702336</a> it looks like the feature was disabled 9 months ago. It is not clear what is the workaround in interim and what is the current state of resolution. For example, how do I use passwords CSV file to load into Microsoft Edge or Chrome and then import this data from that browser back to FireFox? </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",iskovalev
