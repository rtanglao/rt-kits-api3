I installed Firefox on my laptop a long time ago, but I cannot access my bookmarks on my laptop because my laptop had been out of order since this past weekend.  Today I decided to install Firefox on my android phone to see if I could view my bookmarks.  I have a privacy phone and all software comes from one of three different websites and Google isn't one of those websites that I download from.  I downloaded the Firefox software from a website by the name of APK Pure, but I didn't see  download for mobile apps.  I have no idea on how to proceed.  I really would like to be able to transfer my bookmarks from my laptop to my android phone, but if I have to go through Edge or Chrome to accomplish this then I will settle on just viewing the bookmarks, but I can't even do that.  Thanks! </p>",desktop;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",amccaleb

A separate frame hold a table of contents where the user clicks on javascript-generated links to load the desired chapter into the first frame. </p><p>My problem seems to be that the javascript that creates the table of contents does not seem to be executing, or at least, part of it is not, as most of the links in the ToC frame do not show up. </p><p>For what it's worth, using MS Internet Explorer, this was enabled by checking the option inside ""Advanced Internet Options"" called ""Allow active content to run files on My Computer"". </p><p>Unfortunately, until today, the e-books worked without a hitch in Firefox.

This includes taking bookmarks from folders in the bookmark menu. Folders seem to be in the right order, and some bookmarks are, but most bookmarks are in the wrong place and order.

We got some complaints about the performance of the games when they are played with the firefox browser, as the game slows down drastically. So we made a few performance tests on firefox as well as on other browsers. The result was, that others Browsers (like Chrome, Edge, Opera and Safari) handle the game with 50-60FPS*. But firefox sadly just was able to handle 20FPS*. As we wanted to figure out the root cause we played around with the hardware boost which can be defined on all browsers (not on Safari). Interesting was, that if this feature is turn off, all browsers was between 20-40FPS*. But when you turn the feature on, just firefox stay with the 20FSP* - the other browsers increase by 20-30FPS*. <strong>This leads us to the conclusion, that the hardware booster is not working as intended on the firefox browser.</strong> When we check the system-set-ups we use for the tests, we facing one more interesting case which can help identify the root cause: There was few test cases runs on hardware which have a dedicated graphic-card in use and they reached the 50FPS* also with the Firefox browser. But any maschine with just an inbuilt GPU wasn't able to get there. So we assume that FireFox has problems with the hardware boost on inbuilt GPUs. </p><p>Does anybody know about this?

AND OTHER PROBLEMS,"<p>I think the title says it all, but to repeat, drag and drop, (either URLs or images), from Firefox 95 to Windows desktop stopped working on the current version after I installed it fresh in W7pro.  It still works on my W10 machine.  That functionality is literally on all other browsers, including yours on Win10.  I will NOT turn Windows UAC back on, as has been suggested by many.  It was and still is a P.I.T.A. and I don't need user accounts, as I am the only user. UAC sets all kinds of traps on the computer, and spreads like a cancer, and interrupts everything with popup security messages constantly that are totally unnecessary.  </p><p>What this does to me the user: </p><p>It makes me have to do a bunch of additional steps to do what I used to do with a mouse movement and still do on Firefox in Windows 10.  So it creates an operational difference between my older laptop with w7 and my PC with W10.  I might add that I was using Vivaldi on my w7 machine, and will go back to doing so because of these issues. </p><p>Now, to save an image on just the W7 machine, I have to right click, choose ""Save As"" from the drop down context menu, then click on an okay button, and Firefox puts it wherever it wants on the desktop, and I have to go looking for it, then drag it to where I want it. I used to simply drag it to where I wanted with a single mouse operation. </p><p>On a URL, now I have to highlight and copy the URL, Right click the desktop, and using windows shortcut creator, create a new shortcut then paste the URL into it and name it, whereas I used to be able to simply drag the URL onto the desktop. </p><p>This is the age old battle of making something new just for the sake of doing so, and eliminating functionality that everyone wanted and was using, and providing no means for users to give input on what they want. </p><p>I've seen some of the other responses to people asking about this same problem, and no offense to some of you who are volunteers and trying your best, but some of them are ridiculously complicated workarounds.  I build my own PC's and your instructions were more than I wanted to mess with.  Particularly when the issue I'm having is one of functionality that is no longer there but was, and which every other modern browser has. </p><p>I find myself wondering why companies like Mozilla are so intent on making ""the community"" (the users) answer questions that the staff should be addressing.  Passing that task off onto unpaid volunteers, many who have no clue how the designers designed something that now doesn't work, is in my opinion just the cheap new corporate model of ""we don't want to be bothered.""  Make changes, screw things up, defer complaints and questions to other users, who have no answers (and can't sometimes do anything because gee, they aren't the developers). </p><p>Overall I like the browser, was one of the first promoters of Firefox to everyone, and have used it now for decades.  Off and on.  Off when the developers screwed it up, which was often, on again when they finally got it working again.  But the whole time, the attitude has been that we the users are somehow always the problem or add-ons or extensions are always the problem, and so we need to reinstall a new ""clean"" version and see if the problem is still there.""  That has been the pat solution from Mozilla for those decades.  The add-ons and extensions are because features are needed that are not included in the browser.  Hint. Hint.  </p><p>Other problems?  No password import other than from IE or Chrome.  Why should I have to go install and set up IE or Chrome, just to migrate my passwords?  Vivaldi is a chromium based browser.  Why does your importer not work on those?  Why no ability to do it using an .xls or .csv file??? </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-950;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",ajenn55
