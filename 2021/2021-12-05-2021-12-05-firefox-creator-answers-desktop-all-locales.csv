The video just never loads. Debugging steps I have done. </p><p>1) Disabled Hardware Acceleration 2) Deleted all cookies &amp; cache 3) Ran Firefox in Troubleshoot Mode 4) Uninstalled Firefox &amp; Reinstalled 5) Not a part of my debug but I recently did a fresh install of windows on my computer and installed Firefox with the same issue. I do get videos to work on both Edge and Chrome </p><p>I am at a loss at this point and any helping hints would be useful. I have an inkling that it might be put to my playback device but it wouldn't explain why it plays just fine on other browsers.  </p><p>Any ideas? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-940;firefox-9402;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",jbbailoutgreely7

However, I don't want it to do that, I want it to refresh the forms as if I am visiting the page from new. How can I make it so that Firefox does this? It is weird because it used to do this but now no longer does. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,other,en-US,"",lsmurf

I've noticed Mozilla is heavy handed at shoving updates down your throat that break things but always come up short on communicating what changes were made.  The last update broke printing and now it takes 2 minutes for timeout to occur every time I want to print a page. So I know there is a large community of users who want to turn off update nags, suppose every one of those users submitted a new complaint on a daily basis to nag Mozilla to turn the f*cking update nag off.  What will it take? </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-930;,firefox,customize,en-US,1464160;,MarkHHunt
