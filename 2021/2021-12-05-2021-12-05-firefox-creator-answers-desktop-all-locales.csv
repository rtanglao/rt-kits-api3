Once I set up FFox years ago, I long forgot what my email sign in was, of the three emails I have.... aol, yahoo and gmail. </p><p>Recently a file corrupted. Apple techs suggested opening second admin as test user. Test user admin worked fine. In process of testing, I discovered FFox in THAT tester admin opened differently.... no more Bookmarks Toolbar, no History Trail. </p><p>One Apple tech suggested looking into 2nd admin (test) account to see my sign in. It was AOL acct. I did not select a sign in acct. I simply opened FFox browser to test it. Went back to 1st acct (original) and FFox signed in with Yahoo acct. I never realized this. All those years had been opening through Yahoo acct. </p><p>Apple tech said all I needed to do was switch AOL acct back to Yahoo sign in to once again see all my previous Bookmarks Toolbar and History Trail. I've spent HOURS searching how to simply switch accounts in same admin browser. Why is something so simple, impossible to find. Perhaps it can't be done. </p><p>The closest I came was to do this - click upper right corner (3 lines) in browser and click on email address &gt; click Acct settings &gt; click Manage acct. When the Accounts page appears, I see only a Primary email entry (AOL) with no options next to it, and below it, Secondary email (which says None) with button next to it indicating Add. </p><p>When I click it, new window appears asking to enter Secondary email address. I enter yahoo address, click SAVE and red box appears saying ""ACCOUNT ALRERADY EXISTS""  I KNOW THE ACCOUNT ALREADY EXISTS. IF FFOX KNOWS THIS, WHY WON'T IT ALLOW ME TO SWITCH TO IT????????? </p><p>That's as far as I can go. Even signing into the Sync acct asking which account to sign in with, I use Yahoo but next time I open FFox, still back to AOL. </p><p>I will say, once I was in my 2nd test admin and opened Chrome to test as I did FFox, Chrome AUTOMATICALLY updated to same Chrome from 1st admin (corrupted) which included same Bookmarks etc from 1st admin Chrome.  </p><p>But not so with FFox. Not so. </p><p>If there is anyone on the planet who may have knowledge of how to simply switch sign in account from AOL to Yahoo, I would LOVE to meet that person. Thank you! </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,"",fives

The video just never loads. Debugging steps I have done. </p><p>1) Disabled Hardware Acceleration 2) Deleted all cookies &amp; cache 3) Ran Firefox in Troubleshoot Mode 4) Uninstalled Firefox &amp; Reinstalled 5) Not a part of my debug but I recently did a fresh install of windows on my computer and installed Firefox with the same issue. I do get videos to work on both Edge and Chrome </p><p>I am at a loss at this point and any helping hints would be useful. I have an inkling that it might be put to my playback device but it wouldn't explain why it plays just fine on other browsers.  </p><p>Any ideas? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-940;firefox-9402;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",jbbailoutgreely7

I've noticed Mozilla is heavy handed at shoving updates down your throat that break things but always come up short on communicating what changes were made.  The last update broke printing and now it takes 2 minutes for timeout to occur every time I want to print a page. So I know there is a large community of users who want to turn off update nags, suppose every one of those users submitted a new complaint on a daily basis to nag Mozilla to turn the f*cking update nag off.  What will it take? </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-930;,firefox,customize,en-US,1464160;,MarkHHunt
