I downloaded other Browsers and they are working just fine so this tells me there is an issue with Firefox. After a while, Firefox would randomly crash for no apparent reason, while loading a new webpage or installing an Extension. I have sent Feedback for every crash. I have closed all of the Tabs I can that I am not using on Firefox, cleared the Cache, Cookies &amp; History, Restarted Firefox &amp; my PC and everything I can think of. Now, I just started getting an Error Message at the top of Firefox that says this: Firefox is running out of disk space. Website contents may not display properly &amp; it includes a link to read on how to optimize disk usage. I followed the Instructions in that Article and it did not help. I am at wits end. I am ready to Uninstall and Reinstall Firefox and see if that fixes the issue but I hate to lose all of my Extensions and ETC. Can someone please help me with this?

Digis GPON-os internetet és Telenoros mobilnetet is használok, és Firefox esetén mindkét alkalommal azt tapasztalom (leginkább a Facebookon), hogy nem töltődnek be a tartalmak, például a képek. Érdekes módon csak Firefoxnál tapasztalom, de különböző helyeken és gépeken használva is. Edge esetén nincs ilyen probléma. Helyesebben néha ott is akadozik az internet (vagy inkább a Facebook), de az Edge legfeljebb homokórázik egy kicsit, viszont a képek végül is mindig betöltődnek. Már downgrade-eltem is 92.0.1-re és DNS-t is váltottam, de akkor is ez a helyzet. Olvastam róla, hogy a Firefoxnak van valami bugja a Facebookkal kapcsolatban, nem tudom, hogy ez az-e.

Once I set up FFox years ago, I long forgot what my email sign in was, of the three emails I have.... aol, yahoo and gmail. </p><p>Recently a file corrupted. Apple techs suggested opening second admin as test user. Test user admin worked fine. In process of testing, I discovered FFox in THAT tester admin opened differently.... no more Bookmarks Toolbar, no History Trail. </p><p>One Apple tech suggested looking into 2nd admin (test) account to see my sign in. It was AOL acct. I did not select a sign in acct. I simply opened FFox browser to test it. Went back to 1st acct (original) and FFox signed in with Yahoo acct. I never realized this. All those years had been opening through Yahoo acct. </p><p>Apple tech said all I needed to do was switch AOL acct back to Yahoo sign in to once again see all my previous Bookmarks Toolbar and History Trail. I've spent HOURS searching how to simply switch accounts in same admin browser. Why is something so simple, impossible to find. Perhaps it can't be done. </p><p>The closest I came was to do this - click upper right corner (3 lines) in browser and click on email address &gt; click Acct settings &gt; click Manage acct. When the Accounts page appears, I see only a Primary email entry (AOL) with no options next to it, and below it, Secondary email (which says None) with button next to it indicating Add. </p><p>When I click it, new window appears asking to enter Secondary email address. I enter yahoo address, click SAVE and red box appears saying ""ACCOUNT ALRERADY EXISTS""  I KNOW THE ACCOUNT ALREADY EXISTS. IF FFOX KNOWS THIS, WHY WON'T IT ALLOW ME TO SWITCH TO IT????????? </p><p>That's as far as I can go. Even signing into the Sync acct asking which account to sign in with, I use Yahoo but next time I open FFox, still back to AOL. </p><p>I will say, once I was in my 2nd test admin and opened Chrome to test as I did FFox, Chrome AUTOMATICALLY updated to same Chrome from 1st admin (corrupted) which included same Bookmarks etc from 1st admin Chrome.  </p><p>But not so with FFox. Not so. </p><p>If there is anyone on the planet who may have knowledge of how to simply switch sign in account from AOL to Yahoo, I would LOVE to meet that person.
