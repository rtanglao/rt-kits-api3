I've noticed Mozilla is heavy handed at shoving updates down your throat that break things but always come up short on communicating what changes were made.  The last update broke printing and now it takes 2 minutes for timeout to occur every time I want to print a page. So I know there is a large community of users who want to turn off update nags, suppose every one of those users submitted a new complaint on a daily basis to nag Mozilla to turn the f*cking update nag off.  What will it take? </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-930;,firefox,customize,en-US,1464160;,MarkHHunt
