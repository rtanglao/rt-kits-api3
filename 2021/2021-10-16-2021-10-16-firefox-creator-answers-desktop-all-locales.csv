With lots of help from this forum I wrote a userchrome.css file to make several changes to the appearance. </p><p>On a new Windows 10 machine I installed the same version of Firefox (since I don't care for the latest one).  I added my old profle to the new installation and selected it as the default. </p><p>Unfortunately, when I opened the program I was prompted to create a new profile; there didn't seem to be any way around this.  So I let it happen and tried simply copying my old chrome folder into it - I thought at least I could make the visual changes even if I couldn't import my bookmarks and so on. </p><p>But this didn't work either: when I run the program, none of the expected changes are there. </p><p>Presumably I've done something wrong, but what, exactly?  I'd be grateful for any thoughts.  Ideally, I'd like to use the whole of the old Win7 profile but if that's not [ossible at least changing the appearance would be pleasant. </p><p>Many thanks. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",mail226
