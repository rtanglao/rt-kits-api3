Suddenly Firefox is useless and won't load anything. Chrome works just fine, and so I know it's not an internet or wifi problem.  So far the ONLY solution I can find is that I restart my machine. Sometimes this means I can use Firefox for a week, sometimes it's only a few hours before it happens again.  </p><p>Here are things I've tried (and have not worked) based on various threads including Firefox's own help pages: 1) Tried to change network settings to ""no proxy"" 2) Ensured that the ""network.dns.disablePrefetch"" is set to ""true"" (also network.dns.PrefetchFromHTTPS). 3) Tried closing everything and exiting Firefox and restarting </p><p>All other solutions seem focused on OTHER problems (e.g., specific sites, all browsers don't work.)  Any and all help would be more than welcome. I'm getting to the point that I'm going to just ditch firefox and port all my bookmarks over to chrome. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",claire.arthur81

When I try to access them with the VPN turned off I legitimately get a 403. However, when I turn on the VPN firefox keeps showing 403 while other browsers work fine. This also works the other way around. When I turn off the VPN and try to go to one of the internal sites I don't get a 403 (as I should), instead firefox gets stuck at the page loading stage and nothing happens. There seems to be some kind of caching or optimization going on, but it's terribly interfering. Deleting cookies, caches, etc doesn't help at all. The only thing that helps in this situation is restarting firefox. </p>",mac-os;desktop;beta;fix-problems;firefox-940;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",exsdis

It doesn't allow the action and gives me the following error:  <strong>You haven't allowed Facebook access to your microphone</strong> </p><p>The problem is that I did, both in browser and on-site, and I can make audio calls and video calls with microphone working on the messenger just fine. Only sending the voice clip doesn't work. I don't know why and whether the issue is with Firefox or with Facebook's code for Firefox, but the issue definitely is annoying. </p><p>I've also changed Firefox privacy controls from Strict to Standard, and that didn't help either. </p><p>If anyone knows what to do, please help. I love using Firefox, and it's been my default browser for like, decades, and I don't intend to leave it because of this one issue... it's just frustrating. And I've seen some people experiencing the same issue on the web. </p><p>I don't know.
