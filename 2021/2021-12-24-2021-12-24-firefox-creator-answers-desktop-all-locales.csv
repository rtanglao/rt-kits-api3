Merry Christmas! </p><p>I have noticed since yesterday (but maybe it is related to the 95.0.2 Firefox update) that Firefox tries to access some weird websites each time it starts. </p><p>The websites Firefox tries to access are various (non-exhaustive list): </p> <ul><li> <a href=""http://itchytidying.com"" rel=""nofollow"">itchytidying.com</a> </li><li> <a href=""http://jollytestpartying.com"" rel=""nofollow"">jollytestpartying.com</a> </li><li> <a href=""http://dateddeed.com"" rel=""nofollow"">dateddeed.com</a> </li><li> <a href=""http://censusmiles.com"" rel=""nofollow"">censusmiles.com</a> </li><li> <a href=""http://unpleasantconcrete.com"" rel=""nofollow"">unpleasantconcrete.com</a> </li><li> <a href=""http://pacifyrespirator.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pacifyrespirator.com</a> </li><li> (...) </li></ul> <p>Kaspersky Internet Security blocks all those access attempts and notifies me with a ""Download denied"" event and a ""Probability of unauthorized software download"" message (see uploaded image). </p><p>I immediately suspected one of my Firefox extensions, so I disabled them all... But the issue kept on occurring. Could Firefox be infected? (I ran Kaspersky Internet Security through my whole PC, and it found nothing ; I did the same with the free version of MalwareBytes ; nothing again). </p><p>I find it hard to believe that this behavior is normal and that these alerts are false positives from Kaspersky Internet Security...

Sometimes the checks can take around 3-5 minutes to complete.   </p><p>Any videos or streams come to an eventual halt.   </p><p>I have tried tweak a few settings in about:config such as <strong>app.update.interval</strong> </p><p>I have tried uninstalling and re-installing the browser - No change.  This still happens usually about 5-8 times a day.   </p><p>This computer is used for medical emergencies for our clients.  We need a full functioning browser. I thought Firefox was that browser but I am beginning to think about installing something else now. </p><p>In these situations lives could be put at risk and I want to remedy this problem now before the new year. I imagine we will have a lot of patients coming in.  I need to quickly submit forms at times and I really need a stable browser. </p><p>a) Can I turn off updates?   I would prefer to check manually for updates once a week or so via Help -&gt; About b) Can I reduce the frequency of the checks for updates? c) Is this going to be a normal feature for Firefox from now on? </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,other,en-US,1468778;1468781;1468782;,reloadedx23
