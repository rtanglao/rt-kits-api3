Every time I download a file the download speed in kb/s freezes and the download does not progress although there is no indication that the dl is paused. The only solution that works is for me to click pause and then click continue multiple times for the dl to continue. Is there anything I can do for this to work? I already reinstalled firefox but it still does not work. </p>,desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",rakusueru

Sitting here on Christmas Eve at work trying to fix Firefox. </p><p>In a nutshell I have a really really annoying bug with Firefox which is going to cause me to pull all my hair out. </p><p>In the past the program used to check for updates and it used to work fine during this procedure.   </p><p>Lately though I've been experiencing a really strange bug.   </p><p>Whenever Firefox checks for updates the browser then cannot load a single webpage or anything while it is checking.  Sometimes the checks can take around 3-5 minutes to complete.   </p><p>Any videos or streams come to an eventual halt.   </p><p>I have tried tweak a few settings in about:config such as <strong>app.update.interval</strong> </p><p>I have tried uninstalling and re-installing the browser - No change.  This still happens usually about 5-8 times a day.   </p><p>This computer is used for medical emergencies for our clients.  We need a full functioning browser. I thought Firefox was that browser but I am beginning to think about installing something else now. </p><p>In these situations lives could be put at risk and I want to remedy this problem now before the new year. I imagine we will have a lot of patients coming in.  I need to quickly submit forms at times and I really need a stable browser. </p><p>a) Can I turn off updates?   I would prefer to check manually for updates once a week or so via Help -&gt; About b) Can I reduce the frequency of the checks for updates? c) Is this going to be a normal feature for Firefox from now on? </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,other,en-US,1468778;1468781;1468782;,reloadedx23

I've added the google search box at the top right hand page but I hate that too.
