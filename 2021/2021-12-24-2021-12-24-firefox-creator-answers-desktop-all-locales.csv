I have Firefox version 95.0.2 (64-bit) with Windows 10 with the latest updates installed. I have a Dell laptop with an i7 cpu and 63 GB of RAM. This does not occur with other browsers. Reloading the page does not fix it, only a complete shutdown and startup of Firefox. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-950;firefox-9502;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",bp1952

Merry Christmas! </p><p>I have noticed since yesterday (but maybe it is related to the 95.0.2 Firefox update) that Firefox tries to access some weird websites each time it starts. </p><p>The websites Firefox tries to access are various (non-exhaustive list): </p> <ul><li> <a href=""http://itchytidying.com"" rel=""nofollow"">itchytidying.com</a> </li><li> <a href=""http://jollytestpartying.com"" rel=""nofollow"">jollytestpartying.com</a> </li><li> <a href=""http://dateddeed.com"" rel=""nofollow"">dateddeed.com</a> </li><li> <a href=""http://censusmiles.com"" rel=""nofollow"">censusmiles.com</a> </li><li> <a href=""http://unpleasantconcrete.com"" rel=""nofollow"">unpleasantconcrete.com</a> </li><li> <a href=""http://pacifyrespirator.com"" rel=""nofollow"">pacifyrespirator.com</a> </li><li> (...) </li></ul> <p>Kaspersky Internet Security blocks all those access attempts and notifies me with a ""Download denied"" event and a ""Probability of unauthorized software download"" message (see uploaded image). </p><p>I immediately suspected one of my Firefox extensions, so I disabled them all... But the issue kept on occurring. Could Firefox be infected? (I ran Kaspersky Internet Security through my whole PC, and it found nothing ; I did the same with the free version of MalwareBytes ; nothing again). </p><p>I find it hard to believe that this behavior is normal and that these alerts are false positives from Kaspersky Internet Security... What do you think guys?  </p><p>Regards, Jerome. </p>",desktop;malware;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-950;firefox-9502;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1468846;1468847;1468850;1468855;,jerome.ducaud

I opened customize toolbar and it was there at the bottom. Also my added extensions could be seen there. I dragged the Home button over and it was added to the area on the right, but nothing on the toolbar. I tried troubleshooting, nothing helped, I tried refreshing Firefox. That did nothing as well. My extensions have been disabled by safe mode and I still have no Home button. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,customize,en-US,1468852;,silvanet

Pc jsem prohnal antivirem a vším možným abych vyloučil nějaké napadení virem. Musel jsem stáhnout Chrome kde mi vše jede bez problémů. Asi se budu muset s Mozzilou po 12 letech rozloučit.

Sitting here on Christmas Eve at work trying to fix Firefox. </p><p>In a nutshell I have a really really annoying bug with Firefox which is going to cause me to pull all my hair out. </p><p>In the past the program used to check for updates and it used to work fine during this procedure.   </p><p>Lately though I've been experiencing a really strange bug.   </p><p>Whenever Firefox checks for updates the browser then cannot load a single webpage or anything while it is checking.  Sometimes the checks can take around 3-5 minutes to complete.   </p><p>Any videos or streams come to an eventual halt.   </p><p>I have tried tweak a few settings in about:config such as <strong>app.update.interval</strong> </p><p>I have tried uninstalling and re-installing the browser - No change.  This still happens usually about 5-8 times a day.   </p><p>This computer is used for medical emergencies for our clients.  We need a full functioning browser. I thought Firefox was that browser but I am beginning to think about installing something else now. </p><p>In these situations lives could be put at risk and I want to remedy this problem now before the new year. I imagine we will have a lot of patients coming in.  I need to quickly submit forms at times and I really need a stable browser. </p><p>a) Can I turn off updates?   I would prefer to check manually for updates once a week or so via Help -&gt; About b) Can I reduce the frequency of the checks for updates? c) Is this going to be a normal feature for Firefox from now on? </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,other,en-US,1468778;1468781;1468782;,reloadedx23
