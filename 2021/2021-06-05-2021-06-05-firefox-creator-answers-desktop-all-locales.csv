And then when I enter a search it assumes it is a URL and fails -- I can then only search if, after typing my search in the address bar, I must manually then go to the bottom of the recent address list and select the default search engine!  THIS IS CRAP, and an UNWANTED CHANGE FORCED ON ME. </p><p>I searched online and repeatedly only found the ""fix"" of setting ""keyw to disabled"" but that makes NO CHANGE. </p><p>The new behavior makes any search I do require relatively much more effort on my part -- really sucks and changes my entire ""way of life"" as I am a very active/frequent searcher! </p><p>Is there a fix (besides the ""keyw to disabled"" which does not work??

The thing that I don't like is that the top header is now very light in color.  This means that there is virtually no contrast with the items on top, making reading those items very difficult!  In addition, the bookmark list has changed.  Space between list of bookmarks has increased, which makes looking for bookmarks much more difficult. </p><p>I am all for faster browsers, but let's not get carried away with appearance redesigns that do not help improve one's experience.
