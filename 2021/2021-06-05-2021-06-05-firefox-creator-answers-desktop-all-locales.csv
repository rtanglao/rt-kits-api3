Nearly everything worked fine, apart from certain extensions (e.g. Google Container), which either didn't work at all, or wouldn't allow options to be saved. </p><p>The common factor seemed to be that these extensions needed ""sync storage"" and weren't able to access it when the profile was on the RAMdisk, even though it had worked fine when it was on the C drive.  (Note, it made no difference whether I had Firefox Sync configured to sync addon data or not - the relevant thing is that the extensions were using ""sync storage"" as their way of storing information locally.) </p><p>The workaround I eventually found was to move <strong>storage.sqlite</strong> and <strong>storage-sync-v2.sqlite</strong> back to my C drive, and create symlinks in my profile folder on the RAMDisk pointing back to them. </p><p>This isn't too bad: the size of the data is small and writes are fairly infrequent, and I can certainly live with the workaround. </p><p>However, it still seems like a bug, so I'm posting this (1) in case it's useful to anyone else who finds it, (2) to ask whether I should raise it on Bugzilla? </p><p>Some questions you might ask: </p> <ul><li> Was this specific profile corrupt? </li></ul> <p>That wasn't the problem: I could replicate the issue by creating a brand new clean profile on the RAMdisk. </p> <ul><li> Is this a problem with Firefox SQLite databases on the RAMdisk generally? </li></ul> <p>No: places.sqlite, cookies.sqlite and all the rest of them can be written and read just fine.  I wonder if the sync storage code is using different Windows APIs to access files than the rest of Firefox is? </p> <ul><li> Is this a problem with having the profile somewhere other than the C drive, rather than being RAMdisk-specific? </li></ul> <p>No: you can even put the profile on a USB flash drive and it works fine (well, slowly, but without the problem I described). </p> <ul><li> What if you create a directory junction so that the profile appears to be on the C drive, when it's on the RAMdisk? </li></ul> <p>That didn't work either - only moving the files physically back to the C drive fixed it. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",pg_78

Credo nell'Open. Sono un ricercatore e cerco di divulgare open tutto quello che scrivo. Stamattina vedo il ""nuovo"" Firefox che mi viene presentato come ""più nuovo, più bello, più performante ecc."", ma ciò che io VEDO (perché è ciò che VEDIAMO che conta e non ciò che ci contano) è che le freccette a sinistra avanti-indietro sono più piccole, il pulsante Mostra avanzamento download (che si usa spessissimo) è più piccolo e così pure il pulsante Apri menu applicazione. Quindi, nella sostanza, l'uso di Firefox per me da stamattina è diventato più scomodo. Questa è la novità (come diceva Lucio Dalla). Comprendo ovviamente la necessità di aggiornamenti e miglioramenti ""di sistema"", ma perché si debbano cambiare continuamente gli aspetti dell'interfaccia non lo capisco. Perché poi questi cambiamenti debbano essere sempre nel senso di usare caratteri SEMPRE PIU' PICCOLI lo capisco ancor meno. Voi direte: sei vecchio. Ma perché uno giovane non si rovina ugualmente la vista? Quanto potete continuare a rimpicciolire caratteri e simboli, finché non diventeranno microscopici: e allora, cosa avrete ottenuto? Notate che la logica del cambiamento NECESSARIO E CONTINUO è una logica consumistica e non di vero progressismo: la ribellione oggi consiste nel ribellarsi a queste logiche e difendere ciò che già è buono senza alcun bisogno di ""migliorarlo"" (in primis: il Mondo, la Terra, l'Aria, l'Acqua, la Realtà Reale). Chiedo a chi legge di inoltrare, se può, questa mia doglianza a chi può fare qualche cosa per evitare che al prossimo ""rinnovamento"" di Firefox io debba comprarmi una lente di ingrandimento per guardare lo schermo (e non ditemi che si può ingrandire: non si può passare il tempo ad ingrandire lo schermo).

However now I would be forced to manually migrate over all my settings, saved passwords, extension, etc from the old profile to this new one, just because for some reason distill works on that one.
