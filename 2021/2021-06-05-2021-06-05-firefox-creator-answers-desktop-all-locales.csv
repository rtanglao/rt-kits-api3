Latest build is less than expected. </p><p>The ""spectrum of tab"" - no tab demarcations The titles on webpages now use a condensed font, very difficult to read without increasing the font size - I am NOT going to CSS to resolve. The spacing of bookmarks - almost twice the vertical padding, so half the number in view. Loss of real estate on any given page due to vertical spacing of toolbars and tabs. Color schemes - choices are all bad, leaving us to spend hours customizing. </p><p>Chrome is looking good. Looks more like Firefox than ever before.

I have my one main firefox profile with all my bookmarks, addons, etc configured just the way I like it. however, I cant get distill to operate on that profile. At the suggestion of their help (which was only mildly helpful) I created a fresh firefox profile and added distill to that and of course, it works without issue. However now I would be forced to manually migrate over all my settings, saved passwords, extension, etc from the old profile to this new one, just because for some reason distill works on that one. Any thoughts or suggestions on what I can do to get distill working on my main old profile? </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",GUITARMAGEDDON

I had just the right amount of folders and links that could expand to the bottom of the screen and now it goes well off the bottom of the screen and requires scrolling back up and down to use the links I use for the office on the 24"" screen. Worse, my Firefox syncs with my laptop at home so on that 15"" screen its even an even worse problem. I can't find a way to close them all up the way they used to be. There was nothing wrong with the browser as it was. If anyone wanted a new look, they could select different themes rather than force this arbitrary update on all of us. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",symetec

Am I correct that firefox doesnt recommend returning to the previous version. So I simply want to do two things with the current version...go to single spacing in the drop down menus like the Bookmarks menu....and....change size of the test in the upper toolbars like the menu bar.

From the first page viewed in 89.0, any rapidly changing image on screen starts distorted - blocks of varying widths, maybe 10 points high, change like a distortion or static. I get it on THIS page; if I scroll up and down quickly, fragments of my text show up in broken blocks near the bottom; especially when I scroll from the white background to the dark block underneath. </p><p>I get it when trying to NOT-quickly scroll though the Troubleshooting Information Firefox provides when I hit the ""Share Data"" button. Seems to appear in... the last lower sixth of the screen of a full-screen window. In a smaller window, it'll happen in the lower HALF of the window. Happens on all three monitors of a three-monitor setup. </p><p>Most evident when scrolling a page quickly, trying to advance time on an in-page video, on first-load of graphics in page... is there any way to roll back this change, is there an alternate renderer or any other option? </p><p>Don't get me wrong, the interface change is awful, detaching the apparent tab-header from the page is weird, the simplified line-based icons in the URL bar are unsettling and the dialog ""window"" when trying to close multiple tabs in a window looking ever more like Chrome all really SUCK. BADLY. But I could put up with those like every other damned UI change. But the rendering breaking is a deal-breaker.
