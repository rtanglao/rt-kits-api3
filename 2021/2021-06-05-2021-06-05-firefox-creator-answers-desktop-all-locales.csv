The phone version of Firefox offers a reading list so I can temporarily save pages for later reading. Desktop, however, doesn't support this which means that what I have in my reading list on the phone, is not accessible on the desktop. </p><p>For desktop, I've downloaded a reading list add-on and saved some pages there. The problem here is that add on is not accessible on mobile which means I can't read any pages on mobile that I've saved on the desktop. </p><p>So basically, if I save something on the desktop reading list, it's on desktop only. If I save something on the mobile reading list, it's just there. </p><p>I can't save pages on one device and read them on another. I do not understand why Firefox offers a reading list on the mobile app but not on desktop. Whatever the reason, it's inconvenient. Also, I don't want to use Pocket because that means I'd have to download Pocket on the phone, I shouldn't need an app to build a small reading list. Saving the pages to my bookmarks isn't an option because it's inconvenient plus a bookmark is for long-term saving, a reading list is more temporary. </p><p>Any ideas on how I can just quickly temporarily save a page for later reading that will be available on both desktop and mobile?

I loved it.  The latest version of Firefox has ruined it.  Now we are forced to search from the address bar.  I hate, loathe, and despise doing a search from the address bar.  It is an A-1 nightmare.  After you type one letter, it stops registering what you type and throws up a ridiculously long list of the web pages you've visited.  Type another letter, and you have to go through this mess again.  It makes for an absurdly slow search and never actually gets you to what you're searching for.  I wound up with search results that weren't even related to each other much less related to what I was searching for.  After one day of use, I'm so frustrated with this feature that I'm opening Google to do the search. </p><p>How do we reset this new version of Firefox to only search from the Firefox homepage search box and not go anywhere near that address bar?  Or do I have to uninstall the latest update to get Firefox to function properly again?

I have my one main firefox profile with all my bookmarks, addons, etc configured just the way I like it. however, I cant get distill to operate on that profile. At the suggestion of their help (which was only mildly helpful) I created a fresh firefox profile and added distill to that and of course, it works without issue. However now I would be forced to manually migrate over all my settings, saved passwords, extension, etc from the old profile to this new one, just because for some reason distill works on that one. Any thoughts or suggestions on what I can do to get distill working on my main old profile? </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",GUITARMAGEDDON

I had just the right amount of folders and links that could expand to the bottom of the screen and now it goes well off the bottom of the screen and requires scrolling back up and down to use the links I use for the office on the 24"" screen. Worse, my Firefox syncs with my laptop at home so on that 15"" screen its even an even worse problem. I can't find a way to close them all up the way they used to be. There was nothing wrong with the browser as it was. If anyone wanted a new look, they could select different themes rather than force this arbitrary update on all of us. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1417940;,symetec

Am I correct that firefox doesnt recommend returning to the previous version. So I simply want to do two things with the current version...go to single spacing in the drop down menus like the Bookmarks menu....and....change size of the test in the upper toolbars like the menu bar. Now tell me why I cant contact firefox directly to get the help I want...?? </p>,desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,1417955;1417958;,vviktur

From the first page viewed in 89.0, any rapidly changing image on screen starts distorted - blocks of varying widths, maybe 10 points high, change like a distortion or static. I get it on THIS page; if I scroll up and down quickly, fragments of my text show up in broken blocks near the bottom; especially when I scroll from the white background to the dark block underneath. </p><p>I get it when trying to NOT-quickly scroll though the Troubleshooting Information Firefox provides when I hit the ""Share Data"" button. Seems to appear in... the last lower sixth of the screen of a full-screen window. In a smaller window, it'll happen in the lower HALF of the window. Happens on all three monitors of a three-monitor setup. </p><p>Most evident when scrolling a page quickly, trying to advance time on an in-page video, on first-load of graphics in page... is there any way to roll back this change, is there an alternate renderer or any other option? </p><p>Don't get me wrong, the interface change is awful, detaching the apparent tab-header from the page is weird, the simplified line-based icons in the URL bar are unsettling and the dialog ""window"" when trying to close multiple tabs in a window looking ever more like Chrome all really SUCK. BADLY. But I could put up with those like every other damned UI change. But the rendering breaking is a deal-breaker.
