Its like they've never used the browser.  Such a bonehead move.  Its especially irritating when you've been writing up something, pouring your heart out, then have it whisked away by forgetting that the pinhead designer is going to deem your present page of negligible value and wipe it out as it carries you to the History link.  And to think it hasn't been changed in years.     </p><p>Maybe something in About:Config can override this idiocy?  I searched for ""history"" but didn't see anything that seemed related to this.   </p><p>Looked it up on Add-Ons but couldn't find anything.   </p><p>By the way Mozilla, its really time to employ negative filtration in the Add-Ons search.  So you can put in a very general term (because you don't want to eliminate possibilities by being specific) then filter out the inapplicable results.  Its called a dash and its been used for decades by Ebay and Google.  Amazon used to use it but it gave us too much power so that was snatched away a while back.  Say you're looking for something that will control the History function.  When you search for History almost all the results involve wiping/deleting it.  So by using History -wipe -wiping -delete -deleting the results get more relevant to my needs.   As they say, cast a wide net if you want to catch big fish.  The size of the netting filters out the smaller fish caught. </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,1409841;,moz2u

Sometimes, I get a graphic glitch that causes a yellow line to streak across the screen (mot of the times partially or in a window/dropdown box) and it also causes letters to go missing. This is a new laptop so my initial thoughts were to reach out to Dell after I had exhausted my own options. We have still not been able to figure out the cause. There is a laundry list of things that I have tried and here are some that I remember. - Attempted fresh install by using Revo Uninstaller to remove everything, deleted app data and program data, and any other trace of the program that could be found. Then reinstalled Firefox with no addons or changed to about:config. - Uninstalled video drivers and then reinstalled. Updated to most current versions. - Followed instructions found here: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1313520"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1313520</a> - Tested other browsers to see if there was an issue with them, there was not. - Have been able to successfully recreate the problem on a regular basis. Because of this, I loaded Firefox in safe mode and browsed using it for a while. The issue did not happen and I could not recreate it while in safe mode. I am leaning toward this being a software issue due to the last to points that I mention above. However, at this point I am stumped and I believe Dell support is as well. Has anyone had this issue? Is there a fix? Is it possibly a hardware issue? Any help will be greatly appreciated. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",snakex50

At first I had worries that it may have been malware since at the same time my computer started heating up. I scanned my computer with Malwarebytes and Avast but there was no malware. Since there was no malware I googled how to resolve the problem and found a youtube video that said that doing the winsock reset would fix the issue. So I did the winsock reset twice and Mozilla Firefox did successfully open but when I opened it up those two times it said that the server had an error and couldn't it load the Firefox search page. Since the winsock reset solution wasn't working I searched up how to resolve the problem on the Firefox forums. I came upon a thread where a user had the same issue, and the chosen solution to his issue was as listed below: </p><p>This sounds like a file in your Firefox profile may be corrupt or invalid. To check to see if this is the case, you will need to create a secondary Firefox profile and test to see if you can open up Firefox through this profile. </p><p>This can be done by using the Profile Manager for Firefox that can be downloaded from the Mozilla FTP server. There is no installation required, as the program is contained within a ZIP file. Simply extract the ZIP file and run the executable file inside. </p><p>For steps on how to create a second Firefox profile, please refer to this support article: </p><p>Profile Manager - Create, remove or switch Firefox profiles Note: Do not delete the old profile because if it is corrupt you may be able to recover your bookmarks and some settings. For more information on how to do this, please read the Recovering important data from an old profile article. </p><p>I tried the above solution but it didn't work for me.

Every time when I sync an account to a new device, I got a popup to sync another device and afterwards I get a mail on how to complete my sync setup and sync another device. I'd have no problem with it, if this is my first device that I am trying to sync. But I have several devices with the sync enabled, I am syncing from these devices and Mozilla knows this as it has history of devices where I was signed in and it can see that there are data to be synced so apparently this is not the first device you are trying to sync. Can we have an option to dismiss these messages and popups forever? </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",kovacikster

What happens to the only browser on the planet? Why has the new design lost icons and does not allow you to use the thin strip of the bar? Where did the page view button go and why you should follow it into the general menu under the headline of the window or open it on hot keys? Especially what happens with DoH, where did the set-up network.trr.bootstrapAddress in about:config disappear? I kept hoping that the white lights would be fixed when I started and opened the new tab, but it still remains, do I still have WaterFox to continue using or what? Which by the way for some reason is further optimized under the various instructions of the processor unlike the original, which gives a great performance when using a decent set of extensions with a large blocklist of the ad blocker. </p>",desktop;beta;customize;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",sftr01

At least a couple months, Firefox has been acting very strange. Before christmas I did a reset on firefox to clear up some issues. I don't run very many add-ons.
