Every time when I sync an account to a new device, I got a popup to sync another device and afterwards I get a mail on how to complete my sync setup and sync another device. I'd have no problem with it, if this is my first device that I am trying to sync. But I have several devices with the sync enabled, I am syncing from these devices and Mozilla knows this as it has history of devices where I was signed in and it can see that there are data to be synced so apparently this is not the first device you are trying to sync. Can we have an option to dismiss these messages and popups forever? </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",kovacikster

What happens to the only browser on the planet? Why has the new design lost icons and does not allow you to use the thin strip of the bar? Where did the page view button go and why you should follow it into the general menu under the headline of the window or open it on hot keys? Especially what happens with DoH, where did the set-up network.trr.bootstrapAddress in about:config disappear? I kept hoping that the white lights would be fixed when I started and opened the new tab, but it still remains, do I still have WaterFox to continue using or what? Which by the way for some reason is further optimized under the various instructions of the processor unlike the original, which gives a great performance when using a decent set of extensions with a large blocklist of the ad blocker. </p>",desktop;beta;customize;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",sftr01

At least a couple months, Firefox has been acting very strange. Before christmas I did a reset on firefox to clear up some issues. I don't run very many add-ons.

I used to be able to easily open 20-30 tabs if I was going through google search results to try and find some information and never had any problem. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",crossmr
