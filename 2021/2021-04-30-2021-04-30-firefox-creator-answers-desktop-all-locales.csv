Mozilla used to save these settings and now it does not.   </p><p>I have even tried to alter the ""print.printer_name.print_paper_height"" &amp; width, but still no luck. </p><p>How do I get Mozilla to use the default printer settings, or remember the setting? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",richard207

There are currently well over 1200 bookmarks in my toolbar. I am trying to delete the majority of them. I have tried to backup and export before I do this, and have been unable. Firefox won't create any files. I have tried all other suggestions on the forum, stopping sync, Verifying the Integrity, renaming the places.sqlite file, and also refreshing and re-installing Firefox. Nothing works. I also find that Firefox is consistently using over 50% of CPU resources. So the program feels very sluggish.

But I have several devices with the sync enabled, I am syncing from these devices and Mozilla knows this as it has history of devices where I was signed in and it can see that there are data to be synced so apparently this is not the first device you are trying to sync.

What happens to the only browser on the planet? Why has the new design lost icons and does not allow you to use the thin strip of the bar? Where did the page view button go and why you should follow it into the general menu under the headline of the window or open it on hot keys? Especially what happens with DoH, where did the set-up network.trr.bootstrapAddress in about:config disappear? I kept hoping that the white lights would be fixed when I started and opened the new tab, but it still remains, do I still have WaterFox to continue using or what? Which by the way for some reason is further optimized under the various instructions of the processor unlike the original, which gives a great performance when using a decent set of extensions with a large blocklist of the ad blocker. </p>",desktop;beta;customize;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",sftr01
