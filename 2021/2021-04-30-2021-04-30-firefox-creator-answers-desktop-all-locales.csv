At least a couple months, Firefox has been acting very strange. Before christmas I did a reset on firefox to clear up some issues. I don't run very many add-ons. I use moderator toolbox for reddit, ublock origin, and a ""view image"" add-on to add the ""view image"" option back into google images.  </p><p>That's it.  </p><p>I've had all of those for much longer than this problem has existed.  </p><p>I checked browser.tabs.unloadOnLowMemory and it's set to false.  </p><p>I have 32 gb of ram and my ram is nowhere near being fully used.  </p><p>What I'm seeing is that if I have 4 or 5 tabs open, going back to a reddit or youtube tab that I always have open results in that tab being unloaded and having to wait while it reloads the tab.  </p><p>I also notice from time to time that middle clicking something to open a link in a new tab results in the browser jamming up from anywhere from 1-3 seconds.  </p><p>Used Firefox for years and never seen any kind of issue like this before. I used to be able to easily open 20-30 tabs if I was going through google search results to try and find some information and never had any problem. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",crossmr
