That was up to yesterday. Now, it results in each individual file and folder being sent to Firefox instead of in a folder. And when I import those bookmarks from Chrome after making changes in the Chrome bookmark folders, they DONT change in Firefox; the same ""old"" information is still there. So the import bookmarks from another browser is now totally useless. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",spirul

I am getting a box saying wrong PW.  2.) EDITING PASSWORDS IN FF I goto add ons in FF  and check PW...it was NOT UPDATED. I have to edit the PW and start fresh going to the site I want to.
