This is noticeable when scrolling, as CPU usage appears to increase dramatically while monitored. </p><p>The problem does not appear when running firefox in safe mode, but I cannot determine what might be causing the problem when firefox runs normally: the problem persists when I disable all extensions, as well as when I use the browser's default appearance as opposed to the theme of my choice. As far as I can tell, I have not modified any about:config settings either, although some cursory searching online suggests webrender may be a cause. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-930;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1453321;,dmitry7
