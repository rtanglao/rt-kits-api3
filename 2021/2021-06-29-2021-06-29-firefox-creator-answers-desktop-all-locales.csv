I have checked all my settings in Wordpress and on Firefox and all settings are for English. This does not happen using Safari or Chrome so I suspect it is an issue particular to Firefox. Has anybody else had the same experience or know how I can resolve it? </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",tonyp2

Thanks to Firefox Sync this is also a wonderful experience. </p><p>Recently I created an exception list for websites and their cookies. With the checkmark ""delete all cookies when starting Firefox"" a great thing. All cookies are deleted, just not those in the whitelist. All good. </p><p>Unfortunately the whitelist was not transferred to the other device. However, the option ""delete all cookies when starting Firefox"" did. Now all cookies are gone and the whitelist too. </p><p>Am I doing something wrong?
