While playing a video (on YouTube, Facebook or Twitter for example), i loose sound after about 20-30 seconds. </p><p>Here is how it occurs : 1/ I launch the video : the sound and the video plays correctly for about 20-30 seconds. 2/ Then, the video pauses, like if I had a connection problem. It tries to reconnect (the circle rotates) during approximatively 10-20 seconds. 3/ And finally, the video is back, playing where it stopped, but without any sound. </p><p>I tested Windows sound, and it works, even during that bug on Firefox. I tries to navigate in the video, reload the website : nothing works, still no sound. To get the sound back, I have to close Firefox and re-launch it (but the bug comes back randomly, but always with the same process as described below). </p><p>I don't know if this bug is linked to another one, but within the same period, I get another bug only with Firefox : I get Kernel Power errors that makes my computer freeze for 5 seconds then reboot, still randomly (i can spend a whole day without any reboot and then get 3 in a row, in a 5 minutes period). I don't see how these bugs can be related, but it seems... strange. </p><p>To come back to my sound issue, I tried simultenaously with Google Chrome (both windows with the same video launched at the same time) : Google Chrome don't meet that bug while Firefox's sound crashes. Can't explain that ... </p><p>I share with you my troubleshooting information, while the bug is occuring (i didn't re-launch Firefox before sending that question), hope it will help ! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;firefox-8902;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Norynsh
