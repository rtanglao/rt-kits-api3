(It works fine, I recommend it!) Had it for years, but have not used it much. Looking into VPN and proton offers one, so trying to find out more, and so am now exploring the proton site quite a bit. </p><p>I can log into ProtonMail itself very easily; I get directed to <a href=""https://mail.protonmail.com/inbox"" rel=""nofollow"">my ProtonMail inbox</a>. Cool so far. But clicking on 'help' takes me to <a href=""https://protonmail.com/support/"" rel=""nofollow"">ProtonMail Support</a>, <strong>in a new tab</strong>. Not so cool, because I'm now not logged in. If I hit the 'LOG IN' button at the top of that page, I can log in (again) very easily. <em>But it takes me back to my ProtonMail inbox!</em> Same problem if I try to log in to the <a href=""https://protonmail.com/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">Protonmail Blog</a>. </p><p>I've tried everything I can think of. I've checked through all the ProtonMail support articles (that claim they are 'step by step guide to find easily your answer'); I've investigated 'Common Login Problems', and none of the offered solutions apply (I'm not having a problem logging in; I'm having a problem logging in to something other than the inbox.) I've tried disabling browser extensions; checked the settings of Javascript, Session Storage, and Cookies; even tried using a different browser. </p><p>I think the answer to this conundrum is to configure Firefox -- just for proton -- so that instead of opening a new tab it opens the content in the same tab. But I've searched Firefox help, and have not been able to discover how to do that. </p><p>I fear I am slowly but surely going insane. </p><p>Please help! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-81;firefox-840;firefox-8402;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1385048;1385059;1385063;1385064;1385065;1385070;1385076;,pendantry

Lately, Firefox has decided to show logins that don't exist or haven't been used in decades (yes, DECADES). I ran CTRL-SHIFT- DEL, shut down and and restarted FF and rebooting. The fool things still show. What gives? How can these unneeded items be permanently removed?
