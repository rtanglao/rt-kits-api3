Cool so far. But clicking on 'help' takes me to <a href=""https://protonmail.com/support/"" rel=""nofollow"">ProtonMail Support</a>, <strong>in a new tab</strong>. Not so cool, because I'm now not logged in.

I've tried disabling browser extensions; checked the settings of Javascript, Session Storage, and Cookies; even tried using a different browser. </p><p>I think the answer to this conundrum is to configure Firefox -- just for proton -- so that instead of opening a new tab it opens the content in the same tab.
