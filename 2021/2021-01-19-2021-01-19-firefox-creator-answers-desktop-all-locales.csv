Our core financial banking system runs on Firefox.  Our Intranet page has special javascript code to take advantage of IE's ActiveX so if one were to launch IE, the default page (our intranet) has an icon to our core banking system and if clicked the script uses ActiveX and runs this code: ar oShell = new ActiveXObject(""Shell.Application""); 	var commandtoRun = ""C:\\Program Files\\Mozilla Firefox\\firefox.exe"" ; 	oShell.ShellExecute(commandtoRun,""https:/path-to-core-system-web-ui"","""",""open"",""1""); 	} </p><p>So when they click on the icon which is basically an img with the style of cursor: pointer; it does an onclick launch to that code which launches firefox to the web command.  If you open our Intranet page in Firefox or Chrome then ActiveX does not run so it just launches in a new tab the link to our core system. </p><p>This week (1/19) we are going live with a new loan origination system.  The LoS system vendor claims they want us to use Chrome for their system.  Well a few months ago we changed the default browser to Firefox with GPO's and now the issue is our Intranet page opens in Firefox (which works great) as any other, but how can we craft our link to open the Loan Origination System in Chrome?  I call B.S. that is only works in Chrome.  It seems to work in Firefox to me, but that's all they want to support so if we need help they won't help us unless we are using it in Chrome.  I know I'm not happy about it either.  I'm just happy to be rid of IE finally.  I like Firefox (and Chrome) but if I can do any tricks to craft a link, maybe a javascript function to launch something like commandtoRun = ""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe"", along with the argument with the LoS web URL, that would be great. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;websites;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",kjstech

Lately, Firefox has decided to show logins that don't exist or haven't been used in decades (yes, DECADES). I ran CTRL-SHIFT- DEL, shut down and and restarted FF and rebooting. The fool things still show. What gives? How can these unneeded items be permanently removed?
