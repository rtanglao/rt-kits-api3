Not anymore.  85.0.2 caused a major problem.  It would crash regularly with any redirect.  Probably not using technical term, but as examples: 1) in yahoo mail reading email from local paper, click on read more and it crashed (never did before) 2) on my child's school website and click to view lunch menu - crash!!!  Firefox became totally useless.  Crash turns monitors black and then screen identifies crash, it will go back to the previous page, but just don't try to click on anything or crash again. </p><p>Fix:  you can't ""downgrade"" or uninstall update - so I found a good ""restore point"" in Windows 10 that took me back to Firefox 84.0.2 (FYI 85.0 seemed to work, but I don't want any hassles).  If you try to use Firefox after ""restoring"" it will still try to ask you to update to the newer version.  So, you have to go into registry and disable the updates.  Restart and presto, Firefox back to normal operation (the dreaded 85.0.2 is still downloaded, but it won't install or ask you to install it all the time). </p><p>I hope someone fixes this.  I wish I knew more about computer programming and could help.  I will wait for a good while before trying to update or install a newer version.  It's a shame because I appreciate the security fixes.  I LOVE Mozilla Firefox but this incident woke me up to the imperfect nature of this science. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1391448;,tmund19
