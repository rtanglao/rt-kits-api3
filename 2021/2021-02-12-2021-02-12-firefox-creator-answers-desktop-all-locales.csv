Not anymore.  85.0.2 caused a major problem.  It would crash regularly with any redirect.  Probably not using technical term, but as examples: 1) in yahoo mail reading email from local paper, click on read more and it crashed (never did before) 2) on my child's school website and click to view lunch menu - crash!!!  Firefox became totally useless.  Crash turns monitors black and then screen identifies crash, it will go back to the previous page, but just don't try to click on anything or crash again. </p><p>Fix:  you can't ""downgrade"" or uninstall update - so I found a good ""restore point"" in Windows 10 that took me back to Firefox 84.0.2 (FYI 85.0 seemed to work, but I don't want any hassles).  If you try to use Firefox after ""restoring"" it will still try to ask you to update to the newer version.  So, you have to go into registry and disable the updates.  Restart and presto, Firefox back to normal operation (the dreaded 85.0.2 is still downloaded, but it won't install or ask you to install it all the time). </p><p>I hope someone fixes this.  I wish I knew more about computer programming and could help.  I will wait for a good while before trying to update or install a newer version.  It's a shame because I appreciate the security fixes.  I LOVE Mozilla Firefox but this incident woke me up to the imperfect nature of this science. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1391448;,tmund19

The message said to download a fix that would speed up my Firefox without losing my user ids and passwords, and other critical info. Well, I opted for the download fix. All of my passwords and user ids were wiped out. I have tried to get Firefox to remember them again, as I use them. However, each time I ask Firefox to remember my user id and password, it does not do so...so the next time I log into Outlook, for example, I have to reenter my E-Mail address and password. Not much of a fix at all! I was better off without ""the fix."" What can I do? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1391441;,oilinvestor13

However, I recently had to disable all of my extensions due to a computer problem.  When I enabled them again, I lost Symbaloo, unless I directly went to the symbaloo URL </p><p>I managed to solve this via the custom new tab page extension, but first had to deal with the Firefox page telling me to deal with an embedded issue by clicking on 'open in a new window'.  Now it works, but not in Private Browser.  When I click on the + to open a new tab, the Firefox search page opens.  How can I fix it so that Symbaloo once again appears in the new tab in Private Browser, as it did before, and as it is now doing in public browsing?  Thanks. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1391428;1391430;,ajkimmel14

Why cant I just click the zoom link and have it automatically join the meeting without needing to prompt the download option or manually having to enter the zoom meeting id? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",dotdotdtt35
