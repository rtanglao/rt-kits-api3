And every time that master password pop up comes up disrupting what I am doing. I often don't notice because I have a mild visual disability and I look down at the keyboard to type longer texts. I can't count how many times I've typed entire paragraphs into that damned box before I notice. This happens ALL the time and I MUST find a way to get rid of this! This is the ONE thing Chrome handles WAY better than FireFox. </p><p>How do I make this stop? And if there's no way other than disabling my master password, then FireFox needs to be updated to handle this differently! </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",diso683r

This will sound like an odd question, given that everybody seems to search for the opposite - but how could I DISABLE dark-mode in FF95.00?  </p><p>I have my whole OS in dark-mode the whole time because of looks. I also installed a dark-mode theme on FF. Because of looks. But after the latest updates, FF decided to present a bunch of my favourite websites in dark-mode, too. Even at daytime - where I use my Computer.  </p><p>Affected websites are, for example such ""unknown"" websites like  ""<a href=""http://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">twitter.com</a>"", ""<a href=""http://spiegel.de"" rel=""nofollow"">spiegel.de</a>"" or even ""<a href=""http://facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">facebook.com</a>"". It seems like they use some kind of a flag or token, which decides to use darkmode or not. How do I re-enable the light-mode (is this even a word?), not dependent of my windows / FF settings? Is there an add-on? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",marcus.wiedner

Other settings don't seem to be affected. It does seem to unset both at once, never one or the other at a time. </p><p>I have begun using Firefox routinely on two computers, both signed into the same sync profile. My best guess is that maybe one profile is overwriting the other? Both of these options are set on the second system, but maybe there's something going wrong with the sync? </p><p>Thanks, Patrick </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-940;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",patrickking

Since then, I do not have the task manager option in the dropdown menu &gt; More tools. Screenshot attached shows what I mean. This issue does not exist on a new profile if I were to make one, but I am trying my best to avoid transferring everything to a new profile if I have to. </p><p>If the only solution is to indeed use a new profile, I would like to know if there's a way to transfer addons and their settings through file copying and pasting.  </p><p>Thank you for the help! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-940;firefox-9402;,firefox,customize,en-US,1466933;,re11ding

I am given the option to have to do this in the future.  I do select that option but continue to need this authentication.  I contacted my bank bout my checking and was told to use &lt;Microsoft Edge.  I used another browser and my problem is resolved.  My bank thinks it has to do with security setting in Firefox.  I do not have this problem on my Ipad either using apple browser. Google has only recently began requiring this 2 step authentication. I just tried this with Gmail on my Microsoft Edge browser and did not have this problem.' I guess I need change in my Firefox settings but need help. &lt;/p&gt;</p>,desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",changed1956
