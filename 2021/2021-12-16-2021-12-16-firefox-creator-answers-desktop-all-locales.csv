This will sound like an odd question, given that everybody seems to search for the opposite - but how could I DISABLE dark-mode in FF95.00?  </p><p>I have my whole OS in dark-mode the whole time because of looks. I also installed a dark-mode theme on FF. Because of looks. But after the latest updates, FF decided to present a bunch of my favourite websites in dark-mode, too. Even at daytime - where I use my Computer.  </p><p>Affected websites are, for example such ""unknown"" websites like  ""<a href=""http://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">twitter.com</a>"", ""<a href=""http://spiegel.de"" rel=""nofollow"">spiegel.de</a>"" or even ""<a href=""http://facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">facebook.com</a>"". It seems like they use some kind of a flag or token, which decides to use darkmode or not. How do I re-enable the light-mode (is this even a word?), not dependent of my windows / FF settings? Is there an add-on? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,websites,en-US,1466954;1466957;1466959;,marcus.wiedner

It does seem to unset both at once, never one or the other at a time. </p><p>I have begun using Firefox routinely on two computers, both signed into the same sync profile. My best guess is that maybe one profile is overwriting the other? Both of these options are set on the second system, but maybe there's something going wrong with the sync? </p><p>Thanks, Patrick </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-940;,firefox,customize,en-US,1466970;,patrickking
