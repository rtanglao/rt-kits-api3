Emails sometimes are sent without warning, and text get erased, like the backspace button or arrow button was permanently pushed down. The same issue is not happening using Outlook on MS EDGE or the Outlook App. I do not suspect hacking, so would be good to rule out the option of some issues in the interaction between Windows, Outlook and Firefow, as this issue force me to use Edge. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,other,en-US,"",aaagre

This will sound like an odd question, given that everybody seems to search for the opposite - but how could I DISABLE dark-mode in FF95.00?  </p><p>I have my whole OS in dark-mode the whole time because of looks. I also installed a dark-mode theme on FF. Because of looks. But after the latest updates, FF decided to present a bunch of my favourite websites in dark-mode, too. Even at daytime - where I use my Computer.  </p><p>Affected websites are, for example such ""unknown"" websites like  ""<a href=""http://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">twitter.com</a>"", ""<a href=""http://spiegel.de"" rel=""nofollow"">spiegel.de</a>"" or even ""<a href=""http://facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">facebook.com</a>"". It seems like they use some kind of a flag or token, which decides to use darkmode or not. How do I re-enable the light-mode (is this even a word?), not dependent of my windows / FF settings? Is there an add-on? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,websites,en-US,1466954;1466957;1466959;,marcus.wiedner
