Since then, I do not have the task manager option in the dropdown menu &gt; More tools. Screenshot attached shows what I mean. This issue does not exist on a new profile if I were to make one, but I am trying my best to avoid transferring everything to a new profile if I have to. </p><p>If the only solution is to indeed use a new profile, I would like to know if there's a way to transfer addons and their settings through file copying and pasting.  </p><p>Thank you for the help! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-940;firefox-9402;,firefox,customize,en-US,1466933;,re11ding

I am given the option to have to do this in the future.  I do select that option but continue to need this authentication.  I contacted my bank bout my checking and was told to use &lt;Microsoft Edge.  I used another browser and my problem is resolved.  My bank thinks it has to do with security setting in Firefox.  I do not have this problem on my Ipad either using apple browser. Google has only recently began requiring this 2 step authentication. I just tried this with Gmail on my Microsoft Edge browser and did not have this problem.' I guess I need change in my Firefox settings but need help. &lt;/p&gt;</p>,desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",changed1956
