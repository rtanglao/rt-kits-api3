In just few words I cannot see which password are stored and therefore I cannot even edit them (see the pict). The funny part is that the login/passwords data are there because I can use them after landing on any page where I have an account. That's to say that the only way I have to edit a password that I changed on a different browser is to visit the page and then change it.  Another few examples? 1) If I enter in the search box any of the sites that should be (and indeed are) there, it cannot retrieve anything. 2) If I click insert new credential it does nothing (no box where to insert the new data) </p><p>Note!

I initially thought it was a Firefox problem, but I have been having a similar issue with Safari. This does NOT happen on my iPhone using the same two browsers. This also does not seem to effect Google Maps or embedded Google Maps, but embedded maps from other services. Anyway, I'm posting here because Firefox conveniently provides crash data, I'm not sure what else the cause could be and I'm hoping someone can help. </p><p>Two websites this has been consistently happening with are The Empire State Trail bike path (<a href=""https://empiretrail.ny.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://empiretrail.ny.gov/</a>) and a NYC vaccine finder website (<a href=""https://vaccinefinder.nyc.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vaccinefinder.nyc.gov/</a>). Firefox immediately crashes, though with the EST website it seems to be tied to the pathway of the trail being drawn (crashing after I've zoomed in a few times and the path has to regenerate). Safari doesn't totally crash, but forces a site reload and after it fails a second time says it can't display the site. </p><p>Any ideas what the issue could be? I'm on the latest version of Catalina (10.15.7), Firefox and Safari and seem to have all security updates for all.  </p><p>Here's a link to the latest crash data: <a href=""https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/1389c870-51cf-4790-b0a0-fd01f0211202"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/1389c870-51cf-4790-b0a0-fd01f0211202</a> </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-940;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",conradg
