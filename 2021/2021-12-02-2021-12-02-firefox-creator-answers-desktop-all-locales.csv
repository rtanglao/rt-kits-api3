Therefore we get a ""Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead"" page and no one can access the site. Even if you manually try to take out the ""s"" it directs right back to https. I heard Firefox does this if it detects a SSL, but again, we do not have one or never did for this site. I see other sites with no ssl work fine. Is there a work around to not have Firefox do this? All the legacy Firefox browsers work fine on our site. It was just with the last release it somehow seems to think we have one and force redirects. And to clarify, it isn't just on one computer.
