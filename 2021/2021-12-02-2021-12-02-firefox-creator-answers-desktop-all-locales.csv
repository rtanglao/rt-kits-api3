The fps counter flickers as either 53 or 80, but in reality it is maybe 15fps or lower and very stuttery. The resolution, number of blobs, or size of the window does not change anything.  </p> <ul><li>If I enter Troubleshooting Mode, it all returns to working order. The FPS is fixed </li></ul> <p>I have tried disabling ALL extensions, changing to the default theme, disabling hardware acceleration, deleting cache+cookies+history </p><p>I installed firefox developer edition and checked it there, and it was at 60 fps, until I logged into Sync, when it then dropped. </p><p><br> </p><p>I use KDE manjaro linux and have hardware that is definitely good enough to run the content at high framerates normally (everything works perfect in chromium) </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-910;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",saganomical

After several suggestions didn't help I opted to reinstall a previous version and upgrade that. Now it's back again with the v94 update. </p><p>I've disabled ALL extensions. No help. Themes don't seem to make a difference. However, when I went to about:config and entered ""<em><strong>toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets</strong></em>"" to make it true to allow chrome.css files to work it began immediately. Reset it to false and ""X""s are back. Set config to TRUE and it screws up the ""X""s. Again, all this is with all extensions off. </p><p>I hate the transparency of the tabs and menu bars so I need to set .css files.
