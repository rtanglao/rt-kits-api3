If I click to make the video larger, then I see all the quadrants of the video. The upper left quadrant appears to remain the same size when the video is in full screen mode. If I click to bring the video back down to a smaller size, then again, I can only see the upper left quadrant. Please help.

There was a thick black border around the address bar, search boxes, text boxes, context menu, selections, and several other boxes and modules within FF and on websites. There was also some shading on certain items to denote selected or unselected. I actually liked this feature, whatever it is as it made things easier to find. </p><p>Unfortunately, today it just disappeared. I want to get it back, but I know nothing about what it was or how to set it up again. I don't even know if it was a FF or Windows10 feature, but it appeared to be a FF feature to me. Also, I unfortunately did not take any screenshots. </p><p>Can anyone help me identify this feature and instruct me in setting it up? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",p.scott.howell

Instead, a background agent will download and install updates even if Firefox is closed</strong>"".  </p><p>Seriously?...  this is not an ""improvement"".  This is just a nice way to say ""we are taking over the control of Firefox updates and remove all user choice in this regard"".  </p><p>What is the rationale for this change? </p><p>I don't allow any programs to download and install to my PC without my knowledge and permission (including Windows Updates and even Wordpress and plugin updates on my website). I decide if and when anything gets updated to avoid crashes and other computer issues, as well as to prevent installation of something I simply don't want. This includes browser updates. </p><p>Secondly, I finally managed to reduce the space between bookmark lines in menus with a workaround in the about: settings after months of struggling with the settings created for iphone users which are unworkable on my PC (the only device I ever use the browser on).  </p><p>Could someone in the know confirm please that (1) this workaround will continue to work in 94.0.1 (as the release notes are suspiciously silent on this) and (2) that this option will be permanently reinstated in the browser settings with the next update. </p><p>I am not updating my browser until I get more information about the issues I have raised, using Chrome in the meantime and...indefinitely. </p><p>thanks </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1460054;,quantum888
