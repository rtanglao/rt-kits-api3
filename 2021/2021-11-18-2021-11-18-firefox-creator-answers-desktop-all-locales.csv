I switched from the normal App to the Store Version and since then I can't use another Language Pack, even if they are installed and activated as Addons. The only language correction I can use is the default US-English. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-940;firefox-9401;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",alexander16schneider

Instead, a background agent will download and install updates even if Firefox is closed</strong>"".  </p><p>Seriously?...  this is not an ""improvement"".  This is just a nice way to say ""we are taking over the control of Firefox updates and remove all user choice in this regard"".  </p><p>What is the rationale for this change? </p><p>I don't allow any programs to download and install to my PC without my knowledge and permission (including Windows Updates and even Wordpress and plugin updates on my website). I decide if and when anything gets updated to avoid crashes and other computer issues, as well as to prevent installation of something I simply don't want. This includes browser updates. </p><p>Secondly, I finally managed to reduce the space between bookmark lines in menus with a workaround in the about: settings after months of struggling with the settings created for iphone users which are unworkable on my PC (the only device I ever use the browser on).  </p><p>Could someone in the know confirm please that (1) this workaround will continue to work in 94.0.1 (as the release notes are suspiciously silent on this) and (2) that this option will be permanently reinstated in the browser settings with the next update. </p><p>I am not updating my browser until I get more information about the issues I have raised, using Chrome in the meantime and...indefinitely. </p><p>thanks </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",quantum888
