In online banking (ANZ Australia), when I scroll down the banking activities screen I get to the bottom, then it loads more history details. This feature only works sometimes, but always works in other browsers. 2. Our Bureau of Meteorology weather map page (<a href=""http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDR023.loop.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bom.gov.au/products/IDR023.loop.shtml</a>) sometimes doesn't load the overlay data, but always does in other browsers. I see this maybe 1 in 10 times I visit the site, and it always returns to normal after a while. Examples attached. Both issues are intermittent. My Firefox is up to date - set to automatically update. At first I thought it would be a permissions thing, but then the issues would be permanent. I would love any clues what to look for.

Comcast told me to just trust their certificate and I was able to get to my email account, but I am getting the same warning from PNC Bank's website when I try to transfer funds. This REALLY has me worried.  Can someone tell me if this is a sign I've been hacked?
