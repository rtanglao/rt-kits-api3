In the login process, it simply does not go any further without any error message.  The laptop is the same as before. The only thing that has changed are updates to Firefox version 87.0 and Ubuntu version 18.04.5 LTS. On another laptop, the bank access still worked perfectly. I have tried to switch off all restrictions in the Firefox settings and to deactivate all add-ons, unfortunately without success. The bank couldn't solve the problem either, they just said it was probably due to the browser settings. Do you have any ideas? Thank you!

At first some images, not all, would have yellow or green stripes going vertically through the images.  Then things got worse and got yellow and green pixels.  Now it is getting to the point where text is also looking like gibberish.  This isn't everywhere, just on some pictures and some text.  i do not have the same problem using other browsers.  I do not have the problem all of the time.  I have refreshed firefox.  I have uninstalled and re-installed firefox.  I have deleted cookies, etc.  Nothing seems to help.  This has been happening on and off for a long time but is progressively getting worse. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",miss_dana_e
