At first some images, not all, would have yellow or green stripes going vertically through the images.  Then things got worse and got yellow and green pixels.  Now it is getting to the point where text is also looking like gibberish.  This isn't everywhere, just on some pictures and some text.  i do not have the same problem using other browsers.
