Among other things, it is a discord where I value privacy very much and I do not want any person using the laptop (because there is no password and the device is also used by other people in the family) to have access to the account.  First of all, I want to log out of the browser (i.e. simply log in again to just protect my data).  This need came to me because the website (I closed the discord and I am 100% sure of it and it shows me that it is open all the time). I apologize in advance for the spelling because I translated myself with a translator because I do not know English very well. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",steeldragonfire44

No matter what I set my default zoom to in preferences, every tab I open defaults to a previous value I had set for the default zoom.  I have only set the default zoom once which was the previous time @ 150%.  Now every tab opens @ 150%.  I have tried closing all tabs and then settings a new value in preferences and then opening a first tab which didn't work. </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-780;,firefox,customize,en-US,1402540;1402544;,rcastro88

In the login process, it simply does not go any further without any error message.  The laptop is the same as before. The only thing that has changed are updates to Firefox version 87.0 and Ubuntu version 18.04.5 LTS. On another laptop, the bank access still worked perfectly. I have tried to switch off all restrictions in the Firefox settings and to deactivate all add-ons, unfortunately without success. The bank couldn't solve the problem either, they just said it was probably due to the browser settings. Do you have any ideas? Thank you!
