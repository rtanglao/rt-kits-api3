I can enter my username and password but the ""next"" or ""log in"" button or whatever it's called doesn't work at all. The cursor remains as an ""arrow"" when you hover it over the appropriate button to login and never allows you to click on anything. It's like this regardless if I am logging into YouTube, Google, or Gmail. Other websites could be affected...I don't know. The only way I can access my accounts is to downgrade Firefox to version 90.0.1. Everything seemed to work fine before this last version. I've been using version 90.0.1 for a few days now out of desperation since the most recent version doesn't work. I tried updating just now and even though the update went fine, I still couldn't log in to YouTube or Google.  </p><p>I just realized too that I cannot access my Microsoft account. When I try to log in, it accepts my credentials but then takes me to the Office 365 Login page as if I never logged in and not to my mailbox. This does not happen on Edge. I don't want to use Edge but between this and the problems with YouTube/Google, I am not seeing many options here.  </p><p>I'm running Firefox on Windows 10 Pro v1809 64bit.  </p><p>On a side note: Why does Firefox have to update so much? You guys update this thing and nothing's changed except at times like this when things don't work. That's the only difference I see. I wish you would just stop. Stop having updates every time we turn around---ESPECIALLY if nothing different is happening with the browser. I've used Firefox since it was in a version somewhere in the teens or twenties and honestly, I can't see many differences. This is very much true for the past 20 versions of the browser. I mean... we have 95 primary versions of a browser, not to mention the individual subversions. It's really a hassle. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",gdcarlson1975

I clear my cache regularly, and I've even rebooted my router a couple times, just in case. I also have excellent security on my devices and have run 2 virus/malware scans in the same time period. I've exhausted my options. So I'm writing you. I have also tried switching back to Google temporarily just to see if it was faster or loading better, and it was slightly. But I prefer to do my development on Firefox using private windows. Is there anything you can do or suggest? I know about all the stuff that's going on with GoDaddy servers, AWS servers, and all the security hacks and breaches, but this seems different. It just won't load sometimes.
