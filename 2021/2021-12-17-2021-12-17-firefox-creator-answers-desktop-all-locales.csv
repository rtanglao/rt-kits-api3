I have a problem with Firefox but not with Edge.  </p><p>Using Firefox 95.0.1 (64 bit) on Windows 10 Pro version 20H2 build 19042.1415 </p><p>The problem websites are <a href=""http://patreon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">patreon.com</a> and <a href=""http://washingtonpost.com"" rel=""nofollow"">washingtonpost.com</a> At the Post the website asks for a password then click next button and you should get a password prompt.  When I click Next the button goes grey and insensitive and never returns.  No timeout nothing. </p><p>On Patreon the site has text boxes for both account ID and password these both accept text but the ""Login"" button just displays an infinite looping circle. </p><p>Other sites using OAUTH Google, the NY Times don't have any problems. </p><p>... OK I have discovered that the problem is due to the Bluhell Firewall 2.9.  Turning it off fixes the problem. I will post this here anyway since it might be useful if anyone else has this problem.   I am also going to try to figure out what Bluhell is filtering that is causing this problem and complain  </p><p>hkc94501 </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,websites,en-US,1467285;,hkc945011

The response to this person's query was for them to go into Firefox settings and change the setting. This is very inconvenient when you normally want to use the feature but it causes problems on select webpages. I suggest that it would be a useful if you could toggle the feature on and off with a simple keyboard shortcut. </p><p>Thank you, Terry </p>",desktop;other;escalate;windows-10;feedback;feature-request;firefox-950;,firefox,other,en-US,"",TLMorse
