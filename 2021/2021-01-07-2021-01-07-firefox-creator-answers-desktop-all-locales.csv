Currently my customer is using the Firefox Rapid Release 84.x and need your help with the profile migration. The customer has a very isolated on-premises environment and does not allow the users to login into a Firefox-Account. Therefore the settings for Cookies, Cache, History and especially Bookmarks are not synched. </p><p>Environment details: </p> <ul><li> Enterprise environment with several tausends of clients </li><li> All clients on Windows 10 Enterprise between 1809 and 20H2 </li><li> All clients have always the newest Firefox installed currently 84.x </li></ul> <p>This creates a huge challenge to sync this stuff. Therefore I have now identified the following two options: </p> <ol><li>1 Allow the downgrade by using the environment variable <strong>MOZ_ALLOW_DOWNGRADE</strong> on Windows. For this option I am trying to find the real reason why this ""Downgrade-Stop"" has been implemented in the first place? What risks in detail do I take to allow this downgrade? Has anybody done this before and do you mind to share your experience here? How many issues did you face and how did you remediate the issues? </li></ol> <ol><li>2 Hand over the migration to the users. Copy their current profile to their desktop and ask them to import their bookmarks manually. Not preferred by users and I can't even blame them for. </li></ol> <p>Is there any other way to automatically sync the profiles from 84.x to ESR 78.6.x without user interaction?  </p><p>Thanks in advance Amir </p>",desktop;sync;escalate;windows-10;enterprise;profilemigration;firefox-840;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",SuppFire

When i came back to this page, EVERYTHING had gone.

A couple of days back, version 84.0.2 (64-bit) downloaded. As I did not restart the laptop (Win 10, fully up to date), the instal did not complete. Should not be a problem as I've done that many times before. But when i did restart (30m minutes ago), Firefox opened and asked me to set up Firefox - UGH!!! I did that 1 year ago when this laptop was new!!! My history is intact. So are my add-ons. however, all (about 32) of my Top Sites have gone and all of my pre-set start pages (4) have been lost. I can reset the start pages but I will not be able to remember all the Top Sites so some will be lost. This is an 80+% fail by Firefox. I use Firefox because it's been reliable but I can no longer say that it is. It's an atrocious failure and for no apparent reason.  </p><p>I have Firefox running on a separate laptop that has not been restarted today or yesterday. It has had the same personalisations wiped too!!!  Firefox, this makes you my least favourite browser EVER (and I started using computers when punched cards were needed to input questions and get answers!). Reliability = 0.  My confidence = 0   </p><p>I'm not going to try adding troubleshooting  information as that is just adding to the unreliability and my total lack of confidence in Firefox!!! </p><p>If there is a way to get my Firefox back to how it was, please share. I've lost so much confidence in it that I'm not  happy to try anything without advice. </p><p>EDIT More data. </p><p>The other laptop (also Win 10 fully up to date, same version of Firefox) did not have the start pages wiped clean. I use 4, (shouldn't matter which but they are Google; Gmail' Facebook; and Youtube. They are still set on that firefox but mine are completely wiped. When i started up, i had the Firefox Start page (asking me what to import from otehr browsers) and one other page not of my choice (can't remember what).  </p><p>So, Firefox, how did you screw this up and manage to do so differently on 2 different laptops that have almost IDENTICAL BUILDS (yep, same Windows, same user files, same file structure). </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",paulindr

This means I can scroll using a touch gesture on the tablet. Problem is that any sideways scrolling gets interpreted by Firefox as left- or right-arrow keypresses. This wreaks havoc with sites such as duckduckgo, where a left- or right-arrow keypress tabs between the web search, image search and map search page. So if you don't scroll exactly vertically it flicks between these pages. </p><p>Other browsers don't do this. If I open Chrome or Opera and go to https://omatsuri.app/events-keycode and try scrolling left and right I don't see any results. On firefox it reports an 'ArrowLeft' keydown event. </p><p>Is there any way to stop Firefox turning left and right scrolling into keystrokes? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",stib1
