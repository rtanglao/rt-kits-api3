Then i saw the request for Troubleshooting Information. to be helpful, i followed the instructions and used Copy Text, hoping to past it into the space provided (next text box). When i came back to this page, EVERYTHING had gone. Whole page was wiped clean. for pity's sake, Firefox, can't you even get that right? </p><p>2) The reason i came here was because Firefox let me down badly. A couple of days back, version 84.0.2 (64-bit) downloaded. As I did not restart the laptop (Win 10, fully up to date), the instal did not complete. Should not be a problem as I've done that many times before. But when i did restart (30m minutes ago), Firefox opened and asked me to set up Firefox - UGH!!! I did that 1 year ago when this laptop was new!!! My history is intact. So are my add-ons. however, all (about 32) of my Top Sites have gone and all of my pre-set start pages (4) have been lost. I can reset the start pages but I will not be able to remember all the Top Sites so some will be lost. This is an 80+% fail by Firefox. I use Firefox because it's been reliable but I can no longer say that it is. It's an atrocious failure and for no apparent reason.  </p><p>I have Firefox running on a separate laptop that has not been restarted today or yesterday. It has had the same personalisations wiped too!!!  Firefox, this makes you my least favourite browser EVER (and I started using computers when punched cards were needed to input questions and get answers!). Reliability = 0.  My confidence = 0   </p><p>I'm not going to try adding troubleshooting  information as that is just adding to the unreliability and my total lack of confidence in Firefox!!! </p><p>If there is a way to get my Firefox back to how it was, please share. I've lost so much confidence in it that I'm not  happy to try anything without advice. </p><p>EDIT More data. </p><p>The other laptop (also Win 10 fully up to date, same version of Firefox) did not have the start pages wiped clean. I use 4, (shouldn't matter which but they are Google; Gmail' Facebook; and Youtube. They are still set on that firefox but mine are completely wiped. When i started up, i had the Firefox Start page (asking me what to import from otehr browsers) and one other page not of my choice (can't remember what).  </p><p>So, Firefox, how did you screw this up and manage to do so differently on 2 different laptops that have almost IDENTICAL BUILDS (yep, same Windows, same user files, same file structure). </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",paulindr

This means I can scroll using a touch gesture on the tablet. Problem is that any sideways scrolling gets interpreted by Firefox as left- or right-arrow keypresses. This wreaks havoc with sites such as duckduckgo, where a left- or right-arrow keypress tabs between the web search, image search and map search page. So if you don't scroll exactly vertically it flicks between these pages. </p><p>Other browsers don't do this. If I open Chrome or Opera and go to https://omatsuri.app/events-keycode and try scrolling left and right I don't see any results. On firefox it reports an 'ArrowLeft' keydown event. </p><p>Is there any way to stop Firefox turning left and right scrolling into keystrokes? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",stib1

I use adblock, video speed controller, DuckduckGO privacy essentials, and Tampermonkey extensions. I've looked through all their options for anything that might be causing my history to not be saved, especially the Duck duck go one but there's no setting that shouldn't be on as far as I see.

After I do this (and get a message from eBay stating ""Verification Succeeded"") I then get a pop-up box, apparently from Firefox, stating that Firefox needs to ""repeat any [prior] action"" to display the page, but when I click the RESEND button, it just takes me back to the puzzle, which I have to do all over again and get caught in an endless loop.  I called eBay, and those idiots were totally useless in fixing this problem, and told me that Firefox is ""blocking"" the page.   </p><p>And yes, I downloaded the most recent version of Firefox and I'm still having this problem.   </p><p>How do I fix this problem? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,1381934;,GuyDean
