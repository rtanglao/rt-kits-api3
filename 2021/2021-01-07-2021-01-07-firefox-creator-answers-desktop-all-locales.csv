This means I can scroll using a touch gesture on the tablet. Problem is that any sideways scrolling gets interpreted by Firefox as left- or right-arrow keypresses. This wreaks havoc with sites such as duckduckgo, where a left- or right-arrow keypress tabs between the web search, image search and map search page. So if you don't scroll exactly vertically it flicks between these pages. </p><p>Other browsers don't do this. If I open Chrome or Opera and go to https://omatsuri.app/events-keycode and try scrolling left and right I don't see any results. On firefox it reports an 'ArrowLeft' keydown event. </p><p>Is there any way to stop Firefox turning left and right scrolling into keystrokes? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",stib1

I use adblock, video speed controller, DuckduckGO privacy essentials, and Tampermonkey extensions. I've looked through all their options for anything that might be causing my history to not be saved, especially the Duck duck go one but there's no setting that shouldn't be on as far as I see. Why won't firefox save my browsing history? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-840;firefox-8401;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1381939;,morganshumaker

After I do this (and get a message from eBay stating ""Verification Succeeded"") I then get a pop-up box, apparently from Firefox, stating that Firefox needs to ""repeat any [prior] action"" to display the page, but when I click the RESEND button, it just takes me back to the puzzle, which I have to do all over again and get caught in an endless loop.  I called eBay, and those idiots were totally useless in fixing this problem, and told me that Firefox is ""blocking"" the page.   </p><p>And yes, I downloaded the most recent version of Firefox and I'm still having this problem.   </p><p>How do I fix this problem? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,1381934;,GuyDean

How do I force it to go away and permanently default to ""print using the system dialog"", which ""Firefox help"" never heard of.  I can't find any way to get rid of it.  It is a hateful change to Firefox, I hate it and my sister is in tears.  She hates computers anyway.  Seniors can't handle these dramatic changes. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,1381936;,jmaroon452
