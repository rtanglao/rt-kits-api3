Then i saw the request for Troubleshooting Information. to be helpful, i followed the instructions and used Copy Text, hoping to past it into the space provided (next text box). When i came back to this page, EVERYTHING had gone. Whole page was wiped clean. for pity's sake, Firefox, can't you even get that right? </p><p>2) The reason i came here was because Firefox let me down badly. A couple of days back, version 84.0.2 (64-bit) downloaded. As I did not restart the laptop (Win 10, fully up to date), the instal did not complete. Should not be a problem as I've done that many times before. But when i did restart (30m minutes ago), Firefox opened and asked me to set up Firefox - UGH!!! I did that 1 year ago when this laptop was new!!! My history is intact. So are my add-ons. however, all (about 32) of my Top Sites have gone and all of my pre-set start pages (4) have been lost. I can reset the start pages but I will not be able to remember all the Top Sites so some will be lost. This is an 80+% fail by Firefox. I use Firefox because it's been reliable but I can no longer say that it is. It's an atrocious failure and for no apparent reason.  </p><p>I have Firefox running on a separate laptop that has not been restarted today or yesterday. It has had the same personalisations wiped too!!!  Firefox, this makes you my least favourite browser EVER (and I started using computers when punched cards were needed to input questions and get answers!). Reliability = 0.  My confidence = 0   </p><p>I'm not going to try adding troubleshooting  information as that is just adding to the unreliability and my total lack of confidence in Firefox!!! </p><p>If there is a way to get my Firefox back to how it was, please share. I've lost so much confidence in it that I'm not  happy to try anything without advice. </p><p>EDIT More data. </p><p>The other laptop (also Win 10 fully up to date, same version of Firefox) did not have the start pages wiped clean. I use 4, (shouldn't matter which but they are Google; Gmail' Facebook; and Youtube. They are still set on that firefox but mine are completely wiped. When i started up, i had the Firefox Start page (asking me what to import from otehr browsers) and one other page not of my choice (can't remember what).  </p><p>So, Firefox, how did you screw this up and manage to do so differently on 2 different laptops that have almost IDENTICAL BUILDS (yep, same Windows, same user files, same file structure). </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",paulindr

This means I can scroll using a touch gesture on the tablet. Problem is that any sideways scrolling gets interpreted by Firefox as left- or right-arrow keypresses. This wreaks havoc with sites such as duckduckgo, where a left- or right-arrow keypress tabs between the web search, image search and map search page. So if you don't scroll exactly vertically it flicks between these pages. </p><p>Other browsers don't do this. If I open Chrome or Opera and go to https://omatsuri.app/events-keycode and try scrolling left and right I don't see any results. On firefox it reports an 'ArrowLeft' keydown event. </p><p>Is there any way to stop Firefox turning left and right scrolling into keystrokes? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",stib1
