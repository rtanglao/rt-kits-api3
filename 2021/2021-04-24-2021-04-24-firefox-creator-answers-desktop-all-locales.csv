There seems to be an assumption that because I have a computer problem I must know the lingo and where things are and what they do. I tried to follow the instructions but I didn't know what they were referring to. </p><p>Can someone please help me with clear instructions on what I need to do to find the files where my history is stored and restore it along with my login information.  </p><p>I am using a mac book air running 10.12.6 </p><p>This is the second time a Firefox update has resulted in something being deleted. The last time it was all my bookmarks. What gives with Firefox updates doing this? </p>,mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-880;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",JeanieG

When I open a new window and then select the bookmarked page i want to open, FF switches tyo another ALREADY OPEN TAB and loads the page there removing the page that was opened. EX: I use both regular FF and Private windows on my screen and switch from one to the other according to the loaded pages I am using. When I open a new tab in private windows and try to get FF to open a bookmarked page, it will switch to my open tabs under regular FF instead of opening the bookmarked page in the new private windows page it will REPLACE an open page. This happens a lot with my YouTube pages which I leave open during the day to listen to binaural beat music in the background while I am working. What's up with that?  Why doesn't the bookmarked page open in a new private windows tab? </p><p>I also noticed that when I leave pages open during the day in both private and regular FF now (since the most recent update)and go back to them, I often have to reload the whole page instead of just allowing me to go directly to something on that page. </p><p>I have been dodging the most recent updates because with each new update there seems to be more and more CONTROL from your side, and less freedom on our side of the screen.  Is this purposeful? If so, WHY?!!! </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-81;firefox-870;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",pwaiolena1

I am forced to delete the app then reset my macbook and only use Safari or Chrome because of this issue. I tried to log into dominos and the screen was in what I assume was Spanish or Portugese, and the URL was in <a href=""https://www.dominos.com.br/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dominos.com.br/</a>. This is not the only site this occurred in.  </p><p>When I tried log into <a href=""http://Apple.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Apple.com</a>, it kept trying to set my settings to Brazil. When I'd try to set myself to the US, this did not work and kept setting me as Brazil. This does not work on my iphone, and when I try to do whatismyip, it says I am in the US (which is correct).  </p><pre>I have literally no idea why this is a thing, and cannot find any solutions online to fix it.  </pre> <p>Please help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",murban916

When I am on <a href=""http://Yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Yahoo.com</a> reading the news of the day, I only see the first picture in the article. Anything beyond the 1st picture is a blank grey box. The text is all intact and I can read the article normally.  </p><p>If I scroll down to the end of the article and then scroll back up to the beginning, the pictures all appear then without issue. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling firefox, refreshing firefox, all add-ons disabled. I have also tried it in Google Chrome, and it works just fine there, but I prefer to use Mozilla Firefox to browse the news. When I try other websites, such as CNN, the pictures behave normally and appear when they should. Please HELP!  </p><p>Thank You,  </p><p>Mike </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",mlcottle
