I have set up a tag so that I get notified by email when a new version of a magazine   am interested in (5 total) gets added. The Libby website relies on a cookie(s) so that you only login once with your library card and it retains any settings (like the above tagged information). </p><p>I could not understand why every time I accessed Libby, I was being asked to login with my library card and once logged in, my tagged information was missing. </p><p>I contacted Libby Technical Support, and further investigation revealed that Firefox automatically deletes cookies by default when closed. </p><p>I entered Firefox Options and could see that the 'Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed' option was ticked which explained the above behaviour. I left this option ticked (I want all cookies to continue to be deleted on Firefox closure) but set up an exception under 'Manage Exceptions' to allow the cookie(s) associated with <a href=""https://libbyapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://libbyapp.com</a> to be retained on Firefox closure. This exception did not work. </p><p>I then dipped into the History section and selected 'Use custom settings for history' which then allowed me to untick the 'Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed' option. This worked but is not really the approach I want to take. </p><p>In other words, I want to clear down all cookies on Firefox closure but retain the those associated with Libby. What is the best way to do this? </p><p>There seems to be an association (in terms of cookies) between the 'Cookies and Site Data' and 'History' sections within options, which I do not fully understand. </p><p>I have searched through the forum and there is a lot of material on this, with very long exchanges, some of which is not very recent. I thought it was worth asking the question afresh. </p><p>Apologies for the length of my issue description above. </p><p>Thanks in advance for your support. </p><p><br> </p><p>bern </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",bernardgorman1

Firefox is supplying my login credentials on-screen for an often used secure website, but when I click the login button the credentials are wiped from the screen (ie. login details are now removed) and I am not logged in. If I supply the details manually, Firefox prompts me to update the stored credentials with what I've just typed. I confirm that I want it to do so and continue with the login process. Every time I log in, this sequence of events re-occurs, meaning that Firefox is  - failing to use the stored credential (the login fields are blanked out when I click the login button) - failing to update my stored credentials (whenever I supply the details manually, Firefox is triggered to ask if I want to update the stored credentials with what I've just typed, indicating that the stored version is both incorrect and not being updated). Any suggestions on what I should do about this? (I don't have this problem with Safari, which is not my preferred browser.) Many thanks!
