Firefox is supplying my login credentials on-screen for an often used secure website, but when I click the login button the credentials are wiped from the screen (ie. login details are now removed) and I am not logged in.

Every time I log in, this sequence of events re-occurs, meaning that Firefox is  - failing to use the stored credential (the login fields are blanked out when I click the login button) - failing to update my stored credentials (whenever I supply the details manually, Firefox is triggered to ask if I want to update the stored credentials with what I've just typed, indicating that the stored version is both incorrect and not being updated).

When I open a new window and then select the bookmarked page i want to open, FF switches tyo another ALREADY OPEN TAB and loads the page there removing the page that was opened. EX: I use both regular FF and Private windows on my screen and switch from one to the other according to the loaded pages I am using. When I open a new tab in private windows and try to get FF to open a bookmarked page, it will switch to my open tabs under regular FF instead of opening the bookmarked page in the new private windows page it will REPLACE an open page. This happens a lot with my YouTube pages which I leave open during the day to listen to binaural beat music in the background while I am working. What's up with that?  Why doesn't the bookmarked page open in a new private windows tab? </p><p>I also noticed that when I leave pages open during the day in both private and regular FF now (since the most recent update)and go back to them, I often have to reload the whole page instead of just allowing me to go directly to something on that page. </p><p>I have been dodging the most recent updates because with each new update there seems to be more and more CONTROL from your side, and less freedom on our side of the screen.  Is this purposeful? If so, WHY?!!! </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-81;firefox-870;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",pwaiolena1
