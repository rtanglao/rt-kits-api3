I went to a new window, typed in a new search, and a screen popped up saying I was the 5 billionth Mozilla winner and I had 15 minutes to pick a prize.  It told me the last winner won some kind of TV and other entertainment equipment, and after each winner the count resets.  I did not really care, but there was no cancel button, or ""X"" to leave the site.  So, I picked a prize and won a $1000 Amazon Gift Card.  I forgot to verify a ""https://"" on the page and gave out private information.  The page it went to kept buffering, so I closed it and again without looking to verify it was a secure page.  The page I had input my information on was gone and again, not verifying the page was secure I closed it as well.  So, I checked my email address and there is no email telling me about the Mozilla win.  What do I need to do???  I gave out vital information and have put my HARD earned credit into peril.  Recently, I added a Mozilla VPN to my online routine for security.  I do not understand how this page was able to pop up on my laptop.  Currently, I am very upset and do not know what to do to keep myself and my credit safe.  Please help! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,"",kimosabe1

I assume this is because Firefox is no longer behaving like Chrome, since FLoC does not exist in Firefox.

How, then, is it possible for all those data points listed above to be compromised? Even if I answered some survey it published, how would it know any of my passwords if I never entered any of them on that site (which I would never do)? Frankly, this advisory posits such an implausible scenario, and an equally implausible solution, as to be useless. </p><p>There is no explanation as to how any of the hazards alleged to accompany this ""breach"" will affect my accounts.

When I open a new window and then select the bookmarked page i want to open, FF switches tyo another ALREADY OPEN TAB and loads the page there removing the page that was opened. EX: I use both regular FF and Private windows on my screen and switch from one to the other according to the loaded pages I am using. When I open a new tab in private windows and try to get FF to open a bookmarked page, it will switch to my open tabs under regular FF instead of opening the bookmarked page in the new private windows page it will REPLACE an open page. This happens a lot with my YouTube pages which I leave open during the day to listen to binaural beat music in the background while I am working. What's up with that?  Why doesn't the bookmarked page open in a new private windows tab? </p><p>I also noticed that when I leave pages open during the day in both private and regular FF now (since the most recent update)and go back to them, I often have to reload the whole page instead of just allowing me to go directly to something on that page. </p><p>I have been dodging the most recent updates because with each new update there seems to be more and more CONTROL from your side, and less freedom on our side of the screen.  Is this purposeful? If so, WHY?!!! </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-81;firefox-870;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",pwaiolena1
