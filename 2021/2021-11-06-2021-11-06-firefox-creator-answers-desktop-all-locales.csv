But they can't help with browser specific issues accept to offer standard solutions, which I already tried. Also, Stripe works fine in Chrome. </p><p>I'm using 1password extension, and for plugins: OpenH264 Video Codec provided by Cisco Systems, Inc. and Widevine Content Decryption Module provided by Google Inc.
