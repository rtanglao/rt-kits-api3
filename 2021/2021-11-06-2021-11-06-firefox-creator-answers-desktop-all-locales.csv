The site only displays about halfway down its homepage, then crashes FF. I've cleared cookies, all history, removed and reloaded FF, turned off tracking protection for Stripe at the address bar, lowered tracking settings to standard in FF, turned off hardware acceleration, and contacted Stripe directly. But they can't help with browser specific issues accept to offer standard solutions, which I already tried. Also, Stripe works fine in Chrome. </p><p>I'm using 1password extension, and for plugins: OpenH264 Video Codec provided by Cisco Systems, Inc. and Widevine Content Decryption Module provided by Google Inc. I deactivated both those plugins but no use. Ideas? Thanks! Ken </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-940;firefox-9401;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",kenjensen990

One of my most useful tools has been removed (you could right click in a page and you got a box that would allow you to view the page's properties. The one on the new version takes you to a different page with a lot of computer language). I want to know how to go back to the previous version of windows as this feature helped me a lot with my work. </p>,windows-7;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-910;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1456988;,nameless_monster
