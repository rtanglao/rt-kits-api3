One of my most useful tools has been removed (you could right click in a page and you got a box that would allow you to view the page's properties. The one on the new version takes you to a different page with a lot of computer language). I want to know how to go back to the previous version of windows as this feature helped me a lot with my work. </p>,windows-7;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-910;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",nameless_monster
