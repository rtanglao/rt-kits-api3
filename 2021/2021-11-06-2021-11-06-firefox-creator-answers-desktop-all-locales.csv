My old 2015 MacBook Pro did not have this problem to the same extent, so for a new high performing and efficient M1 Pro chip to be draining the battery which should run for a working day is indicating a serious problem with Firefox.

Vou resumir a seguir o meu caso: tenho uma conta com a opção de segurança de autenticação em dois fatores ativada e meu app é o Google Authenticator. Tenho ele instalado em um iPad Air2. Recentemente houve a atualização do sistema operacional desse tablet do IOS 14 para o IOS 15. Após esse processo descobri que teria de reconfigurar o meu app de Autenticação do Google porque, por algum motivo que desconheço, todas as contas que já tinha configuradas em autenticação de dois fatores foram foram perdidas e tive de recadastrá-las. Entretanto, a do Firefox Sync eu não consigo porque também perdi minha senha de recuperação. Eu entendo que a negligência foi toda de minha parte. Li as políticas de segurança da Mozilla e entendi que o motivo é que para recuperar esse acesso preciso provar minha identidade, o que não tenho como fazer no momento pelos motivos explicados acima. Então, estou recorrendo a este canal para solicitar que a área de suporte da Mozilla possa excluir minha conta associada ao e-mail juliovarella@gmail.com e todos os respectivos dados. Assim, eu terei a chance de me cadastrar novamente com este meu e-mail (que é meu principal e-mail) pois tenho todo interesse em continuar utilizando o firefox e sincronizando os dados em todos os meus dispositivos. Não tenho problema em perder os dados já armazenados nos servidores da Mozilla, pois possuo backup de tudo. Só preciso mesmo poder me cadastrar com esse e-mail citado e voltar a sincronizar tudo. Para ter algum acesso provisório acabei cadastrando outra conta de e-mail apenas para esse acesso contingencial. Desde já agradeço pela atenção dispensada e conto com o apoio de vocês.

I am sorry if I missed some content but I don't think so since I think my questions appear to be a bit more specific. These are: </p><p><strong>1-</strong> Extensions ask for permissions and permissions may access your information according to their descriptions explained on: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/permission-request-messages-firefox-extensions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/permission-request-messages-firefox-extensions</a> </p><p>That's ok but extensions are updated frequently, right? So, can extensions' permission settings be changed via an update? If yes, does firefox inform us that the extension has changed it's permission settings? </p><p>I would not like to have an extension having little permissions to be updated to some kind of data recorder without me knowing. (And yes people check these but that's my 2nd question) </p><p><strong>2-</strong> Yes, (sometimes) people check the updates that are made to certain extensions, in case that's a 'recommended' extension, it is always checked by real people, that's great. But I could not find any information about what would be the aftermath of an extension which changed in a bad way. What happens then? Is it immediately blocked? Does it automatically stop working? Does the safe old version keep working and the new-bad-update never sees the light of the day? That would be great to know. </p><p><strong>3-</strong> This one is about privacy. Since one of the most important aspects of Firefox is its privacy-friendly design, I wanted to ask if privacy aspects of the extensions are also checked by the community (or Firefox staff in case of 'recommended' extensions). I know, there are some cases that might make you ask: ""Not everybody cares about privacy, also not every extension is about privacy, some even clearly state they are bad for privacy, why would something like this be routinely checked?"" But there are some extensions that are solely made for privacy. What happens if something about apps privacy policy changes? Or some app that did not collect data beforehand starts to collect data and start to harm our privacy? </p><p>I hope these are some legit questions and with some answers they would leave an information-laden thread to the community. </p><p>Best Regards </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-940;,firefox,customize,en-US,1457095;1457118;,diot_morrocco
