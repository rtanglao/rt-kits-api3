Here is the problem. I'm using Firefox as browser. When using ""<a href=""http://outlook.office.com/mail/"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.office.com/mail/</a>"" (the email of my university) or ""<a href=""http://outlook.live.com/mail/"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.live.com/mail/</a>"" (my personal hotmail email), the spelling option and dictionary choices don't appear when I write click on the text field. The consequences are that the spelling check doesn't work. This problem appears only with outlook services. For example, in the text field I'm currently typing in while writing this message, the option does appear (as you can see in the second attached print screen), but when I do the same in outlook, this option don't appears anymore (as you can see in the first attached print screen). As you can see, the contextual options after right clicking on the text field are different and I don't understand why.  </p><p>I have two dictionaries installed (French and English) and they work perfectly everywhere except in outlook. I read some Microsoft posts about that but what they explain is that the spelling check in outlook is all based on the browser options.  </p><p>I'm not sure of when this problems append but I know the Firefox spelling check used to work before even in outlook. So I don't know if a update or something else created that but it's very bugging me and I might have to leave Firefox is I can't solve this problem.  </p><p>If anyone who faced similar problems found a solution, I would be very glad to hear it!

Since I do not see any options for submitting an enhancement request, I thought I'd do it in this forum. Maybe there is an answer already out there that could get answered here? I am a software business analyst, who specializes in usability and process management. Being one of the older users of Firefox (as are many of us 'old folks') ;), I would like to ask if there is any possibility/functionality of being able to change the tab appearance once you've installed a theme extension? Depending upon the theme installed, the tabs are translucent. This is understandable based on being able to see more of the theme, BUT... For those of us who are older, sight impaired, etc., Often it is difficult to see the words on the tab and which one is highlighted.  I for one, usually have multiple tabs open relative to my work.   It would be so helpful to be able to choose an option to change the tabs to: </p> <ol><li>1 Using opaque scale/slider bar (to increase or decrease), or just an option to make the tabs opaque.  </li><li>2 Change the font to bold if desired.  </li><li>3 Change the color of the text to white or black.  </li><li>4 Make the current tab a little more pronounced (i.e., highlighted)  </li></ol> <p>Thank you for your consideration of these development enhancements which would help many users.  Should there be an answer out there already of how to accomplish at least one of these requests, (of which I will apologize for I cannot find any info or extension yet), I would be most grateful for your assistance with these options.

This is observed directly on the website, not any third-party site. </p><p>Messing with stuff outside of the web player seems to have a tendency to break the web player's volume control, resulting in its volume maxing out and desyncing from the video stream; it almost sounds at times like the audio stream is restarting from the beginning of whatever video is playing, while the video stream continues as normal. I've seen it happen mostly while using a wireless remote + Fliirc to adjust settings (mainly OS volume, brightness, and f.lux settings) but it can also happen from my keyboard, as well as manipulating the web player's volume control too much, and also zooming in/out the webpage too much. Clearing the cache &amp; reloading doesn't work, and neither does disabling all add-ons, or running Firefox in Safe Mode. The only solution I've found so far is to refresh the webpage. </p><p>Spoke with site's developer, who remarked that he had not heard of anyone else experiencing this bug, and suggested it must be a Firefox issue; something about how the browser interacts with the OS' audio subsystem is probably causing this bug. </p><p>Does not seem to happen in latest version of Edge, for some reason. </p><p>Running the latest build of Windows 10 64-Bit  Windows 10 64-bit OS Build 19042.928 and Firefox 64-bit 87.0. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1406727;1406729;1406732;1406733;1406735;1406736;,pirritanoandrew
