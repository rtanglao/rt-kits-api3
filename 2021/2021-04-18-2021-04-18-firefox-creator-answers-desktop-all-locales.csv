Tried several different streams: some streams w/ no customization might fix the problem, but it's not entirely clear to me which streams are ""completely"" customization-free.    Tried different browser: Edge does not exhibit this issue </pre> <p>The Problem: </p><p>Been noticing this problem in Firefox at <a href=""https://cytu.be"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cytu.be</a> over the last couple of months; this seems to be happening with any stream on the site, ; I don't remember exactly when I started noticing it. This is observed directly on the website, not any third-party site. </p><p>Messing with stuff outside of the web player seems to have a tendency to break the web player's volume control, resulting in its volume maxing out and desyncing from the video stream; it almost sounds at times like the audio stream is restarting from the beginning of whatever video is playing, while the video stream continues as normal. I've seen it happen mostly while using a wireless remote + Fliirc to adjust settings (mainly OS volume, brightness, and f.lux settings) but it can also happen from my keyboard, as well as manipulating the web player's volume control too much, and also zooming in/out the webpage too much. Clearing the cache &amp; reloading doesn't work, and neither does disabling all add-ons, or running Firefox in Safe Mode. The only solution I've found so far is to refresh the webpage. </p><p>Spoke with site's developer, who remarked that he had not heard of anyone else experiencing this bug, and suggested it must be a Firefox issue; something about how the browser interacts with the OS' audio subsystem is probably causing this bug. </p><p>Does not seem to happen in latest version of Edge, for some reason. </p><p>Running the latest build of Windows 10 64-Bit  Windows 10 64-bit OS Build 19042.928 and Firefox 64-bit 87.0. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1406727;1406729;1406732;1406733;1406735;1406736;,pirritanoandrew
