I wanted to have the address bar execute the search on the already open tab, and the search bar to open a new tab in the background without stealing the focus. I managed to set them up separately, now the address bar does not open a new tab and the search bar does, but the newly opened tab always steals the focus. I'm trying to keep the focus on the already open tab while the search bar opens a new tab without switching to it. Is there a way to achieve this? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",mostlynothuman
