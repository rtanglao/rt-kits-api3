I have an image of my C:\ drive on a Passport disk.  But the Mac will not read it.  I installed Firefox on my new Mac and signed in had all of my bookmarks and passwords.  Then there was a Firefox icon on the bottom strip and one on my screen.  In the interim, I opened some new accounts and used a bunch of passwords.  At the end of the day, I dragged the icon on the screen down to the row of icons at the lower screen.  That wiped out my Firefox.  I downloaded Firefox again and put in what I thought was the password and it said I had multiple accounts and if I changed the password it would erase  all of my data.  I need to find out how to get the right password so I preserve my data.  The email account I used as the ID is coolsgirl@msn.com.  I am 72 and I don't want to make a mistake that is irreversible. My sister said Macs were easier but I should have gotten a new PC.  Live and learn.  I don't know my Firefox email. Thank you, Phyllis </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",coolsgirl

Thank you for excellent Browser! </p><p>However, I've seen some bad things in Firefox 89, so I'll report it. After upgrading Firefox to 89, access from behind the proxy no longer reaches all addresses beyond the firewall. I noticed that the page opens correctly when I play around with the settings, which is related to the HTTPS-Only Mode and Automatic proxy configuration URL settings. I specify the address of ""http:"" in the Automatic proxy configuration URL. In that case, if HTTP-Only Mode is ON, it seems that the proxy configuration file cannot be read correctly. When I turned off HTTP-Only Mode and reloaded again, the page was displayed correctly. Alternatively, I can give up the specification in the Automatic proxy configuration URL and switch to the manual specification. That said, before 89, all settings were displayed correctly, so I think it was a trigger for the change in 89. Is there anything you can think of?
