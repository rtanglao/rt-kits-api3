They both did their respective jobs well.  </p><p>Starting a few days ago, attempts to type in the search bar (under the Firefox logo) resulted in a mixture of suggestions, addresses, sites visited etc, appearing in and below the address bar (at the top of the page). </p><p>Is it no longer possible to have separate search and address bars?   I've poked around in settings and while I've at least managed to turn the address bar into something like a search bar (no addresses or history), this seems like a second best solution - it was useful as an address bar, just as the search bar was useful as a search bar.  I've lost some functionality.  </p><p>Is the search bar on the home page now just a decoration?  Can it be made to function again as such - offering nothing but suggestions/auto-completions?  Is this an update, or a glitch in my install? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ptd55

Thank you for excellent Browser! </p><p>However, I've seen some bad things in Firefox 89, so I'll report it. After upgrading Firefox to 89, access from behind the proxy no longer reaches all addresses beyond the firewall. I noticed that the page opens correctly when I play around with the settings, which is related to the HTTPS-Only Mode and Automatic proxy configuration URL settings. I specify the address of ""http:"" in the Automatic proxy configuration URL. In that case, if HTTP-Only Mode is ON, it seems that the proxy configuration file cannot be read correctly. When I turned off HTTP-Only Mode and reloaded again, the page was displayed correctly. Alternatively, I can give up the specification in the Automatic proxy configuration URL and switch to the manual specification. That said, before 89, all settings were displayed correctly, so I think it was a trigger for the change in 89. Is there anything you can think of? Is such a phenomenon happening in other people? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",m-ina
