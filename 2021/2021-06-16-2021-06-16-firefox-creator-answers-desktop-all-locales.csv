Thank you for excellent Browser! </p><p>However, I've seen some bad things in Firefox 89, so I'll report it. After upgrading Firefox to 89, access from behind the proxy no longer reaches all addresses beyond the firewall. I noticed that the page opens correctly when I play around with the settings, which is related to the HTTPS-Only Mode and Automatic proxy configuration URL settings. I specify the address of ""http:"" in the Automatic proxy configuration URL. In that case, if HTTP-Only Mode is ON, it seems that the proxy configuration file cannot be read correctly. When I turned off HTTP-Only Mode and reloaded again, the page was displayed correctly. Alternatively, I can give up the specification in the Automatic proxy configuration URL and switch to the manual specification. That said, before 89, all settings were displayed correctly, so I think it was a trigger for the change in 89. Is there anything you can think of? Is such a phenomenon happening in other people? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",m-ina
