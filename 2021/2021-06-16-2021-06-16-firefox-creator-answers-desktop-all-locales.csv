Save the same pdf and open it it in Xreader, click print, and it starts printing immediately. Size of the document seems to play a role; I knew it was slow from trying to print smaller documents in the past, but today I needed a hard copy of a 68MB pdf, and hours later, it still had not printed. </p><p>I'm running latest Linux Mint Debian Edition 4 Debbie and latest Firefox in its repositories, 78.11.0esr (64-bit). Printer is Canon imageRunner 2200, it doesn't have any other slow printing problems, as I stated above. </p><p>Problem seems to have existed for a long time... </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,"",f4f4

I PREFER the SEARCH BAR as it will KEEP my SEARCH 'script' if I get a search not wanted. Then all I have to do is ""modify"" the SEARCH TEXT and search again.  I am trying to get use to typing my SEARCH in the SEARCH bar on the FIREFOX Main screen but is getting hard to break DECADE old habits since I started using FIREFOX  after I gave up on 'NAVIGATOR' a 'few' decades back?  OK, I am 'ole fashioned' sometimes... I never believed in ""change"" for ""change SAKE"".  AM I missing something in SETTINGS that SHOULD ALLOW us to choose the NEW WAY OR THE OLD WAY for at least awhile.   I would have these issues IF I knew the way to fond, use an older PROFILE as I would still be using versions in the early 80's. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jagman55

I wanted to have the address bar execute the search on the already open tab, and the search bar to open a new tab in the background without stealing the focus. I managed to set them up separately, now the address bar does not open a new tab and the search bar does, but the newly opened tab always steals the focus. I'm trying to keep the focus on the already open tab while the search bar opens a new tab without switching to it. Is there a way to achieve this? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",mostlynothuman
