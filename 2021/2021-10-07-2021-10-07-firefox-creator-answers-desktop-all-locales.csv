I have used an appimage to install it on a usb, BUT it still creates a folder with the profile in the Home directory on the PC hard drive.. Can you please give me some idea of how I can move the folder location from the hard drive and have everything pointed to the usb.. I have used the profile manager to create a new profile based on the USB, and then deleted the Mozilla folder on the PC hard drive, but that breaks FF. So obviously even though it is residing and running from the usb, it is referring to the hard drive for something..
