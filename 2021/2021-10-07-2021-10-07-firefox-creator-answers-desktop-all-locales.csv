It won't load the start page, addons page, or ANY WEBSITES WHATSOEVER! I've never encountered this issue before. I've tried refreshing Firefox, uninstalling &amp; reinstalling Firefox, tried deleting &amp; replacing my old Firefox profile because I thought it might be corrupted. NONE of these options worked! It worked fine earlier today, but it hasn't worked since restarting my computer system this past evening. I don't know which details are relevant or irrelevant so I'm trying to be as detailed as I can in explaining my issues. Can anyone tell me how I can fix this?

I have used an appimage to install it on a usb, BUT it still creates a folder with the profile in the Home directory on the PC hard drive.. Can you please give me some idea of how I can move the folder location from the hard drive and have everything pointed to the usb.. I have used the profile manager to create a new profile based on the USB, and then deleted the Mozilla folder on the PC hard drive, but that breaks FF. So obviously even though it is residing and running from the usb, it is referring to the hard drive for something..
