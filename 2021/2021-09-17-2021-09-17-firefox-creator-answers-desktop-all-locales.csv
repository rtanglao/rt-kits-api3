I would like to write a simple parsing script which extracts the main article text content from web pages with similar structure, i.e. different documentation articles about Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications. I am pretty sure I should inspect the HTML tree, figure out which nodes tend to contain article headers and paragraphs, and then just write a script that retrieves those nodes. What would be the simplest way to inspect the HTML tree to find the nodes, and then with which library should I extract the text content from those nodes?
