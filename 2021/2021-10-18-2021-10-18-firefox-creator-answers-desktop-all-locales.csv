No Nightly standard installation on this computer, so no Nightly installed at C:\Program Files, nor C:\Program Files (x86), nor C:\Users. </p><p>Please, I'm looking for a way where the update process is done silently, at least 3 times per day. By update process I mean: Check, Download, Apply/install updates and Restart (if needed)... silently and automatically (no human intervention)... at least 3 times per day. I need to be sure that every time a Nightly is launched ALWAYS is already automatically updated. </p><p>I googled the subject and I found very old articles, so I preferred to ignore them. However, it seems that recently Nightly started to use a new Mozilla Maintenance Service + Firefox Background Updates. But if I well understood, it only works if Nightly is closed/not in use, which is useless for my needs described above. </p><p>A very friendly developer helped me, and he wrote a java script which works perfectly for my needs. But I wonder if I can avoid external java scripts. I wonder if I can achieve same results just by using Nightly own resources. I wonder if I can use the new Mozilla Maintenance Service with a specific Windows task (or a batch file etc). </p><p>Any help will be much appreciated. Thank you in advance! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",lepefe1

Today it has changed and it is terrible.  Using MS Edge it is still the same as always so Firefox must have somehow changed how msn homepage looks.  I want the msn homepage on firefox that I am used to and like....NOT the one from today that changed.  Please tell me how to get the msn homepage I want back on Firefox.  Would it maybe be to install a former version such as v92 of firefox so the msn homepage is how I am used to?
