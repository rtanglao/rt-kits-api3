This Nightly was manually installed in a customized folder, so it works like a portable Nightly (you can copy/paste it to another folder and it'll work). In fact, for test purposes I have several Nightlys manually installed in different customized folder, all working at the same time. No Nightly standard installation on this computer, so no Nightly installed at C:\Program Files, nor C:\Program Files (x86), nor C:\Users. </p><p>Please, I'm looking for a way where the update process is done silently, at least 3 times per day. By update process I mean: Check, Download, Apply/install updates and Restart (if needed)... silently and automatically (no human intervention)... at least 3 times per day. I need to be sure that every time a Nightly is launched ALWAYS is already automatically updated. </p><p>I googled the subject and I found very old articles, so I preferred to ignore them. However, it seems that recently Nightly started to use a new Mozilla Maintenance Service + Firefox Background Updates. But if I well understood, it only works if Nightly is closed/not in use, which is useless for my needs described above. </p><p>A very friendly developer helped me, and he wrote a java script which works perfectly for my needs. But I wonder if I can avoid external java scripts. I wonder if I can achieve same results just by using Nightly own resources. I wonder if I can use the new Mozilla Maintenance Service with a specific Windows task (or a batch file etc). </p><p>Any help will be much appreciated.
