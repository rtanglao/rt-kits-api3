When I open a window (application, data folder or whatever) in front of firefox, then the window doesn't disappear properly when I close it. Bits of it remain (see images) and I have to click on the menu bar or outside the firefox window to get rid of them. It's getting a bit annoying - doesn't happen al the time, but regularly on a seemingly random basis. The problem has existed for a while now, since two or three updates ago. Any clues as to what's going on?  Thanks, </p><pre>Fraidy. </pre>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-930;,firefox,other,en-US,"",cesolon

Recently (10/10/2021) attempted to download .aax files from <a href=""http://Audible.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Audible.com</a>.  Files were unexpectedly converted to .mp4 files, making files unusable by iBooks.  Conferred with Audible Tech support.  Audible Tech confirmed that .aax files are the proper format and that they did not/do not make any format conversions on their end.  Audible Tech then suggested trying download with Safari.  Download (of .aax files with Safari) was successful and maintained proper (.aax) format.  Audible Tech said that he had not encountered this issue before and that it seemed to him that the Firefox browser may be responsible for the unexpected conversion.  In the past I have used Firefox many times to successfully download .aax files from <a href=""http://Audible.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Audible.com</a>, most recent prior to this problem was on (9/11/2021).  I am notifying you simply to advise that you may have a programing glitch within the download programing portion of the latest version of Firefox (ver. 93.0 - 64 bit) for iMac(s). </p>",mac-os;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-930;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1451899;,SkyTraveln
