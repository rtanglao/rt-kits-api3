Recently (10/10/2021) attempted to download .aax files from <a href=""http://Audible.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Audible.com</a>.  Files were unexpectedly converted to .mp4 files, making files unusable by iBooks.  Conferred with Audible Tech support.  Audible Tech confirmed that .aax files are the proper format and that they did not/do not make any format conversions on their end.  Audible Tech then suggested trying download with Safari.  Download (of .aax files with Safari) was successful and maintained proper (.aax) format.  Audible Tech said that he had not encountered this issue before and that it seemed to him that the Firefox browser may be responsible for the unexpected conversion.  In the past I have used Firefox many times to successfully download .aax files from <a href=""http://Audible.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Audible.com</a>, most recent prior to this problem was on (9/11/2021).  I am notifying you simply to advise that you may have a programing glitch within the download programing portion of the latest version of Firefox (ver. 93.0 - 64 bit) for iMac(s). </p>",mac-os;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-930;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1451899;,SkyTraveln
