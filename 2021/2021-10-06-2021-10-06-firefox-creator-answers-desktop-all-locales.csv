If I ignore it all is well, but the password in the box is not the one originally saved.  If  I save it I can see a randomly generated password which is, obviously, invalid for that site.  If I have multiple log-ins it gets very confusing as some users will hit save thinking 'that's ok'  and others won't. If I disable 'ask to save log-ins' it doesn't populate the ones already saved.  Currently my only option is to cancel the 'update' pop-up every time which is annoying and confusing. I've cleared the cache for several sites to no avail. Any thoughts? </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-920;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",essenjay68
