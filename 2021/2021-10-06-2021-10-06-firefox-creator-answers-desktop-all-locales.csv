Na starším PC, který mi ještě jede na Windows XP Professional (32bit, AMD Athlon 1,15 GHz a 2,25 GB RAM, používám prohlížeč Mozilla Firefox 48.0.2) se mi od čtvrtečního odpoledne nedaří otevřít některé webové stránky, např. SEZNAM a CENTRUM, a objeví se hlášení o NEZABEZPEČENÉM PŘIPOJENÍ a neplatných certifikátech. Na jiné stránky se dostanu. Je nás asi víc, přikládám ještě zprávičku ze stránek Seznamu a nějakými doporučeními.  <a href=""https://napoveda.seznam.cz/forum/subsections/489"" rel=""nofollow"">https://napoveda.seznam.cz/forum/subsections/489</a> Zkoušel jsem restartovat zmiňovaná zařízení, ale nepomohlo to. Radil jsem se i s podporou <a href=""http://Seznam.cz"" rel=""nofollow"">Seznam.cz</a>, ale nepodařilo se mi problém nějak vyřešit. Prý je to zapříčiněno aktualizací bezpečnostních certifikátů, které už moje verze prohlížeče a OS nepobere. Na jiném počítači mám normálně Win10, ale na tomto jsem si nechal XP úmyslně, protože mi tam funguje spousta věcí, které by už na Windows 10 asi nechodili. Prý je v případě Win XP třeba stažení a nainstalování nejnovější dostupné verze Firefoxu pro OS, což by údajně měla být 52.9.0 esr. Má verze 48.0.2 prý není podporovaná pro přístup na stránky <a href=""http://Seznam.cz"" rel=""nofollow"">Seznam.cz</a>. Nedokázal by mi, prosím, někdo poslat instalační soubor na zmiňovanou verzi Firefoxu 52.9.0esr nebo nějak jinak poradit? Děkuji.

I really want this back - I don’t want to change from DuckDuckGo but there are a lot of times it’s helpful to use google, and having to copy my search, go to <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> and paste it, is annoying, when I used to have the easy option of clicking in the search bar and then picking google on the bottom toolbar. </p>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,1448753;,Glencora

If I have multiple log-ins it gets very confusing as some users will hit save thinking 'that's ok'  and others won't. If I disable 'ask to save log-ins' it doesn't populate the ones already saved.  Currently my only option is to cancel the 'update' pop-up every time which is annoying and confusing. I've cleared the cache for several sites to no avail.
