After a while either the open tab or the browser will crash. I have tried troubleshooting mode, an account refresh and a fresh install of Firefox, but the crashes still occured after/during all of these fixes. I've tested my RAM and there were no errors detected. This problem has been occuring for a month or so, but seems to be getting more frequent. I've included the report IDs of the most recent crash reports. </p><p>bp-c3632dd7-dff1-4265-90e9-f62710210926 bp-3eb0a8ac-a491-48ac-a186-997250210926 bp-c3632dd7-dff1-4265-90e9-f62710210926 bp-80bb3b1e-6a1d-4942-ac4b-c8de80210926 bp-d649e773-27d6-479e-99b2-bf5d90210926 </p><p>Thanks in advance if anyone has any suggestions! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",sianstables
