It always assumes an ongoing conversation, I do not want that at all. My email provider is WOW, they seem to be changed also. What I miss most is that when I enter a name  the email address no longer appears. That ruins it totally. That is/was the very best email function but now it is gone. </p><p>I use that address to start a new conversation with a friend, and now that function is no longer found.. When I open an email the sender address is not shown, I need that address always. The sender address is vital, it is how I report scams, but more important it is how I can send a new email to the sender, I do not always want to do a reply. The size of the email is not shown, that is how I detect spam and hidden malware. </p><p>Has Mozilla been taken over by microsoft? That is what this change looks like. (Sorry, I know that sounds rather nasty, but it looks that way) </p><p>I use several different computers but I am the only user, I have not yet tried the other computers to see if the old version is still available.
