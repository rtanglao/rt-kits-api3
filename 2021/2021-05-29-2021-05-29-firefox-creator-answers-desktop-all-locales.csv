One article is about Firefox and Chromium security[1] and the author claims that Firefox is lacking in its security, so much so that they advise people to stick to Chromium[2]. I can’t make heads or tails of it but (at least from a layman’s point of view) they seem to know what they are talking about.  At the very end they even include other security researchers who seem to share the same opinion. The only potential flaw I found in the article is that they claim Firefox lacks site isolation, which seems to be true at the moment, but since Fission is now available on Firefox it looks like that will no longer be true in the near-future. However they did claim that Fission still has leaks, which might indicate that it is still a security concern. </p><p>I came to ask what others thought of these criticisms and see if they hold water. If so, does Mozilla have plans on improving the security of Firefox? In my opinion, most of Firefox’s user base is made of people who care about privacy, security, and freedom. If it’s true that Firefox has poor security, I think securing Firefox should be one of Mozilla’s top priorities before trying to add new features or create a fancier UI to appeal to the general public. </p><p>[1] <a href=""https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/firefox-chromium.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/firefox-chromium.html</a> [2] <a href=""https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/security-privacy-advice.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/security-privacy-advice.html</a> </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",nacknack
