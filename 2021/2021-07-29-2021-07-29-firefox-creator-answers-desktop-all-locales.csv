Opening new tabs are hard. Will not close tabs very well, leaving unused space on top. Different sites show up on another sites tab. Worst of all, this new version is a memory hog, with me eventually having to reboot the PC to clear memory until the next time. </p><p>Can you please help? </p><p>Thanks in advance, </p><p>Joe Lisak </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-900;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Joe_in_Indiana

When I followed all the existing steps (closing Firefox and replacing the current stuff with the backups), it only took me to a blank ""about:restore"" tab and popped up an about:support tab. </p><p>When I tried loading it into the scrounger (<a href=""https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/scrounger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/scrounger.html</a>), it crashed the tab no matter how many times I try.

1345317,2021-07-28 18:18:23 -0700,2021-07-28 19:46:54 -0700,Data clogging my browser.,<p>My Firefox browser is constantly showing 1 GB of disk space used.  I've set up automatic clear of site data and cookies.  I'm constantly having to clear all data and then sign in to all my usual websites all over again.  I'm not able to get onto my banking websites most likely due to this data clog.  I'm SO TOTALLY tired of this constant cycle of trying to clear my data and accessing my usual websites.  I'm using Firefox for many years without this trouble.  I'm one week away from changing browsers.  If I go to Safari I am not finding this trouble.  Chrome is my next choice. I use my Mac computer for personal use only and my firefox is up to date.  I'm using Big Sur on my macbook pro. What is going on??  Without a solution I'm out of here. </p>,desktop;fix-problems;firefox-900;firefox-9002;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1430972;,bonnygal2
