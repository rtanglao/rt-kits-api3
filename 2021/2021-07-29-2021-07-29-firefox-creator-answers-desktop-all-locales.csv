I've managed to turn off all the address bar suggestions and whatnot with about a dozen different setting which is ridiculous. Turning off the rich results should fix everything but it doesn't. No mater what I try I cannot get text to appear in the Google search bar. So basically Firefox has stolen the functionality of the Google webpage for me.

I also know that there is a recovery file somewhere in the firefox folder which is used when hitting ""Restore previous session"" to get back the previous windows Would that mean it's possible to find the file from the old computer's hard drive and move it to the same folder on the new computer to use for the restore function in a similar was as the bookmarks? </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,tips,en-US,1431111;,mccool37
