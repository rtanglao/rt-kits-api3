On my old computer I had a fair few windows open. Because of a lot of different issues (bad battery, no working charger etc.), I have access to the hard drive of my old computer but I can't turn it on anymore and it died before I could reopen most of the windows on my new computer. I'm able to use the hard drive as an external hard drive to transfer everything to the new computer as needed So, I know it's possible to get back bookmarks by transferring the files. I also know that there is a recovery file somewhere in the firefox folder which is used when hitting ""Restore previous session"" to get back the previous windows Would that mean it's possible to find the file from the old computer's hard drive and move it to the same folder on the new computer to use for the restore function in a similar was as the bookmarks? </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",mccool37
