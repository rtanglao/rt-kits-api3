It used to be exclusively when I'm visiting <a href=""https://translate.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://translate.google.com</a>. Today, however, it is also happening on <a href=""http://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">twitter.com</a>. </p><p>When it happens however, it has always been when I'm navigating to one of those domains in open tab that I was using. Also, it has always been when I'm relying on the bar's autocomplete (for example, when I start typing ""tra"" and the rest is auto completed to <a href=""http://translate.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">translate.google.com</a>) and I tap the Enter key. No amount of refreshes fixes the problem even if I disable cache (I disabled it from the network inspector in the web developer tools). There's only one warning message in the console saying ""This error page has no error code in its security info"". Also, even if I change URLs while under any of these 2 domains in that ""broken"" tab, I keep getting a blocked page. Changing to another domain, for example, <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> works. For example, If I change from <a href=""https://translate.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://translate.google.com</a> to: - <a href=""https://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com</a> gives a broken page - <a href=""https://twitter.com/firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/firefox</a> gives a broken page - <a href=""https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;text=Hello%20word&amp;op=translate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;text=Hello%20word&amp;op=translate</a> gives a broken page - <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org</a> works </p><p><br> However, if I just go to the url bar and tap ""Alt"" + ""Enter"", the page successfully opens in a new tab. </p><p>I'm using Firefox on Mac. </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;firefox-920;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",dannyhajj
