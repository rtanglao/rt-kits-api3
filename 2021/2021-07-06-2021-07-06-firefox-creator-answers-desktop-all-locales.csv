Until recently everything was running great, but since the last few updates I've noticed a strange and extraordinarily frustrating bug or issue with Firefox on my system where the internet pages are intermittently taking way too long to load, or sometimes just will not load at all. I've tried various different things to troubleshoot, including booting in safe mode, disabling extensions etc etc but the problem will still manifest itself over and over. The same behaviour does not appear on chrome browser, which will load websites fine at exactly the same time as Firefox takes forever, which rules out an internet connection or network issue. </p><p>One thing that I've noticed is that firefox itself is constantly(!) checking for updates in the background, regardless of whether I set it to automatic, manual or background service. Is there any way to stop firefox checking for updates? Whenever it is stuck in this mode the issues seem to appear. It's extremely frustrating and I've been driven to posting on here to see if someone can shed some light on the issue. Having been a firefox user since forever I'm loath to replace it with an alternative like chrome, but if it won't load webpages then it's not doing it's basic job. I am running a windows 7 64 system here and have a number of plugins running in firefox but as I said I've tried disabling those to no avail. I've attached a screenshot of the browser stuck 'checking for updates'. </p><p>Appreciate any feedback or suggestions on how to fix. Thanks </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1426003;,umek16

I captured the attached screenshot using a tiny HTML file that I wrote myself and has <strong>no</strong> CSS.
