I have looked through the forum for solutions and none have helped. Before you guys go and waste both your and my time, I have tried restarting Firefox in safe mode, disabled adblock (in my case uBlock Origin), added the following exception in uBlock: '<a href=""http://www.youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.youtube.com</a> <a href=""http://plus.googleapis.com"" rel=""nofollow"">plus.googleapis.com</a> * allow', and disabled all add-ons in Firefox to see if anyone of them were responsible. None of it has helped. Also the only thing new between comments loading normally in YouTube and now is a firefox update and nothing else; no new add-ons or filters for my adblock. What I need now is a different kind of solution or a work around other than the ones I mentioned above or changing my browser entirely. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",moe13

I love Firefox and using him for many years this time i run on 64bit version number 88.0. I recently discover problem with my saved passwords in Firefox and i mean this broke my or everyone privacy using feature of saving passwords by Firefox. After some time past installation of antivirus program Avast on my desktop PC i was surprised with new installed program on my desktop named Avast Secure Browser. I ran this program first time and without any his any question he show up in front of meon desktop. I discover in his settings that all my passwords saved in Firefox was succesfully decrypted because when i click on the eye icon my password was showed up as he is in firefox. Then i search for a file in my user profile where the Avast Secure Browser has my passwords stored and then check this file on all other user profiles on my PC where nobody not even once run this Avast Secure Browser but all passwords was already prepared for them in that file on all user accounts without any grant or approval by other users during their work on PC. I am only man which administrate this PC and I dont allow Avast Secure Browser stole my passwords from Firefox.  My questions is obvious. <strong>How secure is for any user which stored their passwords in Firefox before any other system application like antivirus installed on PC with platform windows?</strong> How is possible for any app simply decrypt my passwords from logins.json file? For me it is a very bad if this was allowed through maybe some function in Firefox API that can some program use, but i am not an expert on Firefox a that is why i wrote this. If a problem is Avast which use some not good practise in this app, then i immediately send him feedback. But firstly i want answer from your team. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1426125;,mbagin24

Until recently everything was running great, but since the last few updates I've noticed a strange and extraordinarily frustrating bug or issue with Firefox on my system where the internet pages are intermittently taking way too long to load, or sometimes just will not load at all. I've tried various different things to troubleshoot, including booting in safe mode, disabling extensions etc etc but the problem will still manifest itself over and over. The same behaviour does not appear on chrome browser, which will load websites fine at exactly the same time as Firefox takes forever, which rules out an internet connection or network issue. </p><p>One thing that I've noticed is that firefox itself is constantly(!) checking for updates in the background, regardless of whether I set it to automatic, manual or background service. Is there any way to stop firefox checking for updates? Whenever it is stuck in this mode the issues seem to appear. It's extremely frustrating and I've been driven to posting on here to see if someone can shed some light on the issue. Having been a firefox user since forever I'm loath to replace it with an alternative like chrome, but if it won't load webpages then it's not doing it's basic job. I am running a windows 7 64 system here and have a number of plugins running in firefox but as I said I've tried disabling those to no avail.
