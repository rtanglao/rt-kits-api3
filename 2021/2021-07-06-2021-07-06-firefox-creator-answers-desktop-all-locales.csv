After a recent Firefox update, I noticed that the <em>default</em> scrollbar appearance has changed. Scrollbars in Firefox no longer look like the desktop theme and all the other apps. Instead, they are very thin and have no arrows at the top and bottom. Please see the attached screenshots: Firefox vs. standard application (Pluma text editor). I would like to get the scrollbars back to the desktop theme appearance. </p><p>Just to be clear, this is <strong>not</strong> about websites that customize the scrollbar appearance through CSS. I captured the attached screenshot using a tiny HTML file that I wrote myself and has <strong>no</strong> CSS. For what is worth, I tried to customize the scrollbars by following the suggestions I had found in other posts, namely through ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css and userContent.css. None of that worked. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,"",radu.rendec

They get reduced with a `...`. The only way I've found to show the full list of selectors is to double-click it (which puts it into ""Edit as HTML"" mode). </p><p>As a web developer, I find this is adding unnecessary complication and inconvenience. When picking selectors from the page, as I build out custom CSS, I don't want to have to put some HTML elements into ""Edit as HTML"" just to see what the full list of classes is, for example. </p><p>It most commonly occurs on the `body` elements on Wordpress sites (which tends to have a long list of `class` selectors for this element). </p><p>Is there a way to turn this feature off? </p><p>Here's the way it's displaying by default: <a href=""https://ibb.co/MN93bKw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ibb.co/MN93bKw</a> </p><p>Here's the full list of selectors on that same element: <a href=""https://ibb.co/Z85Sq6H"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ibb.co/Z85Sq6H</a> </p><p>Thanks very much. </p><p>Jonathan </p>",mac-os;desktop;beta;customize;firefox-900;,firefox,customize,en-US,1425964;,inspiredearthnz
