Reinstalling the program may fix this problem.  I keep uninstalling, and when I re-install it says it detects an older version so lets update it. I do that, then all I see is a black page. I can't go to any website what-so-ever. So I go through the whole process again. I even started in ""safe mode"" and still nothing.  Does anyone have any suggestions? I deleted all of my extensions from it, but when it re-downloads and installs they are there again. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1425983;,HaughnKA

After a recent Firefox update, I noticed that the <em>default</em> scrollbar appearance has changed. Scrollbars in Firefox no longer look like the desktop theme and all the other apps. Instead, they are very thin and have no arrows at the top and bottom. Please see the attached screenshots: Firefox vs. standard application (Pluma text editor). I would like to get the scrollbars back to the desktop theme appearance. </p><p>Just to be clear, this is <strong>not</strong> about websites that customize the scrollbar appearance through CSS. I captured the attached screenshot using a tiny HTML file that I wrote myself and has <strong>no</strong> CSS. For what is worth, I tried to customize the scrollbars by following the suggestions I had found in other posts, namely through ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css and userContent.css. None of that worked. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,"",radu.rendec

They get reduced with a `...`. The only way I've found to show the full list of selectors is to double-click it (which puts it into ""Edit as HTML"" mode). </p><p>As a web developer, I find this is adding unnecessary complication and inconvenience.
