Most of the times when I submit the report and restart firefox I lose all my tabs, which is very annoying since I generally have around ten open all the time - for a reason. My husband also experiences these crashes on his laptop. There is no new software installed, nothing has changed on/in either of the computers, firefox is up to date. I need my browser to be dependable, the crash is one thing, the loss of the tabs is intolerable. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1413050;,noematik
