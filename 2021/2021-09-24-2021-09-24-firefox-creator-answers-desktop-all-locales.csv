When you hover the cursor over a particular folder or link, it takes forever for it to be highlighted.  In addition, the favicon associated with any particular link takes forever to populate.  The bookmarks worked perfect prior to version 92.0.  Being that I am a WIN 7 user, it would appear that whatever the developers did beginning with 92.0, had great affect to WIN 7 users, which implies that maybe other WIN 7 users may also be having the identical issues with their bookmarks.  The developers should fix this issue ASAP in the next update.  There is no excuse for this issue to be occurring. </p>",windows-7;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-920;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",lee.turkstra
