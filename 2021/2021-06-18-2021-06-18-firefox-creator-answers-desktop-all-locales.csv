Most of the page loads, but the Calendar and display tweets sub-windows will not load! It will be obvious to all where they should be displaying but are not! </p><p>So, I tried removing <a href=""http://12cdrc.org"" rel=""nofollow"">12cdrc.org</a> cookies. Things got worse! Now the Login won't work either, where I was logged in as my user for the site prior to that. </p><p>I tried a Private window/session, and the Login function does work, the Calendar does show, but the tweets sub-section/window still does not display/function. </p><p>Background: This is not the first website to malfunction using Firefox... Previous version updates broke the <a href=""http://rescuemichigan.com"" rel=""nofollow"">rescuemichigan.com</a> website (none of the pull-down menu functions work, but work fine on/with Brave, Chrome, Edge)! Also <a href=""http://mewe.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mewe.com</a> acts up using FF at times, but a clear of the <a href=""http://mewe.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mewe.com</a> related cookies and relogin at mewe via FF clears up the issues of things not wanting to display correctly or fully on mewe using FF - which is why I thought clearing <a href=""http://12cdrc.org"" rel=""nofollow"">12cdrc.org</a> cookies would help in this case (but did not, again, made the malfunctioning worse)! </p><p>This makes little sense. I even tried doing D/L of full 89.0.1 install, didn't help. </p><p>I'd like to try and RESTORE COOKIES (last thing I want to do is clear all data/cookies for FF) for <a href=""http://12cdrc.org"" rel=""nofollow"">12cdrc.org</a> from manual offload of all my userid appdata folder/sub-folders to an external drive (or perhaps appdata backup to Norton cloud backup done a few weeks ago)!

Now, it is only the font/text that is visible when looking at my browser's multiple tabs. The edges have disappeared, only showing up as a faint shadow when I hover the pointer over a tab.
