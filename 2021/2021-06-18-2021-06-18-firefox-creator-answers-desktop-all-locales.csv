There was a block option there and I 'assumed' *chuckles* it was just for the post. But now I've lost ALL my ellipsis on all the posts. :(  I tried contacting Facebook but I fear it was a Firefox browser thing? Or am I wrong. I'm an idiot.

That no longer works.  You can see in the screenshot below that the option check box is ticked. </p><p>This is a fairly recent phenomenon; however, I cannot say for certain when it started.  I think it was when the last ver. 88nnn or the first ver 89 were released and installed. </p><p>What, if anything, can I do to return Firefox to Restoring Previous Session? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,1422288;,rabbithutch1
