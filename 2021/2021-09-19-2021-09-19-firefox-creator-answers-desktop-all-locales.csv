While going through my bookmarks, I tried to log into my Gmail account and it would ask me to ""Add Gmail to your Google Account"".  What is odd is I just tried accessing my Gmail account from my old computer using Firefox and I was able to access my mail.  I have looked through all the Firefox settings on both computers and cannot find any differences.  Looking through other posts about this issue, I've tried the safe mode and disabled add blocker without satisfactory results.

I even installed Firefox on my M1 Macbook Pro and immediately deleted it as it was using a TON of resources and slowing down my machine. </p><p>Can ANYONE please help me in finding out what is wrong with Firefox to make it so very slow in loading for the first time upon firing up my machine.
