The correct URL is present, but nothing loads, it's just a blank black page. I have tried turning off the add-ons and refreshing the page, closing and reopening Firefox with the add-ons manually turned off, restarting Firefox with the add-ons disabled, and restarting in safe mode. All of the attempts were performed without any positive results.  I can copy the URL on Firefox and paste it in Edge, and it opens the correct page. I installed Chrome against my better judgment and pasted the URL, and the correct page opens again. I can copy the URL in either Edge or Chrome, paste it on Firefox, and the same results occur as if I clicked on the link in my bookmarks on Firefox. I can click on the bookmark from either the home page or a page that's already opened, and nothing happens. The URL doesn't change on the existing page, and on the home page, ""Search with DuckDuckGo or enter address"" in the UL space does not change to the URL that I'm trying to open. Is there something I'm missing?  This is one of the URLs that I am trying to open if you want to try it yourself on Firefox: <a href=""https://www.att.com/idpassets/images/support/wireless/Devices-Working-on-ATT-Network.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.att.com/idpassets/images/support/wireless/Devices-Working-on-ATT-Network.pdf</a>  I only ever use Edge when I'm having an issue with Firefox, (usually it's when I'm trying to log on to an account or something and I can't, then I realize that it may be one of my add-ons preventing it. I then disable them one by one until I'm able to achieve what I want.  I don't want to have to switch back and forth between Firefox and Edge just to view three PDFs, so if someone knows what could be the resolution to this, I would appreciate it greatly. </pre>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",zx9r170
