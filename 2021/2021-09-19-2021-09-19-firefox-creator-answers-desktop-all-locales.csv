I have scoured the web and read all the community posts on this robot head, under remote control, and orange stripes in the address bar problem that so many people seem to be having. There are a few answers, but almost all of them use very technical terms that are way above my head and not defined. None of them provide a sequence of steps to fix the problem that a browser novice might be able to follow. Surely there must be a way to fix this or to explain to frustrated users why it is there and not removable. None of my other Firefox browsers have this on other machines. </p><p>Is there a series of steps to solve the problem? That would be so helpful especially without undefined terms. Thanks so much. This type of answer will help so many frustrated users (me included of course) :) </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,other,en-US,1444504;1444512;1444514;1444518;1444529;,photonic
