These are clearly secure. I see the ""connection not secure"" notice because there is supposedly a problem with the certificate. All the help tutorials from Mozilla do not work. For example, I can't listen to internet radio (example: <a href=""http://radio.orange.com/radios/helpmechill"" rel=""nofollow"">http://radio.orange.com/radios/helpmechill</a>). Have Windows 10, I clear the cache regularly, it is also not a problem with external security program like ESET etc.. Suggested solutions do not work, I have no option to turn off the security blocking temporarily etc. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1444580;,Thunderbolt1

Chrome works like a charm. Faster than ever, actually. However, I missed Firefox and it has all my settings the way I like and doesn't have the annoying download feature than Chrome has where it leaves little files along with the download cluttered all over your desktop. </p><p>I have had Firefox deleted from my system for months now and have been using Chrome as my daily browser. I wanted to give Firefox a chance again, seeing as I have Windows 11 IE installed, and figuring that maybe there was a Windows 10 Pro bug that was causing the slowness within Firefox, but no, it is definitely Firefox. I even installed Firefox on my M1 Macbook Pro and immediately deleted it as it was using a TON of resources and slowing down my machine. </p><p>Can ANYONE please help me in finding out what is wrong with Firefox to make it so very slow in loading for the first time upon firing up my machine. It somewhat loads ok after it's been closed and loaded again a while later, but this waiting forever for it to load on startup is absolutely ridiculous. </p><p>For the record, I don't know how to use the about:help stuff, so if you are going to suggest something, then please be very specific as I have not really dabbled in that so know next to nothing about that feature.

I have scoured the web and read all the community posts on this robot head, under remote control, and orange stripes in the address bar problem that so many people seem to be having. There are a few answers, but almost all of them use very technical terms that are way above my head and not defined. None of them provide a sequence of steps to fix the problem that a browser novice might be able to follow. Surely there must be a way to fix this or to explain to frustrated users why it is there and not removable. None of my other Firefox browsers have this on other machines. </p><p>Is there a series of steps to solve the problem? That would be so helpful especially without undefined terms. Thanks so much.
