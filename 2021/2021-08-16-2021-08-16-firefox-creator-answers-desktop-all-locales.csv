Maybe some underlying process that FF uses is broken? </p><p>I should also mention that loading many sites (Reddit, StackOverflow, etc.) is now extreeeemely slow.

There have been a lot of suspicious accesses to my PC these days, and no matter how hard I try, I can't prevent it. So I have a suggestion for you. I want you to increase the hardness of security by registering that firefox users do not have smartphones. That way, you can block suspicious access to my PC and not feel uncomfortable. Can you know how unpleasant I am? I live in Japan. My PC terminal is connected to the corporate terminal of Osaka City Hall. Before I knew it. I just used Osaka City Hall for work!
