It is harder to read while typing, and there is no point in having a large search box in the middle of the screen if all search activity is immediately redirected to the small address bar space at the top of the screen.  I would like to restore my searches to the Google search box in the middle of the screen. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,"",sfroot

If I open a new tab with a link, I get the name of the website on the tab and a grayed out screen.

I only started experiencing this issue after installing avast cleanup and premium security, but I can't find anything that is ""blocking"" firefox or its access to the internet. I don't know what else to do, I've had a similar issue occur before where I've been using Avast's cleaning service and selected Firefox's browser cache or downloads or something, and I don't recall how I fixed it. I can only assume it has something to do the antivirus that I installed, but I don't know what to do to fix firefox, lest I just uninstall the antivirus.
