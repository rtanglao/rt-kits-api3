1347319,2021-08-16 04:22:02 -0700,2021-08-16 04:25:11 -0700,hi Suggestion to you from me.,"<p>I'll propose it here for the first time. I am a smartphone I don't have it, but can you register it with firefox as one of the security things you don't have? Because the browser constantly asks me to sign up for my android. Is it mysterious? I don't have an i-phone or another smartphone. Would this support be proof that someone is accessing it using my account? There have been a lot of suspicious accesses to my PC these days, and no matter how hard I try, I can't prevent it. So I have a suggestion for you. I want you to increase the hardness of security by registering that firefox users do not have smartphones. That way, you can block suspicious access to my PC and not feel uncomfortable. Can you know how unpleasant I am? I live in Japan. My PC terminal is connected to the corporate terminal of Osaka City Hall. Before I knew it. I just used Osaka City Hall for work! I don't live in this city. This criminal is probably using android. Register that the user does not have a smartphone and block from these things </p><p>Would you like to do it? </p><p>Thank you for reading. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1435589;,agomakura

This is tedious, and not necessary on my system, which only I have access to. Can I change the settings either to only require a password once only when the programme is invoked or to extend the time that a password remain valid? (If there is a method - I can't find it!)
