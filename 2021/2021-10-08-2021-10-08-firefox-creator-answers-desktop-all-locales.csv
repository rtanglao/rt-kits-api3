Isso está acontecendo desde que meu computador atualizou o Windows para a versão 21H1 no domingo. Já tentei reinstalar o Firefox, remover add-ons, limpar cache, cookies, histórico completo, resetar certificados SSL no windows, delisgar o monitoramento de internet do Avast e até mesmo remover o Avast por completo, mas nada funcionou. Chrome também está com o mesmo problema, então acredito que o Firefox não seja o culpado, porém ainda não encontrei uma solução e está ficando incrivelmente complicado utilizar o computador assim, pois dependo muito do gmail e do docs. Estou até mesmo considerando instalar uma versão desatualizada do Windows como última alternativa e perder meu fim de semana reconfigurando tudo novamente.
