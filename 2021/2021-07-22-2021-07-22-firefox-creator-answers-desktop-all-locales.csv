I mean HUGE (40pt??). </p><p>I have tried so many things (changing scale/print preview settings, troubleshooting from the Firefox menu, checking for software/driver updates, turning the printer/computer (Windows 10 laptop - new) off, checking printer settings in some weird config menu in Firefox, changing the default font size/zoom (this changes how I see it but not how it's printed) ARGH!!!!!)  </p><p>NOTHING WORKS. Where there is a forum or help tip, I've tried it. Where it has worked for others, it does not work for me. Chrome works fine. Printing to PDF works fine.  </p><p>Aha, you say, it must be my printer (HP smartank 450)! Well the nice folk at HP have spent hours trying to fix this and have no clue. I am about to give up on Firefox. Can anyone help?? </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,1429228;,thebollemonster
