So websites should be shown not by default font, but the font used in websites. But if I turn that option OFF, than I can see websites like it should be, like it was before new version, and like it's shown in other major browsers. But it gives me wrong look (font) with some other websites, so it's not the permanent solution. I guess it's some kind of problem with new version of FF. </p><p>Note: Same thing happend a couple of weeks or months ago with one of previous FF versions, but that was fixed just day or two later with another new version. It looks like we have simmilar problem right now. </p><p>Thanx in advance for any help, and I hope somebody will fix that soon.
