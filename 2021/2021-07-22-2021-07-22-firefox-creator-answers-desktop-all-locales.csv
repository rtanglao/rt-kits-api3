The problem came with the new version 90.0.1. There are some websites I visit every day, and after installing new version of FF I noticed that the fonts used in websites are different than it was before. Some websites are breaking apart and doesn't look like they did before, and like they look in other major browsers right now. </p><p>Examples: <a href=""http://www.alterego.co.rs/_knjigovodstvo/aktuelno.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.alterego.co.rs/_knjigovodstvo/aktuelno.html</a> <a href=""https://www.arrowheadpride.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.arrowheadpride.com/</a> </p><p>I went to the <strong>Settings</strong> option and saw that my FF is set to show Times New Roman 16 as default font, but if I go to <strong>Advanced</strong> I can see that the checkbox on <strong>Allow pages to choose their own fonts, instead of your selections above option</strong> is <strong>ON</strong>. So websites should be shown not by default font, but the font used in websites. But if I turn that option OFF, than I can see websites like it should be, like it was before new version, and like it's shown in other major browsers. But it gives me wrong look (font) with some other websites, so it's not the permanent solution. I guess it's some kind of problem with new version of FF. </p><p>Note: Same thing happend a couple of weeks or months ago with one of previous FF versions, but that was fixed just day or two later with another new version. It looks like we have simmilar problem right now. </p><p>Thanx in advance for any help, and I hope somebody will fix that soon. I am lifelong user of FF browser because it's my favourite and the best, but that kind of problem can be pretty big for someone who is very often online and who is working in developing websites sometimes. </p><p>Thanx again Dragan </p>",desktop;websites;needsinfo;windows-10;firefox-900;firefox-9001;,firefox,websites,en-US,1429254;1429273;,alfa8link
