It persisted so I copied data and the chrome folder to a profile folder I created in October, 2020 but had not used.  That was on August 22, 2021.  It happened again with the 'new' profile.  I quit several times earlier in the day (without clearing history, clearing and managing data) without issue.  Sometimes the lock file is NOT deleted when Firefox quits.

When I go to a trusted website with a URL prefix of HTTP:// that I visit every day, I’m now getting a screen displayed saying the site does not support HTTPS://  and tries to redirect me to the HTTP:// . I say “tries” because Firefox seems to go into a loop about every 10 seconds redisplaying the website does not support HTTPS:// screen and then being redirecting to HTTP:// There is nothing wrong with the website and it specifically states it DOES NOT support “HTTPS://"" My settings under Tools==&gt;Settings=&gt;Privacy and Security for -	History Against the ‘Firefox will’ text I’ve have selected the “Never remember History” option -	HTTPS-Only Mode  I have selected “Don’t enable HTTPS-Only Mode” option </p><p>It appears to me that under Firefox versions 91.0 and above that the ‘Don’t enable HTTPS Only Mode’ is being ignored/overridden and that Firefox is changing the HTTP://  URL prefix to “HTTPS://”, when you set up, under the “History” either the “Never remember history” option or select “Use custom settings for history” option and then select “Always use private browsing mode”  I can get around this by either  -	Method 1 o	Selecting “Use custom settings for history” option For me this totally unacceptable as  OR -	Method 2 o	Selecting “Use custom settings for history” option o	Unchecking the ““Always use private browsing mode” o	After Firefox has restarted &gt;	Untick “Remember browsing and download history” &gt;	Untick “Remember search and form history” &gt;	Tick “Clear history when Firefox closes” </p><p>Is this a bug with versions 91.0 and above????? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-81;firefox-900;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1437468;1437469;1437506;,jamesp2434
