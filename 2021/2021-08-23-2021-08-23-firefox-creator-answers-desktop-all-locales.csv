The browser remembers the login details, but it logs out and I have to log in again. Logging out always takes place after 1 day. So it's not right after I close the page. </p><p>For example: on Monday I open the page, I log in and I work without problems all day, I open the page several times during the day. I turn off the PC in the afternoon. The next day I start the PC, I open the same website and I'm logged off. </p><p>I have set protection against tracking - I had a strict one, but there is no difference. I also tried to add individual sites to the exceptions of cookies and site data, also without effect. </p><p>Do you have any idea, please, what it could be or where I would set it up? By the way - Chrome doesn't do this to me. </p><p>Thanks a lot. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,websites,cs,"",pf93

Do we have a list or identifier that would indicate if there are add-ons that works or would have problems? </p><p>I have an add-on/extension in mind which is the DownloadHelper tool and its built in converter. I'm asking this because I know it primarily uses the CPU (in my case Intel macs) during conversion and I want to know if this tool would still work (or better seeing how M1 chips have been destroying benchmarks) with M1 macs. </p>,desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",wiryantirtarahardja

In standard windows I still get see the tracking icon in the address bar and I still get notifications from some websites asking me to disable AdBlockers. How can I completely disable this protection for all sites (not just exceptions for some sites)? </p><p>I do not support your politics of absolute, ruthless privacy protection and still wish to allow sites to generate some revenue from my visits on sites that are of value to me. I share the privacy concerns, but such features have to be balanced and not at the expense of independent sites that wish to generate some revenue from their sites. Firefox has always been my go-to browser, but this is increasingly infuriating. WHY are you forcing your opinionated, partially unethical preferences on your users and make it so hard to change it? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",hodel.patrick
