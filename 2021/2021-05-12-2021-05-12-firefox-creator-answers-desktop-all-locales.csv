I followed a hyperlink which had been e-mailed to me automatically in the past by the forum, and which pointed to <a href=""http://support.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">support.mozilla.org</a> </p><p>The first screen (whose URL I don't want to try to get right now because doing so might sign me out of my <a href=""http://Support.Mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Support.Mozilla.org</a> account) offered only an option for creating a new account, not signing into an existing account.  It turns out that this is a very significant wording mistake that needs to be corrected.   </p><p>Since I thought my existing account didn't exist anymore, I made a new account with my new e-mail address.   </p><p>Then I found that the short username assigned to my new account had a ""1"" suffixed - which meant that my existing account did exist after all.  So I deleted the new account.  I also managed to sign into my existing account by using the misleadingly named ""Create a new account"" method.   </p><p>The next problem was how to change my primary e-mail address.  There is no evident way to do this.  I eventually found article <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-primary-email-address-firefox-accounts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-primary-email-address-firefox-accounts</a> which confirmed my suspicion that the recommended workaround is to add the new address as a ""secondary address,"" then delete the primary address.  This is another significant issue that needs to be corrected.  I'm registered on possibly dozens of Web forums etc. &amp; all of them (except Mozilla) simply let me change my e-mail address when I need to.   </p><p>Anyway, now apparently the support forum doesn't let me add my current e-mail address as a secondary e-mail address, because there is still a record of this address on the defunct account that I just now created.  Also, the error message here is worded incorrectly (it claims that my new e-mail address is the same as my old e-mail address).   </p><p>Can I please have assistance from a forum admin in getting my e-mail address updated, without change to my short username.   </p><p>I also wish there were a more obvious way to ask for help (or raise defect reports) regarding the forum itself.   </p><p>Thanks for your help. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,1412396;1412405;1412408;,dg1727
