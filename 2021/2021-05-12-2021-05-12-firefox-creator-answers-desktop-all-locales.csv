It got so I couldnt see what I had typed as the screen was unreliable and blocked by the keyboard frequently. My new email worked well for a week. Now it has relearned its old habits. Its unreliable, frequently blocking content on the screen, making the phone unusable for mail. I cant get the keyboard off the center of the screen. And it constantly reappears making use of the phone impossible. Everyone points a finger a someone else </p><pre>The manufacturer of the phone blames my carrier who blames the software developer, who blames the updates and add ons. It has turned into a POS in one week. If I could find out who is responsible for this mess, I would gladly put a bullet in his or her head. Why cant I get the keyboard off my messages? </pre>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",sallyjuneodland
