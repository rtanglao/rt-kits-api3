Well by the time i set the primary password in firefox i realise that it replaced all the saved login passwords of over 600 URLS with primary password.  </p><p>I checked few articles where they have spoken about replacing logins-backup.json and key4.db file. In my case though i think this will not help because i had my syncing on, when i did primary password setting change. is there any method with which i can restore my previous passwords by creating new profile may be.  </p><p>Just desperately need way with which i can restore the passwords else this will be really difficult for my work </p><p>Thanks Prasad </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-870;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",dpsom_05
