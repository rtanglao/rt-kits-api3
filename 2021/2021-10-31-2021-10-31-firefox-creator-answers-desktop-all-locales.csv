There is nothing to open whether you download it or try to open it within Firefox.  Google Chrome can open the file with no issues.  In researching this I saw what looked like similar issues when using Android Firefox and the issue was the way the pdf file was set up on a particular website.  For Android Firefox there wasn't a workaround from what I could see.  Same issue for Windows 10 Firefox?  I didn't find any mention of this on the Mozilla Support page.  I believe I have seen this occasionally on other websites.  I know the behavior doesn't occur on every website when you are downloading or opening up a pdf file inside the browser.   I turned off Virus software so that is not issue. Cleaned up Firefox cache didn't change the behavior Firefox Browser is up to date V93.0 (64 bit) </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1455470;,rrlegault

I signed-out and then my computer was frozen and I powered-off the computer for safety. I started it again, and found that someone had replaced my Firefox with another version that had all of my settings removed. This was not an UPDATE by Firefox and I proved this. I checked my FIREWALL and some by the name of Igor Pavlov somehow was able to pass by my Kaspersky firewall; and, when I expanded his name, the evidence that he had indeed altered my Firefox (and perhaps more than once) was before my eyes! Shocking that he was able to alter my Firefox. Please see attachment. </p><p>Despite ""denying"" him in my firewall, I seem to continue to have problems with Firefox (freezing at times), even though I uninstalled the version that he put on, and reinstalled Firefox (which kept all of my old settings, as it always does with I reinstall or when updates are done).  I am afraid to use Firefox right now, unfortunately.  </p><p>At this point I want to entirely clean Firefox from my computer so that a reinstall does not recognize my past settings or anything else. Then reinstall fresh to see if that helps. </p><p>Do you have any other suggestions?  </p><p>Thanks very much, </p><p>TJ </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",tylerstanley7

The problem I'm having though is whenever I close the lid on my laptop for the night, then reopen it in the morning, the tab is no longer muted. Laptop is set to sleep when closing the lid. I just want to set the tab to mute permanently. Is there a way to do that without adding yet another extension to my growing list of extensions?  Or is this unmute behavior not supposed to happen and something is amiss? Any help would be appreciated. Thank you!
