I’m using a Mac and I just recently changed the main user’s name in the laptop, and now some images won’t ever load. For example, the profile pictures won’t load in StackOverflow and the image of my university in Google Drive won’t load. Actually, I’m not really sure anymore if it has anything to do with changing the username but I only started noticing it after that time. I also tried clearing the cache and resetting Firefox and even tried reinstalling it but the images still won’t load. Any help would be great. Thanks! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1455426;1455432;,bjlherrera
