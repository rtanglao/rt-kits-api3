I recently started having a problem, however. After I have been using firefox for a period of time, it stops loading webpages for me. I will search something or type a website into the search bar but nothing will happen. I know my internet is working because other browsers work just fine. The interesting thing is that when I close out of firefox and quit the application on my mac and reopen, the problem is resolved for a short period of time then it will start happening again. Any tips of what to do? </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;firefox-910;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",lvjnglng
