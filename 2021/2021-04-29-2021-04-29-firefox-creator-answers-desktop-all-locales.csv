I tried printing a receipt that was sent as an attachment to my gmail. It only prints very small in the upper left hand corner even though the print preview looks normal. I tried to print a return label that Amazon sent me a link to. It printed the same way. I called HP &amp; after connecting with my laptop &amp; trying many different settings unsuccessfully, they had me try to print from Chrome. The attached receipt in gmail &amp; the return label printed fine from Chrome. It also printed fine from my gmail in my Android phone &amp; my iPad, so the issue is only when in Firefox on my Windows 10 computer. My saved documents print fine. I just updated to the latest Firefox today, but the issue started when I got the HP printer &amp; tried to print while using Firefox 2 days ago.  </p><p>I saw instructions in here on checking the paper_data. It shows letter. I changed from ""fit to page width"" to Scale 100. I still have the same issue. There was one other instructions given to someone in Mozilla Support to click ""file"" &amp; then something else, but I have nothing on my page that says ""file"". I assume the person answering the question thought the person asking was trying to print a saved document, but that wasn't the case.  </p><p>I tried to attach screen prints, but my laptop is having issues &amp; isn't saving them for some odd reason, yet I can see them in the ""recents"" in Microsoft Word. I save them again, but the same thing. It isn't in the folder when I click ""browse"" on ""Add images"" below. </p><p>What else can I do? it's such a pain to have to go to Chrome every time I want to print something. Thanks </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,"",goldenspring
