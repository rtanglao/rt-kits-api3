That in itself is a problem, but it wouldn't be worth it to me to bother with visiting this forum and creating a post about it, if that was to be the only problem. You would only accidentally scroll down instead of out if your cursor was hovering over some part of the page or workspace that would otherwise give a null response to scrollwheel input, so it's not really too frustrating if you can just make a habit of being conscious of where your mouse is while scrolling. </p><p>The problem, as I hope you'll be able to see from my uploaded images, is the scrollbar, which overlaps the text from the dropdown menu on the right, in addition to causing half of the text at the bottom to be covered due to pushing the workspace's vertical toolbar further out than it's meant to be. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",CaddarkCrypto
