Closing Firefox results in a pause, then the error message reappearing. When I monitor in Task Manager, I see 2 Firefox processes. One closes when I click Close Firefox, then reappears before the error message reappears. If I close both processes before launching Firefox, two new processes appear with the error message. I can't open Firefox in troubleshooting mode. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, still can't launch. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1459780;,12pixelpete

Here's the script: </p> <ol><li>w:: </li></ol> <p>WinActivate ahk_exe C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe Return </p><p>It works great when I just switch from any window/app to Firefox. However, when I minimize Firefox, for example to show the desktop with Win+D, then I restore/activate Firefox with my Win+W hotkey, the Firefox window appears entirely black (even the chrome area) or 3/4 black. </p><p>By 3/4, I mean that if you divide the window in 4 quadrants, only the first (top left) quadrant is automatically redrawn. The remaining 3 are black. </p><p>Sometimes it takes a few seconds before it repaints itself, it's just very slow. Other times, I have to move the mouse over the ""chrome"" area. Moving the mouse over the content has no effect. Sometimes I press ALT or WIN key twice to make it repaint itself. </p><p>At first, I considered this bug a minor issue and thought it would get fixed soon, but after several months, maybe more than a year, I got tired of it. So, I begin by asking here. </p><p>To avoid wasting time, I'm not a novice user. I've used Firefox/Mozilla/Netscape for 20+ years. I've tried a new, clean profile without extensions or customization. I've got the latest NVIDIA driver. I've tried disabling HW acceleration. Several versions of Firefox are affected. Release and Developer Edition branches. Other apps/browsers are not. </p><p>This issue isn't with AutoHotkey since I've tried another hotkey tool with the same result. And I've already asked on their forum. </p><p>I believe this simply exposed a hidden bug in Firefox. Painting is not triggered in some cases. I really hope someone here can reproduce this. I'm not ready to file a bug on Bugzilla yet. </p><p>My OS is Windows 10 Pro x64, 21H1 (19043.1288), but of course I had an earlier version when the issue began. Same for Firefox, currently 94.0.1 but this problem isn't new. My HW is Intel i5/8GB/GeForce GTX 760. </p><p>The red rectangle in the screenshot has been added by me for privacy. The black color is really how it looks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",hixevi8659
