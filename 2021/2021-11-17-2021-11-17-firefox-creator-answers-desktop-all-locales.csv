So, I begin by asking here. </p><p>To avoid wasting time, I'm not a novice user. I've used Firefox/Mozilla/Netscape for 20+ years. I've tried a new, clean profile without extensions or customization.

Other apps/browsers are not. </p><p>This issue isn't with AutoHotkey since I've tried another hotkey tool with the same result.
