It is running Windows 10 which is new and unfamiliar to me. I am also using Firefox V85 as my default browser. In building my new bookmarks folder list I found the folder icons are coloured a nasty shade of grey. However, running Firefox on older operating systems (eg XP or Windows 8.1) the folders are a pleasing yellow colour. I have exhausted myself trawling the web, Youtube, and the Firefox help topics in trying to find a way to change the folder icon colour, but with no sucess. Please accept my apologies as I suspect that this question will have been asked before, but I cannot find any references to it. If anyone knows how to do this, please be aware that, whilst I am literate, I don't necessarily understand arcane computer terminology so I would welcome a simple key stroke by key stroke walk through.  If there is a fix, it needs to work in both the Toolbar and the Sidebar. Many Thanks Chris </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1389842;,stevens.chris1961

I've been using Firefox since the very early days of its existence and always loved it until now. (Still loving it but disappointed in one aspect!) I wanted to checked my network activity with this software ""TCPview"" and once I run Firefo, I realize that Firefox connects to Google / Amazon related Domains :( After a quick search on the net, I found out that the domains (<a href=""http://1e100.net"" rel=""nofollow"">1e100.net</a>) are actually Google! Once I log into my Firefox account, more Amazon and Google connections start. Down below are some of the connections that I see on TCPview: </p><p><a href=""http://sof02s32-in-f1.1e100.net"" rel=""nofollow"">sof02s32-in-f1.1e100.net</a> <a href=""http://sof02s32-in-f3.1e100.net"" rel=""nofollow"">sof02s32-in-f3.1e100.net</a> <a href=""http://sof02s32-in-f14.1e100.net"" rel=""nofollow"">sof02s32-in-f14.1e100.net</a>  </p><p><a href=""http://ec2-44-229-115-174.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ec2-44-229-115-174.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com</a> <a href=""http://33.64.98.34.bc.googleusercontent.com"" rel=""nofollow"">33.64.98.34.bc.googleusercontent.com</a> <a href=""http://82.221.107.34.bc.googleusercontent.com"" rel=""nofollow"">82.221.107.34.bc.googleusercontent.com</a> <a href=""http://ssllabs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ssllabs.com</a> </p><p><a href=""http://server-143-204-103-53.fra50.r.cloudfront.net"" rel=""nofollow"">server-143-204-103-53.fra50.r.cloudfront.net</a> <a href=""http://ghs-vip-any-c46.ghs.ssl.googlehosted.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ghs-vip-any-c46.ghs.ssl.googlehosted.com</a> </p><p>So how come Firefox, supposedly the most privacy conscious browser, uses Google for checking malware? I disabled safe browsing and is still connects to Google domains and I can not disable these connections on Firewall! I can't stand these companies (Amazon, FB, Google,etc) and trying to stay away from them as much as possible but my long time trusted browser is giving away my data to them! If you tell me this is aggregate / anonymous data, please don't make me laugh. We all know Google and Amazon are pure evil companies when it comes to privacy. (Google stealing people's wifi, sharing data with the Govt's, etc) Anyways, pretty frustrated as we can't trust no god damn service on the internet anymore.

It came with v2004 and HP updated trying to fix audio and missing microphone but this did not help.  I have found the problem only happens when using Firefox. Viewing a video is not necessary to recreate the problem. What happens is the audio will stop playing when Firefox is open, even if only reading text on a webpage while listing to a music file with Groove Music. Whether or not a music player is running does not make a difference, even the beep sound when hitting the Number Lock key stops working. The other odd thing I did not notice right away is that the built-in Microphone device often disappears. Only used it once so far for Zoom and happened to notice it was missing from the Sound settings after the audio stopped.  Restarting usually brings back the audio until Firefox is used again. Sometimes it works for 1 hr of a movie and stops. I found out that opening Groove and playing an mp3 usually gets the sound back but not the microphone. The first apps installed on the computer were Firefox, Thunderbird, Zoom and then Adobe CS 5.5 &amp; 6 and now Retrospect Backup. The first occurrence of the sound stopping was when only FF and TB were installed but we thought it was the website. Using Edge (which we don't prefer) the audio always works fine. </p><p>HP replaced the Realtek Audio drivers which did not fix the problem but lost the equalizer function and some of the bit depth and enhancement choices in the speaker settings.  I have attached screen shots of the Sound, Video and Game controller Realtek Audio properties and Audio Input and output Speaker driver properties from the device manager. </p><p>Note, I am not posting this from the problem computer because Firefox account kept rejecting my password even though the correct password was pasted in.
