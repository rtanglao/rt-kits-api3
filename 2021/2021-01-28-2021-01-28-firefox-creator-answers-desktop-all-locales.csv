The does not work in Firefox, minimize, maximize &amp; close remain. I'm assuming this is related to Firefox's ability to remove the title bar all together so tabs can be at the top. The Firefox Customize... page allows you to change just about everything else in the UI except these three buttons.  </p><p>Is there a way to remove Firefox's minimize, maximize and close buttons? </p><p>In case it matters I really only care about the Close button (not Close tab) because GNOME Tweaks lets you remove the minimize &amp; maximize buttons from all apps. </p><p>Thanks </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-840;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",zorkerz
