When trying to load Firefox an error message appears basically saying ""the application has failed to start because it's side-by-side configuration is incorrect"" . Whatever that means. It tells you to do a trace program from the command prompt but that didn't result in anything.  </p><p>At the same time we are noticing that the desktop short cut says "" Firefox -Copy-Copy-Copy-Copy -Copy""  May not be related.  </p><p>Any one seen this before?
