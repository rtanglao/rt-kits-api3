It was there for a few days in May 2021 and I could see April in the ""History"" profile right under the ""This Month"" folder -as it should be. But then before I could get back to reviewing my April history, it disappeared. I believe this may have happened because my Windows 7 had alerted me that I was running low on diskspace while downloading... I maxed out my diskspace without realizing it may have cleared my browsing history to free up storage... maybe,maybe not... </p><p>So, in a panic of course, I view forums that talk about pulling up my Mozilla profile. </p><p>I try typing:  %APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\ in Windows and only find a single JSON file that I am not able to make sense of in an online JSON viewer... </p><p>I also tried installing a Firefox add-on SQlite viewer but I am having trouble finding what forums are calling ""places.sqlite""... There is no SQ.LITE Manager under the Firefox 'Tools' tab... </p><p>I also tried to find the 'index.dat' file in a free online download of a dat viewer but i get this message: ""Your current security settings do not allow this file to be downloaded'  after droping the dat file into it... I will include a screenshot of this... </p><p>Picture 1: Dat viewer Picture 2: The only file appearing after %APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\      entry into windows....

I just need to view my entire month of April 2021 browsing history because Firefox crashed and did not restore my ""restore previous session"" a few weeks ago... I've never seen firefox erase browsing history so fast... </p><p>Please...please help.

Usually when I try to click / open / load a new tab or page, but sometimes just leaving it open causes a crash. I've tried to reinstall twice, but no luck. Safe Mode also did not help, so I assume it has nothing to do with add-ons. I also did a ""Refresh"" but, again, nothing. I did a full system scan (BitDefender, if it matters) but it did not detect any malware. Lastly, I restarted the computer and Firefox still constantly crashes.   </p><p>Here are the crash report logs:  </p><p>- bp-611b4c56-1e4d-4a1e-8b80-c648a0210517 -bp-48c4f0b9-8c93-4b5b-88bb-d3a100210517 -bp-49113762-959a-4788-8938-3670b0210517 -bp-b477e31a-35ac-4329-ba5c-d64120210517 - bp-42df11e0-7feb-4754-9d09-365980210517 - bp-f7a76c79-cade-4f76-9241-143590210517 - bp-208c4fa5-aabb-4455-a89d-a03c60210517 - bp-96d5b8c0-521e-4478-ba5d-755680210517 - bp-477a91fe-2409-4ae8-b263-8ff7c0210517 - bp-1c0ad77d-8945-4794-8e68-5aa370210517 - bp-58ca09c9-4bab-476d-8bcc-0485e0210517 - bp-cb70f76f-f68e-4933-a3af-294cc0210517 - bp-60d36a45-5feb-41e3-876f-420490210517 - bp-d359f5bd-d498-4935-bb66-e7f200210517 - bp-071e3332-79e9-4e5a-9eb3-a8b000210516 - bp-7bed91f6-fcb6-450e-87d3-106e10210516 </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",nirochocz
