It works, very well. The confirming email from firefox is sent from a random amazon address, which gets greylisted as intended. There's a 5 minute limit for entering the confirmation code, but greylisting slows delivery of the email to around 15 minutes, waiting for the amazon sending server to try multiple times.

Open in New Tab, save image as, copy link, copy link location.  Only rarely do I use the developer functions, so that over time I am accustomed to accessing the Developer Tools from the Tools tab on the main menu.  The fact that many of these tools that I do not use are now on the right-click menu are causing me to make errors. I subscribe to an online newspaper that is the first item I read in the day.  I go through the front page of the newspaper, I right click on articles I want to read in a new tab.  I am so used to doing this efficiently from older versions of Firefox in which the right-click menu always opened where I right-clicked and therefore at the ""open link in new tab"" selection.  Now, what happen is that I react by instinct and find myself clicking the middle of the menu and not the top.  This results in errors that waste my time and cost me time and frustration. </p><p>Having read a few other problems that other people have had with updates of Firefox,  I have to add my voice here.  I realize that there are legitimate reasons to change some things - but these things are technical and deal with internet security - not style.  It seems to me that constantly moving things around (like menu bars and the like) interrupts a user's accustomed work flows and therefore not a benefit. </p><p>It seems to me that there are two possible solutions:  One is to make every aspect of user preferences editable by the user.  For me, that means the main menu bar is on the top, followed by the tabs, and the right-click or context menus are editable by the user.  The other solution is to create two Firefox browsers - one for the traditionalist (I'm 82) and a new browser called ""Firefox Superuser"". </p><p>For now, I'd just appreciate it if someone could tell me how I can get the stuff I don't use off the right-click menu.  </p><p>I apologize for my grumpiness, I realize you're all volunteers.  But, first thing in the morning, having to try to remember that the right click menu might not be opening with ""open link in new tab"" right next to my cursor is more than I can manage.  I automatically click and at least 80% of the time, I'm clicking the wrong thing. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",bdjim

I was using an Android smartphone prior to that and had some bookmarks on it I wanted to transfer to the desktop. I mistakenly thought it would simply 'absorb' those Android bookmarks into the bookmark collection I already had on this new desktop, but after using sync, it straight up removed the desktop bookmarks that were there and replaced them with the android ones exclusively. Another neat little 'feature' is how the bookmarks were also completely erased from the Android device after this.  </p><p>So once that happened, I restored my old desktop bookmarks, but then the bookmarks that were imported from the Sync from the android were now gone. My question is this: are those sync'd android bookmarks actually anywhere at all, like did Firefox automatically archive them somewhere just in case, or are they just lost completely?

But then before I could get back to reviewing my April history, it disappeared. I believe this may have happened because my Windows 7 had alerted me that I was running low on diskspace while downloading... I maxed out my diskspace without realizing it may have cleared my browsing history to free up storage... maybe,maybe not... </p><p>So, in a panic of course, I view forums that talk about pulling up my Mozilla profile. </p><p>I try typing:  %APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\ in Windows and only find a single JSON file that I am not able to make sense of in an online JSON viewer... </p><p>I also tried installing a Firefox add-on SQlite viewer but I am having trouble finding what forums are calling ""places.sqlite""... There is no SQ.LITE Manager under the Firefox 'Tools' tab... </p><p>I also tried to find the 'index.dat' file in a free online download of a dat viewer but i get this message: ""Your current security settings do not allow this file to be downloaded'  after droping the dat file into it... I will include a screenshot of this... </p><p>Picture 1: Dat viewer Picture 2: The only file appearing after %APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\      entry into windows.... Picture 3: SQ.lite viewer.... Picture 4: JSON Viewer...before i drop JSON file Picture 5: JSON Viewer...after drop JSON file </p><p>Check mate. I don't know what else to do. I just need to view my entire month of April 2021 browsing history because Firefox crashed and did not restore my ""restore previous session"" a few weeks ago... I've never seen firefox erase browsing history so fast... </p><p>Please...please help. God bless.  </p><p>my e-mail is bergerdani@gmail.com </p>",windows-7;desktop;tabs;firefox-880;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1413294;,bergerdani

Usually when I try to click / open / load a new tab or page, but sometimes just leaving it open causes a crash. I've tried to reinstall twice, but no luck. Safe Mode also did not help, so I assume it has nothing to do with add-ons. I also did a ""Refresh"" but, again, nothing. I did a full system scan (BitDefender, if it matters) but it did not detect any malware. Lastly, I restarted the computer and Firefox still constantly crashes.   </p><p>Here are the crash report logs:  </p><p>- bp-611b4c56-1e4d-4a1e-8b80-c648a0210517 -bp-48c4f0b9-8c93-4b5b-88bb-d3a100210517 -bp-49113762-959a-4788-8938-3670b0210517 -bp-b477e31a-35ac-4329-ba5c-d64120210517 - bp-42df11e0-7feb-4754-9d09-365980210517 - bp-f7a76c79-cade-4f76-9241-143590210517 - bp-208c4fa5-aabb-4455-a89d-a03c60210517 - bp-96d5b8c0-521e-4478-ba5d-755680210517 - bp-477a91fe-2409-4ae8-b263-8ff7c0210517 - bp-1c0ad77d-8945-4794-8e68-5aa370210517 - bp-58ca09c9-4bab-476d-8bcc-0485e0210517 - bp-cb70f76f-f68e-4933-a3af-294cc0210517 - bp-60d36a45-5feb-41e3-876f-420490210517 - bp-d359f5bd-d498-4935-bb66-e7f200210517 - bp-071e3332-79e9-4e5a-9eb3-a8b000210516 - bp-7bed91f6-fcb6-450e-87d3-106e10210516 </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1413323;1413324;,nirochocz
