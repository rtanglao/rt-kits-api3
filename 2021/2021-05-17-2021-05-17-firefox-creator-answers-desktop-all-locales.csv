1336346,2021-05-16 17:54:22 -0700,2021-05-16 17:57:15 -0700,Firefox still constantly crashes,"<p>I posted this question before, and it got escalated, but there wasn't a resolution or fix suggested. I am hoping with more crash reports I can get some help finding a solution! Firefox is now crashing routinely - as in, many times each day. I am at my wits end! It's not profile-related as I sync my browser profiles and have no issues on my other computer. I did a clean install, and the crash frequently slowed for a while, but now I'm back to tearing my hair out. Please help! </p><p>Here are the recent crash reports: bp-fdc51734-9975-4a67-a33f-348cb0210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-b39dd934-e7ae-4f8b-80f7-1123d0210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-cdead43d-7977-4425-95b7-e589d0210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-7a93ee79-f638-4e30-b3bf-f66d90210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-c16b3c85-3a20-4923-8ae7-4b72b0210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-765b10f5-9988-4955-804f-175a90210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-db61262c-686c-4a74-b141-4d4740210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-3e3e63df-bb83-40f2-9058-b3b9c0210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-d917cb17-4011-485f-974f-303880210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-7831bfb3-dd19-43fb-b222-57c8b0210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-653aee9f-1e77-4150-be7e-26a940210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-8a89c943-4384-4b36-b30e-5f3d80210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-c0a188b3-66e6-4530-8193-433840210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-afca439c-82b6-446e-bb53-9b52f0210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-a0f8dc37-5685-4b98-901d-dd2850210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-9d78a008-f795-4447-b5a0-49f270210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-67a74ec3-cf4e-4e4c-9378-a06060210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-efb8faac-8570-4aaf-8e8a-1494c0210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-03e450d7-37a2-469c-b71d-ef8ed0210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-4d2a1325-5742-47e0-8d65-2ca220210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-667d292b-3d39-48c4-824d-54de60210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-c716da51-24d7-48f4-8b2e-c1fbd0210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-94f1c241-8f4f-4cfd-95e9-cf76d0210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-9dd81788-bd24-4295-854c-487270210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-5ca07018-55c1-48df-9936-d13dc0210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View bp-c00e9ba3-9fb3-46e0-873b-a2d150210517 	5/16/21, 6:48 PM 	 View </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1413261;,alifreeman93
