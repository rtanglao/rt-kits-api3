More than a month ago, I realised that my firefox nightly version is few months old. It couldn't update itself, everytime I tried to use update function, after restarting browser it didn't udpate and it didn't even restart, just close itself. So I downloaded latest version from mozilla site to update. But now I remembered that moment and checked what version I have. Guess what, it's that version I downloaded back then. And I can't update it still. I don't know what the error is, but I know what it's connected to it. Every time I open firefox I have to open it double. First opening does literally nothing, and I have to open it 2nd time to open it. </p>",desktop;beta;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",Qbsoon

However, I'd like it not to be opened if the ""tab"" itself is closed, because closing a tab (not a window) meanings I don't want to see it; and if the ""window"" is closed, then I may need it for the next time - I just want to put it aside for now.  </p><p>My question is, can I achieve this on firefox, namely, when I close the last tab of a window and open a new window, I won't see that tab; also, when I directly close the entire window, I'll be able to see it next time. In fact, this is the default behavior of the Chromium Edge which I think we can take. </p><p>What I don't like now is that the last tab is always there - when I close the tab and the browser, and reopen it, it's still there, as if it sticks here; I have to open a new tab + close the ""last"" tab + close the browser to get rid of it, and that's annoying. </p><p>My current work around is to set in about:config to force open a new tab after the last tab is closed; the trouble is that it makes closing the browser a bit difficult. </p><p>Thanks in advance, for looking at this support / feature request.
