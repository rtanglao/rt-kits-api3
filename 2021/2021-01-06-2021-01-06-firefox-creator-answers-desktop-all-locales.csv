However, I'd like it not to be opened if the ""tab"" itself is closed, because closing a tab (not a window) meanings I don't want to see it; and if the ""window"" is closed, then I may need it for the next time - I just want to put it aside for now.  </p><p>My question is, can I achieve this on firefox, namely, when I close the last tab of a window and open a new window, I won't see that tab; also, when I directly close the entire window, I'll be able to see it next time. In fact, this is the default behavior of the Chromium Edge which I think we can take. </p><p>What I don't like now is that the last tab is always there - when I close the tab and the browser, and reopen it, it's still there, as if it sticks here; I have to open a new tab + close the ""last"" tab + close the browser to get rid of it, and that's annoying. </p><p>My current work around is to set in about:config to force open a new tab after the last tab is closed; the trouble is that it makes closing the browser a bit difficult. </p><p>Thanks in advance, for looking at this support / feature request.
