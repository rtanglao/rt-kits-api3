I can't even get to gmail. When I type '<a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a>' in the brower, firefox does nothing. Even if I try a serach of 'gmail sign in' that will come up, but the link won't work? </p><p>2. Also, like, twitter won't work. Facebook I can get to my page but can click on anything, except if I try to message someone, it takes me to a blank page? </p><p>My Chrome browser is working, and my TOR browser as well. </p><p>Firefox is my prefered browser. What's going on? What should I do? </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p><p>John </p>",mac-os;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-840;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",yohejohn

This is why im backing up information before doing a factory reset. One of the things i need to back up are my logins, but every time i try to export them firefox crashes. Are there any other alternatives for backing up my logins? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",w1l14mt0rr4lb4
