I have installed a program called ESET which provides additional security when doing online banking.  I have changed my password recently for one bank.  I have deleted the old password and logon from under the Settings tab, Privacy &amp; Security, and have created a new setting with the new password.  However, when I attempt to log on to that bank's website, ESET opens a new Firefox browser window and uses the old password. Even when I try to edit that under Settings in the new browser window, it isn't saved.  ESET says it is a Firefox problem.  Any suggestions how to fix this? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,websites,en-US,1432951;,jswartz1

What I experience now is that I can login and use it just fine, i.e. access any of its links, except if I try to use the Virtual Credit Card (VCC) feature.  To use that feature you login, select VCC, which takes you to a new page, on which you launch a popup that generates the VC.  My issue is that I login, select he VCC page, but instead it takes me back to the main screen to login again.  This circular problem can continue as many times as I try it.  Below I list my equipment and trouble shooting steps. </p><p>I am using a win10 PC running 21H1 and the current version of FFox.  I have a Malwarebytes Browser Guard installed (MB). </p><p>1.  I tried the login on my Surface GO running win10 Home Edition and no MB installed.  It worked fine. 2.  I tried to login with Chrome and Edge on my PC, neither with the MB browser guard, and they work fine. 3.  I have had the MB installed for quite some time and the Citi site always worked fine.  Nevertheless I disabled it.  That made no difference. 4.  Next I clicked the FFox shield and disabled the Enhance Tracking protection.  No difference. 5.  I deleted all cookies and cache info related to citi, amounting to 10 entries.  That made no difference. 6.  I deleted all cookies and cache totally.  Now I was able to log in and go to the VCC page.   7.  I closed out of the citi site and tried to re login.  The problem reappeared. 8.  I deleted all cookies and cache yet again, closed FFox, launched it again, tried the Citi site and it worked fine. 9.  I logged out of citi, tried to log in again, and once more it did not work. </p><p>Any ideas? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-900;firefox-9002;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",eberger5
