Once 91+ came out it wasn't even a question of fixing the floating tabs and condensing the height and menu spacing (though I tried all of it) but my own codes stopped working properly - I had code to set the background colour of menus/bookmark menus and when I upgrade they were the right colour but with thick white borders around them. This was more important to me than the floating tabs and I immediately downgraded to 90 where I've stayed. Can anyone help me figure out how to get MY codes to work with 91+ and/or to work together with the other fixes out there (tabs, condensed menus etc)??  </p><p>Below is how my userchrome looks and attached is how my current set up looks.
