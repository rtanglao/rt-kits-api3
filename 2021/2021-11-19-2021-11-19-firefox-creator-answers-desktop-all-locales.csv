Firefox suddenly refuse to recognize my YubiKey.  It keep saying it is not familiar with the key.  However, the key does work with Facebook and one of my Google account.  At this point, I still can use other 2FA method to get in for mail/calendar function only. If any of one encountered something similar, would you please kindly advise.  Thanks, Howard p.s.
