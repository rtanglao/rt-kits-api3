Ever since most recent update, any and all Google related websites will randomly fail to load UNLESS I use a private browsing window. As in you type <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> one minute and it loads, but 15 minutes later it does not â€” the little ""loading the page"" dot in the tab bounces back and forth forever, and you don't even get an error message. Ditto for any embedded search engines or map viewers and Google Docs.  </p><p>I have completely nuked the cache and the problem has persisted. I am not signed into a firefox account to do any syncing. I would reinstall firefox, but I work at a company that has all the computers so locked down that installing anything is impossible. Google Chrome works fine. I use Firefox at home with the same OS and it works fine.  </p><p>Suggestions? Using private browsing mode for everything is getting really annoying. </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;firefox-940;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",kevinyma

Firefox suddenly refuse to recognize my YubiKey.  It keep saying it is not familiar with the key.  However, the key does work with Facebook and one of my Google account.  At this point, I still can use other 2FA method to get in for mail/calendar function only. If any of one encountered something similar, would you please kindly advise.  Thanks, Howard p.s. I attached a snip shot with this message as well </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",hhc1218
