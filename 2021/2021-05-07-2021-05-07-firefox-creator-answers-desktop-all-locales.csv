This is a mess!!!! After this erupted updates, everything was gone, seemed like Firefox has created new profile (afresh) for those ""2"" firefox. </p><p>I was digging on this forum, none was helping. So... 1. There was NO ""old firefox"" folder on desktop. 2. Tons of articles about ""about:profiles"" but not sure how it worked as it did not work for me, I was trying to look in ""both"" Firefox  and click ""Launch profile in new browser"" rather than go to my ""old profile"", it seemed to create ""default-esr-1...2...3 etc"" as in Pic 3 &amp; 4. </p><p>I am not very techie, pls someone could give some advice how to solve this a step by step would be wonderful. </p><p>Although I love using Firefox, this is sooo stressful &amp; I'm pulling my hair out! </p><p>PS. Chrome on the other hand, had no issues with this at all, after the win10 update, Chrome just simple retained everything &amp; let me restore all of session I was working on before, nothing lost from fav &amp; apps either. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,1411200;,LondonBabe
