I come from Opera and I didn't have any problem doing this, I just log-in in the desired order in Gmail, and then I log-in in Youtube with the account that I want. But in Firefox it links my gmail with my youtube, so if I log-out my /u/0 in youtube, it also logs out from Gmail. So when I put the /u/1 on first place in youtube it alter the order in my Gmail and /u/1 becames the main one. </p><p>How can I set it up correctly in Firefox? it is not a Gmail/Youtube problem, but a Firefox problem, since I can do it as I want in other browsers. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",fuarrkk

The error message said 'Cookies must be enabled' and I couldn't get further. Cookies *were* enabled! I shut down Firefox, and re-opened, and all was then OK. </p><p>. Web pages with scripts are often completely blank. . Pop-ups are often blank.  If not they often don't work, like (critically) Ebay login. . View source (CMD U) works for new pages.  However doesn't update if the source page changes. </p><pre> I do use &lt;CMD U&gt; from the changed front page. </pre> <p>A silly one is that the keypress to 'Copy Link' was deviously 'A', but not shown.  It has now changed to 'L' and still not shown.  Why? I very much prefer Firefox, and all the many shortcuts are memorised (well bar 'L' (8-)# ) </p><p>However I so often now have to use Safari or Chrome to get around the bugs. This is a pain as the interfaces are different, and specifically 'View Source' never has a shortcut key. They also have their own bugs! </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",tonyfirshman

When I use a mouse or a pen it doesn't close. </p><p>There are some workarounds like open the addon in new windows or opening the virtual keyboard from the tray. But it has worked very well for a long time. Also in other chromium based browser it works still. </p><p>I contacted the Bitwarden Support and they could reproduce the problem, but are not able to fix it, because it has something to do with the particular environment for the add-ons in Firefox. </p><p>Is there something in the settings, which coud fix the problem or is it possible that it will be fixed in another update? </p><p>Best regards, </p><p>Sascha </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",sascha6
