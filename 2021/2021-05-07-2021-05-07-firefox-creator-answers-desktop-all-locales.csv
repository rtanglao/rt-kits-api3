I was able to restart my PC but when I try to open Firefox I get an error message to stay that the ""application had a problem and crashed.  Unfortunately the crash reporter is unable to submit a report for this crash."" I have restarted my PC twice but still cannot get Firefox to open.  I have Firefox 88 - but unsure if there has been a recent update to this.  Firefox is set to automatically update.  I am now using Chrome to do this.  Can anyone tell me what may have caused this? Do I need to uninstall Firefox and Reinstall it? What is the correct way to reinstall it under my same account? I would appreciate some help.   Thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Roann

My organization forced us to auto-update win10 &amp; it seemed they install ""another"" firefox than the one I normally used (Pic 2 - Firefox Quantum) &amp; it seemed my firefox I normally used also was updated with this [Pic 1 - 78.10.1esr (64-bit)]. This is a mess!!!! After this erupted updates, everything was gone, seemed like Firefox has created new profile (afresh) for those ""2"" firefox. </p><p>I was digging on this forum, none was helping. So... 1. There was NO ""old firefox"" folder on desktop. 2. Tons of articles about ""about:profiles"" but not sure how it worked as it did not work for me, I was trying to look in ""both"" Firefox  and click ""Launch profile in new browser"" rather than go to my ""old profile"", it seemed to create ""default-esr-1...2...3 etc"" as in Pic 3 &amp; 4. </p><p>I am not very techie, pls someone could give some advice how to solve this a step by step would be wonderful. </p><p>Although I love using Firefox, this is sooo stressful &amp; I'm pulling my hair out! </p><p>PS. Chrome on the other hand, had no issues with this at all, after the win10 update, Chrome just simple retained everything &amp; let me restore all of session I was working on before, nothing lost from fav &amp; apps either. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",LondonBabe
