I tried all the fixes suggested by Mozilla to get rid of the problem, to no avail. Firefox is up to date, refreshed, reinstalled, without add ons or plugins, running in safe mode, you name it... The problem keeps coming back. </p><p>I have been using Firefox for years and random crazy Firefox CPU peaks have been an issue on my MacBook Pro, causing the fan to go in overdrive and the laptop to overheat. Already that was incomprehensible as I would only be browsing the web when that would happen ( it wasn't like I was uploading or downloading or streaming big files). </p><p>Now the same Firefox CPU overload is happening on my new Mac mini. Whenever my daughter tries to do her homework she calls me over and points at the ""wheel of death"".  Surprise, surprise, Firefox is unresponsive.  I check the Activity Monitor and there you have it again: Firefox at 320% CPU capacity, the computer sounding like a propeller plane ready to take off, we have to force quit, daughter looses some of her work etc.. It drives everyone insane. </p><p>Looking into what sites or apps my daughter uses for homework might give an indication as to where the problem lies?? She tells she has the following tabs opened: Gmail, Google Docs, Google Slides, and Google Classroom. Is there a compatibility issue between Firefox and Google? </p><p>For the time being, I had no choice but to uninstall Firefox and revert to using Safari as our default browser. We like Firefox but using it has become too much of a hindrance. Are the developers planning to resolve the issue any time soon? </p><p>Thank you for your replies, much appreciated. </p><p>Lance Q </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",elgee1
