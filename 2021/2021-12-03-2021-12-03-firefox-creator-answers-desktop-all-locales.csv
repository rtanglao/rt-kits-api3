I need to change them back to the REGULAR adobe pdf files.  I have followed several instructions on here but they have NOT restored my files to the original .pdf","<p>There are several requests similar to mine, mostly about Windows 7 (i have windows 10).  I made sure the ""general settings"" within Adobe were set to use Acrobat as default, and i set firefox options (as near as i could tell) to save my pdf's with Adobe acrobat also.  However, ALL my files - both already saved and new pdf's - now are listed as filetype ""Firefox HTML.pdf""  and all have the html icon.  For my husband's business, we have to fill out state forms in pdf and forward copies to them and to clients.  My clients are frustrated and confused that they cannot recognize the pdf's i sent by the original icons, and some don't seem to understand how to open the ""html"" files i send them  (most of our clients probably use other browsers: when they showed up as straight adobe files this was never a problem)  I need to fix BOTH my stored pdf forms AND new fillable forms from the state as filename.pdf with the adobe icon.
