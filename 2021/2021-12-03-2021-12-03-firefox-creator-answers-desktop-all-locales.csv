It no longer appears under""bookmarks"" on the menu bar. I was able to get it onto the toolbar. (star in tray).

But on the menu bar, on the dropdown menu under ""bookmarks"", no ""bookmarks menu"". </p><p>I can live with this BUT I really don't want to BECAUSE there are bizillion bookmarks in the bookmarks menu. I need to send them someplace (or gather them into a NEW folder, so that I can add newly created bookmarks and be all neat and organized. </p><p>How do I put the ""bookmarks menu"" that shows on the sidebar back under ""bookmarks"" ??? How do I get the bizillion bookmarks off of ""bookmarks menu""? Is there a ""select all"", then ""delete""? I don't want to lose the ones in the html folder on the desktop.
