The majority of those offices does not have IT staff/knowledge, and infrastructure is often sketchy. We use mostly Windows, but have some offices with Linux. We currently use local users, and after an initial configuration of e.g. Firefox/Thunderbird, we don't have any way to intervene automatically.  </p><p>So we are looking for an efficient way to control software configurations after deployment without the need for manual intervention. The scope would initially not be a lot, mostly installing/uninstalling addons. E.g. if a malicious addon is found, we want to have a way to uninstall it on all devices. Right now, we have to ask all staff to do this, and evidently this doesn't work out all the time.  </p><p>Firefox and Thunderbird are 2 key programs installed on all devices, although evidently we use other software as well. I think that with TB78 the policies.json implementation might not be yet finished completely, but for now, Firefox would be more critical (also some staff tend to install addons we do not want on the device). </p><p>As far as I know, when it comes ways how to centrally manage Firefox/Thunderbird without a domain controller/GPO, there are some options: </p><p>1) Azure AD: Identity management, and maybe also ways to configure Thunderbird/Firefox (although Azure AD does not seem to have GPO, but maybe scripts could be executed at the endpoint?). Won't work for Linux I guess. Also Azure could be based in a US datacenter, and as an European NGO we have much less data protection for US-based data. </p><p>2) third party management tool (e.g. like Teamviewer remote management, or chocolately) which allows remote execution of scripts. We could update the policies.json file in the firefox profile via a chocolately/Teamviewer script to uninstall/install addons, etc. Not sure if chocolately works on Linux. </p><p>3) GPOs with Domain Controller after all via a pre-auth VPN. Won't work for Linux I guess, but maybe script to deploy policies.json. Also there would be yet another thing to potentially fail (VPN connection), and we would need 2 different deployment methods (GPO for Windows, scripts for Linux). </p><p>4) write an Firefox/Thunderbird addon which simply downloads a policies.json file from a central location, and places it in the users FF/TB profile folder. upon restart of FF/TB it should deploy the changes based on the new policies.json file. A bit cumbersome, and doesn't cover other software. </p><p>5) a simple bat/sh script which is executed upon start. </p><p>To me, it seems a third party tool (teamviewer, chocolately) seems the best option, as it could cover FF/TB, but also other software which is installed. </p><p>Before we proceed I would like to know of experiences, and best practices: could anybody provide some information how this was achieved? </p><p>kind regards, </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",it132

Nothing happens in Firefox windows until the Scaling Factor reaches 1.25 (125%) and then it jumps to render larger fonts everywhere. (next jump at 1.4) See the screenshots for the difference. What is this threshold? What is the actual parameter Firefox reacts to? Can I control it manually within Firefox?  </p><p>This question has a rather convoluted background: I have replaced my 2560x1600 monitor with the 3840x1600 monitor and suddenly all Firefox windows render super ugly. It's not that they just look smaller due to to the smaller PPI but rather their font shape causes my eyes to tear. Previously the sensation was very soft. I do not know what that is but it seems it's not just the size. Could it be Firefox is using some information from the monitor that brings it to a sub-optimal font rendering/hinting/antialiasing behavior? </p><p>Increasing (Font) Scaling Factor to 1.25 via ""Ubuntu (Gnome) Tweaks"" app makes the fonts look acceptable again. Ubuntu Scaling Factor obviously also changes the size of other windows and their fonts. So I would rather keep the Scaling at 100% and just make sure the fonts are rendered in Firefox as before with the old monitor. I.e. I would like to remove this quality regression.  The fonts can be controlled via Firefox properties but as expected this either increases all font sizes or doesn't work for proprietary fonts supplied by web pages (min font size). There should be a better solution than tweaking each font individually.   The fact that the fonts are suddenly rendered acceptably again after the Scaling Factor reaches 1.25 makes me think that there may be some threshold in Firefox that makes it use different rendering scheme, mechanism or such. After 1.25 nothing happens until Scaling Factor reaches 1.4, then the font increases again. So can I just make Firefox render fonts as when scaling is at 1.25 but with the actual scaling factor at 1.0? </p><p>Apart from the overall size/resolution the monitors (old Samsung 305T vs. new Dell u3821dw) have different pixel pitch 0.2505 mm, PPI 101 (old) vs. 0.22908 and PPI 110,87 (new). Can this this be the root cause of the ugly fonts? So is there maybe a different parameter or setting to tell Firefox to render fonts regardless the higher PPI or lower pixel pitch? </p><p>I would expect everything to look just a bit smaller due to a smaller pixel pitch, but instead the fonts are rendered completely different and I can't find the setting that would fix that.  </p><p>Just FYI I have been playing with these settings: Firefox: - Default Zoom 120% - Check Zoom Text Only - Minimal font size - layout.css.devPixelsPerPx 1 - gfx.font_rendering.cleartype_params.force_gdi_classic_max_size 100 Ubuntu: - Scaling Factor - System Fonts </p><p>I'm on Ubuntu 18.04 using Firefox 89.0 Ubuntu canonical-1.0 . </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",mozilla242

Refreshing doesn't fix it, and I have to copy/paste the URL into a new container tab. This only happens when opening from a shortcut, not from history search or typing the URL. It seems to be happening across all containers I have. I'm using Windows 10 and the latest Firefox. Any help appreciated! </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",tomas.acton1
