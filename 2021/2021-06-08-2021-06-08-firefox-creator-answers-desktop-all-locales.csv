The tabs are ugly and blocky and too big and everything is spaced weirdly. The right-click menu is far bigger than it needs to be. This is all new as of the latest update.  It appears Mozilla did one of those ""changing something for the sake of changing it"" updates which I detest. </p><p>Is there any way to revert to the previous update, when everything was normal? I tried searching through settings but couldn't find anything. Nor could I find an add-on to fix it. This is quite frustrating as I liked the compactness of Firefox but they broke all of that and made it ugly in the process. </p><p>Thank you for any help! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",Lightningtow

It's not that they just look smaller due to to the smaller PPI but rather their font shape causes my eyes to tear. Previously the sensation was very soft. I do not know what that is but it seems it's not just the size. Could it be Firefox is using some information from the monitor that brings it to a sub-optimal font rendering/hinting/antialiasing behavior? </p><p>Increasing (Font) Scaling Factor to 1.25 via ""Ubuntu (Gnome) Tweaks"" app makes the fonts look acceptable again. Ubuntu Scaling Factor obviously also changes the size of other windows and their fonts. So I would rather keep the Scaling at 100% and just make sure the fonts are rendered in Firefox as before with the old monitor. I.e. I would like to remove this quality regression.  The fonts can be controlled via Firefox properties but as expected this either increases all font sizes or doesn't work for proprietary fonts supplied by web pages (min font size). There should be a better solution than tweaking each font individually.   The fact that the fonts are suddenly rendered acceptably again after the Scaling Factor reaches 1.25 makes me think that there may be some threshold in Firefox that makes it use different rendering scheme, mechanism or such. After 1.25 nothing happens until Scaling Factor reaches 1.4, then the font increases again. So can I just make Firefox render fonts as when scaling is at 1.25 but with the actual scaling factor at 1.0? </p><p>Apart from the overall size/resolution the monitors (old Samsung 305T vs. new Dell u3821dw) have different pixel pitch 0.2505 mm, PPI 101 (old) vs. 0.22908 and PPI 110,87 (new). Can this this be the root cause of the ugly fonts? So is there maybe a different parameter or setting to tell Firefox to render fonts regardless the higher PPI or lower pixel pitch? </p><p>I would expect everything to look just a bit smaller due to a smaller pixel pitch, but instead the fonts are rendered completely different and I can't find the setting that would fix that.  </p><p>Just FYI I have been playing with these settings: Firefox: - Default Zoom 120% - Check Zoom Text Only - Minimal font size - layout.css.devPixelsPerPx 1 - gfx.font_rendering.cleartype_params.force_gdi_classic_max_size 100 Ubuntu: - Scaling Factor - System Fonts </p><p>I'm on Ubuntu 18.04 using Firefox 89.0 Ubuntu canonical-1.0 . </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",mozilla242
