Why do I have to contend with the dreadful date format when when visiting mozilla.org in english?,"<p>Hi! </p><p>Since most content is in English and search engines always link to the English version, I usually browse the english version of mozilla pages. But here on support in particular I have to contend with the pathetic date format where you can't tell which is day or month or year. So why can't I find a way to set the date format. Even the majority of tiny websites/forums have an option to specify the date format. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",avada

I have to go into the about:config panel and search for the ""Marionette"" options. If I toggle the two settings that are true/false and restart, the remote control goes away. I did not install this feature, I have no idea how to use it, I don't need it, and I'm tired of having to do this every time I open Firefox. It's ridiculously annoying to the point that I'm ready to start using another browser. The internet has NO practical help on how to fix this for anyone who is not an expert in computer code. I need a permanent fix for this pesky and annoying bug. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",msand1126
