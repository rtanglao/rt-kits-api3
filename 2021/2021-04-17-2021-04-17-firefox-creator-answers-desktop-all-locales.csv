I can't log in now.","<p>Recently, a kind volunteer helped me resolve a technical problem I was having with eBay.  I have only one start up on my computer now, which is my VPN I have disabled all my Add-ons. I exited out of Firefox, restarted my computer and went directly to ebay and had no trouble signing in or using the site. Yay!  I thought it was all fixed. I still wanted to use some very important (to me) add-ons like Ghosterly, and a couple others, which I have had for approximately a year with no problem on ebay. I enable 3 of my favorite addons.  I went back to ebay.  And, now I can't sign in.  They say the password doesn't match. I know that it is correct because I have it written down. When I tried many times, they kept making be ""bot verify"" When I tried to reset my password, they said I had to chat with someone.  I am unable to chat because they say I might have disabled java script.  I don't know where to look to see it I have done that.   Having a ""Senior Moment"" here............ </p><p>....also starting to get frustrated...........   grrrrrrr..... I wanted to try to turn on one addon at a time, to see which might be the troublemaker, but never got the chance. </p><p>Any thoughts?? </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-870;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1406648;,mangonanny

I've been working on cleaning up my bookmarks - they sure do accumulate. </p><p>My question is this: When I have made changes to bookmarks on one of my two PCs (one desktop and one laptop), how do I prevent the changes from being eliminated (changed back to as they were) on the device on which I made them, i.e. which computer to I sign in to first in order for the sync to have the changes take place on the second device rather than reversing the changes.  </p><p>I'm sure the answer is simple and I could spend the time experimenting, but I'm more than confident someone out there can help be out easily, Please? </p><p>Something else that I really like. I have Apple for Windows 10 downloaded to my desktop. Any changes I make to my bookmarks on my PCs, get changed on my iPhone in Safari.

1333016,2021-04-17 10:12:31 -0700,2021-04-17 10:12:31 -0700,Firefox Design. Continously and automatically backing up Sessions to an additional file and folder of my choice,"<p>A problem I'm not sure Firefox has addressed or resolved in all the years I've been using Firefox - even after it changed its programming, and the way it saves session (or even bookmark) backups to the profile folder, is: whenever Firefox is forced to shut down after a computer software issue (like freezing, blue screen, extreme sluggishness, etc.), and we presume (with fingers crossed) that Firefox will open back up with all our tabs intact for the past 7 - 20 days, but instead opens with them all missing and forever gone - even after immediately and instinctively proceeding to the profile folder (before shutting down Firefox) to recover them using Mozilla's recovery steps to replace the ""places.sqlite"" file, I periodically find that every single one of the recovery files has been re-stamped with the same date and time (and missing data) as the new places.sqlite file. </p><p>So I hope and pray, that because this issue happens to thousands of Firefox users over time - no matter what Firefox version update their using (because it has happened in several versions for me), that a terrific way to prevent forcing users to find and use a great sessions manager addon that saves tabs (with all their history - that won't also crash or easily be written over), or forcing users to constantly worry and remind themselves to manually backup the required profile files daily, or having to remember minimally, to backup the profile files ""before"" opening Firefox after a crash, (which seldom happens), that Firefox offers its users the option to set Firefox up to continuously and automatically save a complete new (additional) set of backup files to a different folder of the user's choosing, with the extra option to save a ""set"" number of session backups, where Firefox can't access them upon opening. Imagine how much anguish, anger and self loathing Firefox will eliminate in the world with this one simple option. </p><p>Here's another wish-list item. If Firefox could present the list of open Firefox windows that appear at the top right of the screen whenever hovering the mouse over the Firefox icon in the taskbar, I wish for the popup list to permanently nudge down so it ""never"" covers up my open tabs in each of the open window's (which is how I know I determin which of the numerous windows to navigate). And of course the list should self adjust whenever I turn the ""Menu Bar"" on or off. Thank you, in advance, for considering these two important items toward the Firefox experience. </p><p>If you're wondering why I haven't moved on to the latest version. It's because I all too ""often"" encounter my valuable ""business"" addons no longer working, and the miserable task of trying to go back to the previous version, or trying to find new addons that work half as good. Sometimes all of my addons disappear. I also wish I could turn off Firefox's constant reminder, to upgrade since I've asked twice before, with no Mozilla reply. Thank you again. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",cvmenn

It is my first time here. </p><p>recently, after using the same browser and same site, under the same log in for over 15 years, the pages freeze and I can't do any thing but wait until the error message pops up saying that ""a webpage is slowing down your browser, do you want to:  ""Stop it"" or ""Wait"" I click stop it and then wait a few seconds and I can see the screen glitch and then I can click on something and it will finally work.  But, when I try to click on something else the same thing happens over and over again. I have discussed this with the chat agents, but they were no help. Someone from ebay called me after I asked them to and I explained the problem, and that I had cleared my browser cache, cookies, browsing history and it still gives the same error message and still freezes.   I do NOT have this problem on any other website or platform. The ebay agent on the phone suggested that I try a different browser as he had no way to diagnose my problem.  I asked ""If the problem doesn't happen on any other site, how would it be caused by my browser?"" He said, he was merely suggesting that as a process of elimination. I started to download another browser today, as this has been going on for far too long,  probably two weeks now. Thank you for any suggestions you might have.

I have seen it on both the Home Depot (see attachment) and Lowes websites, and my wife saw it on her laptop with <a href=""http://Weather.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Weather.com</a>. Both systems are Win 10 latest and Firefox 87.0.  In the attaached image, clicking on either the small orange circle or pressing enter fails to work. Similar issue with Lowes and Weather.
