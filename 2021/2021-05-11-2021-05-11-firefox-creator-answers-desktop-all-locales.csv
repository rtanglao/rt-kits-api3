Therefore, I located the ""offline"" installer file on your website and ran it inside the VM. </p><p>A few minutes after I performed the installation, I got a ""setup.exe"" alert box saying ""The system detected an overrun of a stack-based buffer in this application.  This overrun could potentially allow a malicious user to gain control of this application."" </p><p>Note:  I cannot be sure this error actually pertains to Firefox (as it's a remote desktop connection to a shared VM so maybe somebody else was trying to install something).  But the error did pop up shortly after I ran the Firefox installer.  Also, this only happened once. </p><p>VM information:  4 CPUs; 16GB memory (1.28 GB active); hard disk 150 GB.

The software has worked on this computer before.
