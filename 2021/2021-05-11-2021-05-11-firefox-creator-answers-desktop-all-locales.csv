They never happen with any other program on the computer so it is only an issue with the browser. These color blocks usually disappear when I roll the mouse arrow over the discolored block or reload the page. I have attached an image with an example, you can see the discolored black block when it is supposed to be all grey. I have tried both refreshing and reinstalling the software. The software has worked on this computer before. Any help would be appreciated.  </p><p>Kind regards, Magnus </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",magnus.lo

We’re having trouble finding that site. We can’t connect to the server at (website) If that address is correct, here are three other things you can try: Try again later. Check your network connection. If you are connected but behind a firewall, check that Firefox has permission to access the Web."" I did notice it's quite random, most websites work but every 1 in 10 I'd say I get this error, then I refresh the page and it loads. </p><p>I've changed my DNS, Removed my firewall, and reset my firefox and none of that worked, please help. </p><p>youtube video of it in action:<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioKKYKnrniQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ioKKYKnrniQ</a> </p><p>basically it just doesn't load then loads when I refresh it. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1412073;,Bassgaming124
