There have been several complaints on the web about this.  Will it be fixed???  I prefer to use Firefox as a browser and I am wondering if Capital One is intentionally forcing people to use another web browser.  The Google Chrome extension I added to Firefox does not work.  I want to use Firefox and may need to find a new virtual credit card provider if Capital One is not compatible with Firefox.  It used to work wonderfully until they obviously changed something. </p><p>Thank you </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,other,en-US,"",aendries
