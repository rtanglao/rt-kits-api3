I use Apache web server, and using both the httpd.conf file and Windows' ""hosts"" file ( C:\Windows\System32\etc\hosts ) I can make an alias for 127.0.0.1, otherwise known as localhost. Because my name is greg, I can add a server name to my localhost, like http://greg/test.html. </p><p>This works pretty well, but sometimes when I add a new alias, like greg or gregory, Firefox doesn't pick up on it right away. I can go to http://greg/test.html in Chrome, and it goes to the local web page just fine. But if I try it in Firefox, it tries to redirect me to ""<a href=""http://www.greg.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.greg.com</a>"". The usual fix is to go into Settings -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security -&gt; Cookies and Site Data -&gt; Clear Data -&gt; Cached Web Content, then press CLEAR. </p><p>But this doesn't always work, and it seems like no matter what I clear, Firefox insists on not looking up my local server alias, but instead redirects me to <a href=""https://www.greg.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.greg.com</a>. </p><p>How do I force Firefox to look for http://greg/ only on my local server? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",gregory.george.lewis

This is new as I usually clear everything several times while shopping or browsing commercial sites to prevent tracking.  It has never been an issue until recently.  I've also noticed that clearing cache/cookies no longer actually clears them - they remain visible as a number on the preferences page as well as listed in the about:cache list - even after I've cleared them using the  drop down box from the menu bar History tab.  This is definitely a bug.   </p><p>I've had to clear everything, shut down Firefox, then RESTART! the entire computer to get Firefox to load once I manage to clear everything.  Can anyone explain what is happening without telling me, ""there's no need to clear the cache and cookies mid-sesh - it will clear when you close Firefox"".  I don't want, for example, youtube tracking my browsing after I watch a video then leave their site.  I have a vpn/ghostery/adblock etc so it may not technically be necessary but I feel safer when I manually remove them.  This used to be easily possible.  What has changed?

There have been several complaints on the web about this.  Will it be fixed???  I prefer to use Firefox as a browser and I am wondering if Capital One is intentionally forcing people to use another web browser.  The Google Chrome extension I added to Firefox does not work.  I want to use Firefox and may need to find a new virtual credit card provider if Capital One is not compatible with Firefox.  It used to work wonderfully until they obviously changed something. </p><p>Thank you </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,other,en-US,1452152;,aendries

I assume this is part of a recent upgrade.  How do I turn this feature off?
