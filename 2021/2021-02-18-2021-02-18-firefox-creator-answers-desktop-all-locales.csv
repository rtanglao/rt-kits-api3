With the new upgrade it keeps defaulting to printing on the short axis (so the second side is printed upside down) which makes it very difficult to read smoothly.  This has always been easy to set previously.  Now the Print menu only allows you to toggle Two-Sided Printing on and off, not to choose the axis.  The system dialog does include this setting, in theory, but it doesn't work.  I have tried changing it to Long-Edge Binding several times.  Each time I change the setting and print immediately, and it still prints with Short-Edge Binding which I do not want.  Help!  If this can't be fixed I will need to stop using two-sided printing entirely, which will mean wasting a lot of paper. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,other,en-US,"",elkatd
