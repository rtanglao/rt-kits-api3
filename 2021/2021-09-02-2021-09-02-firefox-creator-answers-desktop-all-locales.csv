I tried opening Firefox again, didn't work. </p> <ul><li>Note: I am able to install other programs from the Internet that do work, such as Zoom and Adobe Acrobat PDF Reader, so this is specifically related to Firefox. </li></ul> <p>I tried: Opening it Safe Mode, running Firefox as an administrator, uninstalled-and-reinstalled, trying three different Windows versions of Firefox (Windows 64bit, 64bit MSI, and 32bit, for the heck of it. They all did the same thing when run - nothing), and even reset the PC altogether, completely wiping all files and using a recovery USB to reinstall Windows. Once it finished, I tried installing Firefox again, and once again, it opened for a short moment before quitting, destroying the slightest glimmer of hope I had. I contacted Lenovo Premium Support, and they performed everything above, along with a super-wipe of Firefox using a program called Revo Uninstall Premium (they used a free trial). Nothing worked. </p><p>After all that, they suggested I contact Mozilla support, so here I am.

I currently have Firefox 91, but I first noticed this issue sometime in the mid-80s (don't know the exact update where I first saw this behavior).  It occurs fairly continuously during regular web browsing across every single website -- not on every single page load, but I'd guess every 2-3 page loads I receive the error. Upon refresh, usually one but sometimes it takes two or three, the page loads fine. I've even noticed the error with the Pocket extension, where clicking the save page to Pocket button often gives an error on the first click, but clicking a second time works fine.  </p><p>This issue has been mentioned several times on this forum and I have tried every single troubleshooting step I can find, yet the issue persists.  </p><p>I do not have the issue on Safari, Chrome nor Opera and have no connectivity issues on other apps. I do not have a firewall enabled and am not using proxies nor a VPN (at least during troubleshooting).  </p><p>I have tried the following: </p> <ul><li> restarting </li><li> uninstall and reinstall Firefox entirely  </li><li> run in Safe mode (disabling all add-ons)  </li><li> disable hardware acceleration </li></ul> <p>Today I even tried Waterfox to try to get away from the affront to design that is the Proton UI which apparently can no longer be disabled as of Firefox 91. My version of Waterfox is built on Gecko 78 and has the exact same issue that I'm seeing in Firefox.  </p><p>This issue has made Firefox entirely unusable. I'd really love a fix, but I can't keep wasting hours of my life troubleshooting an issue that's not going away. I'm a contractor and I'm losing income and working hours on this.

I'm also trying to clean up any multiple-account/multiple-username type situations I'm coming across.  My Firefox account email address update is making some issues surface.  Here's what's happened . . .  </p><p>So far, on <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a>, I was able to change my alysenet@earthlink.net email address to alysenet@icloud.com wherever that field is in my profile. I can't recall what my USERNAME was for that case. I THINK, somewhere along the way, I also DELETED my ""alysenet@earthlink.net"" account on <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a>, though I wouldn't bet my life on it.  All I know is: </p><p>1. I'm able to LOG IN aok to <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a> using alysenet@icloud.com and a password. Yay!  </p><p>2. BUT . . . ANNOYING: I am seeing that when I get onto <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a> (such as on a Firefox Forum Support page) using alysenet@icloud.com and my password, the upper right part of the screen shows ""alysenet1"" not plain vanilla alysenet.  </p><p>3. AND . . . ANNOYING...and what I'm trying to SOLVE is: When I go into my alysenet@icloud.com profile and try to CHANGE my username from alysenet1 to alysenet, I get a ""username already taken"" message. </p><p>I think MAYBE the ""username already taken"" is due to *MY* originally having an alysenet@earthlink.net account and maybe the system still considers it ""active"" even though I (am pretty sure) I *deleted* my Firefox alysenet@earthlink.net account on 07-26-2021. </p><p>Would the system say ""username already taken"" even if I was the one who had that username and deleted that account? Dunno if that's what's going on; I'm trying to understand what's going on. </p><p>BOTTOM LINE: Can you please: </p><p>(1) look into whether the ""alysenet"" as well as ""alysenet1"" were/are BOTH *ME* ??? Alyse Simon, in San Diego? If you need additional identification to make sure that ""alysenet1"" and not just alysenet, is Me, just let me know what you'd like to know. </p><p>(2) fix the system so I can change my username from alysenet1 to alysenet? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,1440011;1440016;,alysenet1
