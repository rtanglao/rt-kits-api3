I have 2 types of Firefox, Normal Firefox (Version 91.0.2 64-bit) and Firefox Dev Edition (Version 92.0b9 (32-bit) Normal Firefox for Browsing and Dev Edition for coding. When i was trying to use the Profile in Dev Edition (Pre-made in Normal Firefox) it worked. But when i was trying to use the profile that i used on Dev Edition it doesn't work. Then i was forced to make a new profile. </p><p>Can anyone solve this problem?

I'm also trying to clean up any multiple-account/multiple-username type situations I'm coming across.  My Firefox account email address update is making some issues surface.  Here's what's happened . . .  </p><p>So far, on <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a>, I was able to change my alysenet@earthlink.net email address to alysenet@icloud.com wherever that field is in my profile. I can't recall what my USERNAME was for that case. I THINK, somewhere along the way, I also DELETED my ""alysenet@earthlink.net"" account on <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a>, though I wouldn't bet my life on it.  All I know is: </p><p>1. I'm able to LOG IN aok to <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a> using alysenet@icloud.com and a password. Yay!  </p><p>2. BUT . . . ANNOYING: I am seeing that when I get onto <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a> (such as on a Firefox Forum Support page) using alysenet@icloud.com and my password, the upper right part of the screen shows ""alysenet1"" not plain vanilla alysenet.  </p><p>3. AND . . . ANNOYING...and what I'm trying to SOLVE is: When I go into my alysenet@icloud.com profile and try to CHANGE my username from alysenet1 to alysenet, I get a ""username already taken"" message. </p><p>I think MAYBE the ""username already taken"" is due to *MY* originally having an alysenet@earthlink.net account and maybe the system still considers it ""active"" even though I (am pretty sure) I *deleted* my Firefox alysenet@earthlink.net account on 07-26-2021. </p><p>Would the system say ""username already taken"" even if I was the one who had that username and deleted that account? Dunno if that's what's going on; I'm trying to understand what's going on. </p><p>BOTTOM LINE: Can you please: </p><p>(1) look into whether the ""alysenet"" as well as ""alysenet1"" were/are BOTH *ME*Â ??? Alyse Simon, in San Diego? If you need additional identification to make sure that ""alysenet1"" and not just alysenet, is Me, just let me know what you'd like to know. </p><p>(2) fix the system so I can change my username from alysenet1 to alysenet? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,"",alysenet1

This bright flash is painful as I have to readjust my vision for a moment before the dark mode loads. </p><p>How do I get Firefox to render the dark mode directly instead of giving me this bright flash? It seems to me like it's a caching issue, that it caches the light mode. When I just started to use Firefox it did not have this problem and would load the dark mode instantly. </p><p>Thank you in advance. </p>",linux;desktop;websites;firefox-910;firefox-9102;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",khvjohansson
