It doesn't work on another computer either. However, with Internet Explorer on the same computers, prints can be made. The last time I made a printout of OpenStreetMap with Firefox was on 7/16/2021. Apparently something changed in Firefox after that, making printing no longer possible. Now when I try to print via the Firefox ""Print this page"" button (or Ctrl+P key), only the frame of the OpenStreetMap page is printed, but not the map itself. Also the headers and footers are not printed. This issue does not occur when printing with Firefox from other websites or when using Internet Explorer. </li><li> My software: Mozilla Firefox 90.0.2 (64-bit) on Windows 10 Home version 21H1 (64-bit). On my other computer: Mozilla Firefox 90.0.2 (32-bit) on Windows 10 Home version 1909 (32-bit). </li><li>  WHO IS HELPING ME? </li></ol>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",j.wklopper

I don't want it opening in a separate tab and I don't want to download the file, I want to view it where it is. </p><p>This has security implications. </p><p>I have Firefox set to automatically download PDF files to my Downloads folder. My understanding, based on some common sense is that the automatic download setting should only apply <strong>when I click a download link</strong>.  However, that is not what Firefox is doing. </p><p>Due to the above mentioned strange behavior when I open a web page with an embedded PDF, Firefox automatically downloads it as soon as the page loads.  Firefox does not wait for me to click on any link, or to click on the embedded file.   </p><p>I don't think it makes any sense to do this: the automatic download setting should govern what happens <strong>when you try to download a file</strong>, so there must be an intended action like clicking a link that tells Firefox you want to download it.  It makes no sense, and I would argue it's downright dangerous, for Firefox to start downloading embedded items from web pages without the user's knowledge or consent.  </p><p>Please can someone provide some insight into why Firefox is set up to work like this, or if it is a bug.  I'll be happy to provide more info if needed. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-900;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",Punt
