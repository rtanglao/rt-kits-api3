I didn't update firefox, restart it, or anything. I have no idea why this happened, as firefox has been working perfectly all day long, and only after i left my computer for an hour or two, did i come back to the terrifying sight that all of my nearly 630 bookmarks have fully vanished into thin air. </p><p>Oddly enough, i still have one folder, and a few seemingly random bookmarks left over, as to where the rest of them went, i have no idea. </p><p>I've attempted to restart firefox, log out, log back in, disable extensions, and more. The first thing i tried was to use the restore option, however when i click it, it simply says ""unable to process file"". Out of all the backups available to me, including a nearly year and half old one from an Old Firefox Data folder i had on my desktop, none of them work. </p><p>I also checked underneath profiles, and i saw that i had one more profile than i should, however when using said profile, it has absolutely zero of the bookmarks, so that's a no go. </p><p>I really can't wrap my head around what could've caused this or how to rectify it, and im sort of panicking at the idea of years upon years of bookmarks just disappearing at the drop of a hat. </p><p>My only solace is that it appears my mobile (ios) firefox app appears to have all of the bookmarks still saved and accessible, but i can't find any way to transfer those bookmarks onto browser. </p><p>Any help would be enormously appreciated </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-900;firefox-9002;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1433575;1433576;,teddycasimirdad
