My understanding, based on some common sense is that the automatic download setting should only apply <strong>when I click a download link</strong>.  However, that is not what Firefox is doing. </p><p>Due to the above mentioned strange behavior when I open a web page with an embedded PDF, Firefox automatically downloads it as soon as the page loads.  Firefox does not wait for me to click on any link, or to click on the embedded file.   </p><p>I don't think it makes any sense to do this: the automatic download setting should govern what happens <strong>when you try to download a file</strong>, so there must be an intended action like clicking a link that tells Firefox you want to download it.  It makes no sense, and I would argue it's downright dangerous, for Firefox to start downloading embedded items from web pages without the user's knowledge or consent.  </p><p>Please can someone provide some insight into why Firefox is set up to work like this, or if it is a bug.
