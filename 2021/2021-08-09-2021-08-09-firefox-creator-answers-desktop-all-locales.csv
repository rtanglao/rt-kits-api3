Then, when I tried to download fabric again, it said it saved, and when i opened it, I was brought to a new tab and the same box that said ""do you want to save the file"". i click save again and it pulls up the same new tab and box. I then installed java, and when I downloaded fabric again, same result. i switched it in the general settings of Firefox for jar files to be saved to java, but ended up with the same result. I tried uninstalling Firefox, refreshing Firefox, uninstalling java, deleting all previous downloads, and pretty much anything you could think of.  I am sure that I went wrong by choosing to save downloads to Firefox, so how can I undo this? </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1433745;,estebanjulioramirz

When I start Firefox next time those two windows are maximized (good). But when I hover over the Firefox icon on the taskbar so it shows the little previews of all 14 windows, I only see the content for the two that are maximized. I have to click each minimized window, so that it opens on-screen, in order for the little preview on the taskbar to show the contents of that window, then I minimize it again. Is there a way to either maximize all windows at once, or to make all the little previews show the contents of the windows without having to maximize them? In the attached image I've circled the windows that I haven't clicked yet, so they're still blank. Once I click one the little preview will then show what's in that window, and I can minimize it again. I'm just on a Windows 10 laptop, but I don't know if my hardware has anything to do with the issue. Thank you for any input, and have a great day! </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",goanddo

I've tried also to uninstall and re install firefox from scratch, but nothing happens: I still get the message.

If I open a new window, it is a duplicate of whatever window I was in before. That is, the new window has all the tabs the other window did. So, File-New Window copies whatever tabs are on the current window I am on.  I've never seen this before. How can I make FF return to its normal behavior of giving me a window with nothing but a start window on it? Maybe I should go back several versions because recent changes like this and the negative effect a new release a few months ago had on default screen colors, have made my use of FF harder.

I didn't update firefox, restart it, or anything. I have no idea why this happened, as firefox has been working perfectly all day long, and only after i left my computer for an hour or two, did i come back to the terrifying sight that all of my nearly 630 bookmarks have fully vanished into thin air. </p><p>Oddly enough, i still have one folder, and a few seemingly random bookmarks left over, as to where the rest of them went, i have no idea. </p><p>I've attempted to restart firefox, log out, log back in, disable extensions, and more. The first thing i tried was to use the restore option, however when i click it, it simply says ""unable to process file"". Out of all the backups available to me, including a nearly year and half old one from an Old Firefox Data folder i had on my desktop, none of them work. </p><p>I also checked underneath profiles, and i saw that i had one more profile than i should, however when using said profile, it has absolutely zero of the bookmarks, so that's a no go. </p><p>I really can't wrap my head around what could've caused this or how to rectify it, and im sort of panicking at the idea of years upon years of bookmarks just disappearing at the drop of a hat. </p><p>My only solace is that it appears my mobile (ios) firefox app appears to have all of the bookmarks still saved and accessible, but i can't find any way to transfer those bookmarks onto browser. </p><p>Any help would be enormously appreciated </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-900;firefox-9002;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1433575;1433576;,teddycasimirdad
