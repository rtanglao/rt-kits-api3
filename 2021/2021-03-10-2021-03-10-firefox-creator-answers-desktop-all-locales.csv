The only way I've found to prevent this is to first set the magnification and then determine the desired page range in the FF print dialog.  Finally I go to ""Print using system dialog..."", where I can change this setting back to ""over.""  The change does not persist, however, and must be reset every time I print, which is a real pain! </p><p>I checked the Windows printer preferences and verified that the setting saved in my default print shortcut is ""over,"" so the change isn't coming from there.

Initially, I tried to reply from the bell button in the notifications and soon I realized that the Spacebar was not working. I thought it might be stuck, but it was not, since it was working fine in both the address bar and the search bar. Asynchronous keys function was disabled. Then, I went to the video and tried to reply from there. Guess what! The video was being resized using the shortcuts depending on what I was typing!  For example ""t"" changes between normal and theater mode and ""i"" makes it picture-in-picture. What is going on? I am sure no key is locked, i even restarted my pc and the same thing kept happening. Then, I turned it off and on and the problem was persisting. Everything works fine on other applications, just YT seems broken for some reason. I tried to type on YouTube on two other browsers and everything worked fine. I don't think it has anything to do with the windows update, since it only happens on firefox, which I don't intend to change. Is there any setting to lock/toggle the Youtube shortcuts on and off?
