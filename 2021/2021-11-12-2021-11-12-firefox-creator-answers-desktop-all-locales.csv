Each time after installing Firefox i must go trough all the settings once again. To avoid this time consuming steps, is there a way to import all user-specific-settings for a new installation? The screenshot i attached below clearly shows IT IS POSSIBLE to pre-edit firefox settings for a new installation.

Everything I find online just says to use the domain and it will allow everything from that domain, but that doesn't work in my experience. My work uses a Citrix client so I can log in from home, and the URL changes depending on what servers are available at the time. It's a massive company, so they have dozens of servers, and it would take me forever to try and whitelist them all. </p><p>The URLs are structured as <a href=""https://server-aa11.login.company.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://server-aa11.login.company.com</a>. So I need to be able to whitelist everything from <a href=""http://login.company.com"" rel=""nofollow"">login.company.com</a>. In Chrome, I do this using [*.]<a href=""http://login.company.com"" rel=""nofollow"">login.company.com</a> and I have no problems with it, but I have been trying to use FF instead of Chrome recently as Chrome has been having problems for me on Windows 11. </p><p>Anyone have any advice? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",aacrabtree
