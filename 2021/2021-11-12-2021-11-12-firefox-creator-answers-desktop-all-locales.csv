It won't even allow me to reinstall FireFox.  FireFox appears to load but as soon as I move the cursor I immediately get the ""FireFox is not responding"" and I'm forced to use the CTRL + ALT + DEL to bring up the task manager to kill the program.   When I try to download and reinstall using another browser all goes well until the progress bar gets about 3/4 of the way and freezes. Even when I go into my download directory and try to install an older version of FireFox it will say it's installed successfully but it's nowhere to be found. When I click on the desktop icon it declares that Windows cannot find it. I'd like to think that I'm an experienced PC user but this is new to me and seems awfully odd. I've had MalWarebytes Premium for several years so I really don't expect that this is due to any sort of virus.

I first posted about it <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1330028"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. Since then problem has gotten progressively worse - the number of scenarios where the freeze happens has expanded and the frequency has increased. The gist of the problem is that Firefox freezes: a white transparent overlay appears over the window, the interface stops responding and no crash report is generated. </p><p>When it happens: </p><p>1) When calling any sort of context menus and dialogs. It first began to happen when interacting with autofill menus for input forms, but now it happens with any context menu - input forms, file save dialogs, menus in the menu tab and even the right click context menu. </p><p>2) When opening new windows (notably NOT new tabs) such as when opening a private browsing window, bookmarks window, download history window or when using the picture-in-picture option on Youtube. </p><p>How frequently it happens: </p><p>The frequency appears to be random and not specific to any website. It used to happen after about an hour of browsing, but after I attempted a clean reinstall of the browser (see below) the frequency increased dramatically and I am now lucky to get half an hour of browsing before it restarts. </p><p>What I've tried so far: </p><p>1) Looking for problematic extensions. Running Firefox in safe/troubleshooting mode seems to prevent the issue, so I started disabling extensions one by one. Ultimately though, even with all extensions disabled outside of safe mode, the issue persists. Reinstalling the browser without installing any extensions also does not resolve the issue, so any extension-related problems are seemingly ruled out. </p><p>2) Tracking memory and CPU usage. Nothing abnormal there - I have 16 GB of memory and Firefox rarely goes over 5. Just in case, I also increased the page file size on the main drive where Firefox is installed and enabled page files on all local drives (it was disabled for 3 out of 6 for some reason). This also didn't resolve the issue. </p><p>3) Refreshing Firefox. This did nothing except cause the 'Oops, there was a problem restoring your session' tab to first start appearing. Before the refresh that didn't used to happen at restart. </p><p>4) Disabling hardware acceleration. No effect. </p><p>5) Removing bookmarks. I had a very large number of bookmarks saved so I tried removing all of them. The issue persisted. </p><p>6) Deleting the places database. No effect. </p><p>7) Deleting the session restore files. This has been the most interesting option. Deleting the session restore files DID stop the freezing... until it came back again in a couple of days. Deleting the session files again after that did not make the issue go away again. </p><p>8) Doing a complete reinstall of the browser. I uninstalled Firefox from the Control Panel, then went into the AppData folder and manually removed any references to Firefox. After that I installed the latest version of the browser and refrained from syncing the new instance with my Firefox Account, or installing any extensions. Even with that, the issue persists.  </p><p>9) Checked for hardware problems. Tests of RAM and the SSD on which Firefox is installed produced no errors. The issue also persisted through a GPU upgrade. Barring some arcane motherboard or CPU issue, I think hardware problems are ruled out - and it seems unlikely that a motherboard or CPU hardware issue would affect Firefox and only Firefox.  </p><p>Please help, this is an extremely frustrating problem and </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-940;firefox-9401;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1458680;1458681;,nlkonovalenko

This started happening on two Win 10 computers.  I wrote this off to some recent update to the Mozilla apps.  The crash reports were being submitted almost daily. I also noticed that my desktop was disk thrashing without any apparent reason.  I started researching this problem and discovered various other Win 10 users having a similar issue.  The topic that contained the solution was:   (Googled ""cryptographic services high disk"") </p><p><a href=""https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/82423/windows-10-cryptographic-service-high-disk-usage.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/82423/windows-10-cryptographic-service-high-disk-usage.html</a> </p><p>See user response </p> <h6 id=""w_"">==============================</h6> <p>I did stumble on another page on something that has worked for us. </p><p>1) STOP the Cryptographic Services service either in command prompt (run as administrator) or in services.msc It may take a few minutes for the service to finally stop. It may also, stop, but restart on it's own again requiring you to stop it again. </p><p>2) DELETE or RENAME the catroot2 directory located in C:\Windows\System32 </p><p>3) Restart the Cryptographic services service. </p><p>I honestly don't know why this works, I found it on another forum and it has helped me out as we've had this issue on over 50 different machines in our office at various times. We have wondered it is all just Windows or if it is Windows conflicting with Carbon Black or Syxsense -- we just don't know. </p> <h6 id=""w__2"">===========================</h6> <p>After performing this ""fix"" on both of my computers they stopped their disk churning and almost immediately I discovered to my delight that FireFox and Thunderbird stopped hanging and crashing on shutdown.

I just updated to FF 94 but my confusion pre-dates the update. It would be most helpful to have a clear, concise, non-nerd jargon about how to keeps cookies. I normally delete cookies on domain change. This works for me! </p><p>I have a specific domain, a bank, that *now* charges me a fee to log in and check my account: two-step  verification. The bank says that if I don't delete their cookies when I log off then I won't be charged a fee the  next time I try to log in. Fair enough. </p><p>After looking through the Firefox / Mozilla explanations on how to keep cookies, what I read is not clear. Lets start here: many of the explanations show images of the about:config: ""Cookies and Site Data. What I see on my screen is not what is presented in the proposed solution. Example: at this page ttps://<a href=""http://support.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">support.mozilla.org</a> /en-US/questions/1287495 it shows ""Manage Permissions"". On my screen it says ""Manage Exceptions"".  There is a big difference in understanding between ""Permissions"" and ""Exceptions"" and seeing as how I  don't know what ""Permissions"" mean then I'm left with a hole in my understanding of how to proceed. This  might sound a minor point to make, but I can not find a clear, up-to-date (FF 93) how to keep selected  cookies. So please let me state clearly what I want to know and hopefully a clear, concise answer may appear. </p><p>- I want to keep specific cookies, from a specific domain, that were loaded into FF during a session. - The next time I attempt to login to that specific domain, the previously saved (hopefully) cookies </p><pre>  will be recognized by the domain and allow me to log in without further charges. </pre> <p>For my purposes the ""Cookies and Site Data - Manage Data"" function is not relevant. I don't need to make a special election to allow cookies from my bank, nor am I trying to restrict cookies from entering the browser. I simply want to save particular stored cookies for the next attempted login to a specific domain. </p><p>Please, and with respect: clear, concise, simple language that is attuned with the visuals / graphics / images of FF 93. </p><p>Thank you in advance and wishing you healthy times. </p>",windows-7;desktop;cookies;firefox-940;,firefox,cookies,en-US,1458666;,other6

It is not really ready for publication but maybe it will help you.  I copied this from Excel and it is more readable in Excel.   Please forgive typos. </p><p>To copy from Excel, I had to make it a bulleted list.  Each bullet point was another line in Excel. </p> <ul><li> After many tests here is the cleanest way found to update Firefox.  Changing steps or the order may work only to fail later and sometimes leads to reinstalling and re-configuring Firefox.  Suggested  steps can probably be ignored but I think they are appropriate and help keep the system clean. </li><li> Note:  I only run a single version of Firefox. When updating, no applications are running in a sandbox. </li></ul> <ul><li> Clean Firefox Sandboxes </li><li>     1. Suggestion: ""Terminate All Programs"". </li><li>     2.

This can occur during update, install or even days afterwards, check Webroot: </li><li>     1. Follow instructions in section ""Clean Firefox Sandboxes"" </li><li>     2.
