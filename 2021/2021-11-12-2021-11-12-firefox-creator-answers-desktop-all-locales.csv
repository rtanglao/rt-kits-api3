One of those shows information from my linked devices. I have an iPhone SE and a Macbook Air. However, the title for my iPhone SE reads ""Firefox on Pete's iPhone 6"". Elsewhere, for example in my account, it reads ""Firefox on Pete's iPhone SE - which of course is correct. So, I'm just wondering why the dropdown is showing an iPhone that I cleared and sold years ago - unless, of course, you are getting mixed up between the two. I have attached two screenshots to help with this issue. Remember that there did used to be an iPhone 6 SE. But there is also a newer iPhone SE.

I spent over a year learning how to update Firefox in order to use it within Sandboxie and with Webroot protection.  I can now update Firefox within 5 minutes by following these steps.  It is not really ready for publication but maybe it will help you.  I copied this from Excel and it is more readable in Excel.   Please forgive typos. </p><p>To copy from Excel, I had to make it a bulleted list.  Each bullet point was another line in Excel. </p> <ul><li> After many tests here is the cleanest way found to update Firefox.  Changing steps or the order may work only to fail later and sometimes leads to reinstalling and re-configuring Firefox.  Suggested  steps can probably be ignored but I think they are appropriate and help keep the system clean. </li><li> Note:  I only run a single version of Firefox. When updating, no applications are running in a sandbox. </li></ul> <ul><li> Clean Firefox Sandboxes </li><li>     1. Suggestion: ""Terminate All Programs"". </li><li>     2. Suggestion: Initially ""Delete Contents"" of all sandboxes and then the sandbox used during installation. </li></ul> <ul><li> If Firefox does not open. This can occur during update, install or even days afterwards, check Webroot: </li><li>     1. Follow instructions in section ""Clean Firefox Sandboxes"" </li><li>     2.

Ensure all ""Firefox"" applications ""Allow"" enabled. </li><li>         Note: While I have had seven entries, once this process was learned there has never been more than one.  My Wife's computer has had two.  The most common second entry is the temporary Firefox update folder ""...\updated\firefox.exe"". </li><li>              To remove ""Firefox"" entries, other than ""C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox"", Perform the following for each entry and do so one-at-a-time. </li><li>        FYI: ""...\updated\firefox.exe"" is created during download and deleted after Firefox has been restarted. </li><li>        Warning: Even if an entry can be set to ""Deny"" and have Firefox executed.  Leave it disabled, rather than deleting, until you have your settings, plugins, favorites, etc. documented and you have the time to reinstall.  Very early in the learning process I had to reinstall. Since the bulk of these instructions were created I have never had to reinstall. </li><li>       1. Close Firefox </li><li>                  2. In Webroot set the entry to ""Deny"". </li><li>                  3. Open Firefox </li><li>                  4.

I do this every time Firefox is opened unsandboxed (e.g. when Bookmarks added or settings changed) </li><li>             More &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security   (or enter address   about:preferences#privacy) </li><li>             Close tabs other than Settings.
