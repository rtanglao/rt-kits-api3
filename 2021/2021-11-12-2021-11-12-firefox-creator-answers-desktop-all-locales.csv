I would like to block Amazon from doing this in the future, but I can't find a way to check which websites have this permission.

This description lacks of explenation. </p><p>Does one of the setting include the other one? For exmaple if i use (1: cross site tracking cookies - including social media cookies) Does that mean i block cross site tracking cookies and cross site cookies or does it mean i only block cross site tracking cookies without blocking cross site cookies?? </p><p>Or when i use (2: cross site cookies - including social media cookies) Does that mean i block cross site cookies without cross site tracking cookies or both?? </p><p>Honestly this is so dumb, really the dev team should fix this tiny but stupid issue. </p><p>PLEASE CHECK THE SCREENSHOT ATTACHED BELOW! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1458518;,Firefox_Bug_Report

Everything I find online just says to use the domain and it will allow everything from that domain, but that doesn't work in my experience. My work uses a Citrix client so I can log in from home, and the URL changes depending on what servers are available at the time. It's a massive company, so they have dozens of servers, and it would take me forever to try and whitelist them all. </p><p>The URLs are structured as <a href=""https://server-aa11.login.company.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://server-aa11.login.company.com</a>. So I need to be able to whitelist everything from <a href=""http://login.company.com"" rel=""nofollow"">login.company.com</a>. In Chrome, I do this using [*.]<a href=""http://login.company.com"" rel=""nofollow"">login.company.com</a> and I have no problems with it, but I have been trying to use FF instead of Chrome recently as Chrome has been having problems for me on Windows 11. </p><p>Anyone have any advice? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",aacrabtree
