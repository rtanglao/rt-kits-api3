I thought the server keeps everything and if I sign out the old laptop that whatever was saved in to the new laptop stays. However, on the new laptop after signing off the old one from sync I don't see the tabs anymore. It makes sense because there is nothing to sync but how do I do what I want then? Many thanks for your assistance. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",spr3home

Dall'ultimo aggiornamento di Firefox non posso più utilizzare la funzione [Modifica] che significa modifica visuale, un visual editor estremamente efficiente per il nostro lavoro.

Potete fare una prova entrando in Wikipedia, anche senza un account e tentare di utilizzare la Sandbox, la pagina delle prove. Sarebbe molto utile che sistemaste il problema, perché io preferisco Firefox, anche se Chrome è più veloce, ma io lo preferisco per una serie di ragioni.
