I bought an SSD and fresh installed it.  I entered my password for my account and it locked me for 30 mins, and as I was in a hury I didn't wanted to wait for the cooldown, so I went straight to reset it, (because I had like 2 tries to find my password back) and I needed the account sync RIGHT NOW.  I had no idea if I resetted my password, it would delete all I had on that account. Is there any way to get my log-ins back? They are really important as I had some stuff that I don't use often and I needed them there. Or is anything that I can do at least to recover my passwords?

All the searches on the Web produce loads of blogs where the issue is discussed -- but none of it works definitively.  A lot of Hot Air and useless comments on the topic. Most point to about:config, which has been shown useless to stop floating videos, in my experience.  Have tried every permutation of manipulating relevant config settings according to advice I have found -- nothing works.  At the <a href=""http://DailyMail.Com"" rel=""nofollow"">DailyMail.Com</a> you can ad a script to AdBlock and it works -- for one site... </p><p>All the search links go in circles and just repeat the same information -- none of which works.  Particularly annoying are the CBS affiliate sites with the URL *<a href=""http://CbsLocal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">CbsLocal.com</a>.  Element blocking and ad blocking via UBlock and AdBlock does NOT work beyond one page view.  It seems the floating video frames are given unique tags each time the page loads so you would have to code every combination of the alpha-numeric identifiers they use.  That number is something like equivalent to the number of all the grains of sand on all the beaches in the world, according to my calculator... </p><p>If I am directed to manipulate about:config again I think I will scream and pull my hair out.  Such a major annoyance and I am to believe there is utterly no way to stop it ?  After all these years and the FF developers haven't looked into this ?  I find that hard to believe... </p>",windows-7;desktop;websites;firefox-880;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",JoeJupa

Dall'ultimo aggiornamento di Firefox non posso più utilizzare la funzione [Modifica] che significa modifica visuale, un visual editor estremamente efficiente per il nostro lavoro. Devo ricorrere alla vecchia [Modifica testuale] e non capisco il motivo, dato che con Chrome funziona tutto benissimo. Potete fare una prova entrando in Wikipedia, anche senza un account e tentare di utilizzare la Sandbox, la pagina delle prove. Sarebbe molto utile che sistemaste il problema, perché io preferisco Firefox, anche se Chrome è più veloce, ma io lo preferisco per una serie di ragioni.
