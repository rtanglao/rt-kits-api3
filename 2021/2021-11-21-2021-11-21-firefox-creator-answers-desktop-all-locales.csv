Dall'ultimo aggiornamento di Firefox non posso più utilizzare la funzione [Modifica] che significa modifica visuale, un visual editor estremamente efficiente per il nostro lavoro. Devo ricorrere alla vecchia [Modifica testuale] e non capisco il motivo, dato che con Chrome funziona tutto benissimo. Potete fare una prova entrando in Wikipedia, anche senza un account e tentare di utilizzare la Sandbox, la pagina delle prove. Sarebbe molto utile che sistemaste il problema, perché io preferisco Firefox, anche se Chrome è più veloce, ma io lo preferisco per una serie di ragioni. Grazie per l'attenzione. </p><p>per eventuali ulteriori delucidazioni potete scrivere a brunokito@gmail.com </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-940;firefox-9401;,firefox,websites,it,1460814;1460819;1460820;,brunokito1
