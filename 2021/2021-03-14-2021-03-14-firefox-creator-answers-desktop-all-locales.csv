Unlike other browsers (including brave, a privacy friendly browser), Firefox completely logs me out of my account each time I quit the browser or restart my computer.  I lost my settings and bookmarks several times due to this, before deciding to sync my data across devices.  This is a problem I have never had with another browser.  However, with these settings, Firefox still resets my default browser from duck duck go to google and changes my privacy settings to remember history (when I have repeatedly set it to never remember history), send technical and interaction data to Moxilla, and allow Firefox to install and run studies every time I re-open Firefox and log into my account.  I have syncing on for my preferences at all times, and even made efforts to manually sync my settings right after changing them to my preferences, but these few settings still continue to reset.  I chose Firefox as my browser to protect my privacy, but it feels ridiculous having to change my settings every time I open Firefox just to get the protections I want.  I also noticed that under “Firefox Data Collection and Use” you say “We always ask permission before receiving personal information.”, however this seems to be the opposite of what I am experiencing as I have to actively prevent Firefox from running studies and sending technical interaction data to Moxilla by changing my settings again and again. </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-860;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1398696;1398703;1398727;,themuseedorsay

This happens to all tested feminine forms ending with ""-innen"", even irregular or non-existing ones, if they follow the masculine form and "" und "" (both preceded and followed by exactly one space). The truncation is case insensitive, and when I type the feminine form first, ""innen"" will be cut, and "" und [masculine]"" as well. Turning off auto-correction didn't help. Also, when I send a mail containing such a double form, it arrives correctly, but in my sent mails "" und [feminine]"" is gone. However, when I then open ""forward"" or ""reply"" with repetition of the sent mail, the deleted words are back in place. None of this happens when I use another browser or an E-Mail client or the Gmail app on my phone, nor does it happen with other mail providers, not even when using Firefox. I know this sounds weird, as if there were an automatic ""politically incorrect maker"". But it is exactly what happens.
