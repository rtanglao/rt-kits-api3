Firefox Default Browser Agent 1EC6870EC82BB8F8,"<p>o about a week ago I started noticing something flashing on my screen every so often. Not a big deal really until I tried playing Minecraft with a few friends a few days ago. Suddenly every so often it would kick me back to desktop like I was alt tabbing when I wasn't. I finally got tired of it and started looking into it. I got a program called focus logger to see what was taking the windows focus away. It came back to be conhost.. and it was happening every 10 minutes...looking further I could not figure out what was using conhost like that. thinking about it.. I decided to try to catch it. it was only on the screen for like a millisecond though. I used nvidia shadowplay to capture the screen when it happened and then using premiere pro found the frame it appeared in.. it was something in users roaming called esuiwsu. Googled it.. nothing.. I had already ran malwarebytes, Panda, and Norton, and found nothing. </p><p>I woke up today about to reformat my pc, when I thought.. if its running every 10 minutes.. maybe its in task scheduler.. sure enough I found it. Firefox Default Browser Agent 1EC6870EC82BB8F8 every 10 minutes it starts a program called evuiwsu. But this program doesn't exist on my pc when searching through the files... </p><p>I am ending the task.. but I sure would like to know what was happening, and maybe this will help anyone else who might be noticing a background task flashing on their screen.. or minecraft alt tabbing out when trying to play. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1425348;1425349;1425358;,cta75
