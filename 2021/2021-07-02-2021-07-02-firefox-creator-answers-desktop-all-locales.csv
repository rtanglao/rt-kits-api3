No Old Firefox data.,"<p>Firefox was one of the system updates I installed today on my Linux Mint 19.3.  I updated it and discovered all history and bookmarks are gone.  I have no Old Firefox Data folder.  I tried about:profiles but the only other profile is the default Linux one.  I tried to Restore from Import and Backup in Manage Bookmarks for several different dates, but only get ""Unable to process the backup file"" error.  I also tried to choose several .json files from the STG-backups-FF-8x folders in Linux Downloads directory, but it doesn't seem to do anything.  I've tried using Timeshift to restore from previous system dates, but it would only create Firefox folders with the same outcomes as above.  I don't really care about history, but I have a lot of bookmarks that would be very difficult to recreate. </p><p>Thanks, in advance, for any help getting my bookmarks back! </p>",linux;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-890;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",dschroed13

Neither has a Firefox account set up. In fact I just created a Firefox account tonight just to ask this question. Each browser runs a  strict privacy policy and is as locked down as I can get it for the most part, save for a few whitelisted websites to keep my sanity.    So theoretically, each browser should be ignorant of the other.   However, when I am using Firefox on my iPhone and with my Macbook in front of me, a Firefox icon pops up in the MacBook dock with a little phone in the icon.  When I mouse-over, it says ""Firefox from iPhone"" and if I click on the icon, it opens to the web page I have open on the iPhone.   Without a FireFox account or sync set up, how does that happen? </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-890;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",hoekma
