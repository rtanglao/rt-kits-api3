Neither has a Firefox account set up. In fact I just created a Firefox account tonight just to ask this question. Each browser runs a  strict privacy policy and is as locked down as I can get it for the most part, save for a few whitelisted websites to keep my sanity.    So theoretically, each browser should be ignorant of the other.   However, when I am using Firefox on my iPhone and with my Macbook in front of me, a Firefox icon pops up in the MacBook dock with a little phone in the icon.  When I mouse-over, it says ""Firefox from iPhone"" and if I click on the icon, it opens to the web page I have open on the iPhone.   Without a FireFox account or sync set up, how does that happen? </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-890;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",hoekma

If it is not what I am looking for, I close the Tab and Firefox goes to the right side Tab. This Tab could be dormant, but now it will load consuming more resources. </p><p>I would like Firefox to return to the page I was looking at previously (usually the one tn the left). </p><p>Thanks, FPM </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",fpmishere

I was able to get volume by changing my browser to safari.  I'm hoping to find a solution because I have all my bookmarks set up with firefox.  I'm guessing it has to be with the privacy settings, but so far I haven't found a solution.  Can anyone help? </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-700;,firefox,other,en-US,"",moxie_1977
