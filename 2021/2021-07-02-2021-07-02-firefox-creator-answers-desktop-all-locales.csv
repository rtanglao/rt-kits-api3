I have followed the tips above to check RAM for errors with none found, tried running Firefox in Troubleshoot mode (it still crashed) and have updated several times to the newest version over the last year, still with crashing. I'm following this message with error codes. Thanks for your help. </p><p>bp-5fc493a5-f20e-4537-aa6e-ab4770210701 </p><p>bp-2f226449-908a-4235-be61-cf0410210701 	7/1/2021, 4:59 PM 	 View bp-c67f45cc-a99d-42df-ba10-5a5ef0210701 	7/1/2021, 4:59 PM 	 View bp-1be89764-f261-4415-8ada-778a20210701 	7/1/2021, 4:59 PM 	 View bp-58738d32-ac69-4833-a91d-051710210701 	7/1/2021, 4:59 PM 	 View bp-062075a7-9fb3-4def-834f-d1beb0210701 	7/1/2021, 4:59 PM 	 View bp-42f3fd90-b34d-45a3-8b23-33e670210701 	7/1/2021, 4:59 PM </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;firefox-8902;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1425263;,workingartistgrant
