This is how I would like firefox to work but for some reason today my windows started opening up below whatever Firefox window I have open and I get a desktop notification saying the Firefox private window is ready. I just want the new window to open automatically in front of everything else. Any help is appreciated! </p> <ul><li>Edit* It stopped by itself.

I been a long time user of the Linux &amp; Android version and have donated in the past. </p><p>One thing that I find annoying is that when I close a Tab in Firefox it always moves to the Tab to the right. </p><p>I would like to see an option to make it go to the left.  </p><p>When I am surfing I have a habit to open in new tab. If it is not what I am looking for, I close the Tab and Firefox goes to the right side Tab. This Tab could be dormant, but now it will load consuming more resources. </p><p>I would like Firefox to return to the page I was looking at previously (usually the one tn the left). </p><p>Thanks, FPM </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",fpmishere

I was able to get volume by changing my browser to safari.  I'm hoping to find a solution because I have all my bookmarks set up with firefox.  I'm guessing it has to be with the privacy settings, but so far I haven't found a solution.  Can anyone help? </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-700;,firefox,other,en-US,"",moxie_1977
