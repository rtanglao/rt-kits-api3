It needs one in a bad way. </p><p>Now when I say portable mode what I mean is that the Firefox EXE runs from the folder it's in, using profiles that generated and exist in that same folder and NOT in the user profile. This functionality is needed not just for easy portability, but also for easy migrations from one system to another or one installation of OS to another. </p><p>While the portability mode should be exclusive to the platform FireFox is being used on(IE Windows vs Linux, etc), it should be seamless transition otherwise. </p><p>Before anyone chimes in and says this is not possible, please don't waste your time. Forks of FF have been doing so nearly effortlessly for more than a decade while maintaining perfectly functionally and security with the same usability.  </p><p>So Devs, can you please make this happen? We the public would ever so grateful. </p><p>Additionally, can we get some fine grained controls over the appearance of UI elements?  </p><p>This double spacing nonsense is irritating.  </p><p>Then there is the Extension Icons labels. They've been gone for a while and they need to return, or at least an option to enable them if we wish.  </p><p>Next we have the ""Home page and new windows"" option in settings. Those two options should not be combined. When I open a new instance of FF, I would like to open a blank page. I don't want any navigation happening until I click something or type in an address. I expect FF to sit and wait for my input. Then when I click the ""Home"" icon button does it go to my define home page. </p><p>Next problem we have is the auto update feature. This seems to have become an incredibly <strong>nasty</strong> feature and behavior. For example, I recently updated to Windows 11. After migrating my previous install of FF to it, it swiftly and without ANY warning or user prompt at all updated itself from 78.15.0esr to 91.3. This was NOT desired So how about to folks show respect to us users by <strong>ASKING</strong> if we want to upgrade! Had a prompt appeared I would have swiftly canceled. Updates should <strong>ALWAYS</strong> be at the choice <strong>and</strong> involvement of the user, not at your whim. I had to spend 40minutes manually backtracking and recopying, which was unpleasant. </p><p>Please note that while my above statements have had some negativity to them, I am a ardent supporter of Mozilla and will continue to be. These above points are that of increasing frustration. I am of the school of thought that we the users should have complete and fine-grain controls over every aspect of how our browser operates, whether it be UI elements or nitty-gritty functionality. </p><p>I look forward to responses by members of the dev team. </p><p>Thank You, Lex </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1459151;1459153;1459154;1459192;1459194;1459196;1459199;,lexluthermiester

The problem is purely visual - these elements are present and can be clicked on with the mouse, they just aren't displayed correctly. The more tabs open after 4129, the faster and harder the Firefox lags. When I quickly open more than 50 tabs after 4129, the browser usually stops displaying anything and completely freezes. The problem also appears some time after restarting the browser. Closing all tabs above the limit of 4129 completely solves the problem. </p><p><strong>What have I done to solve the problem and what isn't working:</strong> </p> <ul><li> tried running the browser in ""safe-mode"" (without extensions and hardware acceleration); </li><li> tried running my firefox-profile in a new clean firefox client of the same version (87); </li><li> tried running my firefox-profile in a new clean firefox client of the latest version (94); </li><li> tried running my firefox-profile on another computer with significantly more RAM (32GB); </li><li> tried running my firefox-profile with sessionstore.jsonlz4 saved earlier (a week earlier) </li><li> tried running my sessionstore.jsonlz4 in a brand new profile; </li><li> combinations of all steps above. </li></ul> <p><strong>Partial solution:</strong> The problem is definitely related to the sessionstore.jsonlz4 file from the profile. But since this file is critically important to me, I can't just create a new blank one. I tried creating a brand new one based on the old one, but smaller in size (I used [this](<a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery/</a>) extension). The old sessionstore.jsonlz4 (A) is 10.2MB, the new one (B) is 631KB. This difference in size is due to the fact that the new file doesn't contain data in the ""image"" attribute of tabs. In old (A) sessionstore.jsonlz4 67% of the space was taken up by the ""image"" attribute (it seems to be responsible for displaying the icons on the tabs), 16% by attribute ""csp"" (no idea what it is), all other attributes take less than 2% each. There're no ""csp"" attribute in my new (B) sessionstore.jsonlz4 and ""image"" attributes are ""null"". The first and second place are the ""url"" (23%) and ""title"" (19%) attributes respectively. I moved the new (B) sessionstore.jsonlz4 to the old profile and the problem was solved (the 4129 tabs limit disappeared). However, since the new (B) sessionstore.jsonlz4 has no ""image"" attribute data, all tabs are displayed without icons. I wrote a simple python-script that decompresses sessionstore files into json format, then copy ""images"" attributes of the old (A) sessionstore.json into the new one (C), and then compresses this into the new (C) sessionstore.jsonlz4. The size of such a compiled file is 6.82MB. When using such a sessionstore (С), the tab-icons are displayed, but the problem with the limit of 4129 tabs appears again.

I read people online who had sessionstore.jsonlz4 over 50MB and had no problems. 3) 67% of the space in my sessionstore-(A) is taken up by images, and many of them are repeated 100-300 times - a colossal waste. In total, I counted 792 unique images. Question - is there any way to modify sessionstore.jsonlz4 to significantly reduce its size, but still leave the data about these images? I tried to create 792 files with these images on my disk and replace the ""image"" attributes data with the path to these files.

The problem is purely visual - these elements are present and can be clicked on with the mouse, they just aren't displayed correctly. The more tabs open after 4129, the faster and harder the Firefox lags. When I quickly open more than 50 tabs after 4129, the browser usually stops displaying anything and completely freezes. The problem also appears some time after restarting the browser. Closing all tabs above the limit of 4129 completely solves the problem. </p><p><strong>What have I done to solve the problem and what isn't working:</strong> </p> <ul><li> tried running the browser in ""safe-mode"" (without extensions and hardware acceleration); </li><li> tried running my firefox-profile in a new clean firefox client of the same version (87); </li><li> tried running my firefox-profile in a new clean firefox client of the latest version (94); </li><li> tried running my firefox-profile on another computer with significantly more RAM (32GB); </li><li> tried running my firefox-profile with sessionstore.jsonlz4 saved earlier (a week earlier) </li><li> tried running my sessionstore.jsonlz4 in a brand new profile; </li><li> combinations of all steps above. </li></ul> <p><strong>Partial solution:</strong> The problem is definitely related to the sessionstore.jsonlz4 file from the profile. But since this file is critically important to me, I can't just create a new blank one. I tried creating a brand new one based on the old one, but smaller in size (I used [this](<a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sidebery/</a>) extension). The old sessionstore.jsonlz4 (A) is 10.2MB, the new one (B) is 631KB. This difference in size is due to the fact that the new file doesn't contain data in the ""image"" attribute of tabs. In old (A) sessionstore.jsonlz4 67% of the space was taken up by the ""image"" attribute (it seems to be responsible for displaying the icons on the tabs), 16% by attribute ""csp"" (no idea what it is), all other attributes take less than 2% each.
