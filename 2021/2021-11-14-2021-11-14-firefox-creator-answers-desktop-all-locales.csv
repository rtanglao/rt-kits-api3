Since I installed the latest version of FF, I have to login manually (not automatically) to BT and having done so when I close an article it logs me out of BT.  Firefox asks of if I want to make FF my home browser.  I see that BT is one of my saved logins but this logging out etc is something that did not happen with the older version of FF.  So please how do I permanently make FF my home browser and how do I get it to remember my login on BT when I flick between articles? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,customize,en-US,1459024;,barnesjk
