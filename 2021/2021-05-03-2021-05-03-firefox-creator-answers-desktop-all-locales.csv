I have submitted multiple crash reports but not sure if any went through. There was no pop-up window or any field to describe the problem like what the 'Learn more..' link says when the crash occurs. </p><p><br> I have already seen other reports of this problem (e.g. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1334218"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1334218</a> ) </p> <hr> <p>Firefox 78.10.0 Mac OS 10.9.5 (Can't upgrade further on existing HW) </p> <hr> <p>I don't like the recommendation on the above URL to install an older version of Firefox. We never tell anyone to go back to old versions of our SW if the bug is created by the new version. For me, the crashes started right AFTER I upgraded Firefox to 78.10.0. I was watching CBS shows. So the crash has a definite connection to the Firefox upgrade. I haven't changed anything else on my MacBook. I had no problem watching the shows on previous versions of Firefox. </p><p>To reproduce the crash, try to watch a ""free"" CBS show ( e.g. <a href=""https://www.cbs.com/shows/fbi/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cbs.com/shows/fbi/</a> ). No subscription needed for a few episodes available for free. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-109;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1410302;,khufia-ffmoz
