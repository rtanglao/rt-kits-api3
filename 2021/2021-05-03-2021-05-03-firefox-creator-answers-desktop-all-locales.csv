Everything I have tried never stops it, so I have to assume that Mozilla are doing their best to screw me by insisting I put up with broken software patches and installs. When it updates it removes all my settings and addins meaning I have to reinstall everything from scratch: EACH AND EVERY TIME! Now, I know it shouldn't, as feedback suggests, but as I never receive any feedback from someone who can provide accurate solutions (links to four year old versions are hardly going to resolve the newer software faults), I have now accepted that it is just crap service meant to annoy me. As the last update now never opens the Google ads, does anyone know what Firefox have screwed up this time and how I can restore previous functionality (the reason for not updating!!!!!!!!!). Edge, and Chrome don't have the problem, so I am using Edge and will continue to do so as working Google ads is important to me. Would someone from Firefox either provide a working solution or do I have to accept they have absolutely no interest in customer satisfaction and just plough on in their own little world with zero recognition as to what users actually want: that is working software that remains working with stable upgrades that don't keep introducing more problems that require waiting for more updates to resolve then while introducing more problems each time! The reason why not updating is so important to me. I am sick of it now! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,"",etruscanhouse
