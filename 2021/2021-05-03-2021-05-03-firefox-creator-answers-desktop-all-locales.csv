We never tell anyone to go back to old versions of our SW if the bug is created by the new version. For me, the crashes started right AFTER I upgraded Firefox to 78.10.0. I was watching CBS shows. So the crash has a definite connection to the Firefox upgrade. I haven't changed anything else on my MacBook. I had no problem watching the shows on previous versions of Firefox. </p><p>To reproduce the crash, try to watch a ""free"" CBS show ( e.g. <a href=""https://www.cbs.com/shows/fbi/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cbs.com/shows/fbi/</a> ).
