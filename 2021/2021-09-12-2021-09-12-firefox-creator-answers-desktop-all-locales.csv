The cursor is invisible and shows up erratically on the screen. Very hard to select anything on a map.  This problem seems to have started out of the blue yesterday (September 10, 2021). I made no changes to anything that I am aware of.  This problem does not happen on any other browser page, or any other application on my PC. Just Google maps through Firefox. I tried Google Chrome and the cursor worked fine. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,other,en-US,"",on_time_marc

So my searching ended on the following page: <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/safepal-wallet/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/safepal-wallet/</a>  After I installed this extension and logged in with my credentials it was not working. 8 hours later I checked if my funds were still save on my phone software wallet also from Safepal I saw nothing $0,- balance I was deep in shock I saw my last transactions and saw that my funs ($4000,-) were transferred to another wallet. I could not believe it an add-on that is deployed in the add-on list of Mozilla Firefox. Is there no any audit department that is checking every add-on and test it before it get listed on the official add-on store of Mozilla Firefox. Can you please have a look into this add-on before there will be a massive amount of people getting scammed. And also have a look into the developer identity I have found the IP-address of the developer by tracing the mail address. Please have a look into it and maybe their is a solution to help me out. </p>",desktop;add-ons;malware;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1442730;1442736;1442747;,cali-cpt

The little icon under the youtube video doesn't show any  more. Used to work well. then suddenly didn't. In fact I had one tab open at a youtube vid and the downloader icon was there and working and at the same time I opened another tab by 'right click' and 'open in new tab' from the youtube list - to another youtube vid - and on that tab, that page, the downloader icon didn't show. And now I can't ever open a page where it'll show. So I installed a couple more downloader addons and they don't work either. </p><p>I've check all of them in addon manager and they all appear okay, enabled, enabled in private windows, all okay. </p><p>Anyone know anything about it? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,customize,en-US,1442737;1442740;1442752;,abrogard
