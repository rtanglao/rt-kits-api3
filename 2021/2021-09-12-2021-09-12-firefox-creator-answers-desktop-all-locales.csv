It's been my favorite browser for years and I want to stick with it, but it becomes unusable. </p><p>I've got 32GB of RAM, so I should theoretically be able to open quite a few tabs (which I need as a web developer), but when I have about 15 tabs open, it consumes about 1GB of ram per tab. Usually I have some webmail tabs open, google drive, youtube, some documentation and references, github, example sites... you know, the usuall stuff you find in a web dev's browser. </p><p>I'm running the latest updates on Ubuntu 20.04 and have the latest Firefox installed. On my Windows (dual-boot so the same computer, but windoze is more for gaming than for work), I can open 50 tabs and have no memory issues at all. I'm syncing my extensions so it's the exact same configuration, yet on Linux it's huge a pain in the behind to keep using it. </p><p>Are there any fixes for this? I've seen other complain about similar issues for previous versions of Firefox and other Linux distros, I've ran through all the self help suggestions and nothing helps. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;ubuntu;firefox-920;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1442792;,jan.rubbrecht

I could not believe it an add-on that is deployed in the add-on list of Mozilla Firefox. Is there no any audit department that is checking every add-on and test it before it get listed on the official add-on store of Mozilla Firefox. Can you please have a look into this add-on before there will be a massive amount of people getting scammed. And also have a look into the developer identity I have found the IP-address of the developer by tracing the mail address. Please have a look into it and maybe their is a solution to help me out. </p>",desktop;add-ons;malware;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1442730;1442736;1442747;1442783;,cali-cpt
