Decided to reset FF. Whoops!!! It reset, but by itself, like magic, it reloaded all of the previous extensions.  Startling and weird; threw  me for a loop. This wasn't what was supposed to happen. The dead had come back to life. Gremlins at work? Oh, and contrary to FF ""comes with JS"", that did not happen. Ran reset again, just in case last night's booze had lingering after effects. Same astonishing hallucination. More baffling than ever.  So I ran several on demand Anti-virus scanners; system is clean.  Bewildered and frustrated, I resisted the urge to throw the f#*&amp;^ing computer out the window, when I noticed the sun was rising; so I fell asleep. After several hours of sleep, punctuated by visions of monster virus zombies, I awoke, and then sought help from a nerd. But the esoteric terminology used was beyond my pay grade. Silly me for asking a venerable nerd for help. Witchcraft, or am I infected by a new virus?  I believe this misery may have started when I manually updated FF, prompted by a program that checks for updates. Kindly note that I am not a computer whiz, but I can follow simple directions, minus verbiage that I don't have the foggiest interpretation of.   Sorry about that.  Please help.
