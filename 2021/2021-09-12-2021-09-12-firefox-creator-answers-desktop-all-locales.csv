It's been my favorite browser for years and I want to stick with it, but it becomes unusable. </p><p>I've got 32GB of RAM, so I should theoretically be able to open quite a few tabs (which I need as a web developer), but when I have about 15 tabs open, it consumes about 1GB of ram per tab. Usually I have some webmail tabs open, google drive, youtube, some documentation and references, github, example sites... you know, the usuall stuff you find in a web dev's browser. </p><p>I'm running the latest updates on Ubuntu 20.04 and have the latest Firefox installed. On my Windows (dual-boot so the same computer, but windoze is more for gaming than for work), I can open 50 tabs and have no memory issues at all. I'm syncing my extensions so it's the exact same configuration, yet on Linux it's huge a pain in the behind to keep using it. </p><p>Are there any fixes for this?

I could not believe it an add-on that is deployed in the add-on list of Mozilla Firefox. Is there no any audit department that is checking every add-on and test it before it get listed on the official add-on store of Mozilla Firefox. Can you please have a look into this add-on before there will be a massive amount of people getting scammed. And also have a look into the developer identity I have found the IP-address of the developer by tracing the mail address. Please have a look into it and maybe their is a solution to help me out. </p>",desktop;add-ons;malware;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1442730;1442736;1442747;1442783;,cali-cpt
