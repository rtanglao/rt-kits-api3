Clicking my mouse for ENTER seems as if its not one of it's functions so I have to literally press the ENTER button on my keyboard. That's only one of my problems that I am having with Firefox. So I decided to REFRESH Firefox. Now my bookmarks are missing so I followed the steps and went to&gt;&gt; HELP&gt; More Troubleshooting Info&gt;&gt;PROFILE folder&gt;&gt; Open profile &gt;&gt;bookmarkbackups but there's nothing in that folder, it's empty. So where are my Bookmarks? This is a headache that happens every time I have to REFRESH. I just want my Bookmarks back quickly &amp; simple. I've looked in the OLD FIREFOX folder on my desktop &amp; there's no Bookmarks in there either. I apologize for this article because I know it sounds like every other article about Bookmarks in here but I've become impatient and just want my Bookmarks back in place. It's like a wild goose chase with this issue. </p>",windows-7;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-920;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",agoldenstatewarrior

I followed some old post I found regaridng this isssue and nothign is working. I am using customized shortcuts for Cut, Copy, Paste and find similar cu the keyboard shortcut on Windows PC Ctr+C, Ctr+V. These shortcut are working for all other applications including Safari and Chrome. None of them is working fro Firefox. I need to use CMD+C, CMD+V and so on. I do not have any language packs added except the primary English US. This is the main reason why I am not using Firefox for the most part. I reinstalled the appliaiton af ew times, I have created a secodn profile on MAC and Firefox, I start in refresh mode, issue is still there.
