This can be fixed by using other fonts in browser's font -&gt; advanced settings, but by default result in a very poor text quality when ClearType disabled. Solution from this thread <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1269170"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1269170</a> like deleting those fonts ""AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Fonts"" seem to not work since there's no such fonts. When ClearType enabled back, font immedeately changes to a perfectly smooth one, but since I have unusual RWBG pixel structure it looks quite bad with ClearType. So I either stuck with alternative fonts or eye-straining pixelated fonts without ClearType on Windows. Interestingly, this doesn't look to affect other browsers. I believe it's a bug but maybe I'm missing something. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1448640;,dantaeusb

This issue does not happen in Chrome or Edge on either of my two machines.  This is purely isolated to Firefox. </p><p>I've tried every fix I could find with no resolution.  I love Mozilla and the what the company stands for and would love to continue using the product, but the constant crackling as I'm trying to learn new skills is on the verge of driving me crazy.  It would seem that such a fundamental HTML5 concept as video playback would be well tested and well engineered in Firefox, but as I mentioned, I'm seeing the same issue on multiple machines in multiple environments. </p><p>Any additional help anyone has to offer would be much appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1448517;,ork+moz

They play for like 1min and lag, continue for another 2min then lag etc etc. (even short videos on twitter lag). It was not like that before and I don't have this problem in other browsers. Does anyone know what can be the problem here? Thanks </p>",windows-7;desktop;beta;fix-problems;firefox-930;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1448518;,nicaya

Clicking my mouse for ENTER seems as if its not one of it's functions so I have to literally press the ENTER button on my keyboard. That's only one of my problems that I am having with Firefox. So I decided to REFRESH Firefox. Now my bookmarks are missing so I followed the steps and went to&gt;&gt; HELP&gt; More Troubleshooting Info&gt;&gt;PROFILE folder&gt;&gt; Open profile &gt;&gt;bookmarkbackups but there's nothing in that folder, it's empty. So where are my Bookmarks? This is a headache that happens every time I have to REFRESH. I just want my Bookmarks back quickly &amp; simple. I've looked in the OLD FIREFOX folder on my desktop &amp; there's no Bookmarks in there either. I apologize for this article because I know it sounds like every other article about Bookmarks in here but I've become impatient and just want my Bookmarks back in place. It's like a wild goose chase with this issue. </p>",windows-7;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-920;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1448475;,agoldenstatewarrior
