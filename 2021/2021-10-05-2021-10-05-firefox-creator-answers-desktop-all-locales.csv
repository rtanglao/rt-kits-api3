On Google Chrome, one of the google accounts I am signed into has the domain of the institution I attend (i.e. username@school.edu), and when I am signed into, say, Google Drive or Gmail, the profile icon would look like the first image with ""The College of Science"". On Firefox, however, the same icon looks like the other image, which is the ""Broken Image Error"" image (src: <a href=""https://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/material/system/1x/broken_image_grey600_18dp.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/material/system/1x/broken_image_grey600_18dp.png</a>).

This can be fixed by using other fonts in browser's font -&gt; advanced settings, but by default result in a very poor text quality when ClearType disabled. Solution from this thread <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1269170"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1269170</a> like deleting those fonts ""AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Fonts"" seem to not work since there's no such fonts. When ClearType enabled back, font immedeately changes to a perfectly smooth one, but since I have unusual RWBG pixel structure it looks quite bad with ClearType. So I either stuck with alternative fonts or eye-straining pixelated fonts without ClearType on Windows. Interestingly, this doesn't look to affect other browsers. I believe it's a bug but maybe I'm missing something. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1448640;1448644;1448648;,dantaeusb

The same thing happens when I switch tabs from one video and switch back to the video playback tab. </p><p>I've eliminated internet connection speeds (tried in three different locations with two different computers) as a potential issue, tried tweaking multiple settings in the about:config section, enabled/disabled various windows services and enabled/disabled hardware acceleration and tried safe mode with all extensions disabled.  This issue does not happen in Chrome or Edge on either of my two machines.  This is purely isolated to Firefox. </p><p>I've tried every fix I could find with no resolution.  I love Mozilla and the what the company stands for and would love to continue using the product, but the constant crackling as I'm trying to learn new skills is on the verge of driving me crazy.  It would seem that such a fundamental HTML5 concept as video playback would be well tested and well engineered in Firefox, but as I mentioned, I'm seeing the same issue on multiple machines in multiple environments. </p><p>Any additional help anyone has to offer would be much appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1448517;,ork+moz
