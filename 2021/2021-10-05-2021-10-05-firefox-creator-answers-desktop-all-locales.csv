I followed some old post I found regaridng this isssue and nothign is working. I am using customized shortcuts for Cut, Copy, Paste and find similar cu the keyboard shortcut on Windows PC Ctr+C, Ctr+V. These shortcut are working for all other applications including Safari and Chrome. None of them is working fro Firefox. I need to use CMD+C, CMD+V and so on. I do not have any language packs added except the primary English US. This is the main reason why I am not using Firefox for the most part. I reinstalled the appliaiton af ew times, I have created a secodn profile on MAC and Firefox, I start in refresh mode, issue is still there. Any solution to this issue? </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-920;firefox-9201;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",john.minea
