Is there a way to keep a tab muted but not show this icon? This is actually the default functionality on Chrome and I believe this is much better design. </p><p>This is because the muted tabs are usually my pinned tabs, and these tabs are small when pinned. So when I go to click them I more often than not inadvertently click the mute icon and end up unmuting it, when I actually want to select the tab. Things like Rocketchat, Emails, things I use the most but also are usually work related and would be very annoying if I had unmuted. </p><p>If there's no way I really hope this can be a option, whether to show or hide the mute icon. </p><p>PS: Btw it's important to show which tabs are making sound, but I don't think I've ever thought to myself I really wish I had sound from ""x"" tab, but I wonder which one is muted.

I've tried to use tools which view FF history independently to double-check it's not just the browser and yep - there's nothing older than exactly current date minus half a year. Anything older than that is completely missing.
