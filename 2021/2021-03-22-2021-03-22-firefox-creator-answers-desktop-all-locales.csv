Last tab is October 2020 and then nothing. It was there just a week ago and now it's gone. What's more importantly - with it gone all the browsing info older than October of the last year, and there were a lot of important data. Questions: a) Could it be restored, given that I didn't delete nor did I modify the places.sqlite file? I mean I'm not sure it keeps its revisions history, right? b) Any ideas why did it happen? (And how to prevent it from happening in the future) I mean it's not like there's no history older than six month, it's the entire tab missing completely, that's what puzzling me. I've tried to use tools which view FF history independently to double-check it's not just the browser and yep - there's nothing older than exactly current date minus half a year. Anything older than that is completely missing. On a side note, I really hope FF will implement browsing history export in HTML or TXT; Right now it's just bookmarks and it's a bit inconvenient. </p><p>FF version: 86.0.1 (64-bit) </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,1400400;1400465;,Altervan
