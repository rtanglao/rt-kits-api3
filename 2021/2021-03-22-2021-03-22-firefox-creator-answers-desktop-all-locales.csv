Yesterday i had a problem with my OS linux,and i had to reinstall the system,while i was pretty sure i had all bookmarks saved in an external HD i went straight to a quick format and reinstall of the OS,after installed all the due system update. </p><p>The Problem: </p><p>While i was importing the bookmarks.html i stored in external HD i noticed that nothing was being added in the bookmarks of Firefox,so i tried few times just in case i was doing something wrong but still nothing was being added in the bookmarks,so i tried to import the bookmarks on Tor Browser and the same thing happened nothing was imported. So it came to my mind that the .html file could've been damaged. Now i tried many ways to open the file either in command line or text editor i even tried using libreoffice,in the case of text editor,command line such gedit,pico,nano it loaded the file but it was heavily encrypted,in the case  of libreoffice shortly after i tried to open the file popped up a message telling me that the file was corrupted and libreoffice couldn't read it and stopped. </p><p>I need a solution to either fix the .html file or decrypt it so i can recover the web addresses inside and it would be very bad for me since my bookmarks.html is 3.3Mb large with ALOT of bookmarks inside. </p><p>Can anybody tell me how to? </p><p>Thank you in advance for any help or suggestion that may help me to retrieve my bookmarks. Ludo. </p><p>P.S. OS Linux BackBox 7 up to date along with it latest version of Firefox that update server provides me. </p>",linux;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-860;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1400381;,zmikymiky1976

The Win 7 install was getting unstable and I was getting blue screen crashes a couple of times a week.  I suppose it's possible it was Firefox related, but Firefox seemed to work OK. </p><p>Since the upgrade, Firefox has been unstable in a very odd way I haven't seen before.  I've been using Firefox and its predecessor Netscape since 1995 when I was using a beta version of Netscape. </p><p>Sometimes Firefox will crash and then refuse to restart, but most of the time the problem is I can get it to restart, but then if I close Firefox and try to reopen it, it will refuse to restart.  If I copy over a backed up profile it will usually start at least once and may run OK for a couple of days.  But when it crashes, I can't get it going again without copying over a backed up profile.  Though that can be hit and miss too.  Sometimes a backed up copy that worked before won't work, but another backup will. </p><p>When I upgraded I was on, I think 70.0 esr, but I upgraded to 78.8.0 esr (both 32 bit) trying to get it stable again.  I tried installing 78.8.0 esr x64 and i was able to quit and restart, but it crashed and refused to restart a few hours later. </p><p>I tried Safe Mode and it starts in Safe Mode, even with a bad profile, but when I turn off all add-ins in Safe Mode and try to start normally, it won't start if it's not starting.  Hardware Acceleration is off (it's been off the entire time). </p><p>On the most recent crash I deleted the profile that crashed copied over the last working profile files, but it still wouldn't start.  I then went back to the Win 7 installation profile, copied over the crashes and datareporting directories of the profile and it started.   </p><p>I've tried copying small pieces at different crashes and copying over something that worked the time before sometimes works, and sometimes doesn't. </p><p>Has anybody ever seen a problem like this one?  And if so did they manage to fix it? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;bsod;firefox-780;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1400377;1400379;1400380;,wdolson
