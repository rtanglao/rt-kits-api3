Why have any information at all, then? Why not just have a blank page with a download button? As in, if you don't already know all about Firefox, then you don't want it? But maybe I want information about a browser before I download it -- you tantalize me with fragments but you don't let me see it.  WTF!   There are already download buttons on the landing page.  Maybe you don't want to frustrate people so that they give up on Firefox because they don't trust ANYBODY WHO CAN'T DESIGN A DOWNLOAD PAGE THAT IS ACTUALLY READABLE! </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1446728;1446739;1446744;1446748;,ramsdells
