Request logs provided.","<p><strong>SHORT SUMMARY:</strong> </p><p>A few specific direct downloads from a third-party server successfully finish in Regular browsing mode but fail half-way in Incognito mode. This is reproducable on numerous tries and persists between Firefox restarts, system reboots, and ISP changes. This difference between Regular and Incognito remains even when the requests that the browser sends are fully word-for-word identical, down to the DNT=1 in the request. There are no issues with downloads in Google Chrome on the same machine, and similarly no issues in Incognito mode an old ESR Firefox (v52) on a really old laptop with WinXP. This problem ONLY appears in Firefox 92. <strong> </strong> ========================================<strong> </strong> </p><p><strong>FULL DETAILS:</strong> </p><p>I'm using the latest public release of Firefox, 92.0.1, on Windows 8. I have a habit of using Incognito mode most of the time, and I found out that certain downloads fail in Incognito tabs - but succeed in Regular tabs. A few examples: </p><p><a href=""http://down.360safe.com/cse/360cse_official.exe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://down.360safe.com/cse/360cse_official.exe</a>  <a href=""http://down.360safe.com/cse/360cse_9.5.0.122.exe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://down.360safe.com/cse/360cse_9.5.0.122.exe</a>  <a href=""http://down.360safe.com/cse/360cse_9.5.0.114.exe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://down.360safe.com/cse/360cse_9.5.0.114.exe</a>  <a href=""http://down.360safe.com/cse/360cse_9.0.1.162.exe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://down.360safe.com/cse/360cse_9.0.1.162.exe</a>  </p><p>They are direct links to the .exe setups of various versions of an obscure browser called 360 Extreme Browser, recommended for use with WinXP on obsolete hardware since it's supposedly very lightweight. You can run them through VirusTotal if you want. The first link always points to the latest release, the other links are specific releases. </p><p>When I open any of them, I am first presented with the regular download dialog box, while Firefox automatically starts downloading the file to %TEMP% in the background, without waiting for my decision (as it always does): </p><p><a href=""https://i.imgur.com/0D6pH4Z.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/0D6pH4Z.png</a>  </p><p>... then, a couple seconds later, I'm presented with the ""source file could not be read"" error. </p><p><a href=""https://i.imgur.com/3f6StGQ.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/3f6StGQ.png</a>  </p><p>When I click OK, the first dialog box also disappears, and there is no trace of the (failed) download left in the download widget in the top right. </p><p>Alternatively, I can try to be very fast, and as soon as the first dialog box appears, I can quickly click ""Save File"" and press Enter in the folder selection window that appears. That way, I can confirm the download before it gets a chance to fail. But it fails anyway, except this time I can see the incomplete file in my destination folder, and the failed download in the list of downloads in the top right corner of Firefox. This download fails about 5-15 MBs into the file - it's different between different attempts. </p><p>It is my understanding that the ""nature"" or ""mechanism"" of the fail is the same, but if it happens while it's downloading to %TEMP% and I haven't selected the folder yet, then I'm presented with an explicit error message and there is no trace of it in the download history, and if it happens when I've already selected the folder, then there is no explicit error message and the failed download is displayed in the download history. </p><p>In the latter case, I can then press ""Retry download"" in the download history. Then, the download will successfully restart (not from zero, but from the percentage that it failed at) and will successfully complete. But the FIRST try, initiated by the tab (""by the page""?) and not by the ""download history"" widget in the corner, ALWAYS fails at some point between 5-15 MBs. </p><p><strong>========================================</strong> </p><p><strong>INVESTIGATION AND LOGS AND LOTS OF TECHNICAL DETAILS</strong> </p><p>So you might say, that third-party server is acting weird and is probably misconfigured. But: </p> <ul><li> This download ALWAYS SUCCEEDS without any problems in Regular (not Incognito) tabs. It ALWAYS FAILS in Incognito. </li><li> This download ALWAYS SUCCEEDS in Google Chrome that I have on this same machine, both in Regular and in Incognito. </li><li> This download ALWAYS SUCCEEDS in Firefox 52.9 ESR on a really obsolete laptop with WinXP that I have, connected to the same network(s), both in Regular and in Incognito. </li></ul> <p>To sum up, this fails VERY SPECIFICALLY in Incognito mode in Firefox 92 (current modern version) and NOWHERE ELSE. </p><p>All download attempts that are successful (non-Incognito FF 92, Google Chrome, FF 52.9 ESR...) result in a downloaded file with the same correct size and checksum. The download that is successfully RESTARTED after failing in Incognito (read details above) also results in a file with the same size and checksum. </p><p>I am not aware of any software on this machine that would be interrupting the download, such as antivirus. In any case, it's interrupted when it reaches a different random size on each different attempt, and it only affects Incognito Firefox and nothing else - not Regular tabs of FF and not Chrome. I have also tried two different ISPs - one that provides me with Ethernet at my place, and my mobile phone ISP. Same behavior between them. The only third-party plugin that I have in Firefox is uBlock. I disabled it completely and this didn't change anything. </p><p>I've inspected the requests and responses, using Firefox's own dev tools. </p><p><strong>REGULAR TAB (not incognito) = SUCCESSFUL DOWNLOAD</strong> </p><p>GET 	<a href=""http://down.360safe.com/cse/360cse_9.5.0.122.exe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://down.360safe.com/cse/360cse_9.5.0.122.exe</a> </p><p>GET /cse/360cse_9.5.0.122.exe HTTP/1.1 Host: <a href=""http://down.360safe.com"" rel=""nofollow"">down.360safe.com</a> User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; Win64; x64; rv:92.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/92.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Connection: keep-alive Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 </p><p>Response: </p><p>HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Tue, 28 Sep 2021 06:38:12 GMT Content-Type: application/octet-stream Content-Length: 45846432 Connection: keep-alive Expires: Tue, 28 Sep 2021 06:48:12 GMT Last-Modified: Fri, 02 Feb 2018 12:20:52 GMT Cache-Control: max-age=600 ETag: ""5a7457a4-2bb8fa0"" KCS-Via: REVALIDATED from w-f03.lato;MISS from back-f01.dl.lato;REVALIDATED from w-subsrc02.lato;MISS from back-subsrc01.dl.lato K-Cache-status: MISS Accept-Ranges: bytes </p><p><strong>INCOGNITO TAB: FAILED DOWNLOAD</strong> </p><p>GET 	<a href=""https://down.360safe.com/cse/360cse_9.5.0.122.exe"" rel=""nofollow"">https://down.360safe.com/cse/360cse_9.5.0.122.exe</a> &lt;- notice the forced switch to HTTPS, caused by Incognito mode </p><p>GET /cse/360cse_9.5.0.122.exe HTTP/1.1 Host: <a href=""http://down.360safe.com"" rel=""nofollow"">down.360safe.com</a> User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; Win64; x64; rv:92.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/92.0 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br DNT: 1 Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 Connection: keep-alive Sec-Fetch-Dest: document Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate Sec-Fetch-Site: none Sec-Fetch-User:Â ?1 </p><p>Response: </p><p>HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Tue, 28 Sep 2021 06:40:54 GMT Content-Type: application/octet-stream Content-Length: 45846432 Connection: keep-alive Expires: Tue, 28 Sep 2021 06:50:54 GMT Last-Modified: Fri, 02 Feb 2018 12:20:52 GMT Cache-Control: max-age=600 ETag: ""5a7457a4-2bb8fa0"" KCS-Via: REVALIDATED from w-f01.lato;MISS from back-f01.dl.lato;REVALIDATED from w-subsrc01.lato K-Cache-status: MISS Accept-Ranges: bytes </p><p><strong>The differences are: Incognito mode forces HTTPS, sends Sec-Fetch- entries in the GET request, and also sends DNT = 1.
