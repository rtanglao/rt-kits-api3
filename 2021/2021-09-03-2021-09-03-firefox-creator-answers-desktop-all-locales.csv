I have security set to medium, as I have had it for several years now. All of a sudden, when I go to some sites (~70% of the time), it tells me that it cannot connect to a secure site, and do I want connect to the “HTTP: site or not. <em>This happens with little known sites like <a href=""https://www.usps.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usps.gov</a>, <a href=""https:/www.amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https:/www.amazon.com</a>, and, oh yes, </em><a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/</a>.<em> </em> </p><p>Also EVERY time I try and go to <a href=""https://www.Google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.Google.com</a>, I get a message that says,  </p><p><strong>“Secure Connection Failed</strong> An error occurred during a connection to <a href=""http://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.google.com</a>. PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR </p><pre>   The page you are trying to view cannot be shown because the authenticity of the received data could not be verified.    Please contact the website owners to inform them of this problem.” </pre> <p>Also, whenever I go from a page to another in a different tab, or separately, it takes between 15-20 seconds up to a couple of MINUTES. </p><p>I have to use Microsoft’s horrible (to ME) EDGE program, which does all of the above WITHOUT PROBLEMS, and almost instantly! I have removed Firefox (ALWAYS the latest version) several times, and have even edited the registry to rid it of any Mozilla remnants.  Install a new copy. SAME THING even without loading logins or bookmarks! </p><p>PLEEEEEZE help!

I am using Windows 10 OS and Microsoft Outlook for emails. </p><p>When presented with the dialog box for downloading/saving a file, can Firefox directly attach the downloaded file to a blank email using my email client? </p><p>I have done a one-line batch file (which seems to work with ""open with"") that has the command: </p><p>""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\outlook.exe"" /a %1 </p><p>and it seems to work, but is there an official or quicker solution?   one that doesn't have to involve browsing for the batch file (having to type * or *.* to not show only .exe/.com files) with the ""open with"" option?   </p><p>Alternatively is there a right-click context menu with a ""send to"" or ""email to"" that opens the email client and a blank email with the downloaded file already attached?
