I am using Windows 10 OS and Microsoft Outlook for emails. </p><p>When presented with the dialog box for downloading/saving a file, can Firefox directly attach the downloaded file to a blank email using my email client? </p><p>I have done a one-line batch file (which seems to work with ""open with"") that has the command: </p><p>""C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\root\Office16\outlook.exe"" /a %1 </p><p>and it seems to work, but is there an official or quicker solution?   one that doesn't have to involve browsing for the batch file (having to type * or *.* to not show only .exe/.com files) with the ""open with"" option?   </p><p>Alternatively is there a right-click context menu with a ""send to"" or ""email to"" that opens the email client and a blank email with the downloaded file already attached?  (Or possibly there is a mailto or sendto command that can be selected in ""open with""?) </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",nicolaschen
