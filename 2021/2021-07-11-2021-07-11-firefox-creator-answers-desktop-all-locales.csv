In the last 2 months I have weird memory leaks. I have two users on my PC and it happens only on one of them. It doesn't matter how many tabs are open and it can happen after 1 min or half an hour (so it's not consistent). When I have not tabs it seems to be OK. </p><p>Already tried disabling all the extensions and also launched in safe mode but nothing solved it. The only thing that worked is resetting FF but after a few weeks the issue is back again. When it starts to hang the window becomes unresponsive and I can see the memory usage soaring until I kill the process. I have no clue where to start debugging the issue after trying to disable extensions and resetting. Any help would be appreciated.
