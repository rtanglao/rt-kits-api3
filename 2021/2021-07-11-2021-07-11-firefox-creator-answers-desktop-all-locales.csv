The problem is most of the sites I use most often are remaining at 100% zoom, and therefore their font size is not changing when I change the default in my settings. Another site I'm often on is set to 85% zoom for ?? reasons?? and stays stuck there no matter what I do. I thought these were problems with the Fixed Zoom extension, but I've disabled that extension and the problems haven't gone away. (And the problem I got that extension to fix in the first place, in which dw-news dot dreamwidth dot org and dw-beta dot dreamwidth dot org and every single user or community on dreamwidth dot org are all apparently different sites and I want to be able to set the correct zoom for all of Dreamwidth *once*, is of course back.) How do I clear out the site-by-site zoom settings so everything goes back to default zoom? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",alexconall
