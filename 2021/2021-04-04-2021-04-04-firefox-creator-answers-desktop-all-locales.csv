My browser is set to forget history when I close it so now, every time I open the browser my addons are gone from the bar. When I check them in add-ons they are all there but none is working/active. For all these years I had the Firefox browser(windows) I never had an issue. I have manually for so many times: - disabled/enabled addons one by one.  - Tried ruling out buggy addons. - refreshed the browser (most times without a success). -&gt; The only thing that seems to do the trick is completely re-installing the browser with removing all residue folders prior to that. And signing in to sync the account. But this is only a temporary solution as when I clear the history its all gone again and the merry-go-around starts again.  Ironically I never had Facebook container working in Firefox but now suddenly its working - that is when addons are back. I installed a new ssd with clean os installation last night, however, the very same issue was happening on my previous Firefox installation on previous ssd. I have simply no clue as to what is happening here. Anyone else experiencing this? I mean this is extremely annoying and as much as I dislike Chrome I might need to go back there. I really liked how Firefox worked up until two-three days ago.
