There are no issues loading the video, but shortly afterwards the image freezes while the sound continues. Google chrome works fine, and Firefox is able to play the same videos correctly on my Windows 8 PC. It also seems to only affect newer videos. Any help would be appreciated. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-920;firefox-9201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",talkltalk
