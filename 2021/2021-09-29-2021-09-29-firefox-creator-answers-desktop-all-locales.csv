So far as I'm aware, my version was up to date as of yesterday or so. </p><p>When I reopened Firefox after the crash, I checked the About menu item which said that Firefox needed to be restarted to be updated. Doing so disabled the program and I cannot open it. </p><p>So I downloaded the installer thinking that I'd have to do a clean install. When I ran ""Firefox Installer.exe"", it said that Firefox needed to be updated and said it would do that. I have tried that twice now, and both times the updater got about 75% through and just died. I still cannot access Firefox and when I try to run it through the Start/Run menu, I get a message saying that ""Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You many not have the appropriate permissions to access the item"". I have tried looking in C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox and can see firefox.exe, but it will not run and gives me the same ""Windows cannot access..."" complaint. I tried running it as administrator, and got the same complaint. </p><p>I have copied the contents of install.log into the troubleshooting information area below on this page. I tried to copy installation telemetry.json into the same form, but it wouldn't paste into the box and opened a new tab instead. </p><p>At this moment, I don't see a way around doing a clean install. That will be a pain in the ass as I had a lot of context open, and would rather not have to reconstruct that, but I see no choice at this moment. </p><p>Any suggestions that you have will be greatly appreciated. </p><p>Greg </p> <ul><li><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li><ul><li> </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> <p>While attempting to do a clean install, I started to uninstall Firefox and was given a message saying something like ""Firefox must be restarted complete an update."" I tried to cancel the uninstall but could see no way of doing so. I closed the control panel item and I restarted my computer. Firefox came back up and now says that it's up to date. </p><p>Perhaps the installer really was finished but neglected to tell me a restart of the computer was required. I'm quite certain that no such message was given and Task Manager told me that the installer was no longer running after what appeared to be two failed attempts to update Firefox. </p><p>I'm still confused by what happened, but am happy to report I can now drive on (93 minutes later) and my context wasn't lost. ;-) </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1447127;,greghill
