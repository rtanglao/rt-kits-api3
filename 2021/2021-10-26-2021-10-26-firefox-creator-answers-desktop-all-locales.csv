Now Firefox looks so ugly. I suppose I'll go back to old Opera and never update anymore.

I have no clue of what is going on, but whatever you are doing is going overboard indeed. Your solutions DO NOT WORK PERIOD. and who needs the aggravation of trying this or that (to no avail by the way) when there is already so much aggravation to go around in the world as it is. Well this is what I had to say. and I will look into transferring all I have saved in Firefox back into Chrome. So google spies on people....
