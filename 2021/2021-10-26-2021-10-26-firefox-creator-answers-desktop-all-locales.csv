I tried the suggested solutions to no avail. These are regular sites, AAA site to change my address... nope no go. I opened the page on Chrome without a glitch. A government site for the Global Entry application... nope that neither. And many other sites that are NORMAL without any weird anything, just blocked and nothing works at all. I am afraid I will just go back to Chrome, as it is very inconvenient to keep switching for this or that. I am glad I didn't just delete Chrome at all, and left it on my phone as well. I have no clue of what is going on, but whatever you are doing is going overboard indeed. Your solutions DO NOT WORK PERIOD. and who needs the aggravation of trying this or that (to no avail by the way) when there is already so much aggravation to go around in the world as it is. Well this is what I had to say. and I will look into transferring all I have saved in Firefox back into Chrome. So google spies on people.... I got nothing relevant to hide and who knows maybe you do too. Well then, good bye, so long. Don't fault me for giving up, you did not listen to people one bit.

(attached) I think I am going to have to uninstall then reinstall the browser to fix it, but not happy about this, and do not understand why this would happen. Can someone explain this stupidity to me please?? <strong>Thanks in advance!!</strong> </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-930;,firefox,other,en-US,1453895;1453900;,zlloyd2
