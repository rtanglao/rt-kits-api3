I tend to get the disk image, which populates on my screen as an image icon. This usually occurs several times before I see the actual application file within my download files. Tonight I am having this problem again, as I noticed that the browser was no longer on my computer, which prompted me to download again from Mozilla's own site. However, I keep getting the disk image, with a circle and cross through the circle over the actual firefox icon which is supposed to be dragged into the folder and then installed. Not sure why it keeps showing up as an image (disk), and not the actual application? Any assistance will be greatly appreciated. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",careny.graham
