Also, I can't add that email as secondary, as I get error: ""This email was already verified by another user"". </p><p>Issue 1: I have 2 email addresses that I use, Yahoo and Gmail, and I started migrating all accounts from Yahoo to Gmail. I forgot if I had any Mozilla account, so I tried to reset the password on both accounts: - on Yahoo I was able to do so - on Gmail I cannot, receiving this error: ""Primary account email required for reset"". Problem is I don't remember what other email address I might have used as primary.  Furthermore, if I had lost access to my primary email, shouldn't I been able to reset the password using the secondary email? This should be the whole logic behind backup email address. </p><p>Issue 2: As I want to stop using the Yahoo email address, in the account where I managed to login with Yahoo email, I tried adding the Gmail email as secondary email, in order to make it the primary one. But when I try to do that, I receive this error: ""This email was already verified by another user"". So I was thinking on logging in that account where I used my Gmail as secondary email, but I can't do that unfortunately, as described at Issue 1. </p><p>So, do you have any thoughts? My main objective is to have an Mozilla account using my Gmail email address as my primary one. I don't have any data to sync/recover, so I am ok with a solution based on deleting both accounts, and creating one using my Gmail email address. </p><p>Thank you very much!

I only occasionally view Twitter using my laptop and I use my email address and a password to log in. When I clicked in the field that reads ""Phone, user name or email"" I expected to see the Firefox autofill to show my email address, but instead it shows the name ""Farha Hussain"" (see screenshot image).  </p><p>I checked my Firefox preferences for Saved Logins and I have my email address and password for Twitter saved there, but no mention of Farha Hussain (my name is Keith). I tried other websites to see if I could recreate the issue and couldn't. I visited the Twitter login form using Chrome and Safari and neither suggested Farha Hussain as a user name, so I think that this is something specific to Firefox on the Twitter website.  </p><p>To make this an even more unusual situation, the only ""Farha Hussain"" that I know is a doctor in my city who I have been meaning to contact to see if she is accepting patients, but haven't yet done so. Her name is in my Mac Calendar and that's the only place I can think of on my computer (not in contacts or anywhere else). How this would be connected to a Twitter login is beyond my understanding.  </p><p>Let me know if you would like additional information or screenshots. </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-940;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1461293;1461416;,keith83
