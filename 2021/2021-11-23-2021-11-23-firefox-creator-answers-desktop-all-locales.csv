Also, I can't add that email as secondary, as I get error: ""This email was already verified by another user"". </p><p>Issue 1: I have 2 email addresses that I use, Yahoo and Gmail, and I started migrating all accounts from Yahoo to Gmail. I forgot if I had any Mozilla account, so I tried to reset the password on both accounts: - on Yahoo I was able to do so - on Gmail I cannot, receiving this error: ""Primary account email required for reset"". Problem is I don't remember what other email address I might have used as primary.  Furthermore, if I had lost access to my primary email, shouldn't I been able to reset the password using the secondary email? This should be the whole logic behind backup email address. </p><p>Issue 2: As I want to stop using the Yahoo email address, in the account where I managed to login with Yahoo email, I tried adding the Gmail email as secondary email, in order to make it the primary one. But when I try to do that, I receive this error: ""This email was already verified by another user"". So I was thinking on logging in that account where I used my Gmail as secondary email, but I can't do that unfortunately, as described at Issue 1. </p><p>So, do you have any thoughts? My main objective is to have an Mozilla account using my Gmail email address as my primary one. I don't have any data to sync/recover, so I am ok with a solution based on deleting both accounts, and creating one using my Gmail email address. </p><p>Thank you very much!

I only occasionally view Twitter using my laptop and I use my email address and a password to log in.

Her name is in my Mac Calendar and that's the only place I can think of on my computer (not in contacts or anywhere else).

I tend to get the disk image, which populates on my screen as an image icon. This usually occurs several times before I see the actual application file within my download files. Tonight I am having this problem again, as I noticed that the browser was no longer on my computer, which prompted me to download again from Mozilla's own site. However, I keep getting the disk image, with a circle and cross through the circle over the actual firefox icon which is supposed to be dragged into the folder and then installed. Not sure why it keeps showing up as an image (disk), and not the actual application? Any assistance will be greatly appreciated. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1461273;1461308;,careny.graham
