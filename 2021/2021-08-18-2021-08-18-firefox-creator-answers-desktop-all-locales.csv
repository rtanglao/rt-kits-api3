That's probably going to be optimistic. I'm trying to revert the toolbar and browser style to be an exact replica of the attached image (theme not withstanding). </p><p>We surveyed around 250 users and only 2 like the new FF91 toolbar and tabs. So got to go with the 99.9% of people. The userChrome.css file I am using is here: <a href=""https://pastebin.com/8SFM3i1k"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pastebin.com/8SFM3i1k</a> </p><p>The userContent.css is: </p><p>/* Remove color effect filter on autofilled fields */ </p> <dl><dd>-moz-autofill {filter: unset !important;} </dd></dl> <p>/* Remove filter on all fields */ input {filter: unset !important;} </p><p><br> I'm getting confused with the naming. We have Photon and is it now Proton? And what I'm trying to get back to is Australis? </p><p>Enabled style sheets and I can get the theme working. But when I add the chrome folder and it's contents instead of getting what you see on the attached image I get the default style with the ugly square tabs - the default in v78 </p><p>I also can't seem to stretch the toolbar vertically. It's too damned compact.  </p><p>The addons I want to use include new tab homepage, which seems to install but doesn't show in the list of add-ons and doesn't work. Perhaps I should approach the author for that issue. </p><p>The reload in the address bar works in 78.13, but in 91 it puts the reload button the on the far right... Another add-on problem for the author. </p><p>How do I remove the favorites icon from the address bar? </p><p>On webpages there is a settings cog in the top right corner. I'd also like to remove that. </p><p>I'm a PC builder, not a coder, so the css is provided by the generosity of other people. </p><p>thanks </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",citizen1138x
