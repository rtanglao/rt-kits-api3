Everything is just floating (see screenshot). Also, for example, in the search window, there is no border to the window; there should be a visible box around it. And the theme I used in previous versions (it was called Soft Aqua) seems to have disappeared. It is so frustrating to have the interface change so dramatically every few updated versions. I am a retired graphic designer, and there's a reason to have borders, colors, etc. used to help direct the eye. One shouldn't have to search through a bunch of labels floating on white space. Anyway, I'd appreciate some help. Thanks. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jmazzeo

Hence cannot e.g. change volume or choose another episode. Same issue, two different Dell desktops, two different mice (wired &amp; bluetooth). No problem with Edge or Chrome.

I had already disabled the Proton UI on this installation, because it is horrible. Today Firefox decided to update to version 91. All of the Proton UI junk is back. I tried disabling it again, but nothing worked. Doing a web search, it appears that Mozilla has disabled the ability to turn off Proton. </p><p>I then set about to rollback the installation back to version 89. I found a Mozilla link on this, went to their ftp server and downloaded the installation files for the last version of 89. The installation went normally, but when I opened Firefox afterwards, a little box popped up saying something to the effect of ""To keep your History and Bookmarks from possibly being corrupted, Firefox must create new user profile."" I exited out of this and Firefox didn't start. I attempted to restart Firefox again and the same box popped up again. The only way to get past it was to click the accept button. </p><p>I did so and Firefox started. This was clearly not version 89. As the UI is junk, it took several minutes to find out that this was now the latest version of 92!!!! I'm absolutely positive that I downloaded the correct file. When I look through the update history, it doesn't even show todays version 89 installation as happening. What a piece of junk. </p><p>I then spent 20 minutes figuring out how to revert back to my user profile, not the new one that it had created for me. I then did some research on what had happened. Well it turns out that you can't actually rollback Firefox, despite what Mozilla says. For a while they have added ""downgrade protection"" which automatically creates the new user profile and stops your old profile from being accessed by it. So unless you want to figure out how to spend a hundred hours reconstructing bookmarks, passwords, settings, etc. it actually isn't possible to rollback Firefox. Doesn't this violate some Microsoft rules about being able to uninstall versions of software from within Windows? If you try to do this with Firefox and go back to a previous version it blows everything up.  </p><p>Does anyone know how to actually rollback Firefox to a previous version, so that Proton can be disabled? </p>",desktop;beta;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1436311;1436352;1436361;1436362;1436391;,jack.hidley

Somehow it now seems to think my actual window with all my open taps is the second window that isn't meant to be sessionstored. When trying to close it, it warns me for closing tabs which it only does in 2nd and 3rd windows, not the main one, but this is my only window after closing the one telling me of the upgrade. Also, the restore previous session button disappeared, so i conclude firefox indeed thinks this is a 2nd window and not the main one and thus will discard all tabs when i close it. Any clues?
