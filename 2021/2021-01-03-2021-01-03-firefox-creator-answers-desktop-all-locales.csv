It offered me the option to, in a way, re-set itself (almost as if I unistalled it and re-installed it). I did it, and then had to re-upload my bookmarks and such. The bookmarks I was able to do with no firefox account, but for passwords, it required me to make one, so I did it quickly and easily with my gmail.  </p><p>The problem is, to import logins and passowrds, it keeps telling me to 'Go to the Sync options'  and tick the 'Logins and Passwords box' (in the about:preferences#sync page). </p><p>I do it, click the 'Syncronize now' option and then it asks me to change primary passwords. I never had one,  so it asked me instead to make one.  </p><p>No matter how many I create, even with the quality meter being full, firefox tells me they are unnable to change my primary password - which didn't even exist to begin with. So I don't know what's going on: i never had a primary password, and whenever I try to create one, firefox is unnable to do it so.  </p><p>I don't know if maybe I have to activate some other kind of autentification method unknown to me, but if so, that's just a huge headache. How many passwords and logins must I have just to import my passwords and logins? </p><p>I'm letting you all know at least of this problem, which if can be solved easily, would be nice. As someone that loved mozilla, this leaves me quite sad . I get the passion for security, but this is an headache and a waste of time honestly. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",nescorreia24

When embedded on 3rd party site after pressing play buffer icon spins for a while then throws back message with error. While 'buffering' I am able to click youtube icon to go straight to <a href=""http://youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com</a> and watch video there without any issues at all.  </p><p>In private mode - it works as intended (didn't try safe mode due to that). So I've cleared cache - an error happened. Then also cleared cookies (bit pissed off since I have to log in and set stuff back again on every site) - it helped and videos started to work again. But after not more like 2 or 3 times when it worked correctly it started to crash again. Other browsers seem to work just fine. </p><p>I've been also looking here for a resolution. Found few topics with same issue. Answers usually lead to two sites. One is reddit where main post was deleted and nothing interesting is given down bellow in the comments. Other site is a topic from 2014 saying to uninstall Flash Player.
