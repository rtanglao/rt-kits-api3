Tanto o sistema operacional quanto o navegador estão atualizados na última versão oficialmente disponível para o público, e mesmo assim o problema persiste. </p><p>O que acontece é que quando uso o tema ""Claro"" (Light) no sistema operacional, o Firefox não altera cores de fontes, então ao digitar na barra de endereço, as letras são claras e não podem ser lidas. Anexei uma screenshot para ilustrar melhor. </p><p>Outro problema que tenho, independente do tema aplicado ao sistema operacional, seja claro ou escuro, é que ao selecionar um texto qualquer com o cursor, não aparece o ""grifado"", indicando a porção do texto que foi selecionada. Isso ocorre em qualquer campo da página. Eu consigo selecionar e manipular o texto, porém sem saber com exatidão o que realmente foi selecionado. </p><p>Para que fique registrado, a única extensão de navegador que tenho instalada é a adBlock, e ela não parece ter qualquer relação com o problema. </p><p>Agradeço desde já!  </p><p>Beto. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-840;,firefox,other,pt-BR,"",betogzo
