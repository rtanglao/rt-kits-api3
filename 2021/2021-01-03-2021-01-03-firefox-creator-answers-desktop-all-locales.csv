I started having blue screen crashes and had no idea why they were happening.  Finally, I witnessed blue screen crashes while I was using the computer.  In every case, I was browsing on Firefox.  I made sure that I had the latest version of Firefox.  The crashes kept occurring.  I would leave my computer unattended with Firefox ""up"" and there would be crashes.  So, I stopped using Firefox and went to Edge or Chrome and the crashes stopped.  I did that for two weeks.  Then, I started using Firefox again and the crashes returned.  I've read across the web where people say that Firefox cannot cause a crash.  That is absolutely false.  Firefox undeniably causes my computer to crash.  Now, some have advised me to stop using Firefox.  That may be my ultimate solution, but before abandoning my favorite browser, I would like to see if there is any way to solve this issue.  By the way, I unchecked hardware acceleration as some have advised.  This did not solve the issue. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1381059;1381065;,esanford1

When you write a text like this, sfter the last letter you see a blinking line (?). Well, I see it always somewhere on my screen. There is always somwhere I need to klick and that blinking thing is always somwhere on the screen.  How can I get rid of that thing? Not a big issue but very irritating. </p><p>But my biggest biff is with recaptcha that just went mental few months ago. Normally, say if I use chrome (which I dont like), I will get an option, klick 3 pics that switch rapidly, try again and it is solved. Very fast. Now in Firefox, i click a pic, it takes forever to switch, I get like 6 tries which are ALWAYS wrong, then I get another attempt, and another, and another. No matter what I click it takes forever to change and it is always wrong. It is just killing me. </p><p>Have somethong been done in recent updates in settings? Have I changed something in settings? Can I change something to make it work again? It worked great few months ago! </p><p>I tried the usual cache and cookies cleaning. Not helping.

So I've cleared cache - an error happened. Then also cleared cookies (bit pissed off since I have to log in and set stuff back again on every site) - it helped and videos started to work again. But after not more like 2 or 3 times when it worked correctly it started to crash again. Other browsers seem to work just fine. </p><p>I've been also looking here for a resolution. Found few topics with same issue. Answers usually lead to two sites. One is reddit where main post was deleted and nothing interesting is given down bellow in the comments.
