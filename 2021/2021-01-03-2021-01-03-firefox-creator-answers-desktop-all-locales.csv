Since some time now I feel that my Firefox is kinda slower. Some websites used to open in a splitsecond, now they take a little time.  When you write a text like this, sfter the last letter you see a blinking line (?). Well, I see it always somewhere on my screen. There is always somwhere I need to klick and that blinking thing is always somwhere on the screen.  How can I get rid of that thing? Not a big issue but very irritating. </p><p>But my biggest biff is with recaptcha that just went mental few months ago. Normally, say if I use chrome (which I dont like), I will get an option, klick 3 pics that switch rapidly, try again and it is solved. Very fast. Now in Firefox, i click a pic, it takes forever to switch, I get like 6 tries which are ALWAYS wrong, then I get another attempt, and another, and another. No matter what I click it takes forever to change and it is always wrong. It is just killing me. </p><p>Have somethong been done in recent updates in settings? Have I changed something in settings? Can I change something to make it work again? It worked great few months ago! </p><p>I tried the usual cache and cookies cleaning. Not helping. I use genuine premium versions of Kaspersky and Malwarebytes. I also use glary utilities for cleaning up. </p><p>I am so sorry to bother you all with what perhaps is not an issue at all. But I would be very thankfull to you all who know how and can me help resplve these ""issues"". Big kudos and thanx!

It offered me the option to, in a way, re-set itself (almost as if I unistalled it and re-installed it). I did it, and then had to re-upload my bookmarks and such.

I never had one,  so it asked me instead to make one.  </p><p>No matter how many I create, even with the quality meter being full, firefox tells me they are unnable to change my primary password - which didn't even exist to begin with. So I don't know what's going on: i never had a primary password, and whenever I try to create one, firefox is unnable to do it so.  </p><p>I don't know if maybe I have to activate some other kind of autentification method unknown to me, but if so, that's just a huge headache. How many passwords and logins must I have just to import my passwords and logins? </p><p>I'm letting you all know at least of this problem, which if can be solved easily, would be nice. As someone that loved mozilla, this leaves me quite sad .
