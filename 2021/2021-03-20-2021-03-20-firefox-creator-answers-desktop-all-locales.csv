Nothing works. Each time I try to mark all and delete - they multiply - by doubles or triples -- and then the whole Mozilla crashes. This happened to me with Chrome, and by now I have over 50,000 chrome bookmarks. I have uninstalled chrome, installed Mozilla and it is the only online platform on my laptop now. For some odd reason, several sets of my Chrome bookmarks showed up on the Mozilla. I made sure that nothing is syncing. I still can't delete all the bookmarks. Only one by one. And if I delete one, it adds itself at the bottom of the list. I'm in deep despair. It's probably a malware that my Norton does not detect. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",smadar.lavie18
