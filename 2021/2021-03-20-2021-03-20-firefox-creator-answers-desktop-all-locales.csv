Although, my boss recently lent me a windows laptop (which brings me back in the years) and I noticed I felt borrowed I could not zoom in/out with the touchpad Ctrl+2-fingers-glide like I can do I linux and like Ctrl+mouse Wheel. I know I can Ctrl+[+/-/0] but this is a keyboard feature, and also pinch with the touchpad*, but Ctrl+2-fingers-glide seems to me the natural intuitive sister of Ctrl+Wheel and is very convenient when reading a page where scroll has yet same equivalent for both pointing devices, namely simple wheel and simple 2-fingers-glide. </p> <ul><li> this is fingersache when we have palm sat on the desktop in front of the touchpad, so this question can eventually fall in accessibility features request. Pinch is just a thing for touch-screens. </li></ul> <p>Any chance we see this feature in Windows soon or is there already a hidden feature (I already searched about:config for zoom without success). BTW, some other apps work this way : MSO, LO, GIMP etc.. both in Win &amp; nuxes for the 2 laters. </p><p>Thanks guys for years of quiet browsing. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-860;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",f0rhum
