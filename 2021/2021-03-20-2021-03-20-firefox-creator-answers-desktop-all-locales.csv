It has since been changed so that it drops the last KEYWORD from the URL and now it won't autofill and stupidly demands that I ""copy"" each of the parts of the login independently from the ""logins and passwords"" page where the URL has been wrongfully shortened.  This is on Firefox v86.0.1 that the botching of the formerly functional login retention procedure occurred.  In any event, having to bop back and forth between the login page and the ""logins and passwords"" page is stupidly requiring vastly more time than simply retyping the entire information into the actual login.

I know I can Ctrl+[+/-/0] but this is a keyboard feature, and also pinch with the touchpad*, but Ctrl+2-fingers-glide seems to me the natural intuitive sister of Ctrl+Wheel and is very convenient when reading a page where scroll has yet same equivalent for both pointing devices, namely simple wheel and simple 2-fingers-glide. </p> <ul><li> this is fingersache when we have palm sat on the desktop in front of the touchpad, so this question can eventually fall in accessibility features request. Pinch is just a thing for touch-screens. </li></ul> <p>Any chance we see this feature in Windows soon or is there already a hidden feature (I already searched about:config for zoom without success).
