It has an answer which is marked as Chosen Solution although the question owner explicitly stated it doesn't answer the question, and indeed it doesn't because it just says to look at the configuration page which doesn't contain the information. That thread has been archived. Perhaps it should be deleted or at least the Chosen Solution mark removed. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,"",tilman.schmidt
