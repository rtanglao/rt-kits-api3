Firefox tabs suddenly crash (usually media tabs with video, like Twitch or video conference sites) and I can't seem to find a solution. But most importantly, many videos or live streams show graphic artifacts. You can check it in the attached screenshot). I have tried many things to solve it, but none worked. This is what I tried: </p> <ul><li> Changing cables and monitors. </li><li> Disabling extensions and plugins. </li><li> Disabling hardware acceleration. </li><li> Installing Firefox from scratch. </li><li> Installing an old version. </li><li> Installing Nightly. </li><li> Removing the GPU. The issue persisted with a different video card and with integrated graphics. So the GPU is not the issue. </li><li> Trying using another OS. I thought my Windows install might have been corrupt, but it also happened in Ubuntu. </li><li> Trying other browsers. I tried Chrome (which resulted in the issue as well) and Edge (which surprisingly did fine, it's my only solution right now). </li></ul> <p>I would love to keep using Firefox but it's a pain to watch media like this. I don't know if the issue might be from the motherboard or another component. Between the crashes and this I can't use it normally. </p><p>I can try providing any details needed to solve the problem. Could you please help me? I don't know what else I can try. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,fix-problems,es,"",orphenkirisame

I change the password on the site, she offers to replace the existing one, I agree and save, and she asks this several times in a row, but when entering the site, the form is filled with old  data! Perhaps this is some option that I accidentally enabled? Still installed ""Spy bot&amp; Destroy"", but there were no problems with it before. But I turned on the control of profiles there (I will attach a picture). Maybe he does not allow changing saved passwords? Although I kind of turned off the control of cookies in it. I just got into the settings of Mozila and Spy in the same day and after that various problems with the browser started. Checked for viruses several times, clean. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",mr.andersan
