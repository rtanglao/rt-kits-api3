Tried to load a new adobe package (which failed), then searched on a couple sites then bam - since then Firefox hangs, does not even start to load.  No clue what happened!  What I have done to try and solve -reboot several times, Restart in safe mode, refreshed, uninstall and re-installed, turn off firewall options as instructed, Scanned entire system for Malware (Norton 360), Cleared Cached and cookies, removed Patent Lock file. Before I remove Firefox totally and move to Chrome can anyone help?  I have used Firefox for over 7 years - I don't what to move on.  I looked at troubleshooting on firefox and it states Launch Process - Disabled due to Failure.  Google answers to this point to things I have already done.  webrender-software denied by env: not on allowlist </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1399150;,cindykanwar
