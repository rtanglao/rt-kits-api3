PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR ...","<p>I am not a geek, and the documentation about this problem elsewhere in Mozilla support is way over my head.  I just need plain language - and maybe visual -  instructions on how to stop getting this error message. It never happened until a Firefox browser update a few weeks ago (September 2021).   Often if I click the 'try again' button a couple of times, I can finally get through to the website I am trying to connect to, but this shouldn't be happening.  It's annoying.  I use Avast antivirus software if that's useful info.  thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-920;firefox-9201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",sally.richman
