A third file attached to show that. </p><p>I thought about deleting Firefox and starting from scratch, so I tried to both export and backup my thousands of bookmarks, but apparently whatever is wrong won't let me do either. </p><p>I've saved bookmarks before to transfer to a new computer several times, but I can't do it now. </p><p>Thanks for any help. </p><p>Dan Prall </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",DiverDan

PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR ...","<p>I am not a geek, and the documentation about this problem elsewhere in Mozilla support is way over my head.  I just need plain language - and maybe visual -  instructions on how to stop getting this error message. It never happened until a Firefox browser update a few weeks ago (September 2021).   Often if I click the 'try again' button a couple of times, I can finally get through to the website I am trying to connect to, but this shouldn't be happening.  It's annoying.  I use Avast antivirus software if that's useful info.  thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-920;firefox-9201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",sally.richman

Is this a new ""feature,"" or is there something I can do to get this back?. I've attempted to customized the toolbar, but there doesn't appear to be the + on that or a way to open a new tab - just a new window.
