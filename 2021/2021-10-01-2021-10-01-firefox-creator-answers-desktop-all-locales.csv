I always use Firefox for my banking (currently version 92.0.1) and always the same Windows 10 home computer. I had expected that TFA would only occasionally and randomly be required in my situation. This is obviously not the case. </p><p>I finally got tired of this and called the CIBC. They told me that they were familiar with this issue and that the problem is with the Firefox browser and its apparent inability to store/keep TFA cookies. They recommended that I switch to Chrome. I have read responses from moderators on this forum to similar questions and can categorically state that I do not prevent the placement of cookies or delete them. I do, however, have the uBlock Origin extension installed for ad blocking. </p><p>I look forward to any suggestions that may resolve this issue. </p><p>Frank </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1447636;,fmourits
