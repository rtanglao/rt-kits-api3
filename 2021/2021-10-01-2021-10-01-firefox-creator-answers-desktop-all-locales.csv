I installed Metamask earlier this year and the icon was always visible on the toolbar for me to select and log in. After the update I no longer have the icon displaying. I can log into Metamask but the extension now acts like any other URL display. I liked when it would pop up as a side window and not display like a URL.  I also have ADP ad blocker and can no longer see that icon as well. Any assistance is appreciated. Regards </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,customize,en-US,1447520;,ecl3rd

I've done a reset and made sure I have the latest version but keep getting the same thing.   To reproduce the issue, you can create a new FB user and create a new page ""owned"" by that user.  If you succeed in adding a user, you cannot subsequently change their role. </p><p>I've also verified that Javascript is enabled. </p><p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions on where to look or what to try.
