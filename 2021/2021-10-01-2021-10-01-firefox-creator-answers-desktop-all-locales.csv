Moving on, using Troubleshooting Mode, I have yet to encounter any issues. The screenshot below shows the crash reports between yesterday and today. For some reason it won't let me submit the crash report from yesterday, as well as the first one that happened today. I'm also not sure why there are 4 crash reports generated for 10:05PM on 9/30, because Firefox only crashed once to my knowledge.  </p><p>Here's the submitted crash report ID's, though: bp-35800b96-f14a-488f-b94d-94fa10211001 bp-ad3476ee-2ceb-4de1-a824-a49a90211001 bp-94812bc3-6e24-4454-a479-a6fc70211001 bp-a238a0fc-37f9-4b5c-b883-eb2cb0211001 </p><p>And the ""Failed"" Unsubmitted crash reports: b8ab5181-c940-4177-ad4b-00ef7b99f84a be5771aa-ccc2-423b-b94e-5acbd65ec765 </p><p>Typically I have these extensions installed, and I've never had an issue thus far: 1. uBlock Origin (also in incognito) 2. Adguard Adblocker (also in incognito) 3. Honey 4. Translate Web Pages (though it's left disabled, unless needed) </p><p>Why do I use two adblockers? Because one or the other isn't typically sufficient, and I find those two to work together the best.  </p><p>Any help would be appreciated.

Often if I click the 'try again' button a couple of times, I can finally get through to the website I am trying to connect to, but this shouldn't be happening.  It's annoying.
