I was quite a bit shocked. Got everything done to get away from google services, build my complete online infrastructure upon mozillas suites, mailadresses on relay, and generally FOSS Apps and Software. </p><p>I have some questions: - for what specific reason firefox is making the calls? - which data will be transmitted? - how can I block this ""feature"" entirely in Firefox? </p><p>Any answers from the developing team would be highly appreciated! </p><p>-- ...and lbnl my opinion: Firefox is/was <em>the</em> Alternative to google to me. So the reason I am using it, is to fight against google and the capitalism conquoring the internet. My thinking is therefore quite a bit black and white. I'm really considering to use another browser because of this hidden google Calls. I mean, even if its only to update the blacklists of URLs, there is absolutely no need to make this Calls in idle state, while the user isn't doing anything. And now I'm thinking what you guys are might calling for hosts in other apps? I mean this is shit. To advertise against occupying the internet in the fight for taking back control, and then you collaborate with the enemy. Maybe I'm completely wrong, but this feels more disturbing than anything else these days. </p><p>And if you share my IP on a regular basis with a google host, could YOU be sure, that these requests will not be registered and merged with other meta about myself? When Firefox is sending my IP to this google-Host, right before I was checking a page wich is using recaptchas, it could might be an very easy task to match this both IPs and further combine it with the rest of my metadata. Logically there is no reason for google to separate ""the collection of data"" and assumingly they are already using this massive amount of IP-Connectiondata in some way. </p><p>B. </p><p>PS: here you have the answer to the question, if this service is cross-product: ""<em>Safe Browsing protections work across Google products and power <strong>safer browsing experiences</strong> across the Internet</em>."" - the Head says: ""Keeping over four Billion Devices safer. <em>*shiver*</em> </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-780;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",B33zle

And a helpful instruction tells you permissible characters.  But if you attempt save the change, you get an error message. </p><p>The other Q&amp;A posts say that you can't, in fact, change your Username.  If so, why doesn't the Edit Profile page say so?  Why does it mislead you into attempting to change your Username? </p><p>Also, the note under the Username textbox says, ""Keep in mind that your username is visible to the public.""  So, if your e-mail includes some form of your personal name, and that name becomes your username by default (which happened to me), and you never notice this, you get exposed (such as by posting a query here)?  But in fact, the ""Keep in mind..."" instruction isn't fully true.  As one of the other Q&amp;A posts says, if you choose a display name (which is blank until you add one), your username is NOT exposed.  But the Edit Profile page doesn't tell you this. </p><p>So, the whole Username portion of the Edit Profile page is very misleading.  It needs to be clarified.  And, when you sign up for Firefox, you should be given an opportunity to choose a unique username.  Mine was forced on me in the background, apparently. </p>",desktop;other;escalate;windows-10;admin;verificationemail;firefox-920;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jay_thomas

When Firefox v. 92.0 self-installed on Sept 7, 2020, the menubar/tabs color reverted to Firefox's default, a dull gray.   </p><p>System Theme in Add-ons Manager &gt; Themes is still enabled. </p><p>How do I get Firefox to partake of the Windows system theme again? </p><p>This has happened before when Firefox updated, although it doesn't happen EVERY time.  The last time it happened, I recall being able to find a simple about:config adjustment on Google (not on this site), but I can't find it now.  (As I recall, it was an about:config item that didn't sound like it would affect the menubar color, but it did.) </p><p>I have another laptop on which I rushed to disable automatic updates, so Firefox on that laptop still shows the system color.  Is there a file in the Profiles folder I could copy into the problem computer that would restore the theme color setting? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",jay_thomas

I use Win2Pdf as my printer and have never had problems.  Over the past couple of days FF has printed one webpage okay but it hangs when moving to preview on any subsequent webpage.  Rebooting FF is the only solution I have found but the new boot only prints the one webpage and hangs on subsequent pages.  This means that I have to reboot FF every time I want to print a webpage - something of a PITA. </p><p>I have re-installed FF (92.0 64-bit) and run through the troubleshooting options.  No improvement. </p><p>What's the hangup?  How do I fix it? </p>,desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",vagulus
