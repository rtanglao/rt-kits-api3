And a helpful instruction tells you permissible characters.  But if you attempt save the change, you get an error message. </p><p>The other Q&amp;A posts say that you can't, in fact, change your Username.  If so, why doesn't the Edit Profile page say so?  Why does it mislead you into attempting to change your Username? </p><p>Also, the note under the Username textbox says, ""Keep in mind that your username is visible to the public.""  So, if your e-mail includes some form of your personal name, and that name becomes your username by default (which happened to me), and you never notice this, you get exposed (such as by posting a query here)?  But in fact, the ""Keep in mind..."" instruction isn't fully true.  As one of the other Q&amp;A posts says, if you choose a display name (which is blank until you add one), your username is NOT exposed.  But the Edit Profile page doesn't tell you this. </p><p>So, the whole Username portion of the Edit Profile page is very misleading.  It needs to be clarified.  And, when you sign up for Firefox, you should be given an opportunity to choose a unique username.  Mine was forced on me in the background, apparently. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jay_thomas

I forgot I had previously signed up and in the process of trying to signup again I erred and put my age as ""1.""  Now that I've discovered my old username and password it won't let me sign in because I don't meet age requirements. (I'm 63.)

When Firefox v. 92.0 self-installed on Sept 7, 2020, the menubar/tabs color reverted to Firefox's default, a dull gray.   </p><p>System Theme in Add-ons Manager &gt; Themes is still enabled. </p><p>How do I get Firefox to partake of the Windows system theme again? </p><p>This has happened before when Firefox updated, although it doesn't happen EVERY time.  The last time it happened, I recall being able to find a simple about:config adjustment on Google (not on this site), but I can't find it now.  (As I recall, it was an about:config item that didn't sound like it would affect the menubar color, but it did.) </p><p>I have another laptop on which I rushed to disable automatic updates, so Firefox on that laptop still shows the system color.  Is there a file in the Profiles folder I could copy into the problem computer that would restore the theme color setting? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",jay_thomas

I use Win2Pdf as my printer and have never had problems.  Over the past couple of days FF has printed one webpage okay but it hangs when moving to preview on any subsequent webpage.  Rebooting FF is the only solution I have found but the new boot only prints the one webpage and hangs on subsequent pages.  This means that I have to reboot FF every time I want to print a webpage - something of a PITA. </p><p>I have re-installed FF (92.0 64-bit) and run through the troubleshooting options.  No improvement. </p><p>What's the hangup?  How do I fix it? </p>,desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",vagulus

Same happens for the drop down menu and in the settings window. I have all extensions disabled, still nothing happens when I click the sign in button. Perhaps it is a problem with multiple profiles because sign in works when I open Firefox to my alternate profile. I would like to sign in to Firefox through my default profile.
