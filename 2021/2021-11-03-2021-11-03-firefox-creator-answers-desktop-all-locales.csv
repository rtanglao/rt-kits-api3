It has now been replaced by a Firefox opening page with a pinkish background hue that shows icons for a bunch of different web sites - including one for Outlook Mail (which will open Outlook Mail, but I don't want the inconvenience of having to access it this way), plus it also shows a bunch of Pocket web sites as well.  I would like to restore Outlook Mail as my previous opening home page.  Thank you for your help. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-940;,firefox,other,en-US,"",quig

I am able to load most articles there normally, but some, marked with a 'live' button for certain types of rapidly updated topics (e.g. election day vote updates or the like) won't load. <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/11/02/us/election-news?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-elections-2020®ion=TOP_BANNER&amp;context=election_recirc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/11/02/us/election-news?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-elections-2020®ion=TOP_BANNER&amp;context=election_recirc</a> This is an example of such a page. I click them and just get white space. I normally use a private browser tab for all webpages but it still doesn't load if I use the normal page rather than an in-private window.  I would appreciate any help. Let me know if there is any other information I can provide to help people help me. I may need to be walked through some suggestions. I am using version 94 on Linux Mint as of today, and up until today was using whatever the immediately previous version available for Mint was. The described behavior happened on both versions, if that is relevant. </p>",linux;desktop;websites;firefox-940;,firefox,websites,en-US,1456093;1456115;1456123;,owendombert
