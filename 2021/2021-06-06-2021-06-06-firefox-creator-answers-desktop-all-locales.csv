Now Firefox only will open to the outline of what you see when opening it up. I am able to open up the top right menu but when i click on something, nothing loads. When i go into type a website in and click enter nothing happens, text is put into the URL but no website shows. I checked my firewalls, Firefox is allowed there. I have access to my bookmarks and everything, but when I click on them to go to their sites, nothing happens either. But when I click on websites the url pops up in white text in the bottom left of the screen. Please help, this is incredibly annoying and I still haven't figured origins yet, lol. </p>",desktop;sync;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",osteeldog01

I used to have clear glass, windows 7 styled tabs for Firefox, just so I am able to see behind my tabs and onto other programs and such. This new update completely removed the ability to do that for whatever reason, and I have to pick between like 4 cookie-cutter ""Minimalist"" Discord/Twitter, ""Simplistic"" looking ""themes"". It's been a far bit of time since I managed and fumbled my way into getting the clear glass look. Something like the image attached, except with Firefox. Now it's gone, and I would like some assistance or guidance on how I can get it back to the way it was.   </p><p>I am beyond pissed, and have already turned off auto updates. Any help would be appreciated. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,"",rippepe2015

When I use the Firefox browser (my favorite), at best I get about one fifth of the speed that I get when using the Safari browser (e.g., 70 vs. 340 Mbps). I guess I could just use Safari but apart from the ease of use thanks to uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger add-ons in Firefox, Netflix doesn't want to stream in Safari. So I am screwed either way. The Google Fiber tech help doesn't know what to do, their tech said that he sees this Firefox a lot, no solution. And yes, I have 150 GB of space on my hard drive so that's not an issue. Also, 16 GB of RAM. Any ideas what causes this and/or how this can be fixed or improved? </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",fdeblauwe

I've been using Firefox for a year, but these problems only seem to have been happening in perhaps the last three months.  One of the online accounts I was trying to download from - I rang them - suggested I try using Google Chrome, and I was successful on that browser.  So why won't they download for me on Firefox? [I've played around with the settings for downloading apps, and have read a number of previous questions on this forum, none of which have addressed my particular problem.]  You must have come across this before, so what do you advise?  I'm using Windows 10, fully updated. An opened html file looks like the attached screenshot. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,"",houseoffrancis

I have deactivated all FOUR of my plugins and started up Firefox again. I have uninstalled and reinstalled a fresh copy. I installed Firefox on an SSD even and it is still painfully slow. I have the same plugins and such on Chrome and that one opens up immediately. So I have been using Chrome a lot more lately because Firefox is opening slowly these days. Takes 15-20 seconds for Firefox to open every single time. I have deactivated each plugin one by one to see if they were causing the issue and sure enough, all of them were clean. Firefox still opens slowly. </p><p>On an unrelated note, I have been using Chrome a lot more lately also because some things on a webpage don't work on Firefox. I can't explain it. Like on the hickory farms website, I click on the Add To Cart button and it looks like it is being pressed, but nothing is added to the cart. This type of thing happens across the internet on many different sites. When I go to Chrome, everything works as it ought to. I have my settings set to Standard in Privacy and Security. I don't know where else I have to check and change things to get those buttons and other links and such to work. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1418470;,dyrelogan

The problem here is that, like with everyone else, I get spam and phishing. To check if it is a real one or not, I usually put the address in a google search first which then shows if it is a possible real one or not. I tried this with a phishing email I got.  I put in the address ""<a href=""http://therightcontact.org"" rel=""nofollow"">therightcontact.org</a>"" into what I though was the google search bar and instead of displaying the google search, it instantly put it up the top and started loading the page. This could be disastrous for many computers if it automatically loads the page instead of a google search. I just tried and if you start typing any address in a google search, it shoots up to the address bar and starts putting addresses of websites that you have bookmarked or visited. If you wanted to see something for a train for example, it will ALWAYS show the websites you have up the top first. So basically you can not do any google search without it taking you to the list of the latest websites you have visited. My son is trying to search pages for his homework, but it keeps loading the same webpage every time he does a search. Is there a way to turn this off as it is very annoying not being able to do a simple search? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",nuggles58
