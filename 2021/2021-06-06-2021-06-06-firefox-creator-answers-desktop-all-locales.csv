Me personally, I have what's called Low Vision.  I have difficulty seeing stuff clearly.  I've read all the comments about the recent change to 89, and have myself tried the various themes provided to no avail.  This is an extremely big concern, and may well be a legal one.  Please reference the Americans with Disabilities Act. </p><p>Here are a few observations that may be useful to the developers: Never, Never, Never, NEVER present a user with Low Vision white (or light) text on a dark background.  NEVER!  We just can't read it. </p><p>CONTRAST.  We need contrast.  The most recent changes that came with 89 have no contrast.  Don't argue with me; just believe me.  There is not enough contrast to be able to distinguish between items (e.g. different tabs at the top).  That's particularly applicable when I try to read a tab and can't because the tab's background has become transparent and I can't read the ""print"" because of the very busy theme design in the background.  Reference my comment above about presenting white text on a black background.  It's just as bad with a transparent background.  When it comes to design, just because you can doesn't mean you should. </p><p>SIZE.  For most of us, each item needs to be larger.  I'm referencing the icons that represent the various hyperlinks.  I have such trouble making out each one of them.  And there does seem to be a lot of white space that we didn't have before.  I don't need all that white space; I need to see what I'm looking at. </p><p>I'm going to suggest that you recruit someone with experiencing designing graphics for folks with vision challenges.  Cause right now, it looks like you don't have anyone like that on your team.  And if you can't present us with suitable choices, I'm willing to bet there's a considerable number of users who will find it necessary to move on to a new browers. </p><p>Thanks for listening. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",tompottenger

Firefox still opens slowly. </p><p>On an unrelated note, I have been using Chrome a lot more lately also because some things on a webpage don't work on Firefox. I can't explain it. Like on the hickory farms website, I click on the Add To Cart button and it looks like it is being pressed, but nothing is added to the cart. This type of thing happens across the internet on many different sites. When I go to Chrome, everything works as it ought to. I have my settings set to Standard in Privacy and Security. I don't know where else I have to check and change things to get those buttons and other links and such to work. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1418470;1418485;,dyrelogan

The problem here is that, like with everyone else, I get spam and phishing. To check if it is a real one or not, I usually put the address in a google search first which then shows if it is a possible real one or not. I tried this with a phishing email I got.  I put in the address ""<a href=""http://therightcontact.org"" rel=""nofollow"">therightcontact.org</a>"" into what I though was the google search bar and instead of displaying the google search, it instantly put it up the top and started loading the page. This could be disastrous for many computers if it automatically loads the page instead of a google search. I just tried and if you start typing any address in a google search, it shoots up to the address bar and starts putting addresses of websites that you have bookmarked or visited. If you wanted to see something for a train for example, it will ALWAYS show the websites you have up the top first. So basically you can not do any google search without it taking you to the list of the latest websites you have visited. My son is trying to search pages for his homework, but it keeps loading the same webpage every time he does a search. Is there a way to turn this off as it is very annoying not being able to do a simple search? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,websites,en-US,1418482;1418486;,nuggles58
