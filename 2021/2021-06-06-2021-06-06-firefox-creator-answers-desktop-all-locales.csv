Al abrir el navegador comprobe que todos los textos que aparecen tanto en la barras de navegacion,los que yo escribo y los que estan de plantilla, tienen un tamaño tan pequeño que resulta imposible leerlos. Asi como todos los textos de las diferentes funciones, igualmente ocurre si entro en cualquier web, los textos son ilegibles.He probado con todo lo referente a ampliar tamaño de fuentes en todas sus entradas pero nada me resulta, querria saber si me puedes orientar para resolver el problema. Seria muy grafico para comprender el problema poder enviarte algun archivo con capturas de pantallas de comno se ve lo que intento explicarte, hay algun modo de hacerte llegar estas capturas de pantalla.

Suggestions?,"<p>If I had read about the 89 update before it was installed, I would have turned off auto updates. It now seems like I'm stuck. I've used FIREFOX for over 10 years and dealt with needless changes through that time. NOW, with 89, it would require too many hours for me to try to render it useful. Plus, when you folks throw all of these changes in, you clearly have no idea how impossible a situation you create for seniors. I'm a high functioning 70+ professiional. I have age peers who in the past have told me FIREFOX was too difficult to manage. Now, I'[m joining that <a href=""http://group.It"" rel=""nofollow"">group.It</a> is unbelievable that you would, for no aparent necessary purpose, reinvent the browser appearance, layout, and seolection mechanisms. Maybe you think your doing an aesthetic improvement. You have not. You have merely imposed change for its own sake. </p><p>I've given up on hoping that FIREFOX might  realize that most people want to use their computers for end directed purposes. NOT because they, like some who post, and evidently those who cooked up 89, think it fun and satisfying to spend their time interacting with a machine. We regular people don't love ""code"". It is not enjoyable for us to manipulate or write or have anything to do with ""code"".  </p><pre>FIREFOX evidently sees itself now as a browser to be used only by 25 year olds or computer devotees. It's kind of elitist, ya know. </pre> <p>Can you suggest a browser created with the old Firefox  mentality, that is usable by non-expert citizens? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,1418833;1418834;1418841;,edsgraves

Why change what people are happy with for no reason other than some computer addicts need to change things to occupy themselves? The visuals are awful and undivided. DO you think everyone is 25? Do you realize that your mucking around makes it really hard for older people with older vision to use the browser.  I just had to waste an hour trying to restore some functions to the address bar and tool bar. Why not make it easy for regular people to use and let the computer addicts take things away that THEY don't want?

If you were older, you might understand  how difficult it is to remember all the pointless changes that you are making, that REMEMBERING 100 shortcuts is impossible for most older people.

Expecting to launch the default browser by double-clicking that file or opening a new tab if running, although I can see where that might get weird and launch only the file's source browser and not the default browser; not a problem as yet.  </p><p>Note that I know this is not &lt;Save Page As…/Web Page, complete&gt; that saves the entire page content in a relative directory, or &lt;Save Page As…/Web Page, HTML only&gt; that saves page code to a file system link but without content. Also, not interested in FF internal solutions related to bookmarks, pocket, or favorites. FF is busy enough and my goal is to save links with my file system organization instead of duplicating that inside an application.  </p><p>This is something I once did routinely with Safari on Mac OS, but eOS doesn't map without a default desktop. I expected FF to have a menu selection, contextual or not, or key combo common to all platforms, but I found nothing and very little online comment about this.  </p><p>As a workaround, I can accomplish this is by dragging a highlighted URL from the FF address field to an open file manager directory window. The test file was under a reasonable 200 bytes and launched FF when double-clicked. However, this is cumbersome if the environment isn't ready and waiting, requiring opening a file manager without a desktop, navigating the file system, reducing maximized windows, and stacking windows within reach. Also, copying URL text can't be pasted into the file manager to create a new file; just thought I'd try it.  </p><p>Short of installing a third party desktop, am I missing a simple way to do this with FF?  </p><p>Bonus Question: what does the attached icon mean to you? I thought the little arrow on the known ""code"" document icon was mimicking Windows' shortcut style, but it's not an alias and I honestly don't know what the arrow means. If you action the file of this icon it opens a FF tab as I wrote above, but won't launch ""code"" even if asked, only readable from <em>within</em> code. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,"",skyhook1

Watch, here comes the disabled get bullied yet again. </p><p><br> </p><p>In typical fashion, mozilla volunteers insist o go rewrite my letter somewhere else, on a dif page, on a dif site, in a dif location.   </p><p>AGAIN, these concepts are ridiculous and not based in reality.   In other forums, mods simply move posts to the appropriate topics. </p><p>Mozilla volunteers are now insisting we spend years learning and understanding the layout of their 1 forum, in order to post in what is their opinion of the proper location.  If I  could figure that out my own, I would have done so.  But I couldn't.  Mozilla makes it hard. \ So i'm reposting yet again, to show the world how this sector of human society continually gets pushed around and bullied, even when seeking support, and ZERO HELP IS EVER FORTHCOMING. </p><p>greetings, </p><p>the autistic and aspergers sector of society has an extremely difficult time with change.  They have made petitions, submitted emotional testimony online in your forums, etc, and there has been a complete lack of response.   </p><p>There is gobs of scientific data around this globally, and overzealous overlords in tech constantly change the way the product looks, ignoring the science. These changes do nothing for functionality for 99% of people, and doesn't generate revenue for anyone. </p><p>What it does do, is it harms, disengages, and disenfranchises this entire group of society.  Where they already have an extremely difficult time, the tech world continues to march away from logic, science, and evidence, insisting decorative changes are necessary and required, when the reality is we all know, there is an over the top engineer or designer at 4am on a sunday going ""OMG CHARLIE LOOK AT THIS FONT!!!!!  IMPLEMENTING IT NOW!!!!!!  OMG THIS BUTTON NEEDS TO BE OVER HERE NOW!!!!!"" </p><p>And then, they force us to accept these changes, without warning, teaching or sharing the change, and without giving the majority the information they need, or the ability to understand or even use the change. </p><p>These changes toss their family and home lives into chaos, stress, weeks of slow, turtle like crawl back towards some stability in these humans lives.  In extreme cases, these individuals can be physically violent with their family because they have social disabilities, emotionally damaging relations, love, and kindness, simply because the tech world is full of 1 up man ship, instead of logic or compassion. </p><p>The tech world can literally design build and create anything, except the concept of no change for those that need it most.   </p><p>Every time there is these fundamental changes either to design or functionality, these humans retreat from the life they have that comforts them, they lose advancements in their personal lives, and it disturbs and can harm their well being, their home lives, and their relationships with their care takers. </p><p>The latest update for your browser changed my childs right click menu, that he spent months learning about how to change and setup for himself.  He cannot understand or comprehend how he laboured for what to him seems to be an eternity, and one day when he fires his browser up, all his hard work is gone, that he literally spent months learning. </p><p>This time, because he cant reach his emotions, because of the changes firefox forcibly deepthroats planet earth with, he picked up his laptop and threw it out the rear window of the house, a total cost to repair and replace all damages amounting to just under $8000.  </p><p>Because someone changed his personal stuff.  In his private space.  Located in his personal house, where he lives in privacy with his family.  WHY WOULD THAT CHANGE?  WHY SHOULD THAT CHANGE?. HIS PERSONAL ITEMS CHANGED IN HIS PRIVATE LIFE. And no one told him.  No one educated him on it.  No one told him why it would be better.  No one provided him with the tools to use it.  He spent months learning this stuff, and one day he woke up and his effort was erased from the planet.   </p><p>Keep up the good work. </p><p><br> </p><p>We're all wondering why this stuff is all ok? </p><p>Why is it ok to take a virtual machete to someone else's hard work because someone wants a different color? </p><p>Henry Ford never went into that car you bought, and changed the location of the steering wheel or the pedals. </p><p>Thomas Edison never went into your house, and changed out the light switches for a new design or shape. </p><p>GE never went into any ones home and changed the plastic bezel on our tv's. </p><p>But all of a sudden, we have a tech world where the only constant, is change.  Change  of colors and buttons, which in most cases, the business world of making money, keeps saying is costing us, as a society, billions now, and its not generating revenue, its a loss and write off.  The business world struggles to keep up with dynamic products, reeducating and relearning, because some digital exist in a logic vacuum. </p><p>Speaking of losses, even the general public sees little to no value in change that serves nothing but whimful designers.  In fact, the majority of research indicates that the public would rather be able to makes their own style and design changes, instead of the dynamic, impossible to keep up with changes that have morphed into a false idea of progress in the computer world. </p><p>CHANGING COLORS AND BUTTONS AND FONTS IS KILLING THESE VERY SPECIAL PEOPLE INSIDE.  AND IT ISN'T THEIR FAULT.  ITS A DISABILITY </p><p>When can we expect Firefox to reach the reality that the public already knows? </p><p>This was also sent as an email, to mozilla press, via the web form.  As of today, the recieving email address is unknown and hidden, because instead of posting a public address, mozilla uses a web form preventing a submitter from retaining a copy for themselves in most cases, in the form of sent mail.  That in and of itself, at face value, appears to be intentional, a deceptive process of false engagement.  Another disturbing fact in all this, is that more and more companies are hiding the who/what/where/why of their leadership.   </p><p>As an individual, i am becoming more and more leery of companies and organizations that hide all forms of contacts and insist people use a forum, where they may or may not get a response, resulting in zero accountability in most cases.  (When organizations ask for free public volunteers to be members and help the public, that amounts to social theft.  Multiple countries on earth have outlawed this type of behavior, as it resembles an unpaid internship, resulting in free monetary maintenance value for profit oriented organizations, which I acknowledge firefox is not). </p><p>If an email submitter cant archive or even retain a sent email, because their point of contact was forcibly moved to an unaccountable web form, any organization can deny all existence of submissions, and thus wash their hands of all responsibility and plead ignorance.   </p><p>If your organization truly advocates for a healthy internet as it virtue signals, then this letter would never have been necessary. </p><p>Every single person on earth, is trying to understand, for 25 years, why our lap top and computer screens are 14 to 20 inches wide, and when we send an email or forum submission to firefox, all the text exists inside a 2 inch by 2 inch window, with 10 inches of unused dead space surrounding the text field, complicating and making editing and fluid reading 100% impossible.  We cant read 1 complete line at once, we have to scroll and scroll and scroll in order to read 1 SINGLE SENTENCE.  And then you forget what you typed in the previous line because your eyes cant flit and read it in an instant, you have to grab a mouse and scroll, causing you to forget what you were trying to edit, making you go back and find the questionable entry all over again, repeating the process.  Tiny text entry boxes are personal time thieves, requiring more effort and time to use.  And then because the text box is so small, some people simply write in MS Word or a text document, and copy pasta it over, because you can see multiple lines and paragraphs simultaneously, simplifying and smoothing the editing and proof reading process, all because of a design fail that has been implemented globally as good because its something different than what to used to exist, when we all admit the functionality is a complete failure in all aspects. </p><p>Imagine that. Not using the firefox submission form makes life easier to contact firefox.  WOW.  What a paradox. </p><p>These are absolutely preposterous concepts, yet they have existed for 25 years and more.  Everyone I know objects, and finds it ridiculous.  Yet it persists. </p><p>We keep pushing people away and disengaging some, because the rest can cope or deal, or simply to choose assimilate because they feel 100% powerless to have a voice. </p><p>The new tab ""button"" hovers over the browser, and to my aspergers child, seems to be disconnected from the tab and in the wrong place.  With no ability to fix, commence bay glass window shatter countdown. </p><p>$8000 repair bill in 10, 9, 8, 7, 6........ </p><p>.....because layouts, colors, button placements and designs, are changed.

This letter, takes me 4 minutes to scroll through, even thought it is only 1 page. Because the text box is 2 inches wide****  </pre> <p>What a ridiculous waste of time, effort, energy, and my life.  Thanks firefox.  Thanks for promoting a healthy and safe internet. </p><p>To add to the above, i made an account or something to post this on this forum, i never save passwords or logins for any accounts and ff displays no known logins or passwords in my settings, yet this site has only ever asked me to login once, somehow somewhwere saving my information that i dont want saved, anywhere anyhow. </p><p><br> </p><p>to furthur add insult to injury, the most used font on earth is helvitica, which has been removed from the entire firefox browser. </p><p>We are now expected to all be engineers and developers and self code our browsers to provide basic functionality to ourselves. </p><p>What an absolute slap in the face to human beings. </p><p><br> Thanks again for promoting that healthy internet. </p><p><br> Note for Serburo: If you actually honestly read my post, you will find multiple questions, and multiple requests for support.

Tiny text entry boxes are personal time thieves, requiring more effort and time to use.  And then because the text box is so small, some people simply write in MS Word or a text document, and copy pasta it over, because you can see multiple lines and paragraphs simultaneously, simplifying and smoothing the editing and proof reading process, all because of a design fail that has been implemented globally as good because its something different than what to used to exist, when we all admit the functionality is a complete failure in all aspects. </p><p>Imagine that.

Me personally, I have what's called Low Vision.  I have difficulty seeing stuff clearly.  I've read all the comments about the recent change to 89, and have myself tried the various themes provided to no avail.  This is an extremely big concern, and may well be a legal one.  Please reference the Americans with Disabilities Act. </p><p>Here are a few observations that may be useful to the developers: Never, Never, Never, NEVER present a user with Low Vision white (or light) text on a dark background.  NEVER!  We just can't read it. </p><p>CONTRAST.  We need contrast.  The most recent changes that came with 89 have no contrast.  Don't argue with me; just believe me.  There is not enough contrast to be able to distinguish between items (e.g. different tabs at the top).  That's particularly applicable when I try to read a tab and can't because the tab's background has become transparent and I can't read the ""print"" because of the very busy theme design in the background.  Reference my comment above about presenting white text on a black background.  It's just as bad with a transparent background.  When it comes to design, just because you can doesn't mean you should. </p><p>SIZE.  For most of us, each item needs to be larger.  I'm referencing the icons that represent the various hyperlinks.  I have such trouble making out each one of them.  And there does seem to be a lot of white space that we didn't have before.  I don't need all that white space; I need to see what I'm looking at. </p><p>I'm going to suggest that you recruit someone with experiencing designing graphics for folks with vision challenges.  Cause right now, it looks like you don't have anyone like that on your team.  And if you can't present us with suitable choices, I'm willing to bet there's a considerable number of users who will find it necessary to move on to a new browers. </p><p>Thanks for listening. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-880;mr1;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",tompottenger

When i go into type a website in and click enter nothing happens, text is put into the URL but no website shows. I checked my firewalls, Firefox is allowed there. I have access to my bookmarks and everything, but when I click on them to go to their sites, nothing happens either. But when I click on websites the url pops up in white text in the bottom left of the screen.

When I use the Firefox browser (my favorite), at best I get about one fifth of the speed that I get when using the Safari browser (e.g., 70 vs. 340 Mbps). I guess I could just use Safari but apart from the ease of use thanks to uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger add-ons in Firefox, Netflix doesn't want to stream in Safari. So I am screwed either way. The Google Fiber tech help doesn't know what to do, their tech said that he sees this Firefox a lot, no solution. And yes, I have 150 GB of space on my hard drive so that's not an issue. Also, 16 GB of RAM. Any ideas what causes this and/or how this can be fixed or improved? </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",fdeblauwe

I've been using Firefox for a year, but these problems only seem to have been happening in perhaps the last three months.  One of the online accounts I was trying to download from - I rang them - suggested I try using Google Chrome, and I was successful on that browser.  So why won't they download for me on Firefox? [I've played around with the settings for downloading apps, and have read a number of previous questions on this forum, none of which have addressed my particular problem.]  You must have come across this before, so what do you advise?

I have deactivated all FOUR of my plugins and started up Firefox again. I have uninstalled and reinstalled a fresh copy. I installed Firefox on an SSD even and it is still painfully slow. I have the same plugins and such on Chrome and that one opens up immediately. So I have been using Chrome a lot more lately because Firefox is opening slowly these days. Takes 15-20 seconds for Firefox to open every single time. I have deactivated each plugin one by one to see if they were causing the issue and sure enough, all of them were clean. Firefox still opens slowly. </p><p>On an unrelated note, I have been using Chrome a lot more lately also because some things on a webpage don't work on Firefox. I can't explain it. Like on the hickory farms website, I click on the Add To Cart button and it looks like it is being pressed, but nothing is added to the cart. This type of thing happens across the internet on many different sites. When I go to Chrome, everything works as it ought to. I have my settings set to Standard in Privacy and Security. I don't know where else I have to check and change things to get those buttons and other links and such to work. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1418470;1418485;,dyrelogan

The problem here is that, like with everyone else, I get spam and phishing. To check if it is a real one or not, I usually put the address in a google search first which then shows if it is a possible real one or not. I tried this with a phishing email I got.  I put in the address ""<a href=""http://therightcontact.org"" rel=""nofollow"">therightcontact.org</a>"" into what I though was the google search bar and instead of displaying the google search, it instantly put it up the top and started loading the page. This could be disastrous for many computers if it automatically loads the page instead of a google search. I just tried and if you start typing any address in a google search, it shoots up to the address bar and starts putting addresses of websites that you have bookmarked or visited. If you wanted to see something for a train for example, it will ALWAYS show the websites you have up the top first. So basically you can not do any google search without it taking you to the list of the latest websites you have visited. My son is trying to search pages for his homework, but it keeps loading the same webpage every time he does a search. Is there a way to turn this off as it is very annoying not being able to do a simple search? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,websites,en-US,1418482;1418486;,nuggles58
