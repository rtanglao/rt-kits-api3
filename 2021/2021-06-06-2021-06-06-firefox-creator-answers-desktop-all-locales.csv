When I was using Chrome there was a problem with duplicate favorites and I think I have 3 sets of duplicate favorites. I asked about this online and I was told that by using switching to Firefox and then importing my favorites from Chrome would eliminate the duplicates. When I first brought them over they were put in my bookmark toolbar. I think I did this but what a mess. Is it better to take my Chrome bookmarks into a separate file where I can pick and choose the duplicate bookmarks and then bring them over to Firefox? Of course I don't know how you do that and I'm just not computer savvy. Thank you for your time and any help or advice you can give me.

Firefox still opens slowly. </p><p>On an unrelated note, I have been using Chrome a lot more lately also because some things on a webpage don't work on Firefox. I can't explain it.

The problem here is that, like with everyone else, I get spam and phishing. To check if it is a real one or not, I usually put the address in a google search first which then shows if it is a possible real one or not. I tried this with a phishing email I got.  I put in the address ""<a href=""http://therightcontact.org"" rel=""nofollow"">therightcontact.org</a>"" into what I though was the google search bar and instead of displaying the google search, it instantly put it up the top and started loading the page. This could be disastrous for many computers if it automatically loads the page instead of a google search. I just tried and if you start typing any address in a google search, it shoots up to the address bar and starts putting addresses of websites that you have bookmarked or visited. If you wanted to see something for a train for example, it will ALWAYS show the websites you have up the top first. So basically you can not do any google search without it taking you to the list of the latest websites you have visited. My son is trying to search pages for his homework, but it keeps loading the same webpage every time he does a search.
