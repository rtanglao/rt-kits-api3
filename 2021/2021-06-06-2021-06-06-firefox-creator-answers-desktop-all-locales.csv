When I use the Firefox browser (my favorite), at best I get about one fifth of the speed that I get when using the Safari browser (e.g., 70 vs. 340 Mbps). I guess I could just use Safari but apart from the ease of use thanks to uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger add-ons in Firefox, Netflix doesn't want to stream in Safari. So I am screwed either way. The Google Fiber tech help doesn't know what to do, their tech said that he sees this Firefox a lot, no solution. And yes, I have 150 GB of space on my hard drive so that's not an issue.

I have deactivated all FOUR of my plugins and started up Firefox again. I have uninstalled and reinstalled a fresh copy. I installed Firefox on an SSD even and it is still painfully slow. I have the same plugins and such on Chrome and that one opens up immediately. So I have been using Chrome a lot more lately because Firefox is opening slowly these days. Takes 15-20 seconds for Firefox to open every single time. I have deactivated each plugin one by one to see if they were causing the issue and sure enough, all of them were clean. Firefox still opens slowly. </p><p>On an unrelated note, I have been using Chrome a lot more lately also because some things on a webpage don't work on Firefox. I can't explain it. Like on the hickory farms website, I click on the Add To Cart button and it looks like it is being pressed, but nothing is added to the cart. This type of thing happens across the internet on many different sites. When I go to Chrome, everything works as it ought to. I have my settings set to Standard in Privacy and Security.

The problem here is that, like with everyone else, I get spam and phishing. To check if it is a real one or not, I usually put the address in a google search first which then shows if it is a possible real one or not. I tried this with a phishing email I got.  I put in the address ""<a href=""http://therightcontact.org"" rel=""nofollow"">therightcontact.org</a>"" into what I though was the google search bar and instead of displaying the google search, it instantly put it up the top and started loading the page. This could be disastrous for many computers if it automatically loads the page instead of a google search. I just tried and if you start typing any address in a google search, it shoots up to the address bar and starts putting addresses of websites that you have bookmarked or visited. If you wanted to see something for a train for example, it will ALWAYS show the websites you have up the top first. So basically you can not do any google search without it taking you to the list of the latest websites you have visited. My son is trying to search pages for his homework, but it keeps loading the same webpage every time he does a search. Is there a way to turn this off as it is very annoying not being able to do a simple search? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,websites,en-US,1418482;1418486;,nuggles58
