It used to be that a tab's text was a decent, readable size, a tab icon would be replaced by a play button if media was playing, and when moused over it changed to a speaker icon that let you mute the tab.  Nice!  Now, instead of the universally recognized 'play' icon, someone decided to SHRINK the tab title to barely readable so they could fit PLAYING underneath, making the mute 'button' harder to click as a consequence.  Seriously?  Replacing something that's universally understood with text that has to be customized by regional settings?  And shrinking the tab title to do it?  Who thought this was a good idea?   </p><p>Worse, seemingly to justify this change, if you have autoplay turned off in settings, AUTOPLAY BLOCKED shows up on the tab.  As if it's like ""OMG You Blocked AutoPlay!  What Are You <em>Doing</em>???""  Wow.. cuz I totally forgot that I wanted to NOT hear what every Web PR hack in the world want's to shove down my throat (via the ear canal :-) the second a page opens. </p><p>Mozilla claims to be all about protecting personal information.  Yet every new version has the box checked for Steal My Info.. er.. I mean, Allow Firefox to send [xxx] to Mozilla, <em>even though it was turned off before the update</em>.  It's a setting under <strong>PRIVACY</strong> and Security, for crying out loud!!!  You want to have that stuff turned on for new installs, great, have fun.

I hope changing it to whatever doesn't mess it up anything even more. </p><p>I thought I had to go update Windows or something since recently a couple of times the youtube videos get stuttery and not move as smoothly at times. I can't remember much this one but I either just close Firefox to hopefully that it goes back to normal or I have to update Windows to restart my laptop and it works and it goes back to normal. </p><p>But this time when I did all that and I try to update Windows from my laptop it was doing what it does updating installing or downloading yesterday. The problem is still there and the videos on youtube are still stuttering. And I try to see if there were more things to update there was nothing there and says its up to date. </p><p>I linked a video that has a 60fps option on a another browser Microsoft Edge to see if it works from there and video when putting it on 60fps works fine there. So this must be a Firefox problem or something. </p><p>So if anyone can help me with this problem. Please tell if there's anything else I can do to get these videos on youtube to work on Firefox in 60fps and hopefully can try to easily fix this and hope its nothing complicated to do. Or if there is a bug or something that's making these videos stuttering and everything please try to fix this problem that's going with me right now. Cause i don't want to have to deal with problem I had before again forever and/or if its permanent. </p><p>Hopefully maybe the next update for Firefox might fix this problem I have from these youtube videos, but I don't know. Whenever an update for Firefox happens sometimes, the videos on youtube start to stutter and not move as smoothly with putting it on 60fps and have this problem again.  </p><p>Thank you if anyone has the time to look at this and hopefully someone can get me the answer to finally fix these videos that are freezing stuttering and stuff there. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-900;firefox-9002;,firefox,other,en-US,1432721;1432734;1432776;,buggasep17
