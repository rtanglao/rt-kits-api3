I have been getting a problem lately where nearly all the text on a couple of websites does not display. Only a few characters, such as 'T', 'E', 'L' and '4' display. I have attached screenshots of one of these websites - how it displays in Firefox vs. how it displays in Google Chrome. It also happens in the chat function of the online lecture video system my uni uses (Blackboard Collaborate Ultra), which runs in the browser (it's not a separate app). </p><p>I did a search for similar problems on Mozilla support and tried restarting Firefox in safe mode, however nothing changed. Here's a link to one of the pages with the problem as I cannot upload the screenshot photo <a href=""https://www.primaryarms.com/Brand+Primary-Arms"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.primaryarms.com/Brand+Primary-Arms</a> </p><p>I'm using Firefox 78.12.0esr on MacOS X 10.11.6 </p><p>Any help would be appreciated. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Montgomery.slue
