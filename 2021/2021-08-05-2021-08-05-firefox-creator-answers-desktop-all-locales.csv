When I have Google set as the search engine in Firefox (FF) for macOS (various versions, including the latest 90.0.2 at time of writing), at a certain point after FF has been running (ie not immediately, but say within the hour) clicking on Google search results link results in a blank tab with literally nothing at all in the Inspector &gt; Network  or &gt; Console etc for that tab.  Copying the Google URI from the address bar and pasting it into another fresh tab in FF also results in the same problem.  Copying the same Google URI into Chrome or any other browser, on the same OS at the same time, does not result in any problem (page loads fine). </p><p>I have tried all of the following, and none have made any immediate or long term difference: </p> <ul><li> Disabling all addons at the time of the problem </li><li> Performing a FF reset </li><li> Uninstalling and re-installing FF </li><li> Logging into Google in FF </li><li> Logging our of Google in FF </li><li> Logging into FF with a FF account </li><li> Logging out of any FF account </li><li> Tweaking a couple of about:config settings relating to FF domain stove-piping, since the problem started roughly around the time that was released </li><li> Building an entirely new PC (previous was macOS 11.4.x and 11.5 on Intel; current is macOS 11.5 on Apple Silicon) and building an entire new user profile from scratch, with all apps incl FF freshly installed </li><li> Using a different search engine (DuckDuckGo works fine, consistently, but when I change it back to Google the same problem starts up again after a while - eg within the hour) </li></ul> <p>This just feels like a bug (like nothing at all displayed in any part of the Inspector after a new tab is loaded with a Google link) but if that's true then  </p> <ol><li> I can't be the only person in the world seeing this; and </li><li> It's surprising that it has persisted across a number of FF versions over a couple of months </li></ol> <p>I'm really keen to see this resolved because I do need to be able to use Google for search, and I do *want* to be able to continue to use FF (although this is unfortunately a significant head-wind to actually being able to continue doing so). </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-900;firefox-9002;,firefox,other,en-US,1432881;,paul375

1346125,2021-08-05 10:43:17 -0700,2021-08-05 15:14:36 -0700,Is microsoft email corrupting firefox?,"<p>For the last couple of years I have been plagued by three major Firefox issues which I think now are inter-related - the first is a HUGE amount of memory being use (around 1.5-3.5GB in a 6GB machine), the second is firefox suddenly becoming slow and crashing. The third is that neither of my microsoft email accounts (MS live/Outlook nor my work-based Outlook365) load after restarting firefox from a crash. </p><p>In detail 1. Upon launching firefox, memory usage quickly increase to around 1.5gb, with maybe one or two pages open. This gradually increases to the extent it is throttling my machine and preventing other programs working properly (Windows Explorer being the most regular to be booted off and restart when this happens). I've recently noticed that there are about 10-15 parallel firefox processing running. Killing the largest memory-using instance someimes does nothing except free up memory, sometimes causes tabs to crash (with the stupid 'gah your tabs have crashed' displaying), and sometimes kills the whole program - there is no way to know what each instance is actually doing in task manager, so its pot luck. However I am noticing that quite often force stopping 'high memory process' manages to kill one or both my email pages. </p><p>2. Normally when memory use is high, forefox becomes very slow. At this point, either it, or another running program with crash. I'm quite sure this is because firefox is consuming so much memory that neither it, nor other programs can run properly and a crash occurs. </p><p>3. When I restart firefox (either a forced restart or a crash), and restore my tabs, almost every time, neither of my microsoft email services load. They just hang in a loading state, or a loaded state, but with a white page displaying. I suspet the pages are loaded, but firefox for whatever reason is not displaying them. After anywhere between 10 and c.60 minutes (it it totally random) pressing refresh finally allows the page to load.  This is coming from a clean restart of firefox where all previous instances have been force stopped. Sometimes Firefox has even installed updates on itself (which I would have thought clears all previous running versions). In the mean time I can load my email in private mode (which is annoying as I have to sign in each time). I have tried starting firefox in safe mode, clearing cache etc and it does nothing to help microsoft email services launch straight away. The only work around is to use private browsing. </p><p>I'm gradually coming to the conclusion there is something in the way firefox works with microsoft's email web displays that does not work. This is either MS fault or Mozilla. But either way what is the fix? </p><p>And please don't say 'its good firefox is using otherwise unused memory (a previous argument I stumbled across). This is a rediculous argument if firefox memory use prevents it and other programs from operating properly. </p><p>HELP! I'm shortly to get a new machine and am tempted to say goodbye to Firefox forever (after about 15 years of use) as it is getting unworkable. </p><p>Currently running v.90.0.2 (64 bit) </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1432887;1432888;,camp2009

It used to be that a tab's text was a decent, readable size, a tab icon would be replaced by a play button if media was playing, and when moused over it changed to a speaker icon that let you mute the tab.  Nice!  Now, instead of the universally recognized 'play' icon, someone decided to SHRINK the tab title to barely readable so they could fit PLAYING underneath, making the mute 'button' harder to click as a consequence.  Seriously?  Replacing something that's universally understood with text that has to be customized by regional settings?  And shrinking the tab title to do it?  Who thought this was a good idea?   </p><p>Worse, seemingly to justify this change, if you have autoplay turned off in settings, AUTOPLAY BLOCKED shows up on the tab.

I hope changing it to whatever doesn't mess it up anything even more. </p><p>I thought I had to go update Windows or something since recently a couple of times the youtube videos get stuttery and not move as smoothly at times. I can't remember much this one but I either just close Firefox to hopefully that it goes back to normal or I have to update Windows to restart my laptop and it works and it goes back to normal. </p><p>But this time when I did all that and I try to update Windows from my laptop it was doing what it does updating installing or downloading yesterday. The problem is still there and the videos on youtube are still stuttering. And I try to see if there were more things to update there was nothing there and says its up to date. </p><p>I linked a video that has a 60fps option on a another browser Microsoft Edge to see if it works from there and video when putting it on 60fps works fine there. So this must be a Firefox problem or something. </p><p>So if anyone can help me with this problem. Please tell if there's anything else I can do to get these videos on youtube to work on Firefox in 60fps and hopefully can try to easily fix this and hope its nothing complicated to do. Or if there is a bug or something that's making these videos stuttering and everything please try to fix this problem that's going with me right now. Cause i don't want to have to deal with problem I had before again forever and/or if its permanent. </p><p>Hopefully maybe the next update for Firefox might fix this problem I have from these youtube videos, but I don't know. Whenever an update for Firefox happens sometimes, the videos on youtube start to stutter and not move as smoothly with putting it on 60fps and have this problem again.  </p><p>Thank you if anyone has the time to look at this and hopefully someone can get me the answer to finally fix these videos that are freezing stuttering and stuff there. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-900;firefox-9002;,firefox,other,en-US,1432721;1432734;1432776;,buggasep17
