What happens is any type of pop-up menu does not open properly and the pop-up itself ""crashes"" when you try and open it (e.g. auto fill pop up when you focus an input, context menu pop up, drop-down menu for various Firefox actions in the toolbar, etc.), but it does eventually open with several attempts.
