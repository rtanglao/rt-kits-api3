I'm going to reinstall my computer and I'd like once reconfigured my FF account in it that it automatically reopens all tabs I had previously opened before reinstall. Till now I was looking in Sync menu, find back old computer and reselect each one of tab to reopen it in new instance of FF but it's pretty boring process. Is there an easier way to do that and if so how ? </p><p>Thanks, best, </p><p>Vincèn </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-910;firefox-9102;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",vincen1

I checked about:config and browser.gesture.swipe.left is set to Browser:BackOrBackDuplicate but it does not work. All answers on Mozilla Support and elsewhere are outdated or do not answer the question at all. Please fix this, it is the reason why I switched back to Chrome twice before.

So most bottom-taskbar people can't see this. </li><li> It sometimes grabs normal firefox titlebar so It's colored and sometimes you can see tabs. </li><li> Enabling windows default titlebar fixes this problem because (obviously)default windows behavior is not broken. But it's ugly&amp;unnecessarily uses space. </li></ul> <p>This bug is combination of Windows 10 maximize animation and poor handing of that animation by firefox. When you grab any window and maximize it. You can see that window doesn't just instantly becomes maximized, rather they start from just little bit smaller than maximized. When Firefox is playing this animiation, for some reason, only top edge introduces white stripe; And that white stripe just moves over to other monitor. You should be able to see this animation even if you don't have second monitor. Have to be focused because it's fast. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,"",kimjj2110
