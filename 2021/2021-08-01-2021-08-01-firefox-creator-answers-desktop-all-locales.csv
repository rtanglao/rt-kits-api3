This is a major impediment in using searches systematically. I cannot pin the timing for that problem down to a certain event as there had been updates to all 3 of the above mentioned system elements, OS, AV &amp; Firefox. I tried to go through a number of suggested solutions to the problem without achieving anything. Pls note:  -Browser is NOT set to ""always search in privacy"" -Browser is set to remember browsing history -Cross checking with MS Edge showed the same problem - means that it is probably not a Firefox internal issue -Tweaking MS/Edge privacy settings were equally unsuccessful </p><p>Does anybody have a suggestion where the problem might be rooted? I spent already several hours on this and it feels like a dead end.  Thank you in advance for every hint in the right direction.
