This is a major impediment in using searches systematically. I cannot pin the timing for that problem down to a certain event as there had been updates to all 3 of the above mentioned system elements, OS, AV &amp; Firefox. I tried to go through a number of suggested solutions to the problem without achieving anything. Pls note:  -Browser is NOT set to ""always search in privacy"" -Browser is set to remember browsing history -Cross checking with MS Edge showed the same problem - means that it is probably not a Firefox internal issue -Tweaking MS/Edge privacy settings were equally unsuccessful </p><p>Does anybody have a suggestion where the problem might be rooted? I spent already several hours on this and it feels like a dead end.  Thank you in advance for every hint in the right direction.

Before that everything was OK. </p><p>After that.....  Firts of all in Google Chrome everything works just fine. In Firefox  - most of the time after a google search if I click on one of the results nothing happens. If I open it in a new tab or window, I got a blank page. - I cannot log into my gmail account. I can get to the page where I can type in my account name, but then I get an error message before the web page'd ask for my psw.  - youtube does not load properly. If then I click on the youtube icon on the top left corner then it tries to load the page again, and after some time it says I have no internet connection. - google translate service does not answer, - reCAPTCHAs don't work. The browser could not load them, or if it loads something then it won't work. Etc. </p><p>Again: everyhing was OK before the version 90 update. I was on a 2 weeks vacation, just got back, but all the same, they don't work. </p><p>I tried everything - cleared the history, cache, etc., - checking the firewall,  - proxy (I don't use any proxy),  - ipv6 - made a new profile - troubleshooting mode (disabeling addons and themes), everything. Nothing helped.  </p><p>I use Win10. Have an other Win10 PC, on that before the version 90 update I checked the problems above, and neither of them affected the system, and as the update taked place I got the same propblems there too. My firefox profile is synched onto that PC. </p><p>After 20+ years of using firefox this is my last try before switching to chrome. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-900;firefox-9002;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",imkere

Cambio pagina e traballa, sfarfalla ancora per altri 4/5 secondi. Con al browser tipo Crhome, Opera, Microsot Edge non succede, è tutto regolare). Forse perchè sul mio vecchio PC (che però è ancora discretamente rapido, non mi crea nessun altro problema se non lentezza ad accendersi e a spegnersi, ma nulla di più) è installato ancora WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL 64 BIT  e magari alcuni aggiornamenti fatti ultimamente da Firefox hanno creato questo piccolo inconveniente al mio monitor ?
