Estava utilizando o firefox normalmente, não sei dizer se foi após alguma atualização ou simplesmente parou de funcionar de um dia para o outro. Quando tento abrir o firefox só percebo uma piscada na tela, não tenho nenhum mensagem de erro, nenhum processo ou serviço é iniciado no windows. Tentei por várias vezes recuperar o aplicativo sem sucesso, tentei acessar o perfil através do comando (firefox.exe -p) mas este também não abre. Desinstalei, eliminei todas as pastas e arquivos que continham o (mozilla ou firefox) do HD, baixei a ultima versão disponível no site e instalei. Novamente sem sucesso. Também desabilitei o antivirus (McAfee) fiz a reinstalação e novamente o firefox não abriu. Estou utilizando o windows 10 home sigle language (20H2). Alguma dica para pode voltar a utilizar o firefox?? obrigada </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,pt-BR,"",fe.caetano.silva
