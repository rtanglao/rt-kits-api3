I'm still using 56 one reason being that there are separate control options for the start page and the home page. I like to start with a blank page, but have the home button available for my #1 destination. The current version of firefox combines start and home pages, thus taking away my options to separate these elements. For a while it wasn't in the GUI, but you could fix it in the about:config (which was my previous ""solution""), but with the latest updates this has been removed as well. </p><p>How do I get separate start and home pages?   If I could assign a value to the home icon that didn't affect the start page, that would work too.  </p><pre>         Tak! </pre>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-560;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",matieusinjon

An easy solution is to create a symbolic link replacing the one places.sqlite file with a link to the file in the other profile, thus we're always just using one set of bookmarks and all is happy.   However, Firefox keeps overriding my link; labeling the file ""corrupt"" and replacing it with a cached version.   I need to know how to stop firefox from overriding my input and respect the changes made in the profile folder. I need to disable whatever mechanism is going on that is checking the files and reconstituting them.  </p><pre>                                Tak! </pre>",linux;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-560;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",matieusinjon
