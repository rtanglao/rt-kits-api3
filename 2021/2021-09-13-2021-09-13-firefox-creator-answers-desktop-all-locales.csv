I'd like to be able to mark an answer as obsolete, as it's potentially misleading. </p><p>If you search on Google for ""firefox toggle bookmark bar"", the first result is this: </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/865261"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/865261</a> </p><p>It indicates that there's no shortcut to toggle the bookmark bar, which was probably true when it was written, but isn't true now (can use Ctrl+Shift+B). As the question thread is archived, there's no way to add additional responses to indicate the current Firefox functionality, and users that search for this information may get the impression that the older answer is still accurate. </p><p>I don't mean to single this example out, I'm sure there are others and the author of the answer did nothing wrong, but I would like there to be some way to help direct users to more up-to-date information. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,other,en-US,1443014;,tarclarke

It will revert to a default font if i turn off the ability for sites to choose their own fonts, but this interferes with the functionality of a lot of sites' icons so its not a great solution. This also stops when i go into troubleshooting mode, but when i went through hardware acceleration and my extensions one by one, none of them were the cause. </p><p>images in order: my roll20 homepage with the incorrect font display, the same page with fonts disabled (note the notification icons in the upper right are broken now though), the same page in troubleshoot mode with the correct font display </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1442974;,zoe.kierce
