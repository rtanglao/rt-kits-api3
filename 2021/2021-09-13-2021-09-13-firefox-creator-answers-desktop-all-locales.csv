Let us choose a compact view.,"<p>It appears that you, Firefox developers, changed the browser in version 89 so that bookmark menu items are now <em>super far apart</em>. Users now have to scan twice the vertical space and/or scroll to find their bookmarks. I'm on version 92 and this is annoying. </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1338204#answer-1416709"" rel=""nofollow"">Overly complicated hacks were devised</a> to eliminate the extra spacing. Maybe people who are using touchscreens appreciate the extra space, but for users using a mouse, what I would assume is the majority, it's obnoxious. In the previous link, <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/user/jscher2000"" rel=""nofollow"">jscher2000</a> says, ""If you have any issues with the new design, <strong>please let us know what it is you don't like, and we can try provide more permanent solutions</strong> depending on the issue."" So, here I am. </p><p><strong>We don't like the double-spaced bookmark menus. Please provide a method for choosing a compact view of the bookmark menus.</strong> This could be a separate option or just piggy back on the <em>Normal</em> option (versus <em>Touch</em>) on the <em>Density</em> in the <em>Customize Firefox</em> tab (see attachment). Either way, regular users (e.g., people's parents who have them using Firefox) shouldn't have to change CSS to fix this. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jlaack
