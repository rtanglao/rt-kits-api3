It will revert to a default font if i turn off the ability for sites to choose their own fonts, but this interferes with the functionality of a lot of sites' icons so its not a great solution. This also stops when i go into troubleshooting mode, but when i went through hardware acceleration and my extensions one by one, none of them were the cause. </p><p>images in order: my roll20 homepage with the incorrect font display, the same page with fonts disabled (note the notification icons in the upper right are broken now though), the same page in troubleshoot mode with the correct font display </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",zoe.kierce
