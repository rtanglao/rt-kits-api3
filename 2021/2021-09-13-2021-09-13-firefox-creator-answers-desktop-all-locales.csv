The other Windows PCs did so without trouble, but the Mint PC did not restore the export file correctly:  When I attempt to restore on the Mint PC, I get the folder structure from the original Windows export, but none of the folders is populated with bookmarks; instead, all 5K or so individual bookmarks are listed individually at the top level of my ""Bookmarks Menu"" folder, beneath the list of empty folders. </p><p>I've run the about:support Places Database ""Verify Integrity"" function on both the Windows master PC and on the Mint PC.  The function does not flag any issues. </p><p>Any idea what's going on, and how I can resolve it?  Might there be a bug in the Linux 92.0 that I should report somewhere?
