First, when I had a Firefox or Mozilla I changed computers and when I signed in on the new computer I went to for stored files and hit the start button and went to where my files were stored they were missing.  Just now, I guess I asked for help and I to hit the contact button and then hit it again till finally I got to a page that I  could at least ask someone for help. So who ever sees my question please try to help me or tell me the secret to asking support. I asked this question before thinking support would see it but I had zero reply's. I guess I asked a stupid question and the no reply was what? A reason not to reply? They didn't have an answer? Who knows? I just wanted to find out about my stored files. I'm I supposed to reconnect my old computer to find them? I have another question about printing and Firefox's unique way of storing them different from other browsers? I'll ask that later. Thank you for enabling me to be able to search without worrying if it's private. Others browsers don't!  Please try and help me. Not everyone has deep computer knowledge so I do need help. Thanks, Rob A </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,"",colleenandrob
