For some reason, through no effort on my part, I ended up on the beta channel for the regular browser. </p><p>That was OK until the latest beta (version 90) started showing an extremely annoying bug. On a daily basis, on average, it will stop loading pages for no reason. For that reason, I'd like to get off of the beta channel and get back to using the release version. Would uninstalling the beta version and installing the release version do that for me? Or will I somehow end up back on the beta channel and get upgraded to the beta version again? (If I do have to uninstall the beta and install the release, I want to keep all of the settings, bookmarks, plugins, etc. that I have in that browser. I have the Dev Edition browser set up to never sync, so it has a different set of settings, etc., which I don't want carried over to the other browser.) </p>",desktop;beta;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1426557;,rholstein
