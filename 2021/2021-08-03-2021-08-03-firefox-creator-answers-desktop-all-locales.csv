However when I disconnect and try to continue browsing, it takes up to 3 minutes for FF to load the pages again. </p><p>I'd like to ask if there is an option to modify the time for FF to check for the pac file? the MS Edge does not take more then 5 seconds to detect the change. </p><p>Thanks Regards Jan </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jd28
