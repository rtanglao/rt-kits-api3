However, for some reason it keeps coming back, and I've discovered that it happens whenever I download something. This seems to happen regardless of where I save something or where the pop-up for choosing the download destination automatically opens to. It also seems to be specific to firefox, as this doesn't seem to happen with other browsers. </p><p>I should add that it's only the folder itself that comes back. Before I originally deleted it, I emptied its contents and it's only the empty folder that keeps reappearing on my desktop </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",notabot2001

Luckily, I found a workaround with this issue by setting `apz.gtk.kinetic_scroll.enabled` to `false` and increasing the default value of `general.smoothScroll.mouseWheel.durationMinMS` from `50` to `120`. However, there is still minor quirk with my scrolling experience especially at the end of each scroll or each time I pause scrolling. </p><p>This minor quirk has a lot to do with how I do the two-finger scroll gesture. For each scroll, I don't necessarily lift my fingers up immediately. I might pause for a while then scroll further until my finger reaches the end of the touchpad or I might scroll in the opposite direction without lifting my finger up. However, just having two of my fingers rest on the touchpad detects even the slightest movement. The effect is a page slightly shakes each time I pause scrolling without lifting my fingers up. Although, this minimal shake also occurs as I lift my finger up. </p><p>This behavior is detailed in a bug report <a href=""https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gtk/-/issues/1079"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> . It might have something to do with Wayland but based on my experience, the issue still persists when running Firefox through XWayland. Also, Vivaldi (Chromium) which also runs in XWayland, doesn't show this problem. In Vivaldi, the touchpad will be less sensitive (at least that's how it feels for me) each time I pause scrolling. </p><p>I already tried fiddling with the following through the `about:config` to no avail: </p> <ul><li> apz.touch_move_tolerance </li><li> apz.touch_start_tolerance </li><li> mousewheel.transaction.ignoremovedelay </li><li> mousewheel.transaction.timeout </li></ul>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",lewisbolaton

Years ago, Firefox changed from having the normal ""File Edit View History"" etc. as the default interface and tried to streamline everything into icons.  I have no idea why.  Maybe it had something to do with the mobile version.  With a few customizations I was able to get the old look back, with my address bar. </p><p>Then a while back the address bar changed.   It used to be that the address bar had a drop down that listed the sites you used most frequently.   At some point mine just sortof froze and only lists the same 8 sites.  Except its worse because 2 of them are now searches for Google and Amazon and not even the original google or amazon web pages.  I cannot delete pages from this list like I could in the past, either. </p><p>Also, you could, you know... put an address in the address bar and it would take you directly to that site.   Now it tries to do a search just as often as it actually takes me to the correct site. </p><p>This forcing search engines baffles me, because there's an actual search bar, right directly next to the address bar by default. </p><p>So if someone could help me understand how I can change my address bar back to being an address bar, that would be a great help to me.   Second, if I could fix the drop down of sites to either be my most frequent sites, or a list of sites I add manually, that would be great also. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,other,en-US,1405056;1405062;1405063;1405064;,theopheus
