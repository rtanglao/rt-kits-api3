So the bookmarks at the bottom don't fit in the window, and to get to the ones I can't see, I have to click the arrow at the bottom.  But making it worse, is that if I do go to the bottom, the next time I open the bookmark tab, the list will open at the bottom (it doesn't revert to the top).  So I'd have to scroll up to get to the ones at the top. </p><p>I list my bookmarks in the order they're in so I can get to the ones I go to most often as fast as possible.  So they're at the top - I don't have to scroll far to get to them.  I also use the ""Other Bookmarks"" tab since that's at the top.  But sometimes that's hidden and I have to scroll up to get to access that as well.    </p><p>Also, this update changed the size of the command windows - the copy/paste window, the ""open in new tab"" window, and the window to get the correct spelling of the word.  They're so big, they run from the top of the screen to bottom, instead of a small square.  So you'll have to scroll way up to get to the command or word you want.    </p><p>I can't stand this.   </p><p>There was a simple work-around.  Changing the proton preferences to false.  But they removed them with 90.   I posted a message on these boards a few weeks ago asking for them not to be removed.   Of course it didn't do any good.  </p><p>There supposedly is a ""fix"" to this, but it has to do with CSS - whatever the heck that is and I'm not even going to attempt to figure it out.   Fixing this should NOT be complicated at all (like the proton preferences).  And besides, even that CSS thing won't bring everything back to what is was.  So why bother?  </p><p>More scrolling, bigger command windows, etc., are not that big of a deal, but that's not the point.  Why can't they leave well enough alone?  What part of ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it,"" do they not understand?  If I wanted a tedious way to access my bookmarks, I'd use Chrome!  </p><p>I know it won't happen, but how can we get them to reset the bookmarks and command windows back to the way they were?   Is that asking too much?  Ask a silly question... </p><p>If their objective is to lose Firefox users, congratulations.

It is so fast in opening the first window to the loading of webpages its instant. I am on cloudflare dns and that is the fastest around. Then when I check Edge or normal Google's Chrome version and compare it to Firefox I see a day and night difference on the rendering engine. I run on an 8700K PC but boy is it faster on edge chromium. The only reason I haven't switched is the interface is larger compared to firefox, on edge browsing bookmarks is difficult as I have to scroll a lot before I get to what I wan't but on firefox it is much slimmer so I don't have to scroll the fat bookmarks dropdown menu like in edge. But That is the only thing that is holding me back. Could you guys please not reinvent the wheel diverging to think what more a browser must do to what can a browser do well that it already does and just get Firefox to loading websites faster, your Geko engine is beaten dead by Chrome's engine. They are ridiculously faster in perceptualy seeing that webpages drop on your screen in seconds and dns resolution does not take such back and forth. The whole page just drops when firefox pieces all of the webpage as you sit and look at it to render. Could it not just appear instantly and start clicking on links to further browse on. Leave everything you are doing and just make it render faster than chromium and you would have your userbase back. Privacy is great I do like the new bells and whistles protecting me. On desktops at least could you not unleash the full multicore capability of process crunching to get the webpages to load. I am on an 110 Mbps Download, 10Mbps Upload, 7ms Ping connection and then there is cloudflare. Tried different DNS providers like quad dns, cleanbrowsing, opendns etc but on edge and chrome still faster. Tried fiddling with network trr mode and dns doh on firefox settings, tried various troubleshooting methods but still firefox takes time to resolve dns from initial press of the link to rendering the webpage via gpu or even disabling web gfx. I don't have time to type all of what I have tried here it will become a bible. So just saying under the hood do something so that Firefox renders and loads webpages fast, this is the basic principle of a web browser to browse the web without hinderance or annoyance. Oh and also I am running my Windows 10 OS on Intel Optane 900P so that isn't a bottleneck at all. Thas pure Optane drive no cache or QLC attached drivel.   Yes I know all about addons disabling and firefox refresh and startup cache reset and all the other shenanigans. I am not a noob, tried about:config improvements as well. So no Firefox does not by any measure come close to loading webpages as fast as chrome does. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-900;firefox-9002;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",sortmyit

If there is a way, please tell me. --First try was to open a second window and drag it to the other monitor. Minor problem, that was considered a popup, but was allowed to OK it. I intended to use parent/child window communication but the two windows weren't from the same 'domain' (come now - they were from the same directory). Hmm, the popup problem may be due to where I do the open (just found a demo that did not have a problem from a &lt;a&gt; or &lt;input type=button&gt; --Second try, I switched to postMessage() communication. That ran into problems when I coded (roughly) &lt;button onclick=""Send_Message('1 ',+FontSizeO.value+', '+x3+',  '+x4+', '+x5)""&gt;Pause Clock&lt;/button&gt; Only two parameters were being passed to Send_message - FontSizeO.value+', '+x3+',  '+x4+', '+x5 was being sent a a single string as the second parameter to the function. I used the following code to fix that problem: function Send_Message()	{ 	X= arguments.join(',');Z=Z.split(','); 	SubWin.postMessage(Z,""*"") } Later I changed the button to &lt;button onclick=""Start_Clock()""&gt;Start Clock&lt;/button&gt;<br> coding the function call outside the onclick worked --Next problem was the &lt;audio&gt; wasn't being heard from the 'popup' window. I got around that by using a postMessage to the parent window to play the &lt;audio&gt; (also). It seems like an unecessary . --Recap, while I got around the problems, I would still like help for the following issues: 1) Coding HTML for two monitors. 2) Allowing parent/child window communication with widows generated from same directory (Yes, I know if I moved code to a server that shouldn't be an issue). A config parameter would do. 3) Need to fix problem with &lt;button onclick=""....""&gt;not passing more than two parameters to a called function. 4) Sound from the 'popup' window. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Col_Boogie
