But I can't find anything that looks like a match in about:config: There is a setting for security.password.lifetime, but I the only information on it is contradictory, and does not match what I experience. -Nath Rao </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-900;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",nathrao

I intended to use parent/child window communication but the two windows weren't from the same 'domain' (come now - they were from the same directory). Hmm, the popup problem may be due to where I do the open (just found a demo that did not have a problem from a &lt;a&gt; or &lt;input type=button&gt; --Second try, I switched to postMessage() communication.
