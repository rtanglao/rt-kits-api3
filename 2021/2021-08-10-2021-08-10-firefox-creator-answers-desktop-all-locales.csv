It tells me to download the mobile app on desktop and everything is very stretched out. I assume the website is trying to fit everything to width and displaying ads for their mobile app because it thinks I'm on a mobile device. </p>",desktop;websites;firefox-900;firefox-9002;,firefox,websites,en-US,1433759;,alexdam030

Disappeared and I'm pretty ticked off about it. Because I like my Firefox add-ons, and I shouldn't have to deal with losing them from time-to-time, same with my bookmarks, + I didn't get a response on my Google Play review so at very least you people should at least acknowledge me. Otherwise, I'm done with your browser it's not worth keeping anymore. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;needsinfo;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1433757;,NickDavidson19

First I would say that in the past I would use FF over all other browsers, but something happened in the past year that is making it unproductive to use the browser. Particularly when you lose setting and passwords saved.  </p><p>Is there a way to stop notifications? </p><p>As a professional that has important work to do, I am considering removing the FF browser from the computer. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",xcorp1
