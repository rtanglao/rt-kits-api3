I wanted a two monitor transaction. One for person sitting at the PC and another for the audience to see. I found there may be something in the works to allow html to do that, but don't think it is implemented yet. If there is a way, please tell me. --First try was to open a second window and drag it to the other monitor. Minor problem, that was considered a popup, but was allowed to OK it. I intended to use parent/child window communication but the two windows weren't from the same 'domain' (come now - they were from the same directory). Hmm, the popup problem may be due to where I do the open (just found a demo that did not have a problem from a &lt;a&gt; or &lt;input type=button&gt; --Second try, I switched to postMessage() communication. That ran into problems when I coded (roughly) &lt;button onclick=""Send_Message('1 ',+FontSizeO.value+', '+x3+',  '+x4+', '+x5)""&gt;Pause Clock&lt;/button&gt; Only two parameters were being passed to Send_message - FontSizeO.value+', '+x3+',  '+x4+', '+x5 was being sent a a single string as the second parameter to the function. I used the following code to fix that problem: function Send_Message()	{ 	X= arguments.join(',');Z=Z.split(','); 	SubWin.postMessage(Z,""*"") } Later I changed the button to &lt;button onclick=""Start_Clock()""&gt;Start Clock&lt;/button&gt;<br> coding the function call outside the onclick worked --Next problem was the &lt;audio&gt; wasn't being heard from the 'popup' window. I got around that by using a postMessage to the parent window to play the &lt;audio&gt; (also). It seems like an unecessary . --Recap, while I got around the problems, I would still like help for the following issues: 1) Coding HTML for two monitors. 2) Allowing parent/child window communication with widows generated from same directory (Yes, I know if I moved code to a server that shouldn't be an issue). A config parameter would do. 3) Need to fix problem with &lt;button onclick=""....""&gt;not passing more than two parameters to a called function. 4) Sound from the 'popup' window. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Col_Boogie

It tells me to download the mobile app on desktop and everything is very stretched out. I assume the website is trying to fit everything to width and displaying ads for their mobile app because it thinks I'm on a mobile device. </p>",desktop;websites;firefox-900;firefox-9002;,firefox,websites,en-US,1433759;1433764;,alexdam030

Particularly when you lose setting and passwords saved.  </p><p>Is there a way to stop notifications? </p><p>As a professional that has important work to do, I am considering removing the FF browser from the computer. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",xcorp1
