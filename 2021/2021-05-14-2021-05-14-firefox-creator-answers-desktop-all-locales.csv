It's not obsolete, I use it for work, and a good one third of my browsing is easily ftp sites such as <a href=""http://NetBSD.org"" rel=""nofollow"">NetBSD.org</a>, <a href=""http://ftp.gnu.org"" rel=""nofollow"">ftp.gnu.org</a> and others. FTP is still used heavily.  </p><p>I really really dislike that it's gone. I'd gladly spend 30-40$ a year for a paid version. </p><p>I've been using you guys back to Mozilla, Firebird, Netscape and even earlier ..possibly related was NCSA Mosaic. C'mon guys.. which Millenial decided FTP was obsolete and uncool because it was old? It's how most of the Open Source projects and distributions still move data around. :~(  This is the first time since I started using Netscape/Mozilla/etc that you've ever done something I don't like.  The last thing I want to do is be forced to use Chrome or some other garbage. Please.. bring it back or some sort of external module we can pay for to get browsing back.  Please! I beg you. (Trying hard to be really civil and nice here ..truely baffled that it'd be removed). </p><p>A. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,1412719;,vk2fvax
