I'm posting in this forum because this only happens when I go there in Firefox.  If I use Chrome or Edge (i.e. Chrome rebranded) I get the U.S. version of the GD site.  I've verified that my public IP, currently 98.43.226.196, is in fact registered to Comcast.  I've cleared cookies and cache, restarted Firefox, but GD still sends Firefox to its India version.

I am on a new installation and know it is not due to any malware. It's beginning to get annoying to have to consistently delete bookmarks that I did not want.

Oddly enough it can sometimes be multiples of the same webpage I visted and I don't remember ever touching the address bar.  Is there another way firefox can add bookmarks in the middle of the toolbar?  Also is there a way I can ""Lock"" the toolbar, not allowing any more bookmarks to be added unless I unlock it?

I hoped setting signon.includeOtherSubdomainsInLookup = false on the about:config page would work but it does not. </p><p>Suggestions? </p>",windows-7;desktop;websites;firefox-780;,firefox,websites,en-US,1412762;1412774;1412806;,couger69
