I currently have Windows 10 and Microsoft Edge.  But Edge will not allow me to download the program:  it sends me a message that it is blocked.  I've spent several hours trying to untangle this problem with FTM support and doing my own research on the 'net.  The latest suggestion is that I try a different browser and Firefox was suggested.  Now I'm not interested in becoming computer savvy;  I just want to do genealogy.  Is this something Firefox can support without thirteen pages of instruction? My second question:  I will have to buy a new operating system this fall as Windows 10 is apparently no longer supported.  What program would you recommend?  Thanks ahead of time for your help. </p>,desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1412688;,dyankeetwoo

Display issues: Titlebar, Borders",<p>I'm using Firefox 88.0.1 for Linux on a Chromebook running OS Ver. 91.... which uses Linux 5.4.109-26059-gc7455b8ce0e0 right now - but started on Ver. 88 or something and whatever version of Linix that used. Anybody know why I can't turn the title bar off and why the screen rendering generally looks a bit flaky? I'm guessing it has something to do with the display manager that Google use and that it's not responding any of the Firefox settings.
