I'm using Windows 10 with the latest updates and the latest Firefox developer edition. The problem has been around for about a year and is really bothersome. My processor up to i7 2760qm, I have 16gb of ram. I will also add that in my second laptop with core 2 duo, this also happens only with me, no one who has this problem.

(Ubuntu 20.04),"<p>I got a second hand HP Spectre x360 (2015) today which came with Ubuntu 20.04 preinstalled and it seemed fine at first but when I connected to the internet I found Firefox to be incredibly slow to load any site I tried to access. Trying to watch a video on youtube took about two minutes to load. Facebook and Gmail both refuse to load properly at all. No matter what site I try, it seems to take at least 30 seconds to load, if it loads at all. This might be the slowest computer I've ever used, and I remember the 90s! I know the internet connection isn't the problem since my other devices work perfectly. I tried to download some other browsers (Chrome, Opera, Vivaldi) to see if Firefox was causing the issue but they all failed to download properly (error message ""failed to install file: not supported"").  </p><p>I'm at a loss. I've tried searching for answers online which suggested fiddling with the proxy settings and going to about:config to toggle the ""network.dns.disableIPv6"" from ""false"" to ""true"". and nothing seems to have helped so far. Any ideas please? I like the computer but it's totally unusable for me at this point. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-910;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1446084;1446103;,geosebastian89
