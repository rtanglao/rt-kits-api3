Then all of a sudden, Firefox would crash several times a day. I looked and Firefox had updated me to ver 89.0. But I let it ride.  Then Firefox about a month ago, Firefox stsrted to crash EVERY DAY. Then one day it crashed EIGHT TIMES IN A ROW and I mean when I hit RESTART, IT WOULD CRASH. I tried to revert to rel 88 but Mozilla WILL NOT ALLOW US TO REVERT BACK TO A PREVIOUS VERSION. When you do, the PROFILE gives you TWO OPTIONS: '<em><strong>EXIT or CREATE A NEW PROFILE.'</strong></em> Certainly you do not want to CREATE A NEW PROFILE as you will LOSE, your history, add-ons, Bookmarks, EVERYTHING and you see a WHITE Firefox screen with nothing. So I choose EXIT and tried to put up with the CRAPPY ver 89. BUT FIREFOX KEPT CRASHING. TODAY IT CRASHED SIX TIMES IN A ROW......When I checked the VERSION, YOU HAD UPGRADED TO VER  91.0b6 (64-bit) AND IT IS NO BETTER. </p><p>WHAT IN THE HECK IS GOING ON. I DO NOT WANT TO LEARN CHROME OR EDGE AS I HAVE USED FIREFOX SINCE VERSION 1.0. </p><p>DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO GO BACK AND KEEP YOUR OLD PROFILE, FLACKY OR NOT AS THAT IS BETTER THAN 'RESTARTING' FIREFOX ALL THE TIME.  </p><p>MY VERSION 88 NEVER FAILED. </p>",desktop;beta;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",jagman55
