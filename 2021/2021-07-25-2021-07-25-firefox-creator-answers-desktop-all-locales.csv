Since I never use Chrome, I decided to check if Firefox was at the latest version.  When I clicked into options, I saw a notice saying that Firefox is not my default browser.  I thought that somehow something had messed up my settings since I made Firefox my default browser when I first bought this computer over a yea ago, so I clicked the button to set it as default.  That took me to Windows settings which showed that Firefox was already my default browser. </p><p>Since then I have restarted the computer multiple times; upgraded to Firefox 90 and restarted; deleted Chrome; reset Firefox; gone to Windows settings and changed my default browser to Edge. then later reset it back to Firefox. </p><p>The Firefox options STILL indicate that Firefox is not my default browser. </p><p>What is going on?
