My Settings' History ""Firefox will"" has been set to ""Remember History"" for many years.  I shut down my laptop and turned on my laptop and saw the same behavior.   </p><p>I would have attached to this message a screenshot that shows the Library window, but could not because when uploading my screenshot, the Uploaded images' area showed a rotating circle that kept rotating for at least ten minutes and I got tired of it wasting my valuable time.  The image's size is 63 KB.  I tried uploading using Firefox and Chrome and both showed the same behavior. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-950;firefox-9502;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",rxyicefirefa

I input my email and password, and get told that Firefox has sent a code to my email. I enter the code, but then get told ""Incorrect Password"". However, I know the password is correct, since it sent me the email code and if I do put in an incorrect password, it does not do that. It does not say that the code was wrong. </p><p>In addition, since I have two email addresses associated with my account, it requires me to put in my primary address, but then changes it to my other address (which is the one I made the account with). </p><p>I tried doing a fresh install of Firefox, but it does not seem to have helped. </p><p>This is very frustrating, because I had to make an entirely new account to post this, since I could not sign in to my normal account. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,sync,en-US,1470274;1470284;,pmsinclair+firefoxbackup

Since then, I've completely reinstalled firefox several times, with no addons-I also tried the beta and nightly versions, and even Waterfox, and still run into this problem. It seems to be an issue that strikes a lot of firefox users, and I haven't been able to find a fix yet. </p><p>In short: copy image paste image into discord (it doesn't matter if it's ctrl-v or right click paste) two images are attached to the message instead of one </p><p>This only happens to some images, mainly .pngs. I have no idea what is causing this problem and I would appreciate some kind of fix. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1470257;,DHH
