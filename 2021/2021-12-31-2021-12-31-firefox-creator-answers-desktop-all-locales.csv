I had three tabs open, one google showing the search results, and two of the search results. The browser was running like this in the background, I was working in another application. </p><p>After some time I noticed, that the windows taskbar indicated that two windows for firefox were opened. I clicked on the taskbar, and saw that the second one was a ""Please enter your main password"" dialog. It was only the dialog, no additional firefox window. </p><p>This behavior seems very weird to me. Usually the password prompt only opens, when a page contains a login. Then it is a modal dialog that is displayed on top of the active window. It is not shown as a separate window in the taskbar. </p><pre>Could this be some kind of virus that is trying to steal my stored passwords? </pre> <p>The following additional information may be relevant: - The system was freshly installed two days ago, completely wiping the main harddisk. The latest version of firefox was installed. I copied my old profile into the %APPDATA% folder, but chose ""start fresh"" during installation, so bookmarks etc. were imported, but extensions were deleted. Apart from that only thunderbird and anti virus software was installed. - Only two extensions are installed: ublock origin and umatrix, both by Raymond Gorrhill. - I do not use firefox sync and do not have firefox login active - I do not use AVG or ESET as antivirus solution, but BitDefender. However BitDefender also uses some MITM stuff to inspect HTTPS traffic. - None of the opened tabs contained a login for which I have stored credentials. Upon restarting the browser and reopening the tabs it was not reproducible. Also it hasn't happened again after this. - I thoroughly scanned the system (BitDefender Virus scan, MBAM System Scan with rootkit scan activated and with a linux rescue CD containing multiple virus scanners (Sophos, Kaspersky and Open Threat Scanner). No findings at all. </p><p>Any ideas about this? Do you guys think that is a virus that is somehow using firefox software to trick me into decrypting my passwords? Or is this normal behavior that might happen? </p><p>Thanks a lot for your support, Felix </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1470340;1470344;,f.schollmeyer

(It used to not happen at all. I am visiting the same websites I always have.)  Each time it takes anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes to buffer enough to continue playing. It pretty much ruins any movie or show that I'm watching. I use CCleaner to keep the computer clean. I have W10. I clear history on FF DAILY.  My download speed on <a href=""http://speedtest.com"" rel=""nofollow"">speedtest.com</a> consistently runs between 43-48Mb.  </p><p>I'm wondering if there are any settings or about:config options that will decrease this buffering and return me to smooth streaming. In ""settings"" I unchecked ""use hardware acceleration when available"" and that seemed to help for about 24 hours - so it wasn't the main problem.  Is there a cache for video somewhere that I can increase, so that the streaming has enough ""room""?  Please forgive me; I am not the least bit tech-y, so my online searches are just tragic - I don't really know what to ask!~ </p><p>Any help will be SO appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-950;firefox-9502;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1470302;,Anaya

There is only one thing (so far) that make me more comfortable using Chrome is its recall of  ""Form Input History"".   ( I am not a IT person, the terms I use below might not be accurate) </p><p>FF does remember form history, but limited to normal form (e.g. login page on most websites),  but <strong>it is not able to remember or recall many Form input field history (e.g. Google Form)</strong>.  I am not sure if it is called ""Ajax Form"" or not.  But many website forms are more like Google Form, which FF just couldn't recall the form history contents/input, and I have to manually type for the repeated form filling.    Our company is using Google Form to record visitors info together with some staff particulars and locations info.  The staff particulars and location info are very much repeated to a small group of staffs located at a specific location.  However, use of drop-down list or checkbox is also not practical to our situation, as there could be hundreds of staffs using this form in many various locations.   Hence, my team have to use Chrome, as it could remember the input history for staff and location particulars.  (I am not asking for Auto-Filling, but selection of input history).  </p><p>The relevant questions i search online / forum are all related to Auto-filling and Form History.   Yes, my FF setting is correct, FF does remember a very very small handful of webpage, but majority not.    Understand, it could be security concern (you may set disabled by default), but it would still be our option to use (if it is available).
