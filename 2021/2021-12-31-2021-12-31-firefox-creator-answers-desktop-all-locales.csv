I clicked on the taskbar, and saw that the second one was a ""Please enter your main password"" dialog. It was only the dialog, no additional firefox window. </p><p>This behavior seems very weird to me. Usually the password prompt only opens, when a page contains a login. Then it is a modal dialog that is displayed on top of the active window. It is not shown as a separate window in the taskbar. </p><pre>Could this be some kind of virus that is trying to steal my stored passwords? </pre> <p>The following additional information may be relevant: - The system was freshly installed two days ago, completely wiping the main harddisk. The latest version of firefox was installed. I copied my old profile into the %APPDATA% folder, but chose ""start fresh"" during installation, so bookmarks etc. were imported, but extensions were deleted. Apart from that only thunderbird and anti virus software was installed. - Only two extensions are installed: ublock origin and umatrix, both by Raymond Gorrhill. - I do not use firefox sync and do not have firefox login active - I do not use AVG or ESET as antivirus solution, but BitDefender. However BitDefender also uses some MITM stuff to inspect HTTPS traffic. - None of the opened tabs contained a login for which I have stored credentials. Upon restarting the browser and reopening the tabs it was not reproducible. Also it hasn't happened again after this. - I thoroughly scanned the system (BitDefender Virus scan, MBAM System Scan with rootkit scan activated and with a linux rescue CD containing multiple virus scanners (Sophos, Kaspersky and Open Threat Scanner). No findings at all. </p><p>Any ideas about this? Do you guys think that is a virus that is somehow using firefox software to trick me into decrypting my passwords?

There is only one thing (so far) that make me more comfortable using Chrome is its recall of  ""Form Input History"".   ( I am not a IT person, the terms I use below might not be accurate) </p><p>FF does remember form history, but limited to normal form (e.g. login page on most websites),  but <strong>it is not able to remember or recall many Form input field history (e.g. Google Form)</strong>.  I am not sure if it is called ""Ajax Form"" or not.  But many website forms are more like Google Form, which FF just couldn't recall the form history contents/input, and I have to manually type for the repeated form filling.    Our company is using Google Form to record visitors info together with some staff particulars and locations info.  The staff particulars and location info are very much repeated to a small group of staffs located at a specific location.  However, use of drop-down list or checkbox is also not practical to our situation, as there could be hundreds of staffs using this form in many various locations.   Hence, my team have to use Chrome, as it could remember the input history for staff and location particulars.  (I am not asking for Auto-Filling, but selection of input history).  </p><p>The relevant questions i search online / forum are all related to Auto-filling and Form History.   Yes, my FF setting is correct, FF does remember a very very small handful of webpage, but majority not.    Understand, it could be security concern (you may set disabled by default), but it would still be our option to use (if it is available).
