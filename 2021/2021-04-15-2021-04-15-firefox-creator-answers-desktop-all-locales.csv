At first, the marked webpage will only show names but not the link, when i click on the bookmarks that i saved it won't direct me to page. Now even worse, the bookmark function doesn't work at all. I tried restore all my settings and redownloaded firefox three times, it's always the same problem. Also the<strong> history </strong> function doesn't store my current browsing history at all. I 100% sure I didn't change anything at the privacy section. </p>",mac-os;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-870;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",xchristina5945
