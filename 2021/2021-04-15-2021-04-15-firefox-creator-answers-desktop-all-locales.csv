Zaznaczyłam w opcjach: przywracanie poprzednich sesji, ale to nie działa. Nie rozumiem tego.  Jak miałam Windowsa, to nigdy nie było z tym problemu. A pracuje przy kilkudziesięciu otwartych kartach i nie wyobrażam sobie, żebym miała je za każdym razem otwierać pojedynczo...  Z jednej grupy wsparcia Apple dostałam informacje, że Mac ma swoją przeglądarkę: Safarii i żebym jej zaczęłam używać. Ale ja nie chcę innej przeglądarki. Mam za dużo zapamiętanych kart, żeby je przenosić i nie chcę uczyć się kolejnej aplikacji.  Dodatkowo powiedziano mi, że Mac nie lubi innych oprogramowań niż swoje. Idąc tym torem, nie można by używać Photoshopa, Adobe PDF, i wiele wiele innych aplikacji, bo Mac ich nie wyprodukował... To jakiś absurd! Proszę o pomoc, jak otwierać przeglądarkę z kartami z poprzedniej sesji?  </p><p>Martyna </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;sessionrestorebroken;firefox-870;,firefox,other,en-US,1406090;1406092;,martyna.kondratowicz

I am struggling to understand why my website page containers go nuts on Firefox. I tried so much, I payed a good developer who told me the issue was over, but it is still there. I'm trying everything but my project is being a failure due to very nasty WP Theme issues, like this one. I had to spend my time fixing the Theme and my project completely past its deadline.  Maybe I'm going to be fired, without fox.  </p><p>I clearly cannot add site credentials for anybody, but maybe some developer knows what could be of help.  </p><p>It seems that the issue has something to do with page Container and Flex attribute. The website is a Wordpress site and the page is built with WPBakery Visual Editor. All updated, no customizations, pages should work easy... As you can see the page title is ok, but then inside the main page container, the Visual Editor rows (which have display = flex) behave as if they had no width. Despite that, changing the flex attribute to display = block targeting FF specifically through Css, it doesn't seem to work either.  It's not something simple just as a Row option inside the Visual Editor.  </p><p>Please see attachments. Many pages behave like that. My questions:  - is there a possibility to speak with Firefox assistance and get a clue?   - did any developer from community, experience something similar before? How did you manage to solve it?  - Firefox, why are you behaving like that with an old supporter?  </p><p>Thank you to anybody spending his time to help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1406087;,sviluppo5
