But now I have concert tickets stored on my phone and this forces me to use Firefox browser. So I changed the settings to Firefox but DuckDuckGo continues to be the browser that I'm using even though when I go back and check the settings it says Firefox. So I'm going to have to delete DuckDuckGo. I'm already very unhappy that I'm being forced to use Firefox which does not seem to provide as much cover as ducked up go and ultimately back to Chrome if things continue in this convoluted complicated unhelpful manner. It just seems like technology is going backwards I understand that we're making advances but when it comes to simple tasks like going to a concert things have gotten horribly out of control My work site is practically frozen up with problems. And it's because they keep adding on instead of just simplifying and securing and battening down the hatches. They've got to stop trying to do so many different things </p>,desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",tsargard2000
