Even if I try to change the https that Firefox has recently started to insert in view-source URLs, it still doesn't allow me to view the source code of the website. </p><p>Firefox is the only browser that I know of that does this. Google Chrome allows you to view the website's source code, even if the website's URL begins with http. This hasn't always been the case, but it has been the case since I last updated Firefox. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",calumchilds
