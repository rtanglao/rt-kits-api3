Les escribo porque he pensado seriamente en cambiar de CHROME a FIREFOX (u otro buscador), porque Chrome viene presentando problemas con Windows10. El caso es que Chrome se cuelga y debo buscar el Administrador de Tareas de Chrome para finalizar procesos que consumen una enorme cantidad de CPU. El hecho es que cada día que pasa, el problema se agudiza y decidí cambiar. Debo indicar que escribí el caso al Foro de Google CHROME hace más de un mes y aun no recibo respuestas. Triste, porque anteriormente tenían un buen servicio de apoyo y ayuda. Debo indicarles que probé con EDGE y en principio todo migró correctamente. Sin embargo, como buen producto de Microsoft, es invasivo y lo hace paso a paso. Como ejemplo, si usted busca un video, lo hace BING y si usted envía ese enlace, hace que EDGE se abra en el dispositivo receptor y no el buscador predeterminado. Es el caso que actualicé FIREFOX y seguí las instrucciones para migrar todo lo que tengo en Chrome para Firefox y para ser franco, es un proceso complicado. Primero, las instrucciones que aparecen en la ayuda no especifican bienlos pasos. Es decir, asumen que uno ya sabe todos los pasos y lo dirigen a uno donde uno NO SABE COMO LLEGAR. Terrible. Luego de varios intentos, eliminar Firefox y montarlo nuevamente, aparentemente hay incompatibilidades de mi cuenta de Google y la cuenta de Firefox. Para muestra, aun espero que todos los marcadores migren y los que han migrado, ninguno tiene su icono con excepción de los más usados. Igual con la página principal que se monta la de Firefox que NO ACTUALIZA lo iconos y uno debe adivinar.  Verdaderamente, no se que hacer; porque si esto sigue así, lamentablemente tendré que usar EDGE con sus limitaciones e invasividad. Obviamente, algunas extensiones no pasan y hay otras que,si bien deberían existir, aun no se como hacer para encontrarlas en FIREFOX ADD-ONS.  S bien a la fecha cuento con 70 años, les indico que he venido trabajando con Internet, Correos, Buscadores y otras herramientas desde el año 1988. Y verdaderamente, cada vez las instruccions son menos explícitas y repito, no soy novato en esas lides. Pregunto: ¿Será posible procurar INSTRUCCIONES PASO A PASO para los novatos en Firefox y hacer la migración como debe ser? Si no es posible, ¿que puedo hacer? Cualquier observación, consideración o recomendación de su parte será bien recibida. Y por favor, no crean que por la edad, no puedo hacer cosas. Tengo experiencia, pero eso no vale de nada si los que dan información, no saben lo que es un servicioal usuario. Mil gracias de antemano, RAFAELE.

In Chrome, IE, Edge the user is then correctly redirected to our shopping cart page. But in Firefox, the redirection to the cart is not done and the users still see the Punchout inbound page which is empty.  We already tried to switch off the Enhanced Tracking Protection for our site and the punchout site. But that didn't help.
