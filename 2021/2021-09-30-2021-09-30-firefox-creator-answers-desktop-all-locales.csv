I can see in my email account that I was informed of that and I must have logged in since I also have an email with a verification code from Firefox sent from accounts@firefox.com . </p><p>Fast forward to today, I try to log in and I'm asked a verification code. After reading all the docs I understand that I should have received another such email with a 6 digit verification code. I haven't. I tried to have it resent. It didn't. I waited. I have added accounts@firefox.com to my contacts, no luck. I can see from the email where 2FA was activated that I am on the same device I used back then. Since it is a Mac I'm not sure how to verify it since all verification is via email and I'm not receiving any emails. (even though, again, I had no issues to receive emails when the 2FA was set up) </p><p>I don't have the recovery codes (I'm not sure if I may have received them via email too?) and I am not logged into my Firefox account in any devices. </p><p>How should I proceed? This is very frustrating. </p><p>I can show proof of same device/email access etc if needed. </p><p>PS: I had to create this new account just to post a question. </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-920;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",boixadosj

User is not redirected to shopping cart.,"<p>Hi everyone, Users log in to our shop system from SAP via OCI. Our page is called from SAP in a frame. Then they connect again via OCI to an external Punchout shop. They add some products to the cart and the cart from the external shop is transferred back to our shop system via OCI.  In Chrome, IE, Edge the user is then correctly redirected to our shopping cart page. But in Firefox, the redirection to the cart is not done and the users still see the Punchout inbound page which is empty.  We already tried to switch off the Enhanced Tracking Protection for our site and the punchout site. But that didn't help. Have anyone has an idea what could fix the problem? </p><p>Any help will be much appreciated. </p><p>Thank you in advance. </p><p>Regards </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1447237;1447249;,marek.paw
