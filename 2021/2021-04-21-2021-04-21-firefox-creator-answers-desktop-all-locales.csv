After that I tried to download same file from other mirror but that one was blocked as well.  In the end, I have downloaded one of those (download anyway) and cancelled the other.  But now I have that file shown every time firefox starts.  Deleting that from download history does not help. What / where do I need to delete to get rid of that file?

Now my bookmarks list is so long I have to scroll down to see everything. It looks like everything has been spaced out further, which I hate. It takes up was too much space.  They were probably going for a more elegant, less cluttered look, but it just ended up making things more aggravating for me.  There should be a way to adjust or turn off the spacing feature. Any suggestions? </p>",desktop;beta;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",gmkorn1

This only happens in firefox by the way, and i happened to see in the firefox preferences in the section where you can select the folder where all downloads are going to automatically be stored, as example C:Downloads the most common example without asking for confirmation, or the other option says ""Ask every time where to save files"" i have that option checked, but in the other option there is the path of that folder that is magically created after downloading something.  So here goes my question: Can i prevent firefox from creating that folder? If i delete it, everything works fine until i decide to download something else in a folder that i want, that folder is just created again. Its not a big deal since is empty, but is there a way of this not happening anymore? Ill provide capture of the config section i'm talking about.  Thanks and sorry if you can't understand me well, i'm not english native speaker. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,download-and-install,es,"",danihorvat

See the screen shots below for the FF 87 vs 88 menus. </p><p>Is there a way to restore or customize the right-click menu options? I want to change ""Copy Link"" back to ""Copy Link Location"" and for the ""a"" in ""Location"" to be underlined.   For many years, possibly decades, I have been using right click and then tapping the ""A"" key to load the URL part of a link into the copy/paste buffer.  With FF 88 this is now the ""L"" key which is painful as my right hand is on the mouse and my left hand is on the left side of the keyboard. Hitting ""A"" is a no-look-no-brainer for me. For ""L"" it looks like I need to remove my left hand from the mouse, look at the keyboard, and then tap it. </p><p>Related to this is that FF 88 removes ""View Image Information"" from right clicking on images. I also have used this regularly. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,1407389;,mkupper
