If i delete it, everything works fine until i decide to download something else in a folder that i want, that folder is just created again.

See the screen shots below for the FF 87 vs 88 menus. </p><p>Is there a way to restore or customize the right-click menu options? I want to change ""Copy Link"" back to ""Copy Link Location"" and for the ""a"" in ""Location"" to be underlined.   For many years, possibly decades, I have been using right click and then tapping the ""A"" key to load the URL part of a link into the copy/paste buffer.  With FF 88 this is now the ""L"" key which is painful as my right hand is on the mouse and my left hand is on the left side of the keyboard. Hitting ""A"" is a no-look-no-brainer for me. For ""L"" it looks like I need to remove my left hand from the mouse, look at the keyboard, and then tap it. </p><p>Related to this is that FF 88 removes ""View Image Information"" from right clicking on images. I also have used this regularly. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,1407389;,mkupper
