They are both of the same Mozilla support webpage - one on Firefox and one on Safari. The one on Safari looks the way that I would expect it to but Firefox shows it without background colours. On other websites I have noticed that where there are grey fonts on Safari, Firefox shows those fonts all black. </p><p>I first noticed this starting about one week ago but I can't remember anything specific changing around that time but I may have forgotten (age!). I have tried troubleshooting mode and refreshing the browser and I have even created a new profile but the problem persists. It is like this on all websites that I have accessed. </p>",desktop;other;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,"",redochre77

I can't quite find how to fix it. </p><p>Last time, I had the proton tabs disabled and that was pretty much all I needed to fix the issue.  But right now I've got two problems: 1. I really dislike the floating look to them, is there any way to again block the proton update/feel etc? 2. This is the one that's truly got me bananas: the volume icon that one usually got in the tab by default when sound was being reproduced... now only shows when the cursor hovers above it, otherwise it disappears. Is there any way to bring this function back?  </p><p>Please, please help. </p><p>I adore Firefox, have been using it pretty much since 2004 or thereabouts, and would not change it... but sometimes these changes drive me to tears. I'd love it if there was a manual or something that would teach one how to change these things without having to bother anyone elseÂ :( </p><p>Thank you guys!! </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1434237;1434264;,silfer_cartagena
