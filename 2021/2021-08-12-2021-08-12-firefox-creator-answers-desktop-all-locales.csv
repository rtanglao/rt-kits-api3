Using BT Webmail on Firefox, I find that replying to a message won't allow me to 'new line' after a few words. Also, if I continue a line of text to the 'end' of the message window, the text does not wrap around to a new line. Also, If I 'click' the cursor directly under the first line of text, I cannot type any text; the cursor doesn't move. If I then 'new line' again, the cursor disappears. I can only continue writing text by 'clicking' the cursor about 3 lines down, typing, then back spacing that text. Everthing works perfectly with other browsers; it would be a shame to give up on Firefox. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-900;firefox-9002;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",graham.carlisle

Think of our family of USERS, not developers. </p><p>Yes, I understand the circumstances of free software. Yes, I see it is necessary to keep up with modern UI design and the so-called technical progress. The FF 91 UI changes slightly towards what we expect to get in Windows 11. Fine! Also, it is absolutely clear that the new menu line spacing adds more comfort to the FF usability ... on tablet PCs and smart phones. But NOT for desktop users. </p><p>As far as I know, Microsofts plans for Windows 11 still include a setting to keep the old narrow menu item height. Mozilla should do so, too.
