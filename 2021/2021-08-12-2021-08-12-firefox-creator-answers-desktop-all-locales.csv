After allowing the upgrade to v91 (a big mistake as it's been nothing but a disruption to my work), I find removing separators to be finicky compared to older versions.  FYI - in case it matters, I was using the [preferred] NOT BLACK background of 'classic' Firefox in all prior versions. </p><p>A quick right click at the separate was enough to bring up the context menu with DELETE command.  Now, it can take multiple attempts to get just the right spot for this to work.  It seems the separate went from multiple pixels thick to just a single pixel.  Whatever the tech explanation, it sucks. </p><p>Also, I noticed that trying to add a separator to a sub-list of bookmarks, by another separator, apparently keeps focus on the main dropdown list since the separator ends up there rather than on the sub-list I clicked.  I don't do this often so I can't say it never occurred before.  Putting a separator between bookmarks seems ok. </p><p>Am I crazy and just noticing these things now that the dreaded black background is in full effect?  Can these ""improvements"" be negated so working in Firefox is actually easy again?  Can the black menu background be taken back to the classic look (without fooling around with custom coding as I've seen mentioned in other help issues?) </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",jonbarden

I really dislike the floating look to them, is there any way to again block the proton update/feel etc? 2. This is the one that's truly got me bananas: the volume icon that one usually got in the tab by default when sound was being reproduced... now only shows when the cursor hovers above it, otherwise it disappears. Is there any way to bring this function back?  </p><p>Please, please help. </p><p>I adore Firefox, have been using it pretty much since 2004 or thereabouts, and would not change it... but sometimes these changes drive me to tears. I'd love it if there was a manual or something that would teach one how to change these things without having to bother anyone else :( </p><p>Thank you guys!! </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1434237;1434264;,silfer_cartagena

I have confirmed that its firefox causing the issues. I did a system update, firefox updated, my drivers are up to date, other programs pick up0 the audio such as OBS Studio, Discord, Chrome online audio tests work. When I try the same audio tests on Firefox, it doesnt work at all, it pickups that I have my mic plugged in but when it comes to record, it doesnt record any sound. I also did a restart of Firefox. Any help would be appreciated. </p><p><a href=""https://bin.snopyta.org/?603bddd490784b2f#6wm4BfpkyTJLiH9mrAfY65r4RNAimWHFXgUCcneucooT"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bin.snopyta.org/?603bddd490784b2f#6wm4BfpkyTJLiH9mrAfY65r4RNAimWHFXgUCcneucooT</a> </p><p>HyperX Cloud Alpha Mic is what I have the mic labeled as. </p><p>EDIT: Ive tried using other mics and uninstalling Firefox/removing all traces of FF from the pc. FF is still the only program that refuses to access any mic. Everything else uses the mic without issue. I've also tried installing older versions of Firefox and still have the same result. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,1434232;,qandres12
