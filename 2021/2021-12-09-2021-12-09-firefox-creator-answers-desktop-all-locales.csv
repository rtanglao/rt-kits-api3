The Full Screen Button on the keyboard will take Firefox out of full screen, but when you try to use it to put Firefox in Full Screen, the window gets slightly larger, and then goes back to its original size. </p><p>Other applications seem to be able to go to full screen using the Full Screen key that are running under Linux.  For instance, gvim, thunar, meld, and gnucash all will go into full screen with the Full Screen Key. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-950;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ski.brimson

Thus, here is the thing: I work with multiple tabs, and if I open a new tab (Firefox home), start typing and when you have to switch tabs by ctrl+tab so you do it, a text in a new tab text always will be selected. Seems like no problem, however, If I accidentally press keys (except for arrow keys), all search text will disappear right away. Arrow keys only can move a cursor. Therefore, it is just annoying because you always wanna press arrow keys. </p><p>Sorry for my English but I hope you got it rightly. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",m88953455

I will be the next one if someone doesn't help me. AND DO NO respond to me with your computer IT LINGO. I am NOT AN IT person, I don't understand most of your ever-so-helpful (NOT) articles. Speak to me as though I know NOTHING about computers, even though I have used them for 40 years. MOZILLA you need to learn then teach your volunteers how to access my computer walk me through all of the problems I continue to have.  I DID DOWNLOAD the latest v. 95, however, yesterday I downloaded a file and suddenly my OLD FF PAGE showed up and that is where the download went.  HOW does that happen? Trying to get help is another anxiety-ridden experience. This is the 3rd page I've been on to get SOMEONE'S ATTENTION! I, personally, haven't found FireFox to be user-friendly as so many others seem to feel. AND, if you start using BING, I will be gone, NO if, ands, or buts. Bing is a piece of crap! I've tried numerous times to get it off MS Edge only for it to appear again. MS may think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread, but it isn't, even their format is UGLY! </p><p>I thought I finally got the hang of TABS...open tab, select website or whatever you want to open, then you don't lose all the other TABS that are open. HOWEVER, when one is moving along at lightning speed and happens to forget to open a TAB, that's when I want to SCREAM at the top of my lungs because now the other tab I opened is GONE! I'm sure I must be doing something WRONG, NO DOUBT, then teach me how to do it RIGHT!  </p><p>NO MORE WRITTEN ARTICLES, THEY ARE A WASTE OF MY TIME! You may think you've written them in the clearest possible way, but you HAVEN'T. Again, if your audience is for IT people then MAYBE, just maybe they might understand what you've written, but I DO NOT! </p><p>That is the SINGLE MOST ANNOYING habit that every company has. SPEAKING IN COMPUTEREZE. I have worked in the medical field for many years, and the medical field has it's own terminology, words, diagnoses, codes, etc. and if I were to somehow use these words when messaging you, you would be CLUELESS! AND you wouldn't even bother to figure out what I'm asking or how to respond. Specific fields in this country have their own language. My husband worked in Aerospace for years and when he would describe to me what he was working on, it was Greek to me. The list goes on and on. </p><p>WELL, that's what you do now! You can pat yourselves on the back for all of your brilliant directional articles, but many of us out here in the real world are not patting you on the back. </p><p>Get your stuff together, take this email seriously, and perhaps you won't keep losing customers. </p><p>YOU NEED A SPECIFIC LOG-IN PAGE. When I open Firefox and go to the 3 bars I HAVE TO THINK I AM LOGGED IN. There is my Email address and if I click on that account I have many options. Two of which are manage account with my email address again, and SIGN OUT. I have to be signed in to sign OUT, right?  AND if I have the correct version there should be NO REASON to EVER SEE my OLD FF home page, RIGHT?  Then, why do I? It is great that you are trying to make your browser the safest browser on the market, but if people CAN NOT get legitimate answers in language understood by ALL, no computereze, then WHAT IS THE POINT? </p><p>And so much for the SCREENSHOT link. How does that work. I have the link on my Toolbar and it states, ""Take a Screenshot"" and that's what I did, because I wanted to show you some pages. BUT where did the screenshot go??? I looked through BROWSE, couldn't find it there in my files. </p><p>DO NOT make educated guesses, because that is what you do now. GUESS!!  I guarantee that your educated guesses are WRONG! </p><p>Most Sincerely, Rhonda Caywood </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Rhonda_89

Plus an unusual number missed by Gmail's usually pretty good filter. </p><p>The main problem is with Gravatar (<a href=""http://www.gravatar.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.gravatar.com</a>), somehow associated with <a href=""http://WordPress.com"" rel=""nofollow"">WordPress.com</a>.Â ?? It doesn't seem to allow changes to either email address or password, unless I overlooked something... Options available are to Hide and/or Close the account, and I did both. Trying to sign in again still shows my email addy, so I'm not sure that it has been resolved quite yet. Oh and.. There I can change the email address, but there's no point in being spammed all over again from a different direction. </p><p>Less of a problem is the 500px site. Some nice photographs in there, but I haven't visited in years (probably). My account there has been deactivated, in the meantime, and, judging by the amount of spam until the last month or so, I'd guess that one is resolved. And, btw.. I do use unique passwords. </p><p>I'm actually very grateful for this service. I'm just not sure I managed to fix either breach. The other thing is that Gmail places the notifications under Promotions tab instead of Primary or Updates tabs. Not sure what I can do to fix that.... </p><p>Many Thanks, </p><p>Colin. </p><p>P.S.
