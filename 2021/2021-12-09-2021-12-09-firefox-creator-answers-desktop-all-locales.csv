They have found as I have told them multiple times that there is no centralized method to ensuring firefox remains up to date. The admx files from github do set the appautoupdate and backgroundappupdate to a value of 1 to indicate updates but all PCs are at different levels from 90.0 to 95.0 and I've found that even with the auto update switch on that many pcs do not auto update due to users leaving firefox up and ignoring the restart. The autoupdate task runs only if the user is logged on and that allows users to browse with an insecure version of Firefox that can lead to data breaches. CVEs lead to threats to exploit the CVE and that leads to risk that leads to data breaches. These CVEs are tracked by the NVD and this puts security in the hands of users instead of the business and the business has decided to remove firefox from their environments due to this fact. </p><p>I know mozilla is NFP but to maintain firefox in an enterprise environment, it need a better update process such as Google Chrome and Edge Chromium. </p><p>CVE-2021-38503 CVE-2021-38504 CVE-2021-38505 CVE-2021-38506 CVE-2021-38507 CVE-2021-38508 CVE-2021-38509 CVE-2021-38510 </p><p>The above are current CVEs of High risk in one environment that has decided firefox will no longer be used. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",bruce92
