They have found as I have told them multiple times that there is no centralized method to ensuring firefox remains up to date. The admx files from github do set the appautoupdate and backgroundappupdate to a value of 1 to indicate updates but all PCs are at different levels from 90.0 to 95.0 and I've found that even with the auto update switch on that many pcs do not auto update due to users leaving firefox up and ignoring the restart. The autoupdate task runs only if the user is logged on and that allows users to browse with an insecure version of Firefox that can lead to data breaches. CVEs lead to threats to exploit the CVE and that leads to risk that leads to data breaches. These CVEs are tracked by the NVD and this puts security in the hands of users instead of the business and the business has decided to remove firefox from their environments due to this fact. </p><p>I know mozilla is NFP but to maintain firefox in an enterprise environment, it need a better update process such as Google Chrome and Edge Chromium. </p><p>CVE-2021-38503 CVE-2021-38504 CVE-2021-38505 CVE-2021-38506 CVE-2021-38507 CVE-2021-38508 CVE-2021-38509 CVE-2021-38510 </p><p>The above are current CVEs of High risk in one environment that has decided firefox will no longer be used. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;escalate;developer;enterprise;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",bruce92

Thus, here is the thing: I work with multiple tabs, and if I open a new tab (Firefox home), start typing and when you have to switch tabs by ctrl+tab so you do it, a text in a new tab text always will be selected. Seems like no problem, however, If I accidentally press keys (except for arrow keys), all search text will disappear right away. Arrow keys only can move a cursor.

I will be the next one if someone doesn't help me. AND DO NO respond to me with your computer IT LINGO. I am NOT AN IT person, I don't understand most of your ever-so-helpful (NOT) articles. Speak to me as though I know NOTHING about computers, even though I have used them for 40 years. MOZILLA you need to learn then teach your volunteers how to access my computer walk me through all of the problems I continue to have.  I DID DOWNLOAD the latest v. 95, however, yesterday I downloaded a file and suddenly my OLD FF PAGE showed up and that is where the download went.  HOW does that happen? Trying to get help is another anxiety-ridden experience. This is the 3rd page I've been on to get SOMEONE'S ATTENTION! I, personally, haven't found FireFox to be user-friendly as so many others seem to feel. AND, if you start using BING, I will be gone, NO if, ands, or buts. Bing is a piece of crap! I've tried numerous times to get it off MS Edge only for it to appear again. MS may think it's the greatest thing since sliced bread, but it isn't, even their format is UGLY! </p><p>I thought I finally got the hang of TABS...open tab, select website or whatever you want to open, then you don't lose all the other TABS that are open. HOWEVER, when one is moving along at lightning speed and happens to forget to open a TAB, that's when I want to SCREAM at the top of my lungs because now the other tab I opened is GONE! I'm sure I must be doing something WRONG, NO DOUBT, then teach me how to do it RIGHT!  </p><p>NO MORE WRITTEN ARTICLES, THEY ARE A WASTE OF MY TIME! You may think you've written them in the clearest possible way, but you HAVEN'T. Again, if your audience is for IT people then MAYBE, just maybe they might understand what you've written, but I DO NOT! </p><p>That is the SINGLE MOST ANNOYING habit that every company has. SPEAKING IN COMPUTEREZE. I have worked in the medical field for many years, and the medical field has it's own terminology, words, diagnoses, codes, etc. and if I were to somehow use these words when messaging you, you would be CLUELESS! AND you wouldn't even bother to figure out what I'm asking or how to respond. Specific fields in this country have their own language. My husband worked in Aerospace for years and when he would describe to me what he was working on, it was Greek to me. The list goes on and on. </p><p>WELL, that's what you do now! You can pat yourselves on the back for all of your brilliant directional articles, but many of us out here in the real world are not patting you on the back. </p><p>Get your stuff together, take this email seriously, and perhaps you won't keep losing customers. </p><p>YOU NEED A SPECIFIC LOG-IN PAGE. When I open Firefox and go to the 3 bars I HAVE TO THINK I AM LOGGED IN. There is my Email address and if I click on that account I have many options. Two of which are manage account with my email address again, and SIGN OUT. I have to be signed in to sign OUT, right?  AND if I have the correct version there should be NO REASON to EVER SEE my OLD FF home page, RIGHT?  Then, why do I? It is great that you are trying to make your browser the safest browser on the market, but if people CAN NOT get legitimate answers in language understood by ALL, no computereze, then WHAT IS THE POINT? </p><p>And so much for the SCREENSHOT link. How does that work. I have the link on my Toolbar and it states, ""Take a Screenshot"" and that's what I did, because I wanted to show you some pages. BUT where did the screenshot go???
