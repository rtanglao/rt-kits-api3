Plus an unusual number missed by Gmail's usually pretty good filter. </p><p>The main problem is with Gravatar (<a href=""http://www.gravatar.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.gravatar.com</a>), somehow associated with <a href=""http://WordPress.com"" rel=""nofollow"">WordPress.com</a>.Â ?? It doesn't seem to allow changes to either email address or password, unless I overlooked something... Options available are to Hide and/or Close the account, and I did both. Trying to sign in again still shows my email addy, so I'm not sure that it has been resolved quite yet. Oh and.. There I can change the email address, but there's no point in being spammed all over again from a different direction. </p><p>Less of a problem is the 500px site. Some nice photographs in there, but I haven't visited in years (probably). My account there has been deactivated, in the meantime, and, judging by the amount of spam until the last month or so, I'd guess that one is resolved. And, btw.. I do use unique passwords. </p><p>I'm actually very grateful for this service. I'm just not sure I managed to fix either breach. The other thing is that Gmail places the notifications under Promotions tab instead of Primary or Updates tabs. Not sure what I can do to fix that.... </p><p>Many Thanks, </p><p>Colin. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",colincv
