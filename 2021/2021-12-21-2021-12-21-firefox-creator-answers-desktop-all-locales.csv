Everytime I play music using firefox, whether it is soundcloud or youtube, and, when I load multiple applications like adobe after effects, illustrator, indesign to work, there is a crackling glitch sound from my speaker. I've tested the same using different browsers but it seems like only firefox is making this issue. </p><p>My firefox is updated to the latest version. I've tried removing all the data from my macbook and reinstalled firefox but no luck. It still makes the crackling sound. </p><p>Any leads would be really appreciated. </p>",mac-os;desktop;macos;,firefox,basic-browsing-firefox,en-US,"",justabjith
