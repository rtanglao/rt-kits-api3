After closing, a restart is answered by an error message - ""Firefox is already running. The old Firefox process must be closed to open a new window."" When this is done, another instance of Firefox displays. It appears that two instances of Firefox have opened when only one was requested and the second has somehow disabled the search request, either manual (direct) or from a separate application/link. I have completed a Refresh without any change in behaviour. What can I do now? Thank you Graham Garden </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-900;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",grahamgarden
