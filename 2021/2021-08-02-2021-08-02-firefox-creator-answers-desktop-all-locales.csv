I have the strictest anti-tracking protection enabled and have one question: Firefox prevents cross-site cookies by default, but if I install Firefox Containers, does that mean that those cross-site cookies will be allowed inside that container, even if they're not when browsing outside of any container? My concern is that, if that happened, using Firefox containers would actually diminish privacy instead of increasing it (for example, Facebook would be able to use Instagram cookies because they're in the same container, even though it wouldn't if I hadn't installed Containers).
