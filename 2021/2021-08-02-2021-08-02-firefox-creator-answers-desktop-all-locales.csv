I have the strictest anti-tracking protection enabled and have one question: Firefox prevents cross-site cookies by default, but if I install Firefox Containers, does that mean that those cross-site cookies will be allowed inside that container, even if they're not when browsing outside of any container? My concern is that, if that happened, using Firefox containers would actually diminish privacy instead of increasing it (for example, Facebook would be able to use Instagram cookies because they're in the same container, even though it wouldn't if I hadn't installed Containers).

In other words, add-on bookmark managers would necessary all be within their own, floating window, which makes switching between the browser and your other, main, application a nightmare. Over the last years, FF has lost most of its users, but before saying good-bye on my turn, I really would like to have resolved the above problem, which in fact is my only problem with FF, but a constant and most awful one. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",nnmm
