Every time I've clicked ""Import"" from Lockwise and checked the appropriate boxes, I get a dialog box telling me that the import was successful... but Lockwise still tells me ""No logins found."" I do know that importation of some kind is happening because my bookmarks imported just fine. Prompts to save my logins still appear, but passwords do not get saved, as evidenced by the ""No logins found"" message where a list of my saved logins should be. When I attempt to create a login manually, I get a dialog box like the one used to create a Primary Password, except it looks more like a system dialog box, something from Windows rather than from Firefox (image 1.1). I've tried entering all the passwords I can think of into this dialog box--my OS password, my Firefox password, the password I'm trying to save, the password I would choose for my Primary Password if I had one--only for another box to pop up stating ""Unable to change password"" (image 1.2). Upon closing this box, a red banner appears stating that there was an error while trying to save the password. </p><p>One of the times I was trying to use Lockwise, a bar appeared at the top of the screen stating that I needed to use my Primary Password--which I didn't have and still don't--to access my logins. I can't remember what I did because I've tried several things, but if I figure out how to recreate that I'll update this post. I attempted to create a Primary Password from my Options menu by checking the box next to ""Use a Primary Password."" Even though it clearly recognizes that I don't have a Primary Password set, I still get an  ""Unable to change primary password"" notice (image 2). I've tried resetting it, but to no avail. I have also followed the advice of all the relevant articles I could find (e.g., the help article on what to do if your passwords aren't saving), but nothing so far has fixed the issue. </p><p>Lastly--it seems like I'm getting the system-dialog-looking box about every hour or so, always twice in a row: I'll click ""cancel,"" and then it will show up again. I also can't seem to log out of my Firefox account, as that same dialog box appears and prevents me from doing so.  </p><p>What is going on here?

One is that the file does not contain the thumbnail like the original URL created from the browser itself. Another is that the file size takes 10 to 100 times more storage space. Lastly, when I open it Windows display a warning message that needs to be answered to continue. That extra step gives a bad experience. I admit that I haven't looked at the code yet, but I suspect that it won't do the result that I want even if I understand how it works which I'll take a chance to do. </p><p>Overall, I would say that I found nothing like the default drag and drop option. </p><p>I'm afraid that if I ask if is there such feature the answer will be negative. </p><p>Any help is welcome.

Only Restarting Firefox resolves this issue (memory consumption reduces to 1.884GB, that is 2.7GB reduction!). (See attached pictures) </p><p>Should I think this is proper and intended behavior of Firefox? I cannot help thinking that some kind of needless memory allocations are happening during Firefox keep running.

I followed <a href=""https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/HiDPI#Firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">Arch's own documentation</a>  on how to fix this by increasing `layout.css.devPixelsPerPx` (mine is at 1.4), and then adjusting font size by editing userChrome.css to select the desired size. Problem is that Firefox won't actually change anything based on what I put in that file. I have set `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to True, and I have attached a photo of my userChrome.css (yes, I'm using nano because Vim is too advanced for my smooth brain). I changed it to a ton of different values and I can confirm that the font size is not actually changing. </p>",desktop;customize;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,customize,en-US,1414862;1414889;1414890;1414986;,csparrow101

I have 3 machines, 2 Levono / 1 Dell and they all run Firefox. I recently changed my primary password because I received warnings that my email was found on the dark web (Dark web? I'm behind the times. I digress.)  One of my Lenovo machines will not accept the new password. I have changed it several times but still it will not recognize the new primary password. It won't sync with the other machines. Here's the kicker, it tells me I'm logged in!!! Can't do anything on the account.  My other 2 machines are fine.  Changed the password with no issues.  That brings me to another question.  Shouldn't the password sync across all 3 machines? Everything else syncs. I literally had 3 different passwords at one time (because I kept forgetting them.  I write them down now). Hope somebody can shed the light for me.  So frustrated.  May have to go to Chrome if this keeps up. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,sync,en-US,1414858;,joeydrisk

Does anyone know if there is a bug when using this brand new iMac?  I keep going in and setting it in preferences and checking ""Restore previous session"" and it works for a while and then goes back to Safari and I lose all my tabs.  I was doing some banking so exited out of Firefox several times and sometimes my previous session was restored but then, after a few times, it went back to Safari.  Then I went back into Firefox and my previous session was gone again.  Thanks for any help that you can offer. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Fi424
