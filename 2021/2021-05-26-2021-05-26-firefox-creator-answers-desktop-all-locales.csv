Only Restarting Firefox resolves this issue (memory consumption reduces to 1.884GB, that is 2.7GB reduction!).

I cannot help thinking that some kind of needless memory allocations are happening during Firefox keep running.

I followed <a href=""https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/HiDPI#Firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">Arch's own documentation</a>  on how to fix this by increasing `layout.css.devPixelsPerPx` (mine is at 1.4), and then adjusting font size by editing userChrome.css to select the desired size. Problem is that Firefox won't actually change anything based on what I put in that file. I have set `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to True, and I have attached a photo of my userChrome.css (yes, I'm using nano because Vim is too advanced for my smooth brain). I changed it to a ton of different values and I can confirm that the font size is not actually changing. </p>",desktop;customize;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,customize,en-US,1414862;,csparrow101

I have 3 machines, 2 Levono / 1 Dell and they all run Firefox. I recently changed my primary password because I received warnings that my email was found on the dark web (Dark web? I'm behind the times. I digress.)  One of my Lenovo machines will not accept the new password. I have changed it several times but still it will not recognize the new primary password. It won't sync with the other machines. Here's the kicker, it tells me I'm logged in!!! Can't do anything on the account.  My other 2 machines are fine.  Changed the password with no issues.  That brings me to another question.  Shouldn't the password sync across all 3 machines? Everything else syncs. I literally had 3 different passwords at one time (because I kept forgetting them.  I write them down now). Hope somebody can shed the light for me.  So frustrated.  May have to go to Chrome if this keeps up. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,sync,en-US,1414858;,joeydrisk

Does anyone know if there is a bug when using this brand new iMac?  I keep going in and setting it in preferences and checking ""Restore previous session"" and it works for a while and then goes back to Safari and I lose all my tabs.  I was doing some banking so exited out of Firefox several times and sometimes my previous session was restored but then, after a few times, it went back to Safari.  Then I went back into Firefox and my previous session was gone again.  Thanks for any help that you can offer. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Fi424
