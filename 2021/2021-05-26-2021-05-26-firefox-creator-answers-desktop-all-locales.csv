Does anyone know if there is a bug when using this brand new iMac?  I keep going in and setting it in preferences and checking ""Restore previous session"" and it works for a while and then goes back to Safari and I lose all my tabs.  I was doing some banking so exited out of Firefox several times and sometimes my previous session was restored but then, after a few times, it went back to Safari.  Then I went back into Firefox and my previous session was gone again.  Thanks for any help that you can offer. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Fi424
