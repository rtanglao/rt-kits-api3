Please give me instructions on how to permanently block / stop FireFox's ""Welcome Pages"".   </p><p>I remember asking FireFox to block trackers and suppress as much advertising as possible. I never thought that FireFox would think that it was OK for FireFox itself to track me and send me unsolicited advertising.  </p><p>I just received a FireFox ""Welcome Page"".  This is something I don't recall ever seeing before.  On the ""Welcome"" page I found a link that informed me that ""Welcome Pages"" are sent when people reach certain ""Milestones"".   FireFox had to be tracking me in order to decide I'd reached a ""Milestone"" - although I have no idea what Milestone I reached.  </p><p>On top of that, the so-called ""Welcome Page"" is actually an ADVERTISEMENT for an UNSOLICITED product offer to pay FireFox for something.  What kind of ""welcome"" is that ?   </p><p>All I can say is I'm very shocked that FireFox has taken advantage of making me feel I'm being protected from tracking and ads, which the browser seems to do quite well, EXCEPT for FireFox itself. That is shameful in my opinion. </p><p>Thank you in advance for your assistance helping me to go the extra mile and plug the tracking and ad leak I was not aware that I've had all of this time. </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;needsinfo;firefox-780;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1459592;,ruthyruth5

And here's my problem, if lets say the first file of those twenty files is a huge 10 GB file and is going to take 50+ minutes to download, but the 2nd thru 20th files are just some dinky 2 meg JPG files and they download practically instantly...  whenever I open my ""ongoing download list"", it will STILL only show the last 5 files downloaded, even though they are completed and yet that first file which ISN'T finished doesn't show at all until I click the ""show all"" button to even see it, and even then I may still have to scroll down the list of finished files in order to actually see it's progress... </p><p>Is there a command I can put into my profile / or is there a preexisting add-on/extension (or whatever) that i can download/install that will constantly sort the output of the downloads list so that the ACTUAL active downloads are the top of the list showing up as those first five lines on the short list, and if I have more than five the rest are hidden until I click the show all button (preferably sorted in the order of most percentage completed to least percentage completed), and then, as a file completes its download, it gets moved to the top of the completed/history section... IE after all the files are completely downloaded, the list will be sorted by the file COMPLETION time NOT the time I STARTED to download it.  I seem to recall that a prior version of Firefox acted this way, but I don't remember if I had to modify something to get it to do that, or if it was a standard/stock feature that I somehow turned off in this build and forgot how i did it... or,  if I'm actually misremembering it that way at all and it's just wishful thinking on my part!!! </p><p>Anyway, thanks in advance for any info you can help figure out for me... </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-940;firefox-9401;,firefox,customize,en-US,1459547;,god72
