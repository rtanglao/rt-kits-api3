So i've found that in <strong>about:config</strong> there is parameter called <strong>gfx.font_rendering.cleartype_params.rendering_mode</strong> and if i change value to any from <strong>-1</strong> to <strong>5</strong>, fonts get what i want, but this works until i restart browser. </p><pre>It looks like firefox changes this parameter to default <strong>(-1)</strong> every launch even if there still my own <strong>(i use 5)</strong>. </pre> <p>For example i changed <strong>gfx.font_rendering.cleartype_params.rendering_mode</strong> to <strong>5</strong>.  Fonts start to look good and if i restart browser fonts still look like if <strong>gfx.font_rendering.cleartype_params.rendering_mode</strong> on <strong>-1</strong> when there is still <strong>5</strong>. </p><p>That is strange because if i change any other setting in about:config no matter which exactly this parameter turns on again. </p><p>So if i want to render mode on 5 i just need to turn any settings on <strong>about:config</strong> after every time i launch browser.

And here's my problem, if lets say the first file of those twenty files is a huge 10 GB file and is going to take 50+ minutes to download, but the 2nd thru 20th files are just some dinky 2 meg JPG files and they download practically instantly...  whenever I open my ""ongoing download list"", it will STILL only show the last 5 files downloaded, even though they are completed and yet that first file which ISN'T finished doesn't show at all until I click the ""show all"" button to even see it, and even then I may still have to scroll down the list of finished files in order to actually see it's progress... </p><p>Is there a command I can put into my profile / or is there a preexisting add-on/extension (or whatever) that i can download/install that will constantly sort the output of the downloads list so that the ACTUAL active downloads are the top of the list showing up as those first five lines on the short list, and if I have more than five the rest are hidden until I click the show all button (preferably sorted in the order of most percentage completed to least percentage completed), and then, as a file completes its download, it gets moved to the top of the completed/history section... IE after all the files are completely downloaded, the list will be sorted by the file COMPLETION time NOT the time I STARTED to download it.  I seem to recall that a prior version of Firefox acted this way, but I don't remember if I had to modify something to get it to do that, or if it was a standard/stock feature that I somehow turned off in this build and forgot how i did it... or,  if I'm actually misremembering it that way at all and it's just wishful thinking on my part!!! </p><p>Anyway, thanks in advance for any info you can help figure out for me... </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-940;firefox-9401;,firefox,customize,en-US,1459547;1459608;1459611;,god72
