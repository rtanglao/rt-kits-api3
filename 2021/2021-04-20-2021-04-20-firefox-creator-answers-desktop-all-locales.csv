Restarting the computer (because I don't want to lose my tabs) solves the issue and it becomes perfectly responsive again, but it takes ~2 minutes to shut down, when it usually takes at most 20 seconds, because Firefox is not closing properly.  </p><p>I also didn't add any new add-ons before the issue started appearing.  </p><p>Now I wouldn't mind a restart here and there if I wasn't working as much as I do in the browser.
