Now it is gone.  I can get the info page back by right clicking the padlock icon, clicking the arrow, then clicking more info but that is a real PITA.  How do I get the link back on page right click.  I am 100% sure that this was not done intentionally.  That would be very silly and absurd to do. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,"",support2

I notice that the browser is slowly getting more and more unresponsive while switching tabs and eventually it stops completely. I get a loading symbol in the middle of the tab, even on previously loaded ones. I can't switch tabs anymore, but I can open a new tab once per Firefox. I can open as many windows as I want, they all just show a white page and the search bar is unclickable. </p><p>I don't get any error message from my computer nor Firefox. Restarting the computer (because I don't want to lose my tabs) solves the issue and it becomes perfectly responsive again, but it takes ~2 minutes to shut down, when it usually takes at most 20 seconds, because Firefox is not closing properly.  </p><p>I also didn't add any new add-ons before the issue started appearing.  </p><p>Now I wouldn't mind a restart here and there if I wasn't working as much as I do in the browser. So if anyone has an idea where to look for a solution I'd very much appreciate it. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ShockZz
