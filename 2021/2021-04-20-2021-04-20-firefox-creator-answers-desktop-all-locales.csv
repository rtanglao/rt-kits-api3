The dialog intruded, despite the add-on. But worse than that, when I clicked 'I agree', nothing happened! I cannot get to the maps page at all. I've tried disabling enhanced protection -- no change. I've tried disabling various add-ons -- no change. I've tried restarting FF in safe mode, but the same problem persists. </p><p>I can't figure out how this is happening or what to do about it.

1333225,2021-04-19 19:42:51 -0700,2021-04-19 19:42:51 -0700,Firefox unresponsive - loading symbol in the middle of the screen,"<p>So for a few weeks now I've had this problem come up multiple times. I notice that the browser is slowly getting more and more unresponsive while switching tabs and eventually it stops completely. I get a loading symbol in the middle of the tab, even on previously loaded ones. I can't switch tabs anymore, but I can open a new tab once per Firefox. I can open as many windows as I want, they all just show a white page and the search bar is unclickable. </p><p>I don't get any error message from my computer nor Firefox. Restarting the computer (because I don't want to lose my tabs) solves the issue and it becomes perfectly responsive again, but it takes ~2 minutes to shut down, when it usually takes at most 20 seconds, because Firefox is not closing properly.  </p><p>I also didn't add any new add-ons before the issue started appearing.  </p><p>Now I wouldn't mind a restart here and there if I wasn't working as much as I do in the browser. So if anyone has an idea where to look for a solution I'd very much appreciate it. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ShockZz
