It kept saying were having technical difficulties.  Ive done about as much troubleshooting as possible including chatting in to their tech support a few times.  Its the dumbest thing and idk wtf to do.  Heres the dumbest part.....if I come off of my home wifi and a public hotspot I can connect.  If im on my home wifi I cant.  I can browse Secure websites on my home wifi, play other games, send and receive email but im lost as to what to do.  It has to be my cable modem thats the issue but I can do every other thing on the internet except connect to the EA servers for Tiberium Alliances.   </p><p>Rob D </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1458772;1458775;1458776;,robert.l.davidson

I did check Profile and there was nothing there as well.

Whenever I hit the CTRL button (e.g. for CTRL+F, CTRL+A, CTRL+C, etc.) the zoom is decreased by 10%. Same goes when I use the CTRL button to zoom with the mouse wheel. </p><p>I'm using Firefox 94.0.1 (64-bit) under Windows 10 </p><p>I tried closing the browser and opening it again, restarting the computer and using Firefox in Troubleshoot Mode, but the problem persists. A search in the forum here and on google yielded no relevant results. </p><p>Anybody who's got some good advice for me? Thank you very much. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-940;firefox-9401;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",claudegeorges
