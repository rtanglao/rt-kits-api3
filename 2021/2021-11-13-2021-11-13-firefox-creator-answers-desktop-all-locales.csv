Whenever I hit the CTRL button (e.g. for CTRL+F, CTRL+A, CTRL+C, etc.) the zoom is decreased by 10%. Same goes when I use the CTRL button to zoom with the mouse wheel. </p><p>I'm using Firefox 94.0.1 (64-bit) under Windows 10 </p><p>I tried closing the browser and opening it again, restarting the computer and using Firefox in Troubleshoot Mode, but the problem persists. A search in the forum here and on google yielded no relevant results. </p><p>Anybody who's got some good advice for me? Thank you very much. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-940;firefox-9401;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",claudegeorges
