I  use it and like it  but  it  does not do all the things it does on other browsers because it is not updated. I think the  developer of fb purity is waiting for    firebox to  update or give him the code or whatever you have to do to make it  work. I like the extension  but like  i said  It does not do  what it does and  when it  removes on the other browsers .I like and have used Firefox  for years and   do not  want to use  any other browser So I am asking  please allow  this extension to update on Firefox.
