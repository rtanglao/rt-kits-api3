Essa ""MARAVILHA"" restaurou por completo, como se estivesse sido reinstalado. Custava deixar totalmente explícito o que iria acontecer?! Uma mensagem em size 500, em vermelho e em bold, um popup de confirmação... que seja, qualquer coisa.  </p><p>Após algum momento de muita raiva, fui tentar recuperar TODAS as configurações que eu havia feito através da opção Sincronizar. Porém de nada adiantou. Muito tempo perdido configurando item à item do Firefox, extensão à extensão. </p><p>De que adianta vocês colocarem a bendita mensagem que estou sincronizando ""Configurações"" se o mesmo não se é feito??? </p><p>Eu havia configurado um diretório específico para downloads, eu havia configurado exceções (muitas) no tópico Privacidade e Segurança -&gt; Cookies e dados de segurança -&gt; Gerenciar exceções, eu havia configurado diversas opções em Pesquisa -&gt; Atalhos de pesquisa, eu estava logado em diversas extensões. </p><p>Tudo resumido à tempo perdido. </p>",desktop;beta;sync;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,sync,pt-BR,"",rodrigoplc95

I would contact widevine or chrome support to ask them, but I couldn't find a good place to ask, so I figured this would be a place to ask. It's my understanding that there is no compiled binary for widevine on bsd, so I was wondering if there was any plans from google/widevine to change this, and if not, if there is any workaround known? </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",blauekapelle

It kept saying were having technical difficulties.  Ive done about as much troubleshooting as possible including chatting in to their tech support a few times.  Its the dumbest thing and idk wtf to do.  Heres the dumbest part.....if I come off of my home wifi and a public hotspot I can connect.  If im on my home wifi I cant.  I can browse Secure websites on my home wifi, play other games, send and receive email but im lost as to what to do.  It has to be my cable modem thats the issue but I can do every other thing on the internet except connect to the EA servers for Tiberium Alliances.   </p><p>Rob D </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1458772;1458775;1458776;1458782;1458785;1458786;,robert.l.davidson

Whenever I hit the CTRL button (e.g. for CTRL+F, CTRL+A, CTRL+C, etc.) the zoom is decreased by 10%. Same goes when I use the CTRL button to zoom with the mouse wheel. </p><p>I'm using Firefox 94.0.1 (64-bit) under Windows 10 </p><p>I tried closing the browser and opening it again, restarting the computer and using Firefox in Troubleshoot Mode, but the problem persists. A search in the forum here and on google yielded no relevant results. </p><p>Anybody who's got some good advice for me? Thank you very much. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-940;firefox-9401;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",claudegeorges
