It seems to me that method of keeping Firefox up-to-date might be more effective than the traditional Mozilla background service.  However, I use the Beta channel.  Is there any chance that channel will be added to MS Store?  Regardless of the version I assume that you have to completely uninstall the conventional Firefox install and lose all your about:config and other settings (anything not included in Sync). </p>",desktop;beta;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",mikeynavy1
