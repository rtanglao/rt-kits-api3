It's been 72 hours since the change, but FF will not load the sites at all.  Here's what I've done: </p> <ul><li> Flushed local DNS cache (in windows, ipconfig/flushdns). </li><li> Cleared browser cache </li><li> requested Cloudflare (what my routers and PCs use for DNS) to purge the cache for these 2 sites </li><li> set proxy to ""none"" in FF settings </li><li> disabled DNS over HTTPS </li></ul> <p>Using IE and Edge, the sites redirect to the correct sites just fine.  But FF refuses to load anything at all--I've tried various computers (and my iphone running FF) on various networks, no luck.  Using the network inspector, I sometimes get a ns_binding_aborted error (on Windows).  FF on iOS gives me a request timed out (NSURLErrorDomain). </p><p>I'm running FF 92.0 x64 on Win 10 x64. </p><p>Any ideas what is going on here? </p><p>Thanks!
