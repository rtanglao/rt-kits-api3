It has become a hassle to use Firefox. When we first started using Firefox years ago we might get an update 2 times a year now it appears to be 2 times a month. Please let us know why and if there is something we can do to change this. Updating and make unnecessary changes is very costly to our business and if it continues we may have to change browsers. We love Firefox but the updates must stop be so frequent. We do not have the time to keep updating nor do we want any computer updating without someone watching it. We do not want automated updates. On update was the worst when you made all the unnecessary changes. It took me all day to all 5 computers to look alike so everyone could use them no matter where they work. Please consider yourself a top browser and not a fly by night. This is a professional company so please act like it, walk like and turn this around. I am wondering if someone from Microsoft has started to help you? </p><p>SteveKessler SteveKessler Question owner 11/20/14, 4:22 PM </p><p>Two different answers to one question. I am asking why does Firefox constantly make updates? Why not leave everything alone? I understand if it is necessary but about 95% of the changes are b/c someone thinks they are helping. It is broken so please stop updating. If there needs to be an update due to hacker, i.e. then okay but all these other updates is not making it any better. People think if we make this change it will help others when all it does is make us keep updating and we do not use the new idea. We just want a fast browser without the gimmicks. Please consider that you already had a great browser and leave it alone. </p><p>SteveKessler SteveKessler Question owner 11/20/14, 6:56 PM </p><p>We're not interested in making changes when nothing is broken. You had Notice the word HAD the best browser on the internet! Now it is another browser competition for what? Just leave it alone. It does not need unnecessary upgrades. Making changes to make changes is not improvement. Keep it up and you will run off everyone. I know more about this than you think. Worked 35 years in this industry and know more than most will ever learn. I know if you keep changing just to change it will break down and you will not get the people back. You are not justifying the means and customers are very finicky. You are very close to losing it all. Too many people trying to show they know something without counting the cost. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jeffreyson

Turned off windows defender and nothing happened. I did have glasswire installed so uninstalled that as well and nothing happened. </p><p>After researching a bit more i found a solution where a guy imported the required certificate from another browser so i did the same. The certificate from both these websites was ""DigiCert Global Root G1A"" and it was present in Chrome but it was missing in Firefox(In case its relevant), and afterward i got access to both these websites however YouTube stopped working properly. The sidebar on the main site does not show any content( <a href=""https://prnt.sc/109dtjv"" rel=""nofollow"">https://prnt.sc/109dtjv</a> ), the comment section wont load and also when i click on my profile it wont load as well ( <a href=""https://prnt.sc/109dux1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://prnt.sc/109dux1</a> ). As far as i am aware those are the only issues i am facing, the videos load with no problem. Everything is working properly on Chrome so i will assume its not YouTube. I tried starting in incognito mode and safe mode, the issue is still there. So what im currently assuming is that maybe i should not have imported a certificate from another browser but i could be wrong so any help would be appreciated. </p><p><br> TL:DR: Imported certificate from another browser to fix ""Error code: SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER"", now YouTube wont load the sidebar, comment section and myprofile dropdown menu. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1395416;1395419;1395428;,Foximite

The Street View screen essentially freezes when I try and use it. But, taking a tip from Firefox help I opened up a new profile in a new browser. When doing so, the existing Google Street View problem disappeared completely in the new browser. I call my new profile in the new browser my second Firefox browser to use. My question is, can someone explain why the problem disappears in my second Firefox browser? Looking at the options window when I open the Firefox menu, I see a few differences between the two browsers. The big difference is the second browser has much less applications in it. It has 7 applications where as my first browser has 21 applications. Is this the possible reason why the second browser doesn't have the problem that my first browser does? If so, how can I delete some of the applications in the first browser to see if that is the problem? I'm trying NOT to refresh my first Firefox browser as refreshing Firefox caused much problems for me in the past. And, it seems some Firefox aficionado's do say use caution when using a refresh. So, can someone please explain why the one browser, the new second browser, is void of the problem that plaques my first or original Firefox browser? Thank you. </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-860;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",sciencemagic
