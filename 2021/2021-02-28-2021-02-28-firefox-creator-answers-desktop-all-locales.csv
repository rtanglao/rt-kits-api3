Firefox says its blocks trackers ( ie cookies), esp third party ones, which are the problematic ones.  </pre> <p>But when we surf, we see options to accept third party cookies. So far I always go ahead and select No. But could I be saving time by clicking yes; knowing Firefox blocks them anywayÂ ?  Shouldn't there be a way that Firefo sends information to the site I'm visiting automatically about my wish not to have third party trackers?  </p><p>Thanks, Caroline </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-860;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1395477;,caroline16

For years I've felt violently abused (it's not an exaggeration in my head) by the UI team who lord over it in a totalitarian way instead of just giving us options to not be constantly humiliated every day we use it. </p><p>The address bar has become my worst enemy lately. I keep staving off ""86ing"" Firefox from my life by editing the CSS this and that, when it worked just fine for years, but it changes and every time for the worse. How can we effectively get Firefox to give us options? Why are options so bad? Why do we not deserve options? I want to know how we can apply pressure on the institution to make FF usable again. </p><p>Here are a few examples, the last is the worst of them: </p><p>1) I want to have an X button on tabs, I just want to be able to delete a tab? Why can't I have an option for this? (I have to use crazy CSS script. Normal people don't go to that length. I would not adopt FF out of the box today.) </p><p>2) Many complain about the address bar that freaks out whenever you touch it. I want an option to disable that. (Again I have a CSS script that makes it act like normal productivity software. That's insane. Why can't we have an option to make the address bar behave like a normal HTML form element? I just want an option.) </p><p>3) As of FF 86 I can no longer use the address bar to perform searches. I've added the Search bar to my UI so I can do searches, but the browser still defaults to the address bar, so I have to click over to the Search bar. And if I use the address bar by accident, it laughs at me and refuses to process my search. I just want to be able to search with an address bar. I remember years ago having to remove the search bar because it would no longer search, but the address bar would search. My radical solution was to amputate the search bar. Now I'm in the complete opposite situation where the search bar searches but the address bar doesn't search. Again, I just want an option to be able to apply searches with my browser. </p><p>I just want an option for FF to not be aggressively hostile to me. It's not so simple as to ignore it. Every time you interact with the UI it's its own humiliation. It's a constant reminder of impotence. And questioning why do I subject myself to the whims of these people who're pulling my tail like I'm some monkey.  </p><p>What the hell is wrong with Mozilla? Is is it still Mozilla? Why can't add-on people effectively address these problems if Mozilla won't? Why dictate how everything is, and then make everything unusable? Why? </p><p>How can we make our voices heard? Why can't Mozilla just kill FF if its goal seems to be to do that by making it unusable? Why not just close shop? Because some one will carry it on because it's open source? It really seems like someone wants FF to be unpopular. How else can we understand that it doesn't just give options? No even options in its crazy about:config system? Why am I in this masochistic relationship with FF? What's in it for FF? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,customize,en-US,1395452;1395459;,mick-p

It has 7 applications where as my first browser has 21 applications. Is this the possible reason why the second browser doesn't have the problem that my first browser does? If so, how can I delete some of the applications in the first browser to see if that is the problem? I'm trying NOT to refresh my first Firefox browser as refreshing Firefox caused much problems for me in the past. And, it seems some Firefox aficionado's do say use caution when using a refresh.
