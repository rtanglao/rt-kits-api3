This is what FF wanted to do for some unexplained reason so I just let it. </p><p>Now when I open a new tab in an open window I get a white screen and nothing works. Entering a URL in the bar or pressing any of the buttons like home does nothing whatsoever. Just a blank white screen.  </p><p>This is why I LOATHE updating anything! The odds of breaking something that was working perfectly is VERY high. Proved the point once again. I used to let FF update itself and then got burned by the Quantum update that trashed ALL of my open session windows. Turned auto-update OFF after that so that could manually grab and save a copy of the profile BEFORE any update happens. </p><p>So how do I fix this or is it a legitimate BUG that should be reported (and how to do same)? </p><p>Thanks, Steve </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-860;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Steve_Sr.

The Street View screen essentially freezes when I try and use it. But, taking a tip from Firefox help I opened up a new profile in a new browser. When doing so, the existing Google Street View problem disappeared completely in the new browser. I call my new profile in the new browser my second Firefox browser to use. My question is, can someone explain why the problem disappears in my second Firefox browser? Looking at the options window when I open the Firefox menu, I see a few differences between the two browsers. The big difference is the second browser has much less applications in it. It has 7 applications where as my first browser has 21 applications. Is this the possible reason why the second browser doesn't have the problem that my first browser does? If so, how can I delete some of the applications in the first browser to see if that is the problem? I'm trying NOT to refresh my first Firefox browser as refreshing Firefox caused much problems for me in the past. And, it seems some Firefox aficionado's do say use caution when using a refresh. So, can someone please explain why the one browser, the new second browser, is void of the problem that plaques my first or original Firefox browser? Thank you. </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-860;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",sciencemagic
