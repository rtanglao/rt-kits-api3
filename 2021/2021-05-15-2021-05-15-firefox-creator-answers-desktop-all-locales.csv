Unless I'm missing something --and I've been poking around these files for over an hour-- it is now, at best, quite obscure.    Is there a way for me to install a CA certificate for a CA you have chosen to not recognize and include with the system?  If so, a clear explanation of how to do it would be appreciated.  And, yes, I understand the implications of doing this. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",klensin+mozilla
