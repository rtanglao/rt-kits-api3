I understand that firefox caches certain inormation in the Firefox/&lt;profile name&gt;/cache2 directories. I know, how to clear these directories. But there is also one cache2 directory next to the profile directories directly in the Firefox folder. This directory also contains several thousand files, which seem to be updated in a similar manner as the cache2 folders in the various profile directories. I would like to know, which information is stored in that ""common"" cache2 and how it can be cleared.

Once I got adjusted to the different controls, I really like using it, BUT... </p><p>I have updated it three times now (the last time was on accident after ignoring the notice for a long time).  Every update breaks the browser for me.  I start getting Windows that don't load - the dot just bounces but the window stays blank for hours. The browser fails to load anything.  On restart I get message that Firefox failed to close properly. New windows take up to 6 or 7 tries to load a link, and the same for loading into a tab. </p><p>The first couple times I updated, I followed the guidance to save favorites, dump the browser and restart from scratch, then load everything back in.  While it worked, it's a PITA for a browser that updates pretty frequently, and I think routine updates should be able to load without having to spend hours troubleshooting and reloading.  I'm not stupid or computer illiterate - I manage a Linux server cluster at work, but I can't manage my Firefox at home through a routine update. </p><p>Can anyone help get Firefox to load and run properly such that it works even after an update?  I hate Edge, and Internet Explorer, while easy to learn is full of security holes and often DOA at most websites these days.  I refuse to go Google, and I'd prefer to not learn another browser.

Unless I'm missing something --and I've been poking around these files for over an hour-- it is now, at best, quite obscure.    Is there a way for me to install a CA certificate for a CA you have chosen to not recognize and include with the system?  If so, a clear explanation of how to do it would be appreciated.  And, yes, I understand the implications of doing this. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1412963;,klensin+mozilla
