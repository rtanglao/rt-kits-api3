Once I got adjusted to the different controls, I really like using it, BUT... </p><p>I have updated it three times now (the last time was on accident after ignoring the notice for a long time).  Every update breaks the browser for me.  I start getting Windows that don't load - the dot just bounces but the window stays blank for hours. The browser fails to load anything.  On restart I get message that Firefox failed to close properly. New windows take up to 6 or 7 tries to load a link, and the same for loading into a tab. </p><p>The first couple times I updated, I followed the guidance to save favorites, dump the browser and restart from scratch, then load everything back in.  While it worked, it's a PITA for a browser that updates pretty frequently, and I think routine updates should be able to load without having to spend hours troubleshooting and reloading.  I'm not stupid or computer illiterate - I manage a Linux server cluster at work, but I can't manage my Firefox at home through a routine update. </p><p>Can anyone help get Firefox to load and run properly such that it works even after an update?  I hate Edge, and Internet Explorer, while easy to learn is full of security holes and often DOA at most websites these days.  I refuse to go Google, and I'd prefer to not learn another browser.  I like Firefox, but the post-update problems are killing me. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",whit_tx

When copy-pasting text with formatting (bold, italics, spacing) into any <a href=""http://Reddit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Reddit.com</a> comment submission box (not post submission boxes) from any external text application (Microsoft Word, Google Docs, Pastebin) using Firefox (v88.0.1), all formatting is lost and seemingly random newlines are added.

(Resulting) </p><p>When trying to delete this text and copy-paste additional times, ghost text appears that cannot be deleted but overlays on top of any additional text. Removing any parts of text seems to paste another copy and infinitely loop more of the pasted text, creating a horrible looking overlay of text that now looks like cryptic symbols because of the overlaying.  </p><p>I posted and looked through Reddit's /r/help, and it seems that multiple people are reporting this issue, all using the latest version of Firefox and having the issue appear in the last few days. </p><p>I have already tried disabling extensions, launching in Safe Mode, clearing Firefox cache, manually troubleshooting settings in about:config, looking through all entries of about:support, refreshing the Firefox profile, <strong>completely </strong>reinstalling Firefox. The issue does not appear to be my installation, but rather a bug with the software on this version. </p><p>Any help is appreciated, I am totally stumped. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,1412945;,TrainorDT
