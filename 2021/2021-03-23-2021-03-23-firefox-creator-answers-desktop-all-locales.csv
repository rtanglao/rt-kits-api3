I need it for making websites legible, but Firefox disabled it for Android (and won't let me go back to earlier versions), so I'm afraid to update the desktop version. Added security doesn't help if I can't read what's on a webpage. I'm running version 85.0.2, on Windows 7 Pro. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-850;,firefox,other,en-US,"",gk7

I didn't touch it; did nothing to it, but when I tried to open Firefox it suddenly was missing. And your Help system HAS WAY TOO MUCH INFORMATION IT SO AS TO BE NOTHING BUT CONFUSING. I AM NOT A CODE JOCK OR A WEB DEVELOPER OR SOMETHING. END RESULT: YOUR HELP SYSTEM IS USELESS!!!!!!!! I even tried deleting my current Firefox and downloading a fresh app. SAME THING! Please answer back with a REAL person, not some canned menu of HUNDREDS OF OPTIONS. Or, I will simply not touch anything from Mozilla again. Now that is SIMPLICITY!!!! </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,1400611;,northphysicsgroup

I will decide if and when I want to ""update"" a program, excepting of course the steaming pile that is Windows 10 where they cram it down your throats, often at a profoundly inconvenient time. </p><p>But after doing some upgrades to an old computer and installing v. 86 of FF, two days later it's in constant nag mode.  I've shut off everything I can, I've tweaked about:config so much it's a wonder it still works at all.  Everytime I start up the computer it displays a notification about do I want to allow FF to make changes.  Not no, it's hell no.  Everytime I start up FF I get a popup, (uh, wasn't FF supposed to have eliminate them?) nagging at me to upgrade.  Then if I'm on for a while it nags me again.  The more I get nagged, the more I push back.  Now I may break something, FF, keyboard, whatever, but nagging me will not result in me doing what the nag wants.    ""Updates"" over the years have made so many more things worse than better I can't even count.  I've been using FF for ~15 years, generally been happy with it, but this is driving me nuts.  How to I fix it?  Fix, as in repair so it works like I want it to and like it used to.  It's broken.  Or should I just migrate to another browser? </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-860;,firefox,customize,en-US,1400590;1400597;,mw999
