I will decide if and when I want to ""update"" a program, excepting of course the steaming pile that is Windows 10 where they cram it down your throats, often at a profoundly inconvenient time. </p><p>But after doing some upgrades to an old computer and installing v. 86 of FF, two days later it's in constant nag mode.  I've shut off everything I can, I've tweaked about:config so much it's a wonder it still works at all.  Everytime I start up the computer it displays a notification about do I want to allow FF to make changes.  Not no, it's hell no.  Everytime I start up FF I get a popup, (uh, wasn't FF supposed to have eliminate them?) nagging at me to upgrade.  Then if I'm on for a while it nags me again.  The more I get nagged, the more I push back.  Now I may break something, FF, keyboard, whatever, but nagging me will not result in me doing what the nag wants.    ""Updates"" over the years have made so many more things worse than better I can't even count.  I've been using FF for ~15 years, generally been happy with it, but this is driving me nuts.  How to I fix it?  Fix, as in repair so it works like I want it to and like it used to.  It's broken.  Or should I just migrate to another browser? </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-860;,firefox,customize,en-US,1400590;,mw999
