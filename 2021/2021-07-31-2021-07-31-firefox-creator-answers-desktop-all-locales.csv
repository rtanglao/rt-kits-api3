There is no 'old firefox data' folder on the desktop or elsewhere, so presume this is not due to an update. I also haven't recently installed any AV software. The logins.json file and logins-backup.json file have reduced down to 2KB, when they should be much larger (approx 100KB). Both files dated 31/07/2021. Fortunately I have a number of PC's - one of which I used Firefox on yesterday, so I have copies of both .json files dated 30/07/2021. They are both sized 125KB. I have noted that the PC's all have 2 User profiles, the first being the .default profile &amp; the second the .default-release profile. On the PC I am having the problem with, the active profile appears to be the .default profile whereas on the other PC's it is the .default-release profile. I am going to replace the 31/07/2021 files with the 30/07/2021 files &amp; see if that solves things, but it won't answer why the situation happened in the first place. Just to clarify, the active profile on all the PC's is the only one that contains the logins.json and logins-backup.json files. In fact, on the other PC's the non-active profile only contains one file: times.json, whereas on the problem PC it contains a lot more, sub-directories as well as files. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,other,en-US,1431694;,tmartynjones

This was extremely annoying, especially since none of the add-on themes can properly duplicate that aesthetic function. One of the things I liked about Firefox was that unlike Chrome, Opera, and Edge... it actually still respected the Windows theme settings (which programs like browsers should do by default). And now, that prized trait had been inexplicably and insensibly discarded. </p><p>I was further displeased by the removal of the dividing lines between tabs. This made Firefox substantially harder for me to use, almost headache-inducingly so. Whoever you have testing these changes before rollout - if anyone - should be replaced, because this was a massive accessibility downgrade. Unacceptably so. </p><p>These changes were so frustrating and ugly, and made the browser so much more difficult for me to use, that I reverted to version 88 and continue to remain on that version. </p><p>Does version 90 resolve these issues? If it does, I'll update. But if not.... then in my opinion it should be axed and you should cease pushing it in favor of working on a new version that <em>does</em> fix these poor decisions. And I'll be sticking to version 88 until that happens. </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",linksmower

Bunun bilgisayardan yada tarayıcı ayarlarından kaynaklandığını düşündüm ama tarayıcıyı sıfırlamam yada yeniden yüklemem işe yaramadı. Farklı bir arama motorunu uzun süre kullanmadım.
