I'm using a dual external monitor set-up, and still running 10.14 due to 32-bit compatibility issues with some of my (scientific, bespoke) software.  </p><p>I am pretty sure that there is a very odd, browser-level bug in alpha display on my system that leads to, for example, the overlay of YouTube's UI appearing peppered with row-wise stripes of other colours; or PDF page previews not displaying properly. There is nothing relevant displayed in either the (JS) console log; `dmesg` or MacOS's Console.app application. The appearance of the stripes / corruption is randomly different each time: it is different in private browsing mode to not, for example, and refreshing the page alters their exact appearance.  </p><p>I have done the obvious things of disabling hardware acceleration -- no change -- trying in a new private window with no extensions / addons loaded -- no difference -- but I do not necessarily want to nuke everything and try again. This problem has existed for as long as I have used FF on this computer, but I am just reporting it now. Mostly it's fine, aside from one variety of captcha that I cannot solve!  </p><p>I have no idea how to go about debugging this and alas I don't have the time to do it ""properly"" -- I am on a system with SIP disabled and can easily load up FF in lldb, for example, if someone could give me targeted advice. I am not a web developer and do not know the exact api call that causes this -- but it appears to be used in pdf.js' sidebar page overlay code, but not the actual page itself. Most PNGs, SVGs etc are fine.  </p><p>Please see the attached series of screenshots – if it's not clear what I've done (the same youtube video in and out of private browsing mode with no extensions, a PDF viewer; and that page reloaded showing a different pattern), please don't hesitate to ask -- the corruption is pretty visible in all cases, I think. The fact that I can screenshot this and share it with you means, I think, that it is not an OS-level graphics driver bug and is probably a rendering bug.  </p><p>Thanks for your help, and sorry if this is the wrong forum! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-1014;firefox-880;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1407938;,landak123

This behavior continues as long as I use the first FF window to open any links - they never open in a tab of the original window and only create lots of windows - this is very hard to deal with IMHO.  Now here's the weird part - If I use one of the new windows, then FF behaves just as it should.  Do a Google search and all links can be opened in new tabs in the new window, as requested.
