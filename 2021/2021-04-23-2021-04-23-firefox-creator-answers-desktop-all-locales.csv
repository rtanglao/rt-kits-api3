Give me a break !!   the complaint I had which I found a workaround was to DELETE up to 1G of cookies so I had a little usable ram and space on my HDD...   Some of the cookies were HUGE...   My OS has been Linux mint or other flavours of Linux since about 1990 and used to boot in less than 20 seconds, then it would load the previous days applications where I left off in another 10 seconds...    Now, judging by the sixes of the files downloaded to refresh Firefox you are writing BLOATWARE WTF...   Why do you think I would not touch Intel &amp; windoze?     DAZE of compulsory Amerikan speling &amp; corporate spying are numbered if this keeps deteriorating... 20,000 cookies a day? and how big is the file to install firefox...   That is what I call BLOATWARE... </p><p>I watch informative YT but when it gets boringly repetitive I just scan what is force fed in the vain hope I will spot something of interest...   90% is crap, or dumb'ed down BS to find a few paste jewels... </p><p>My brain is somewhat addled with Dementia, and afflicted with aspects of Asperger's Syndrome, Bi polar disorder...

The new window takes up the right hand half of my display which means I have to manually size it larger or maximize it.  This behavior continues as long as I use the first FF window to open any links - they never open in a tab of the original window and only create lots of windows - this is very hard to deal with IMHO.  Now here's the weird part - If I use one of the new windows, then FF behaves just as it should.  Do a Google search and all links can be opened in new tabs in the new window, as requested.  I did not notice this strange behavior until about April 10 when I believe I accepted a new update to FF. </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,tips,en-US,1407877;1407887;,qtluom
