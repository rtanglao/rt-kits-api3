An error box(es) pops up stating that Firefox is already running but not responding, and as quick as I can hit the ""close Firefox"" button (when it lets the mouse work), more just pop up behind it. I keep clicking (when resources let me) and they just keep multiplying, until eventually everything just freezes up and the only thing left to do is a hard power down using the power button. </p><p>For reference, this is an older laptop (HP dv6-6135dx running Windows 10 Home) that is seldom used. It had been sitting for several months, and when I first turned it on it was fine. There were several windows updates downloading, and I had opened Firefox, which gave me a pop up that said something to the effect of ""it looks like you haven't used firefox in a while, would you like to refresh"" or something like that, so I selected yes to refresh. Firefox shut down briefly and then came back up and seemed to be working fine. The problem occurred when I restarted the computer to complete some of the installs. As soon as it came back up, Firefox went on the warpath, behaving as described above, and completely taking over the computer rendering it unusable. I have shut down and restarted several times using the power button, but each time it goes back to the same behavior. </p><p>So, my ultimate question is: Since I can't access anything on the computer due to this problem, is there any way to boot up around this issue and perhaps remove/disable Firefox? Again, just to be clear, once the computer has booted up I can do absolutely nothing as all of the resources are sucked up by Firefox and I can not get anything else to open. Occasionally it will allow me to move the mouse slightly, but only for a split second or so. </p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Problém sice vyřešilo zapnutí firefoxu v nouzovém režimu se zakázanými doplňky, ale to potom zase nefungují jiné věci, třeba režim panoramy v <a href=""http://mapy.cz"" rel=""nofollow"">mapy.cz</a>. A také je to dost zdržující, po každém spuštění firefoxu ho restartovat a spouštět v nouzáku. Nemá někdo radu, co konkrétně může tuto chybu způsobovat? Třeba nějaký konkrétní doplněk?
