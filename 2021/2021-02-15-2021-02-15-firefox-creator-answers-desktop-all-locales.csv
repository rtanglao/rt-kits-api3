Of course, I can turn off the history altogether and then the sites will not be added, but this is not an option. </p><p>So, how can I disable adding sites based on my requests and visited pages in the top sites? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",obainkyyyy

This has been going on for a couple weeks now - since the unremovable Other Bookmarks button appeared, though I *have* since removed that - but basically, I've had a lot of tabs open for a while now. Well over 100 of them. 99% of them were unloaded and just there for me to go back to whenever, that's not usually a problem for me, it doesn't lag my browser. </p><p>What *does* lag my browser is opening my bookmarks. Because Firefox has taken these 100+ tabs and bookmarked all of them. Thousands of times. There are over 170,000 bookmarks bogging down my browser and they're all these exact same tabs, over and over and over and over and over again. Obviously, I never did this. This just up and happened one day. </p><p>I managed to scroll through all of them, and couldn't find *any* of my *actual* bookmarks whatsoever. They're all gone. All I have are these tabs, over and over. What the hell is going on, and how do I fix this? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-850;firefox-8502;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",werefallingup
