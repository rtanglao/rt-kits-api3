This is a good quality desktop system, less than a year old.   This is my daily driver but I also have a laptop running windows 10 and Firefox. </p><p>A couple weeks ago I did a normal system update which included Firefox version 90.0.2.  Since that update I have been unable to access my account on Amazon.  I can bring up the Amazon web page and I can login as myself.  The problem is that I can't put anything in my cart.  I get an error page that says ""Sorry something went wrong on our end.""  In the browser console I see an error, ""HTTP/2 503 Service Unavailable"".  I can sometimes view my cart, but most often I can't.  Also, when I click on my account information, I get another error page that says, ""Sorry we couldn't find that page.""  The browser console shows a number of ""503 Service Unavailable errors"", but the last line shows this error (in it's entirety).  ""GET <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/css/homepage.html?ref_=nav_AccountFlyout_ya"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.amazon.com/gp/css/homepage.html?ref_=nav_AccountFlyout_ya</a>    [HTTP/2 404 Forbidden 215ms].  So, basically I can browse products, but I can't order anything or change any of my account information using Firefox. </p><p>So, even though I am logged in, I am being denied access to my account information, including ordering. </p><p>These are the things I tried to mitigate the probem. </p><p>Cleared browser cache Cleared all cookies and data for Amazon Tried different security settings Reverted to all default settings for browser Removed Firefox with the dnf utility and deleted all residual Firefox directories that I could find, including in my home directory Reinstalled Firefox 90.0.2 from Fedora 34 repository </p><p>The same problem persists.  I get exactly the same behavior. There is no problem using Chrome on the same Linux machine.  This is my workaround. There is no problem using Firefox 90.0.2 on my Windows 10 laptop. I only see the problem in Firefox on my Linux desktop which is less than a year old and gives me no other problems what-so-ever. </p><p>So far I have not found this or a similar problem on any other website, only Amazon. </p><p>I added a screenshot of the last entries in my browser console log which may or may not help. </p><p>Thanks for listening. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-900;,firefox,other,en-US,"",john.mohr

Nothing improves even after I allow Windows 10 to install all updates it wants to install. </p><p>What's pathetic is that Internet Explorer 11.0 properly displays the page and allows me to navigate its links offline.

This looks very strange. Like I said I dindn't notice any issue with flickering on previous Mozilla Firefox versions. Only with these new versions with new look of the tabs. I didn't remember if it was 89.0.0 version or 90.0.0 version. I don't know if it is problem with the machine but I didn't notice this issue on another computer with 90.0.2 Firefox version but with Windows 10 OS. I also noticed this issue with Firefox 90.0.0.2 with Windows 7 OS on another computer so I don't know if this is problem with two computers or Firefox itself.

Il browser è comodo e accattivante, l'unico problema che ho riscontrato riguarda il caricamento di alcune pagine, per esempio YouTube. YouTube è di una lentezza sfinente. In pratica, quando cerco di andare su YouTube, vedo solo le anteprime dei video con i titoli, ma le barre laterali non vengono caricate, così come l'icona del mio profilo e tutti i tasti interagibili, ci vogliono circa 20 secondi perché tutto venga elaborato. Spesso capita anche con i video. Clicco su un video e carica il titolo ma non il video in sé.  </p><p>Ho provato modificando ogni singola impostazione, dall'accelerazione hardware alla disattivazione del blocco dei tracker, ecc. Cercando online non riesco a trovare nulla, fatta eccezione per le solite soluzioni scontate come ""prova a reinstallare"", cosa ovviamente già fatta. Ho provato anche svariate estensioni, ma niente ha funzionato.  </p><p>Il fatto è che raramente non dà questo problema. Ogni tanto, cambiando le impostazioni, il problema si è risolto per un solo caricamento. Mi spiego meglio, supponendo che il sito non funzioni, dopo aver cambiato un'impostazione questo torna a funzionare, ma solo per il primo caricamente. Provando poi a chiudere il browser e riaprirlo, lasciando quell'impostazione modificata, il sito già riprende a non funzionare. </p><p>Qualcuno ha idea di cosa potrebbe essere? </p><p>Grazie mille in anticipo! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,fix-problems,it,1433206;1433210;1433245;1433264;,Luca_Moretti_19
