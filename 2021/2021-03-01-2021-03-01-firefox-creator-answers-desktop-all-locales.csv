It created an ""Old Firefox Data"" folder. The newly refreshed Firefox had none of my bookmarks, etc., so I tried to add them by calling up the site and pressing Control+D, clicking on the star, etc. Nothing worked. Then I tried to add ""Top Sites"" to the opening page of the browser, putting in the name and URL. That didn't work either. Then I went to look at the suggestions on the Mozilla site as to what to do, either to allow the current version of Firefox to accept Top Sites &amp; Bookmarks, or to reinsert the Old Firefox Data. I found the relevant pages but could make no sense of them. The recommendations are infinitely beyond my computer capacities, but even the simplest suggestions, like 'open the Old Firefox Data folder, highlight the items contained therein, right click, and press Copy' were unhelpful, since when I right-clicked, the menu that came up didn't include ""Copy."" Should I uninstall Firefox and download anew? I'm using Windows 7 and Firefox of approximately the same vintage. (Alas) I am also of a generation that remembers when electric typewriters were the big new thing, so I'm going to need very very simple instructions. . . .

Then after the upgrade it would crash but only when I logged out or rebooted the OS. Hence I hadn't noticed an issue for a while. The crash happened also using firefox --safe-mode from the command line. Deleting profiles and restarting - crash. Uninstalling FF and re-installing - crash. So I bit the bullet and wiped my drive and installed Mint Mate 20.1 </p><p>I imported my bookmarks and Imported my logins from a csv file and all worked until I logged out/rebooted and again FF crashed. I dug out a spare HDD and did a clean install of Mate. I didn't import logins and FF didn't crash when I logged out of Mate or rebooted. Once I imported logins from the csv file FF crashed again. </p><p>I installed Chromium and imported bookmarks and logins - it worked okay but I wanted to use FF so am at the point where I've spent a week troubleshooting this problem and have fallen behind in my workload. I just don't want to spend days installing / uninstalling etc. I could go round in circles, testing on the Live USB stick for example, I could try enabling signon.management.page.fileImport.enabled import my logins and then disable the option before closing FF and subsequently rebooting Mate and so on, but its getting tedious and for now Chromium works and I can get work done. </p><p>So, when I enable signon.management.page.fileImport.enabled and import my logins, all is well until I logout of Mate or reboot the OS. Then when I launch FF I get the Crash report. Running firefox at the command line gives this error - </p><p>ExceptionHandler::GenerateDump cloned child 3776 ExceptionHandler::SendContinueSignalToChild sent continue signal to child ExceptionHandler::WaitForContinueSignal waiting for continue signal... </p><p>nothing else. Same with firefox --safe-mode </p><p>Uninstalling, deleting my profile, rebooting the OS, reinstalling FF, same error, and that's without importing my logins. It appears that once the option in about:config - signon.management.page.fileImport.enabled has been used, its causing FF to crash. </p><p>I was going to do a clean install of Mint Mate and not update FF from version 84 to version 86 and test the older version to see if its version 86 causing this, which I suspect it is, since the problem also suddenly occurred on my old Mint Mate 19.3 install after an update... </p><p>Its possible my login.csv file is an issue, so I also exported the logins from Chromium instead after importing them from a FF csv backup and then imported the Chromium login csv back into a clean FF install and it crashed again... So after going around in these circles I decided to post here and pass the buck so to speak. </p><p>Perhaps later tonight or later this week if I get the urge I will try the clean Mint Mate install, not update FF to latest version, staying at version 84 and try the same thing to see if its the firefox causing the issue. </p><p>On a side note, once in a blue moon, instead of FF giving a crash report, it would offer to boot in safe mode or perform a clean startup. This would get FF going again until I closed it and started it, when it would crash again. </p><p>Cheers and have a good day :) </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",scotsmist

Am almost there but hung up on a message where the BOOKMARK BAR is suppose to be that says: </p><p><em><strong>""For quick access, place your bookmarks here on the bookmark bar.  ""MANAGE BOOKMARKS...""</strong></em> </p><p>I can not get my BOOKMARK BAR BACK to display ""bookmarks"". Just the above message.  </p><p>I have no idea what it wants as if I press ""MANAGE BOOKMARKS""[in the message""], the LIBRARY windows pops up and nothing I can do to get ""a bookmark on the ""bar"" that says "" </p><p>'For quick access, place your bookmarks here on the bookmark bar"".
