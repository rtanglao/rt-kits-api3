Then after the upgrade it would crash but only when I logged out or rebooted the OS. Hence I hadn't noticed an issue for a while. The crash happened also using firefox --safe-mode from the command line. Deleting profiles and restarting - crash. Uninstalling FF and re-installing - crash. So I bit the bullet and wiped my drive and installed Mint Mate 20.1 </p><p>I imported my bookmarks and Imported my logins from a csv file and all worked until I logged out/rebooted and again FF crashed. I dug out a spare HDD and did a clean install of Mate. I didn't import logins and FF didn't crash when I logged out of Mate or rebooted. Once I imported logins from the csv file FF crashed again. </p><p>I installed Chromium and imported bookmarks and logins - it worked okay but I wanted to use FF so am at the point where I've spent a week troubleshooting this problem and have fallen behind in my workload. I just don't want to spend days installing / uninstalling etc. I could go round in circles, testing on the Live USB stick for example, I could try enabling signon.management.page.fileImport.enabled import my logins and then disable the option before closing FF and subsequently rebooting Mate and so on, but its getting tedious and for now Chromium works and I can get work done. </p><p>So, when I enable signon.management.page.fileImport.enabled and import my logins, all is well until I logout of Mate or reboot the OS. Then when I launch FF I get the Crash report. Running firefox at the command line gives this error - </p><p>ExceptionHandler::GenerateDump cloned child 3776 ExceptionHandler::SendContinueSignalToChild sent continue signal to child ExceptionHandler::WaitForContinueSignal waiting for continue signal... </p><p>nothing else. Same with firefox --safe-mode </p><p>Uninstalling, deleting my profile, rebooting the OS, reinstalling FF, same error, and that's without importing my logins. It appears that once the option in about:config - signon.management.page.fileImport.enabled has been used, its causing FF to crash. </p><p>I was going to do a clean install of Mint Mate and not update FF from version 84 to version 86 and test the older version to see if its version 86 causing this, which I suspect it is, since the problem also suddenly occurred on my old Mint Mate 19.3 install after an update... </p><p>Its possible my login.csv file is an issue, so I also exported the logins from Chromium instead after importing them from a FF csv backup and then imported the Chromium login csv back into a clean FF install and it crashed again... So after going around in these circles I decided to post here and pass the buck so to speak. </p><p>Perhaps later tonight or later this week if I get the urge I will try the clean Mint Mate install, not update FF to latest version, staying at version 84 and try the same thing to see if its the firefox causing the issue. </p><p>On a side note, once in a blue moon, instead of FF giving a crash report, it would offer to boot in safe mode or perform a clean startup. This would get FF going again until I closed it and started it, when it would crash again. </p><p>Cheers and have a good dayÂ :) </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",scotsmist

Refreshing via F5 fixes this, but needs to be reinforced when the table is tweaked. It might go away if the table is completely changed by navigating to another report with another URL. </p><p>When this error happens, it feels like as soon as the page is loaded, the viewport flickers, and a second scroll bar pops up. This causes the long tables on the lower half of the screen to remain unscrollable, even though fully loaded and present. </p><p>As a curiosity, the ""Take a Screenshot"" option can scroll down the page (while saving a an entire page, or via the selection tool). Nohuman input can replicate this. I have tested Tab, arrows, Page Up/Down buttons, manually scrolling from either scroll bar or the mouse wheel from anywhere on the screen, search, etc. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",suleyman.okan
