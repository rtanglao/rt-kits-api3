For the last 3 or 4 weeks the Walmart grocery site is not working right. For anyone familiar you know that there is a little heart you click on for your favorites, and on the right side of the page is your items currently in your shopping cart. Ok, neither of those is working in Firefox right now. It is working fine in Opera but not Firefox which is my preferred browser. (I was using Opera for a while and one of their updates caused the same issue, they saw it about a week later and it works there now.) I have attempted several restarts with addons disabled. As far as I can remember the only thing that I have changed in about:config was ""browser.urlbar.update1""  (that has been changed for a long time) ...I went in and changed it back but that made no difference. Does anyone have any ideas? I really dislike having to open a separate browser for 1 site. I have attached a picture showing what I am referring to.

So I bit the bullet and wiped my drive and installed Mint Mate 20.1 </p><p>I imported my bookmarks and Imported my logins from a csv file and all worked until I logged out/rebooted and again FF crashed. I dug out a spare HDD and did a clean install of Mate. I didn't import logins and FF didn't crash when I logged out of Mate or rebooted. Once I imported logins from the csv file FF crashed again. </p><p>I installed Chromium and imported bookmarks and logins - it worked okay but I wanted to use FF so am at the point where I've spent a week troubleshooting this problem and have fallen behind in my workload. I just don't want to spend days installing / uninstalling etc. I could go round in circles, testing on the Live USB stick for example, I could try enabling signon.management.page.fileImport.enabled import my logins and then disable the option before closing FF and subsequently rebooting Mate and so on, but its getting tedious and for now Chromium works and I can get work done. </p><p>So, when I enable signon.management.page.fileImport.enabled and import my logins, all is well until I logout of Mate or reboot the OS. Then when I launch FF I get the Crash report. Running firefox at the command line gives this error - </p><p>ExceptionHandler::GenerateDump cloned child 3776 ExceptionHandler::SendContinueSignalToChild sent continue signal to child ExceptionHandler::WaitForContinueSignal waiting for continue signal... </p><p>nothing else. Same with firefox --safe-mode </p><p>Uninstalling, deleting my profile, rebooting the OS, reinstalling FF, same error, and that's without importing my logins. It appears that once the option in about:config - signon.management.page.fileImport.enabled has been used, its causing FF to crash. </p><p>I was going to do a clean install of Mint Mate and not update FF from version 84 to version 86 and test the older version to see if its version 86 causing this, which I suspect it is, since the problem also suddenly occurred on my old Mint Mate 19.3 install after an update... </p><p>Its possible my login.csv file is an issue, so I also exported the logins from Chromium instead after importing them from a FF csv backup and then imported the Chromium login csv back into a clean FF install and it crashed again... So after going around in these circles I decided to post here and pass the buck so to speak. </p><p>Perhaps later tonight or later this week if I get the urge I will try the clean Mint Mate install, not update FF to latest version, staying at version 84 and try the same thing to see if its the firefox causing the issue. </p><p>On a side note, once in a blue moon, instead of FF giving a crash report, it would offer to boot in safe mode or perform a clean startup. This would get FF going again until I closed it and started it, when it would crash again. </p><p>Cheers and have a good day :) </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",scotsmist

Refreshing via F5 fixes this, but needs to be reinforced when the table is tweaked. It might go away if the table is completely changed by navigating to another report with another URL. </p><p>When this error happens, it feels like as soon as the page is loaded, the viewport flickers, and a second scroll bar pops up. This causes the long tables on the lower half of the screen to remain unscrollable, even though fully loaded and present. </p><p>As a curiosity, the ""Take a Screenshot"" option can scroll down the page (while saving a an entire page, or via the selection tool).
