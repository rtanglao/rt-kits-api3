But, the new installation is with all of the old password data. I have also tried to change the Firefox password on the Desktop installation, but here I run into the same issue, I cannot change the password, as Firefox tells me the existing password is incorrect.

If I attempt to access my router using 192.168.1.1 Firefox automatically changes the address to https://192.168.1.1. Guess what you morons: NONE OF MY ROUTERS USE HTTPS AND CANNOT BE ACCESSED! Instead I now use Edge which allows what I enter to be used and gives me access. Another reason to dump this crap. Why is it that each and every time I am forced to update: I don't get a choice, I get another reason not to use Firefox. If you charged for this crap the developers would have been sacked long ago. Please don't insult my intelligence by pointing me Privacy &amp; Settings because none of the options make any difference.
