How do I tell Firefox to use DNS like it's supposed to instead of some secret back-door into this Social Marketing rubbish?  Microsoft Edge works just fine.  I've not tried nor do I intend to use Google Chrome so that browser is not an issue.  Just Firefox. </p><p>Is there some cache I need to clear in the infinite number of inane Firefox settings. </p><p>I would like to keep using Firefox if I can just tell it to do what I tell it.
