Worse, it seems to add illicit hypertext to any html-based message that I send, so I can only send simple text messages, and sometimes not even those, because the invisible html iframes are inserted automatically and so my messages can't be sent. This is especially annoying if you have to fill in a web form sheet and it is always rejected because obviously I can't even paste in ""clean"" texts from the editor - they get ""infected"" with all kinds of special characters as soon as I insert them into any given field. Even my provider-based mail program only permits mails which are written in ""text only"" mode and sends me back all the ones that I forgot to format in plain text.  </p><p>Some web forms give you an information why the text cannot be submitted (that's how I learned that 'illicit characters' have intruded into my texts, although I can't see them). One form shortly popped up a small window (which disappeared again after three seconds) which gave me the information that such characters originated from a site called ""remote.video"".  Then I tried to find out what this is. Google gives no information on this site because of ""privacy"" issues. NoScript has a new function which allows you to examine websites: no results. Then I banned ""remove.video"" by putting it on permanent block via LeechBlock, but NoScript shows me it's still there - with every website that I visit (of course I told NoScript that it shall not be trusted). It seems to be permanently resident in my browser no matter what I do. There is no hint that it is somewhere resident in my windows OS, a search for it yields no results whatsoever.    </p><p>No virus scan has ever yielded positive results, my system seems to be virus free (according to AVG, eset and Malwarebytes).   </p><p>Instead, things like the following continue to happen. I quote from a request which I entered into a web form (and which, of course, I was finally unable to submit):    </p><p>""Now your site doesn't give me any information either. Instead (after I gave all permits for your site and entered my mail address), your website wants me to prove I'm not a robot via captcha. After I identify some bridges or taxis or stairs and confirm, it sends me right back to the captcha and asks me to prove I'm not  robot. So I am unable to access any of your possible information. Please send me a mail and tell me how to resolve this problem."" </p><p>In some web forms, typing the text into the editor and then copy it from there into the text field works fine. But in most, it doesn't (see above). </p><p>This is making me crazy. I would have switched to an IOS system if Covid would not have torn a huge hole into my revenues, so I just can't afford to buy a new system at the time and have to stick with my age-old nc-20 notebook, the RAM of which cannot be expanded to more than 2GB.  </p><p>Anyone out there who can tell me how to to solve this problem?

Tentei pesquisar por uma string bem grande de texto no DuckDuckGo pela barra de pesquisa, já que é o meu buscador padrão. Pensei que não causaria erros, e de fato o buscador retornou uma página de erro dizendo que a string era muito grande. Mas quando diminui a string e tentei pesquisar de novo o navegador retornou problema de conexão, e logo vi que a minha internet parecia ter caído. </p><p>Ou pelo menos foi o que pensei pelo ícone, logo em seguida apareceu a tela azul com o erro  </p><p>FAULTY HARDWARE CORRUPTED PAGE </p><p>Que aparentemente ocorre quando um driver manipula de forma errada a memória, mas não entrando nesse mérito, meu Windows reiniciou e veio uma sugestão de restaurar o Windows, o que achei estranho já que devia ser um erro pequeno, mas cliqueis ao invés em reiniciar e depois de muita demora ele não iniciou. Em seguido fui forçado a desligar pelo botão e ligar novamente, quando apareceu a mesma mensagem de restauração. </p><p>Então, aqui estou eu restaurando meu Windows a horas. Por sorte tenho backup de tudo o que é importante, por exemplo meus favoritos do Firefox. Não sei se as minhas extensões contribuíram ou se realmente passei muito tempo sem restaurar o Firefox, ou se o próprio OS manipulou errado, o que não me surpreenderia. De qualquer forma, cá estou eu sem fazer ideia do que aconteceu. Se alguém tiver alguma ideia, para que eu evite que aconteça de novo, ficarei muito agradecido. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,pt-BR,"",darioviveiros155
