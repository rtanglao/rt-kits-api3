Not the first time, either.  Every time I get it squared away (different problem each time), it runs well for a couple of weeks, then it's back again and SOOOO slow it's nearly unuseable.  It's a new (less than one year old) Dell laptop running the latest version of Win10, and it's fully updated. </p><p>I click on the Firefox icon in the taskbar to open it, and after a couple of minutes get a blank white rectangle, and several minutes later, it's still a blank white rectangle.  Fired up Task Manager, and yup... back to 100% disk usage, this time with Firefox sitting right at #1 on the disk usage hog list.   It shows Firefox once, but with a down carat.  Click on the carat, and it shows SEVEN instances of Firefox running!  I have only one Firefox window open, and only a single tab open within that window... so why am I looking at anywhere from six to nine instances of Firefox running?  (Happens to be seven right now...) </p><p>Usually it's ""System"" that's sitting up there, or any one or group of Windows system processes that's pulling everything down, but not this time.  Haven't seen this one before. </p><p>Hope somebody has some ideas; this is a battle I'm getting *really* tired of fighting; it's a lot like playing ""whack-a-mole,"" only not nearly as much fun.  Microsoft has no definitive fix (of course...), just a long laundry list of things to try.  ALL of 'em seem to work for some people, but not for others.  And if you DO manage to kill it... it always seems to come back after awhile.  Linux is looking better every day, gotta tell ya! </p><p>Thanks in advance!! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",kharrisma

The blank space's size varies by post, and is usually equivalent to the size of the images in that same post. This issue does not occur on any other browser for this website, so it has to be an issue with the html interacting with Firefox. Does anyone know any changes I could potentially make to the html of the website itself to fix this? Tumblr is a microblogging website and I have the ability to directly edit the code of my blog, but I do not know how to proceed and fix this issue. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,websites,en-US,1414432;1414438;,matias383
