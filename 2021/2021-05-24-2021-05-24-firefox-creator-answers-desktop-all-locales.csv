Hopefully that's the right word here. </p><p>Just wanted to pass along this issue to get it on your radar. I have an M1 Mac mini and I've noticed a peculiar bug that seems to be a combination of a bug in Firefox and a bug in MacOS. Let's say I fire up my Mac, browse the internet for a while and step away for the night (and computer doesn't go to sleep...disabled that - anyway).  </p><p>I come back to my computer a while later, maybe 6-10 hours or so. When I come back, Firefox seems to be completely hung up and wifi is completely broken on MacOS. I cannot load any pages, and while I can close Firefox windows the application itself will not actually close until I use the MacOS force close menu. No applications at this point can access network resources until the Mac is rebooted, which cannot happen until Firefox is force closed, like described earlier. </p><p>Anyway, if there is any info you need, feel free to let me know and I'll try to get it for you. Happy to help wherever I can. </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ndguardian

The blank space's size varies by post, and is usually equivalent to the size of the images in that same post. This issue does not occur on any other browser for this website, so it has to be an issue with the html interacting with Firefox. Does anyone know any changes I could potentially make to the html of the website itself to fix this? Tumblr is a microblogging website and I have the ability to directly edit the code of my blog, but I do not know how to proceed and fix this issue. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,websites,en-US,1414432;1414438;,matias383
