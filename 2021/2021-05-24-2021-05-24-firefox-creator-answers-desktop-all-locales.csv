The blank space's size varies by post, and is usually equivalent to the size of the images in that same post. This issue does not occur on any other browser for this website, so it has to be an issue with the html interacting with Firefox. Does anyone know any changes I could potentially make to the html of the website itself to fix this? Tumblr is a microblogging website and I have the ability to directly edit the code of my blog, but I do not know how to proceed and fix this issue. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,websites,en-US,1414432;1414438;,matias383
