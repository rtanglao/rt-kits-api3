After updating Firefox on my Macbook, a website I visit now will not load, the message ""transferring data"" will appear and the status indicator looks like the data is loading, then when the status bar looks like its at 100%, it will start over and show ""transferring data"" again, and this keeps repeating indefinitely.  This only happens when using an IPv6 address, it works fine with IPv4. This did not occur in Firefox 81.0.2. This also does not occur on other websites or with other browsers. I am looking at the notes for releases between 81.0.2 and 85.0.1 but am not sure what may have changed that would cause this. The website in question is a BMC GUI for a server I'm working on.  If anyone has any ideas I'd really appreciate it. I tried the debugger in Firefox but not sure what I am looking for. I did set a breakpoint for caught exceptions, and the screenshot is attached if it helps any... Thanks! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jfriedman.seattle

It used to just provide search suggestions from my list of bookmarks, but now below the list of search options is a separate segment with ""This time, search with:"" followed by multiple icons--in my case, Google (my default browser), bookmarks, tabs, history, and settings. And you know how when you're sometimes typing something you want to find and the desired result is toward the bottom of the list, so instead of pressing the down arrow key to get to it, you press the up arrow to start from the end…well now, when I try that on the address bar, it cycles through each icon before letting me get to the list's end.  </p><p>I know it sounds like a petty complaint, but it's annoying and inconvenient to have to do it each and every time since it's habitual to cycle from top to bottom or vice versa on basically every other search bar. I went the route of ""Settings &gt; Options &gt; Search &gt; Search Shortcuts"" to see if I could get rid of these icons, but just like how it doesn't let you get rid of search engines when you only have one on the list, it doesn't give you an option to remove these superfluous icons.  </p><p>These Mozilla dumbasses seem to lack foresight and/or consideration with the way they limit user preferences. Can anybody give me any alternative solutions? Please spare me the snide answers like ""switch to Chrome"" (already considering it). If there's a way to simply circumvent these icons in the address bar rather than getting rid of them entirely, that would be more that enough: I just don't know how to go about it.

I'm a sort-of new Firefox user, and I just noticed some differences in behavior between Firefox and Chrome. </p><p>In Chrome, when I drag a tab out of its window so that I can move it into another window, if the window in question only has one tab, then dragging that one tab will hide the current window and show the background, allowing me to easily drag it into that background window. </p><p>This is especially useful when both windows are maximized. </p><p>In Firefox, I cannot do the same. Dragging a tab around a window with only that one tab open does not hide the current window, but rather, drags the tab around the browser window. I recognize now that this is because I can drag the tab to other places such as the Bookmarks menu, and if the above Chrome behavior was replicated, I would have a hard time doing this with just one tab open. </p><p>Though, I think the way to merge a maximized one-tab window onto another window in Firefox is to just drag the window a bit so it stops becoming maximized, then drag the one tab onto the window behind it. Is that how I'm supposed to do it, or is there a better way? </p><p>On another note, is there any way as of the moment to replicate Chrome's behavior with regard to this tab dragging situation?
