It used to just provide search suggestions from my list of bookmarks, but now below the list of search options is a separate segment with ""This time, search with:"" followed by multiple icons--in my case, Google (my default browser), bookmarks, tabs, history, and settings. And you know how when you're sometimes typing something you want to find and the desired result is toward the bottom of the list, so instead of pressing the down arrow key to get to it, you press the up arrow to start from the end…well now, when I try that on the address bar, it cycles through each icon before letting me get to the list's end.  </p><p>I know it sounds like a petty complaint, but it's annoying and inconvenient to have to do it each and every time since it's habitual to cycle from top to bottom or vice versa on basically every other search bar. I went the route of ""Settings &gt; Options &gt; Search &gt; Search Shortcuts"" to see if I could get rid of these icons, but just like how it doesn't let you get rid of search engines when you only have one on the list, it doesn't give you an option to remove these superfluous icons.  </p><p>These Mozilla dumbasses seem to lack foresight and/or consideration with the way they limit user preferences. Can anybody give me any alternative solutions? Please spare me the snide answers like ""switch to Chrome"" (already considering it). If there's a way to simply circumvent these icons in the address bar rather than getting rid of them entirely, that would be more that enough: I just don't know how to go about it.

I'm a sort-of new Firefox user, and I just noticed some differences in behavior between Firefox and Chrome. </p><p>In Chrome, when I drag a tab out of its window so that I can move it into another window, if the window in question only has one tab, then dragging that one tab will hide the current window and show the background, allowing me to easily drag it into that background window. </p><p>This is especially useful when both windows are maximized. </p><p>In Firefox, I cannot do the same. Dragging a tab around a window with only that one tab open does not hide the current window, but rather, drags the tab around the browser window. I recognize now that this is because I can drag the tab to other places such as the Bookmarks menu, and if the above Chrome behavior was replicated, I would have a hard time doing this with just one tab open. </p><p>Though, I think the way to merge a maximized one-tab window onto another window in Firefox is to just drag the window a bit so it stops becoming maximized, then drag the one tab onto the window behind it. Is that how I'm supposed to do it, or is there a better way? </p><p>On another note, is there any way as of the moment to replicate Chrome's behavior with regard to this tab dragging situation?
