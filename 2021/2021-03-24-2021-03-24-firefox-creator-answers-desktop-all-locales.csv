For a completely unknown extension I am not likely to be comfortable with that, *if the extension can send that data to external endpoints on the web*.  But many add-ons don't need that permission.  For example, an add-on that just adjusts styles on a webpage doesn't need to contact the Internet at all. (It would still need to check for updates, but I assume Firefox would do that and it wouldn't require granting carte-blanche internet access to the Extention). </p><p>I am generally comfortable with an extension contacting the Internet if it doesn't have any of my data (so that nothing privacy-relevant can be sent).  I'd also be comfortable with an extension having major access to data if the data can *never* be sent anywhere - it is just on my machine.  But Firefox doesn't seem to distinguish between these two extremely different privacy cases. </p><p>Is there some plan to implement this, or else some reason why it is not done?  Is the technical challenge extreme for some reason? </p><p>I (and I suspect many others) could use a lot more extensions comfortably if this kind of privacy protection was available. </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-860;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Freewalker1

It allows me to send texts from my desktop computer's web browser.  When FireFox automatically updated to the newest version, something didn't work right and MightyText stopped being able to connect. </p><p>My workaround was to use System Restore to go back in time so to speak. But FireFox is pretty aggressive with their updates, and eventually that stopped being a work around.  </p><p>I tried to install an older version of FireFox manually but I couldn't ever get my profile to work right.  </p><p>So, I've landed somewhere where FireFox has updated to the latest version, AND MightyText works just fine.  </p><p>But now the problem is I cannot use any of my add-ons. Actually, I can re-fresh FireFox, and start it without any add ons. I can add all my add ons and everything works great, but if I restart my computer, FireFox will not connect to the internet (the wheel just spins) until I refresh again and wipe out all the add-ons. After doing so, all my tabs are restored, all my saved passwords, etc--and I can add back the add-ons and they will work until FireFox Crashes or I restart the computer, but then FF won't connect to the internet and around and around we go.  </p><p>What's up? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-81;firefox-870;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",dontbesojumpy

I created a function using the following code ""const $ = $ =&gt; $"". When I called the function with the following code ""$('test')"" I would get a return of ""null"". What is expected to return is ""test"". I have tested other browsers and it would seem to work perfectly fine. These browsers include: Edge, Chrome, Epiphany. I have also tried creating a function like so ""const a = a =&gt; a"". Then I called the function like this ""a('test')"". The result would be ""test"". </p><p>I had also asked a developer friend of mine to test this out and nothing is wrong on his end. I cannot recall what machine my friend runs but I know it does not run Linux. I wouldn't know well enough but my suspicions lie with the Linux version of Firefox.
