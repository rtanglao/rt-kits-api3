It's the laptop that my wife uses and because she's far from tech-friendly, things need to be simple and basic. She didn't want to update it because everything was fine for the limited browsing that she uses the laptop for but for the sake of doing as we're told, we let it happen. </p><p>When the laptop restarted and we went to open Firefox, a damned User Profile Box appeared - one that's got me scratching my head and cursing.  What the hell is it? Choose User Profile Then inside the box; Create Profile Rename Profile  Delete Profile She doesn't have a 'profile' - what the hell is it anyway? Why should we make this change - what's it in aid of? </p><p>Whatever, we opted to click on Rename Profile and found that the existing profile was 'User', so I renamed it with her name - and then started Firefox. A blank Firefox page appeared - with no favourites; no log-ins; no records - NOTHING.  Preferences? NONE. What on earth has happened? She had a selection of physiotherapy exercises in her favourites - WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY?  THEY WERE VITAL FOR HER HEALTH AND NOW THEY'RE GONE. Just what the hell is going on? Why do we need to go through all this - where have all her records gone? </p><p>Ok - I searched the internet for an answer. I then found a similar case from back in 2015 - and the member (because it was on this forum) came to the conclusion that it was best to use Chrome instead - and I reckon that's what my wife will have to do. If this change can't be undone and if her saved information can't be accessed (and EASILY - not via a string of convoluted instructions that neither she nor I will understand) then you've just lost another customer.

For a completely unknown extension I am not likely to be comfortable with that, *if the extension can send that data to external endpoints on the web*.  But many add-ons don't need that permission.  For example, an add-on that just adjusts styles on a webpage doesn't need to contact the Internet at all.

This is my first time in a very long time contacting technical support. Please bare with me as I explain my situation. I recommend that someone that is familiar with Javascript and the browser console help test this issue. </p><p>I try to create a function in the browser console on a very blank html file. I created a function using the following code ""const $ = $ =&gt; $"". When I called the function with the following code ""$('test')"" I would get a return of ""null"". What is expected to return is ""test"". I have tested other browsers and it would seem to work perfectly fine. These browsers include: Edge, Chrome, Epiphany. I have also tried creating a function like so ""const a = a =&gt; a"". Then I called the function like this ""a('test')"". The result would be ""test"". </p><p>I had also asked a developer friend of mine to test this out and nothing is wrong on his end. I cannot recall what machine my friend runs but I know it does not run Linux. I wouldn't know well enough but my suspicions lie with the Linux version of Firefox. I have also tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox from my computer the results seem to remain the same. </p><p>I will attach images for a visual of the situation. I will also leave some specs that might be of concern down below. </p><p>Here are my computer specs: </p><p>LMDE 4 (debbie) x86_64  Kernel: 4.19.0-14-amd64  Shell: bash 5.0.3  Resolution: 2560x1080  DE: Cinnamon 4.8.6  CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 1700 (16) @ 3.000GHz  GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070  Memory: 6153MiB / 64414MiB  </p><p>Firefox Version: 78.9.0esr (64bit) </p><p><br> Please get back to me, Terrance Banh </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,1400853;,firefox.shrouding
