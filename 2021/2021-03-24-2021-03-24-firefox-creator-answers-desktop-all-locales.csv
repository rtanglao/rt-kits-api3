This is my first time in a very long time contacting technical support. Please bare with me as I explain my situation. I recommend that someone that is familiar with Javascript and the browser console help test this issue. </p><p>I try to create a function in the browser console on a very blank html file. I created a function using the following code ""const $ = $ =&gt; $"". When I called the function with the following code ""$('test')"" I would get a return of ""null"". What is expected to return is ""test"". I have tested other browsers and it would seem to work perfectly fine. These browsers include: Edge, Chrome, Epiphany. I have also tried creating a function like so ""const a = a =&gt; a"". Then I called the function like this ""a('test')"". The result would be ""test"". </p><p>I had also asked a developer friend of mine to test this out and nothing is wrong on his end. I cannot recall what machine my friend runs but I know it does not run Linux. I wouldn't know well enough but my suspicions lie with the Linux version of Firefox. I have also tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox from my computer the results seem to remain the same. </p><p>I will attach images for a visual of the situation. I will also leave some specs that might be of concern down below. </p><p>Here are my computer specs: </p><p>LMDE 4 (debbie) x86_64  Kernel: 4.19.0-14-amd64  Shell: bash 5.0.3  Resolution: 2560x1080  DE: Cinnamon 4.8.6  CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 1700 (16) @ 3.000GHz  GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070  Memory: 6153MiB / 64414MiB  </p><p>Firefox Version: 78.9.0esr (64bit) </p><p><br> Please get back to me, Terrance Banh </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",firefox.shrouding
