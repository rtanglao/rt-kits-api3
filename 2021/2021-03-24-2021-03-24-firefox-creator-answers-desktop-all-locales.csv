It's the laptop that my wife uses and because she's far from tech-friendly, things need to be simple and basic. She didn't want to update it because everything was fine for the limited browsing that she uses the laptop for but for the sake of doing as we're told, we let it happen. </p><p>When the laptop restarted and we went to open Firefox, a damned User Profile Box appeared - one that's got me scratching my head and cursing.  What the hell is it? Choose User Profile Then inside the box; Create Profile Rename Profile  Delete Profile She doesn't have a 'profile' - what the hell is it anyway? Why should we make this change - what's it in aid of? </p><p>Whatever, we opted to click on Rename Profile and found that the existing profile was 'User', so I renamed it with her name - and then started Firefox. A blank Firefox page appeared - with no favourites; no log-ins; no records - NOTHING.  Preferences? NONE. What on earth has happened? She had a selection of physiotherapy exercises in her favourites - WHERE THE HELL ARE THEY?  THEY WERE VITAL FOR HER HEALTH AND NOW THEY'RE GONE. Just what the hell is going on? Why do we need to go through all this - where have all her records gone? </p><p>Ok - I searched the internet for an answer. I then found a similar case from back in 2015 - and the member (because it was on this forum) came to the conclusion that it was best to use Chrome instead - and I reckon that's what my wife will have to do. If this change can't be undone and if her saved information can't be accessed (and EASILY - not via a string of convoluted instructions that neither she nor I will understand) then you've just lost another customer.

For a completely unknown extension I am not likely to be comfortable with that, *if the extension can send that data to external endpoints on the web*.  But many add-ons don't need that permission.  For example, an add-on that just adjusts styles on a webpage doesn't need to contact the Internet at all.
