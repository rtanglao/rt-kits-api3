I learned it by heart, also copied it to my iPhone in a safe notation (I have access to the notation using my finger print). It worked just fine for the first days. Today I tried to use the primary password again, in order to enter a website, but somehow FF denies me entrance, again and again. No spelling issues or missing characters, because I copy the primary password from my iPhone notation and paste it into the primary password field on my Mac. In FF Lockwise (on my iPhone) I can also still see my primary FF password, which is exactly the same. Typing it down character by character doesn’t solve the problem, nor does restarting FF. Caps lock is off. No issues with my keyboard. In my privacy and security setting I cannot to stop FF from asking my primary password, because (of course also there) it won’t recognize the primary password I enter... </p><p>There is no one who knows about my primary password nor has anyone access to my computer or iPhone. So there is no way I could explain somebody to have been able to change my primary password. Could anybody please explain to me what might be going on? Did other people experience the same issue? What steps should I take to try to solve it? </p><p>And I surely wish not to need to reset my primary password, because I will lose all my saved passwords from FF... Happily I still have access to FF Lockwise on my iPhone (using my finger print). So I could still copy each password and save it somewhere else. But that would mean quite a lot of work. Besides of that I don’t trust it to work better next time I set up a primary FF password… </p><p>I hope I explained my problem well enough.

When I delete a tab, it leaves a ‘space’ where the tab was, only ‘back filling’ after I’ve opened up another tab to full screen mode and then minimised it again, at which point it goes to the very left-most tab and the only way I can get to tabs further down the list, is by deleting them in the manner described. I’ve actually got 2 laptops (Win 7 &amp; 8.1), and it’s now happening on both of them. This might have something to do with memory management/the computer’s page file, but as things stand, I’m SERIOUSLY going to be switching to another browser - despite sticking with Firefox for many-a-year. BTW, I’m actually writing this on my phone, as I couldn’t now do it on either of my laptops (hence I’m currently unable to attach anything/provide screen grabs etc. I guess the only way to ‘clear’ this issue, would be to either close/restart Firefox or my laptop - neither of which I really want to do.

Maybe there's an extra attribute that I could add to the video tag to preserve the pip window between navigation events?

I've been forced to use Windows 10 and I've apdated both my desktop and my Laptop at the same time (one hour difference) - both run almost exactly the same programs with the exactly same structure (name of software, names of files and/or directories, cookies, extensions etc etc). My Laptop (HP EliteBook) has no problem whatsoever, while on the desktop firefox keeps crashing whenever I sitch on an external HD, or I start a program, or often when I play chess. It crashes also when I'm watching an You Tube clip, and I change clip.... The only time that Firefox doesn't crash is when it is alone, no programs are running in  the background, and I explore the internet using the same window, and not opening any links in a new window. I have an idea of what may be the cause but I'm looking for someone who has my same issues in order to check causes. I must admit that I'm fed up, and I'm seriuosly considering to switch to chrome after having used Firefox since it was born....
