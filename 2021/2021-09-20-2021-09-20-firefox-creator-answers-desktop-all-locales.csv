Having having a variety of issues that come and go when using Facebook.  Some of the problems:  photos in Facebook feed not showing or only a couple (sometimes was okay), Facebook Messenger sometimes was blank, got so I had to sign in every time I left Facebook and went back to it, sometimes when I would try to type a comment or type in Facebook search box it would not let me type, in a Facebook photo album it only showed photos on one side and then other times it would not show photos.  I cleared the cache while still in Facebook and also when signed out.  I've used F5 numerous times. I tried making the cache larger.  Still had issues.  I tried a different browser and did not have those problems.  Problems are not all constant.  I finally ended up uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox, which so far has helped with some of the problems (at least when I tried it), but not all.  I tried to type a comment now and it would not allow me to. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ca266b
