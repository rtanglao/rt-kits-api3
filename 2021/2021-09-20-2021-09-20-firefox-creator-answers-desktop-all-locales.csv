NOT! </p><p>USED TO BE:  Click on a Bookmark in the Bookmarks Toolbar and the roll-down would be single lines -- meaning a person could control the number of links in that Bookmark so the roll-down would go to the bottom of the screen.  Simple to read, no extra activity needed. </p><p>NOW IN THE ""NEW &amp; IMPROVED"" VERSION:  Click on a Bookmark in the Bookmarks Toolbar and the roll-down is 1.5 or 2.0 spacing -- meaning a person is now required to futz with the roll-down since it goes way past the bottom of the screen.  A waste of time to search, since one is required to spend the extra activity to scroll down and down and down until all of the bookmarks have become visible. </p><p>VISIBLE?  Ha.  Part of the ""NEW &amp; IMPROVED VERSION"" is that the screen font used by Firefox is that all-too-ubiquitous light gray color that can barely be read unless is blessed with exceptionally good eyesight.  Some websites these days think it is So Very Hip to utilize that style of font -- but make it even lighter!  Mindless Madness. </p><p>SO:  How does one  1.  Return the Bookmark roll-down list back to a single-line style? 2.  Change the font color so that it is dark enough to be readily read? </p><p>Thank you. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-920;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Hikermann

Having having a variety of issues that come and go when using Facebook.  Some of the problems:  photos in Facebook feed not showing or only a couple (sometimes was okay), Facebook Messenger sometimes was blank, got so I had to sign in every time I left Facebook and went back to it, sometimes when I would try to type a comment or type in Facebook search box it would not let me type, in a Facebook photo album it only showed photos on one side and then other times it would not show photos.  I cleared the cache while still in Facebook and also when signed out.  I've used F5 numerous times. I tried making the cache larger.  Still had issues.  I tried a different browser and did not have those problems.  Problems are not all constant.  I finally ended up uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox, which so far has helped with some of the problems (at least when I tried it), but not all.  I tried to type a comment now and it would not allow me to. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ca266b
