Whenever I go to a page on it and it times out, the location protocol changes from http to https. I suppose it is trying to help me out by saying if I typed in the protocol wrong. </p><p>This is annoying because I have to manually edit the address bar and hit enter. I'd rather be able to refresh without thinking. Is there a way of turning this functionality off? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",tieTYT

What the hell is wrong with you guys...?? Are you secretly employed by Microsoft and/or Google....?? Seriously, this is no way to run a browser company. It is, however, a great way to ruin one. Give us a break, and stop breaking our browsers. You ruin our experience, and you do it on a semi regular basis. It's all well and fine to release new stuff, with new features, but for the love of God if it's gonna break what we already have, at the very least offer us a way to keep what we have, and have it supported even in a minimal way, and branch off the new option. I get your fears, you fear that not enough people will opt for the new one like that, and you're probably right. That however, should tell you something. </p><p>We loyally support your project. That should be worth something. Thanks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,"",snikky

It was partially successful, as described below. </p><p>First, a little more on update history.  I have multiple accounts on my computer.  My main account we will call Account-A and another account is Account-B.  Account-B was setup years ago as a backdoor into my computer in case Account-A became corrupted. A couple of other accounts were for my kids and have not been accessed in years. </p><p>Fast Forward - After Installation of both upgrades (OS X 11.6 and FireFox 92.0) from Account-A,  I then went to Account-B and found missing bookmarks.  I followed instructions provided on FireFox’s website under “about:profile” and recovered my bookmarks under Account-B </p><p>I returned to Account-A and discovered the same problem.  I went to “about:bookmarks” and attempted to recover my bookmarks. The profile said it was fixed  and was not able to be changed and could not be accessed. Note the file paths were different.  </p><p>After nearly giving up in trying to find the file as displayed on the file path on FireFox about:profile page, I found what I believe are the fifteen (15) previous files that FireFox stores.   I am unable to select any previous bookmark file from the list within the ‘about:profile” page. </p><p>In an attempt to buy time before the file is over-written and preserve what I believe are my bookmarks, I COPIED, the one file from yesterday (Sept 18, 2021) to my Desktop. </p><p>I need further help or guidance on recovering my bookmarks under Account-A. </p><p>Thank you in advance for any and all help! </p>",desktop;bookmarks;firefox-920;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",mainstade

A waste of time to search, since one is required to spend the extra activity to scroll down and down and down until all of the bookmarks have become visible. </p><p>VISIBLE?  Ha.  Part of the ""NEW &amp; IMPROVED VERSION"" is that the screen font used by Firefox is that all-too-ubiquitous light gray color that can barely be read unless is blessed with exceptionally good eyesight.  Some websites these days think it is So Very Hip to utilize that style of font -- but make it even lighter!  Mindless Madness. </p><p>SO:  How does one  1.  Return the Bookmark roll-down list back to a single-line style? 2.  Change the font color so that it is dark enough to be readily read? </p><p>Thank you. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-920;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Hikermann

Having having a variety of issues that come and go when using Facebook.  Some of the problems:  photos in Facebook feed not showing or only a couple (sometimes was okay), Facebook Messenger sometimes was blank, got so I had to sign in every time I left Facebook and went back to it, sometimes when I would try to type a comment or type in Facebook search box it would not let me type, in a Facebook photo album it only showed photos on one side and then other times it would not show photos.  I cleared the cache while still in Facebook and also when signed out.  I've used F5 numerous times. I tried making the cache larger.  Still had issues.  I tried a different browser and did not have those problems.  Problems are not all constant.  I finally ended up uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox, which so far has helped with some of the problems (at least when I tried it), but not all.  I tried to type a comment now and it would not allow me to. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ca266b
