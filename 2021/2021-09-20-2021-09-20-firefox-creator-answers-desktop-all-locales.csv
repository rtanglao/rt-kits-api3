I've been forced to use Windows 10 and I've apdated both my desktop and my Laptop at the same time (one hour difference) - both run almost exactly the same programs with the exactly same structure (name of software, names of files and/or directories, cookies, extensions etc etc). My Laptop (HP EliteBook) has no problem whatsoever, while on the desktop firefox keeps crashing whenever I sitch on an external HD, or I start a program, or often when I play chess. It crashes also when I'm watching an You Tube clip, and I change clip.... The only time that Firefox doesn't crash is when it is alone, no programs are running in  the background, and I explore the internet using the same window, and not opening any links in a new window. I have an idea of what may be the cause but I'm looking for someone who has my same issues in order to check causes. I must admit that I'm fed up, and I'm seriuosly considering to switch to chrome after having used Firefox since it was born....  Thank you, Marko </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",marko.meloni

What the hell is wrong with you guys...?? Are you secretly employed by Microsoft and/or Google....?? Seriously, this is no way to run a browser company. It is, however, a great way to ruin one. Give us a break, and stop breaking our browsers. You ruin our experience, and you do it on a semi regular basis. It's all well and fine to release new stuff, with new features, but for the love of God if it's gonna break what we already have, at the very least offer us a way to keep what we have, and have it supported even in a minimal way, and branch off the new option. I get your fears, you fear that not enough people will opt for the new one like that, and you're probably right. That however, should tell you something. </p><p>We loyally support your project.

I cleared the cache while still in Facebook and also when signed out.  I've used F5 numerous times. I tried making the cache larger.  Still had issues.  I tried a different browser and did not have those problems.  Problems are not all constant.  I finally ended up uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox, which so far has helped with some of the problems (at least when I tried it), but not all.
