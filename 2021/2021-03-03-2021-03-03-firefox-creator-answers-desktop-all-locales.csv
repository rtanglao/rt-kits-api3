The toolbar of the workbook ist still in the same position as it should be. </p><p>My suspicion is that the workbook simply is a PDF and that only the embedded PDF turned but not the whole browser window?

(It is nice to see a program in your native language. However, most manuals, tutorials, forums etc. on the Web are in English, so using English version of apps wherever possible feels straightforward and consistent). I found one functionality that is browser language dependent for no reason - availability of search engines. Specifically, <a href=""http://allegro.pl"" rel=""nofollow"">allegro.pl</a> (Polish auction site). It's there by default when Firefox language is set to Polish. When I switch to English, it disappears along with other default Polish search engines, only to be replaced by English ones. </p><p>When I try a ""manual"" setup of search engines, <a href=""http://allegro.pl"" rel=""nofollow"">allegro.pl</a> is nowhere to be found. Firefox settings -&gt; find search engines - no official allegro search engine (just some fan-made add-ons). Go to <a href=""http://allegro.pl"" rel=""nofollow"">allegro.pl</a> -&gt; Firefox search bar - I expected the icon of magnifier with green plus sign that would add the search engine of current site - again it's not there. </p><p>Is there any workaround?

The worst element of this from my point of view as a teacher who frequently prints from the internet is the newly imposed loss of the capacity to customize headers and footers. The two-pages-per-sheet option is obviously a good thing, but in order to number the pages, one is required to splay the URL across the entire top of the page. This is yet worse if you attempt to use the two-page-per-sheet format; you will now have the URL displayed TWICE across the top of the entire page. It's ugly and unnecessary, as is the date and time that I prepped the material. The title is at the top of any article; now it also have to be on every sheet multiple times, alongside the URL, the date and time, and only one possible numbering format. What is sad is that it appears not to be understood that the desired form for much printing from the internet is something approximating the  appearance of a book or journal page; whether it is two on one page, or single pages per sheet. If anyone knows how to preserve BOTH the customizable headers and footers AND select one OR two pages per sheet, we'd be very well-helped. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",bwp123
