The worst element of this from my point of view as a teacher who frequently prints from the internet is the newly imposed loss of the capacity to customize headers and footers. The two-pages-per-sheet option is obviously a good thing, but in order to number the pages, one is required to splay the URL across the entire top of the page. This is yet worse if you attempt to use the two-page-per-sheet format; you will now have the URL displayed TWICE across the top of the entire page. It's ugly and unnecessary, as is the date and time that I prepped the material. The title is at the top of any article; now it also have to be on every sheet multiple times, alongside the URL, the date and time, and only one possible numbering format. What is sad is that it appears not to be understood that the desired form for much printing from the internet is something approximating the  appearance of a book or journal page; whether it is two on one page, or single pages per sheet. If anyone knows how to preserve BOTH the customizable headers and footers AND select one OR two pages per sheet, we'd be very well-helped. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",bwp123

For the past couple months i've been able to use the web version of Google Earth within the browser with little to no issue. However, about a week or two ago I discovered Google Earth stopped working whenever I tried to use it. I would navigate to Google Earth's website, click ""Launch Google Earth"", and be met with this loading screen which never changes. I went to Google for help and they had me run Memtest86 on my computer, to which I found all of my RAM sticks were fully functional with 0 error or issue. </p><p>I am using the absolute latest version of firefox as well as my operating system. I am running Windows 10 on a custom built PC for gaming, 64-bit. I've tried the following: </p><p>-disabling browser addons -restarting firefox -disabling my antivirus -disabling my antimalware -restarting computer (multiple times) -disabling ALL of my browser addons </p><p>Now at first google earth wouldn't load in google chrome either, but at some point during my troubleshooting for fixing google earth on firefox, google earth began loading in chrome with no issue. As of now the only browser that can't pull up google earth is Firefox. I've attached a screenshot of the error messages I see when loading Google Earth in firefox. </p><p>Please, any and all help would be greatly appreciated. If there's anymore relevant, useful information I could provide then please let me know. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;webgl;firefox-860;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1396109;1396117;1396130;,jocusmo
