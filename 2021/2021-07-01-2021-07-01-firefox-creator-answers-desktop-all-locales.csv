In most cases my practice would be to simply block .menu-iconic-left via userChrome. With the latest versions of Firefox this also blocks the display of the #contentAreaContextMenu navigation icons. This would normally not be an issue as I would apply the blocking of icons to individual context menu items instead i.e. </p> <ol><li>CONTEXT-MENU-ITEM &gt; .menu-iconic-left { </li></ol> <pre>  display: none !important; </pre> <p>} However, there are some context menu items added by extensions which have a number suffix in their element name - An example would be #CONTEXT-MENU-ITEM-### where '###' represents a number that changes with each page opened. In this instance, my efforts to block the .menu-iconic-left element are thwarted as the element name is effectively different when the above-mentioned number changes. </p><p>Is there a CSS means of applying the code with the inclusion of a number range?
