Please post a work around to make the bookmarks single spaced.  I was able to change how they are spaced in the bookmarks bar, but not the rest of the bookmarks that are at the top of the page under the favorites icon. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",zuck1517

Trying to use that did nothing. Neither did using the regular reload button. I cleared the cache and even  about:serviceworkers and looked up Twitter, and clicked 'unregister.' On both Twitter <em>and</em> Tweetdeck. But it still gives me the message that something is wrong on twitter proper, though tweetdeck still shows tweets and the like fine. Can anyone confirm if Twitter is having issues right now, or if it's somehow on my end? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Marc7

In most cases my practice would be to simply block .menu-iconic-left via userChrome. With the latest versions of Firefox this also blocks the display of the #contentAreaContextMenu navigation icons. This would normally not be an issue as I would apply the blocking of icons to individual context menu items instead i.e. </p> <ol><li>CONTEXT-MENU-ITEM &gt; .menu-iconic-left { </li></ol> <pre>  display: none !important; </pre> <p>} However, there are some context menu items added by extensions which have a number suffix in their element name - An example would be #CONTEXT-MENU-ITEM-### where '###' represents a number that changes with each page opened. In this instance, my efforts to block the .menu-iconic-left element are thwarted as the element name is effectively different when the above-mentioned number changes. </p><p>Is there a CSS means of applying the code with the inclusion of a number range? Unless of course I'm barking up the wrong tree and there is a much simpler solution. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,1425022;1425030;1425031;1425033;1425034;1425036;1425037;,deanone
