Right clicking on that blank location where the story pictures should be does not get a ""properties"" notation nor anything else. It's as if it has not downloaded at all. It's easy to eliminate any anti virus protections from interfering because it happens on all of my computers. My Windows 10 computers use Firefox 64 bit 88.0.1 and one uses Norton 360 anti virus and the other uses Trend Micro anti virus.  My other computers are running on Linux Mint 20.1 and Firefox 86.0.1. The fact that two different OS's display the same trouble points straight to Firefox. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,"",cavman35
