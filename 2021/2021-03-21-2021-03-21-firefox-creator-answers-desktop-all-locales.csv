It's very annoying and frustrating. In search help the answer is not simple to understand. Please tell me, what is sessionstore and where can it be found?  Why is there not a button to fix this problem? If sessionstore gets corrupted frequently as mine seems to (according to the answer) why not have a sessionstore back-up and a routine to correct the problem or at least easily recover from the corruption? </p>",windows-7;desktop;tabs;firefox-860;firefox-8601;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",Vicr
