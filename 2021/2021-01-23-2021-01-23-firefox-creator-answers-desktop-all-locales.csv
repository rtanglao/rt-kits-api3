1322911,2021-01-22 17:27:05 -0800,2021-01-22 17:27:05 -0800,Some webpage images do not show,"<p>I find that images generally show on webpages such as the front page of a news site.  However, when I click into a specific article, the image which is usually near the start of an article in a lot of cases does not show (so it's not a ""always  never shown"" situation); it's as if it's been removed from the webpage syntax  i.e. there's no white space section showing something is missing.  One example (of many I could include!) is <a href=""https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/phonics-revolution-the-new-sound-of-reading-in-the-nations-schools/7A5UVZ55NAOJEQACLKELCNEU6U/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/phonics-revolution-the-new-sound-of-reading-in-the-nations-schools/7A5UVZ55NAOJEQACLKELCNEU6U/</a> I verified there are images there by restarting Firefox with Add-ons disabled (which starts Firefox in Safe Mode), and also by opening in another browser.  So I went thru and disabled *all* add-ons and restarted Firefox.  Images still don't show!  These missing images only show when I run Firefox in Safe Mode. </p><p>In the back of my mind, there is/used-to-be an option to limit the size of images on a page(?) but I can't find any option now.  I have also refreshed Firefox (a number of times; including a total de-install, reboot, re-install) but the problem remains. .. What am I missing?  I'd like to be able to see these images. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-840;firefox-8402;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",LudwigWN

Restart could not proceed because Firefox was still running. I went to the Task Manager to end the Firefox process but the Task Manager was not able to stop it. I had to reboot the computer to end Firefox. You know a crash is real bad when the OS can't even terminate it. Just wanted to see if someone could pass this along to the developers as the feedback page does not appear to be working.
