I recently decided to tinker around a little with private browsing.  I had my laptop and phone sync'd.  Within the last 10 days or so I have been restricted to only accessing my bank using private browsing.  I have been online with my bank to try and resolve, to no avail.  I have added exceptions for all the cookies, pop up windows etc for my bank and still nothing.  I have disabled the syncing and still nothing. My bank said they have had some communications issues with Firefox...I tried to login with Chrome and sailed right into my bank account.  I really don't want to have to use another browser to access my bank. </p><p>Below is the error I get.  Please help!! its truly a hassle to HAVE to use private browsing for 1 item. </p><p>Access Denied You don't have permission to access ""<a href=""http://signon.navyfederal.org/siteminderagent/forms/nfcu.fcc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://signon.navyfederal.org/siteminderagent/forms/nfcu.fcc</a>"" on this server. </p><p>Reference #18.37022417.1617761856.4d8aaa4d  </p><p>Thank you for your time in advance! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",MMButler

I've tried both the network name and password, as well as the Orbi user name and password, with no success. It happens multiple times a day now, but only on sites we type in. Sometimes if I add https://www. to the beginning of the address it'll work, but often that doesn't solve it either. </p>",desktop;websites;firefox-870;,firefox,websites,en-US,1403962;,bcmallonee

I am constantly getting this popup (see attached) when on the <a href=""http://Nine.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">Nine.com.au</a> site (using Firefox 87.0 on Mac OS 10.14.6). It is only occurring on this particular website and only seems to happen when I'm using Firefox as my browser. I've gone to the same site in both Chrome and Safari and the popup doesn't appear. FWIW, the TV network that this website it affiliated with was recently the target of a (suspected State orchestrated) cyber attack - not sure if that's just coincidence and completely unrelated to the issue I'm having: <a href=""https://www.9news.com.au/national/nine-network-hit-by-cyber-attack-threatening-news-services-nationwide/c653fe12-a5c4-4da8-9a33-b902f1325eed"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.9news.com.au/national/nine-network-hit-by-cyber-attack-threatening-news-services-nationwide/c653fe12-a5c4-4da8-9a33-b902f1325eed</a> Obviously I haven't clicked through on the popup, I just close it each time, but it's getting annoying and I can't seem to get rid of it.
