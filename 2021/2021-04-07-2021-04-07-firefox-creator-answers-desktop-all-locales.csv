I rarely use the current version of Firefox as; it never works 'out of the box', one has to learn to use the 'new features' by trial and error as there are no instructions of the 'changes'..... Being BUGGED for weeks every second to ""upgrade"", they wore me down.  I tried to install rel 87.0. I got a message warning that using an older release would be disastrous and the two options was “EXIT or CREATE A NEW PROFILE"". I choose EXIT. IT REFUSED TO CONINUED. It only accepted ""NEW PROFILE"". After 87.0 came up, EVERYING WAS GONE, BOOKMARKS, HISTORY, ADD-ONS....and an hour later trying to customize the toolbars.... AND features like the old ""+"" TO ADD A NEW TAB.... IT REALLY ""GOT MY 'GOAT'. [A NICER FORM OF HOW I FELT ABOUT MOZELLA/FIREFOX PERSONNEL] and rel 87.0 There are NO actual instructions on how to go to your old profile which MIGHT let you see, restore all the crap a NEW PROFILE LOST.

The graphs on the binance exchange site have stopped updating for me on Firefox. I mean when i load the page with the graph in it the graph is static and i have to keep refreshing the entire page to see changes in the graph. I should mention that the graphs on a different site that i use work fine and display the prices in real time. </p><p>I also had microsoft edge and the same problem happens there too but today i installed chrome and the problem in NOT present there. So the site and graphs update and work properly in chrome but not in Firefox or edge. I prefer to use Firefox for everything! </p><p>-I tried Firefox safe mode and the problem is still there.  -I also made a new Firefox profile and the problem is still there.  -Finally i even refreshed Firefox but even that didnt fix the problem.  I should mention that i have Firefox sync enabled so after i refreshed Firefox it automatically installed back all my addons (and other settings?) so even though it is refreshed it looks and behaves exactly like before i don't know if that ""cancels"" the effects of the refresh. </p><p>I am running win10 and my antivirus is kaspersky. I had Kaspesky on ""pause protection"" while i was troubleshooting but that didnt help either. I hope i managed to explain everything because i find it hard to express my self in English. If you need me to clarify anything let me know. I hope someone can help me with this because I don't know what else to try. </p><p>Thanks in advance Kiri </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",kiriup
