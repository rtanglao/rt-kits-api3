I am constantly getting this popup (see attached) when on the <a href=""http://Nine.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">Nine.com.au</a> site (using Firefox 87.0 on Mac OS 10.14.6). It is only occurring on this particular website and only seems to happen when I'm using Firefox as my browser. I've gone to the same site in both Chrome and Safari and the popup doesn't appear. FWIW, the TV network that this website it affiliated with was recently the target of a (suspected State orchestrated) cyber attack - not sure if that's just coincidence and completely unrelated to the issue I'm having: <a href=""https://www.9news.com.au/national/nine-network-hit-by-cyber-attack-threatening-news-services-nationwide/c653fe12-a5c4-4da8-9a33-b902f1325eed"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.9news.com.au/national/nine-network-hit-by-cyber-attack-threatening-news-services-nationwide/c653fe12-a5c4-4da8-9a33-b902f1325eed</a> Obviously I haven't clicked through on the popup, I just close it each time, but it's getting annoying and I can't seem to get rid of it. Thank in advance. </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-870;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",starkyl
