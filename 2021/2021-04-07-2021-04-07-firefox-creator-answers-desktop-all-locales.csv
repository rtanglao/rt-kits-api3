I downloaded from the Mozzilla site the new Firefox for Windows 10, uninstalled Firefox and installed the new one. Then again these sites noted that my browser was old. Again I uninstalled Firefox completely and then I found out that ALL the files were not deleted but some kind of hidden. In Windows Verkenner there were no files to be found but my firewall found them all, but they had no size, no date, no digital signature at all. </p><p>Then I deceded to do a test. In the firewall I switched all the rights of the ""deleted"" files into ""forbidden access"". Then again made a new installation with the new installation file. It proceded as normal. But then it apeared that again the same old version of Firefox was present again. </p><p>My question is: what is happening here. </p><p>Best wishes and thank you, Han Benes </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",hanbenes

In particular <a href=""http://udemy.com"" rel=""nofollow"">udemy.com</a>, as well as <a href=""http://my.onexamination.com"" rel=""nofollow"">my.onexamination.com</a> I feel this is an issue due to firefox privacy containers, as the tracking on these websites is trying to get information which firefox is denying it, causing a delay in resolution. I prefer firefox but I am starting to use chrome for such websites.
