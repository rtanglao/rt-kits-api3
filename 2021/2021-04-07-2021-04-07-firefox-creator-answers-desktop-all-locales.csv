I recently decided to tinker around a little with private browsing.  I had my laptop and phone sync'd.  Within the last 10 days or so I have been restricted to only accessing my bank using private browsing.  I have been online with my bank to try and resolve, to no avail.  I have added exceptions for all the cookies, pop up windows etc for my bank and still nothing.  I have disabled the syncing and still nothing. My bank said they have had some communications issues with Firefox...I tried to login with Chrome and sailed right into my bank account.  I really don't want to have to use another browser to access my bank. </p><p>Below is the error I get.

FWIW, the TV network that this website it affiliated with was recently the target of a (suspected State orchestrated) cyber attack - not sure if that's just coincidence and completely unrelated to the issue I'm having: <a href=""https://www.9news.com.au/national/nine-network-hit-by-cyber-attack-threatening-news-services-nationwide/c653fe12-a5c4-4da8-9a33-b902f1325eed"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.9news.com.au/national/nine-network-hit-by-cyber-attack-threatening-news-services-nationwide/c653fe12-a5c4-4da8-9a33-b902f1325eed</a> Obviously I haven't clicked through on the popup, I just close it each time, but it's getting annoying and I can't seem to get rid of it.
