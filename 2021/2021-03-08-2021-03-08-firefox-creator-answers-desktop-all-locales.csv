I've used firefox for a long time with this printer with no problem, but recently it started printing double width or more characters rendering the printouts useless. If a document is in PDF form, I have to save it and then print it out from a separate PDF viewer. If printing a web page or a receipt, I have to use another browser or try and copy the page to MSWord for printing. I'm guessing this might be a problem caused by an update, but if not, what setting is causing this? The paper is set to A4 and all settings I can see look fine.
