Initially it was the page freezing and causing me to have to stop issues. Now the program will not open or work at all. All I get is a white page, I can't sign in or out nothing. This program is important to my work. I tried yesterday clearing the cache and that didn't help. Anyone else having issues with Hootsuite? Please help, I need this program to work or I have to move to Chrome as it will work on Chrome with no issues, but everything is saved here on Firefox so it would be a nightmare to move. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",cindysbd

It occurred to me that I'd read somewhere that if you told Firefox to ""forget this site,"" it might solve the ""access denied"" problem. I didn't remember how to do this, though, so I searched online and found a site that said that adding the ""Remove"" button to the Toolbar and clicking it would solve the problem. I dutifully added the ""Remove"" button, then, before clicking it, I triple-checked that the ""Forget the last Five minutes"" was selected and not any longer period of time. After all, I didn't want to lose everything! </p><p>Well, I did. </p><p>I had literally hundreds of tabs that I was working on open — they're all gone. All of my history — years worth — is missing. More things may have been deleted, but, to be honest, I'm afraid to check. </p><p>What did I do wrong? Or is the ""Remove"" button buggy? </p><p>And while I believe that everything that's missing now is irretrievably lost, if anyone has a hack to recover anything, I would be so, so grateful if you'd let me know. </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p><p>P.S. I wrote this post up once, hit ""Submit,"" then, after an interminable period of time, the screen went to a blank page. My original post has never appeared.

All of the government forms are available as PDFs on this website.  However if I try to download a form the site looks at the browser description and does not see Adobe Acrobat installed on my system, so it returns a text document telling me to install Adobe Acrobat release 8 or higher.  I cannot install Adobe Acrobat because Adobe does not support Linux.  I don't need to install Adobe because Firefox, Chrome, and every other browser on the market has builtin support for PDF.
