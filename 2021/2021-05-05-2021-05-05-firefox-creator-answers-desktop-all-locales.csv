All of the government forms are available as PDFs on this website.  However if I try to download a form the site looks at the browser description and does not see Adobe Acrobat installed on my system, so it returns a text document telling me to install Adobe Acrobat release 8 or higher.  I cannot install Adobe Acrobat because Adobe does not support Linux.  I don't need to install Adobe because Firefox, Chrome, and every other browser on the market has builtin support for PDF.  How do I customize Firefox to LIE to the website and say that Adobe Acrobat is installed? </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",jamescobban

I am sick of the banner that pops up at times that affects the browsing ability which is entirely annoying and how do I remove the shield and padlock from my fire fox entirely. I hate having to disable those as they interfere with the operation of my firefox and website that I have because not all the content on my website fails to load if the mixed content is disabiled. I'm tired of having this on my browser. I have to enable all my site features everytime I reload my browser. This is totally in the way. </p>,desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",warriorprincess4christ7077
