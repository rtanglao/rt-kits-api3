Sorry FF folks, but bookmark management in the new ff is still a disaster. </p><p>Bookmark management failures to be corrected asap: 1. it does not properly delete and create new bookmarks 2. you cannot search by folder name, only bookmark name 3. there is no feature 'show in folder' like the old extension 'go parent folder' (which is key to any proper bookmark management) </p><p>4. many more intelligent features are missing, but start with the above and you get am actually useful browser (many still use the old ff for bookmark management, since nothing compares) </p><p>5. make bookmarks, cookies, history and any user customizations or content completely inaccessible by any site as it is horrible to learn that sites could read all those and much more for many years (who ever had such a bad, evil and abusive idea) </p><p>Please stop any ignorance/superficiality, as they are not solutions, but problems!
