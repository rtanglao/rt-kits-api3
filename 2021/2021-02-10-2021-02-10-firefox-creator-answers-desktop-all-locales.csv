History tab is for editing history. Password tab is for editing passwords. It's not rocket science. Don't add functionality for the sake of it. If the function will delete something as important as a password to a website, maybe, just maybe, GIVE A WARNING IN BIG BRIGHT BOLD LETTERS. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,other,en-US,1390995;,CrankyFFUser

When I try it asks for my windows credentials. I try logging in and it says that they do not work. I verify the log in is correct by logging into my Microsoft account, and into the PC itself with the same log in information.

Instead, it deleted everything - my logins, my cookies, my extensions - and I don't know how to get it back. I tried looking online for the answers, but none of the solutions I found worked (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1195682"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1195682</a> was the closest one that had some semblance of sanity) and the closest I figured was that I needed to either create a new profile with different settings I could import from my Old Firefox Data or put the Old Firefox Data in the Profiles folder which doesn't seem to be working, as there are always two other folders within. I tried creating new profiles with the Old Firefox Data as the basis, yet it doesn't work. In addition, I like my old profile and don't exactly want to switch, although if that is the cost of retrieving my data, I will take it. Any solutions please? I rely on my computer quite often, and I don't want to be handicapped for a while. My computer is also the recent updated Mac version, if that helps. </p>",mac-os;desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",amylastlast123
