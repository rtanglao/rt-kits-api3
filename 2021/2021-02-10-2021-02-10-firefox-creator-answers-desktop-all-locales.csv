I didn't think to look into the %AppData% and figured a uninstall/reinstall would fix it just fine. But now that it's reinstalled everything from bookmarks to extensions are all gone. I had few important things up that I was working on. Is there anyway to get it all back? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",mtrmapua

Anything that works to stop tabs closing or the browser shutting down? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",sle727

Instead, it deleted everything - my logins, my cookies, my extensions - and I don't know how to get it back. I tried looking online for the answers, but none of the solutions I found worked (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1195682"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1195682</a> was the closest one that had some semblance of sanity) and the closest I figured was that I needed to either create a new profile with different settings I could import from my Old Firefox Data or put the Old Firefox Data in the Profiles folder which doesn't seem to be working, as there are always two other folders within. I tried creating new profiles with the Old Firefox Data as the basis, yet it doesn't work. In addition, I like my old profile and don't exactly want to switch, although if that is the cost of retrieving my data, I will take it. Any solutions please? I rely on my computer quite often, and I don't want to be handicapped for a while. My computer is also the recent updated Mac version, if that helps. </p>",mac-os;desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",amylastlast123

Sorry FF folks, but bookmark management in the new ff is still a disaster. </p><p>Bookmark management failures to be corrected asap: 1. it does not properly delete and create new bookmarks 2. you cannot search by folder name, only bookmark name 3. there is no feature 'show in folder' like the old extension 'go parent folder' (which is key to any proper bookmark management) </p><p>4. many more intelligent features are missing, but start with the above and you get am actually useful browser (many still use the old ff for bookmark management, since nothing compares) </p><p>5. make bookmarks, cookies, history and any user customizations or content completely inaccessible by any site as it is horrible to learn that sites could read all those and much more for many years (who ever had such a bad, evil and abusive idea) </p><p>Please stop any ignorance/superficiality, as they are not solutions, but problems! The old ff was great, the new ff is...well, not new anymore...so it really needs the above done/fixed. </p><p>Thx! </p> <dl><dd>) </dd></dl>",windows-7;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-850;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",spdgnzls
