I have gone in an turned off Bing for search options and Google is the preferred search engine, but still does not work. I know I should be able to go in to Add-ons and delete anything with ""bing"" in the name along with other things, but whatever this is will not allow the Add-ons page open up. It is just a blank page. I have gone to the programs uninstall on the computer also and nothing I can see that shouldn't be there. I just want Google back and I am assuming that there was some auto update that happened and this tagged along because I haven't installed anything on here for a while. Any help would be appreciated. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",Shane.Hanson

However, it only drills down to application level, and no further. So I'm wondering is it technically possible for each Firefox tab to be individually assigned to an audio output of the user's preference, maybe in a dropdown when right clicking the tab? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",chrishase
