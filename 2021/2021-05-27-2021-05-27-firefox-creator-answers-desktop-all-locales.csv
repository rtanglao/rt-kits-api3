It's nothing to do with resources. I've recently upgraded my laptop and I did not experience it on my old one. I have an i711 so the CPU is more than quick enough to handle the processes and 16GB of RAM, so memory is not the problem either. As far as I can see, it is do with Firefox. The add ons I have are all approved by Mozilla so I would assume they're not the problem either.  </p><p>This hiccup only occurs when I open a new tab and it is not consistent and difficult to predict when it will happen. It's like the laptop doesn't have the available resources to open up the new tab- but it does, more than enough.  </p><p>I had a look through the help articles and couldn't find one that applies to my situation.
