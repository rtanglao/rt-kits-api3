Told to go to General/Performance/Use hardware acceleration, remove check mark which I have done twice and it didn't help, everything still the same so it makes it hard to read when each individual letter has a dark and light side, r/l or top/bottom!  This has been a problem for a long time, especially after I refresh!  Two other MAJOR problems though, there is no ""HOME"" button anymore, and my bookmarks, and bookmark toolbar/menu that I had on the left side of the screen is GONE!  Both of those are the worst, and I can find nothing to restore either of them!!!!!!
