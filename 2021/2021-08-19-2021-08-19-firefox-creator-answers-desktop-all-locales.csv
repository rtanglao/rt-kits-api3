Now every time i restart the browser, all site settings are reset. That includes acknowledging new machine sign-ins into gmail (every single time even after choosing to remember the device), entering verification codes sent to my email to sign into other websites that I never signed out of before closing the browser. Some websites like youtube and twitch I have to set up over and over again. This is extremely annoying and I've never had these issues before the update. I checked all the settings for clearing data upon closing the browser and none are enabled just like they have never been. I do not want to reinstall firefox as I have a load of personalized tweaks done that I cant even remember. Any suggestions? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,1436502;,alex7537

Therefore, I wasn’t able to export my past projects to Glitch such as many other users. I’ve already created two Glitch accounts in order to see if it’s still possible to transfer information, but you all seem to have no form of direct customer service contact.
