Firefox'a çok alıştım ancak günümün önemli bir kısmı Youtube'da geçtiği için bu durum benim için problem oluşturmakta.Önerileriniz nelerdir? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,websites,tr,"",dabbe_samet_

Particularly there should be a mandatory step to backup a current profile before updating.  Today I updated Firefox not by choice, for some reason my PC decided that a single click was a double click. So the latest version created a brand new profile I assume because I already had Firefox open. I am beyond rage right now because I just spent the last half hour trying to find my correct profile in my user data because for some insane reason Firefox decided to create two new profiles. </p><p>I manually backed up my profile data but it's incredibly stupid that A) the profile naming is gibberish and B) I had to do that in the first place.8 </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",njdev

I was direct messaging you all in order to gain some insight on old Thimble projects. I've recently started college, I've been learning Python, and I've already started helping those, with other majors specifically business, who need assistance with creating websites using HTML. Assisting these students would be even more accomplishable if I had these past projects. Unfortunately, I don’t remember being informed about the shutting down of Thimble. Therefore, I wasn’t able to export my past projects to Glitch such as many other users. I’ve already created two Glitch accounts in order to see if it’s still possible to transfer information, but you all seem to have no form of direct customer service contact. Additionally, I've sent sent an email and direct message to Mozilla but received no response. I've been trying to recover my projects for the past two days and a while ago, so it would be greatly appreciated if I can please still recover my past projects! Thanks! </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",tmmoore1210
