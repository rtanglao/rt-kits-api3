I think we had an  browser update. We had another one today and I was hoping the problem was going to be fixed but it was not. </p><p>I have the Print set to old (false) mode. I have used this mode for  years to print all of my documents and webpages. </p><p>This is what is happening. I do my print preview and adjust the scale number accordingly. The print preview shows, I adjust number of pages, preferences etc. then hit print. </p><p>The page that prints is not complete. Is missing the part of the right side and bottom. I have not changed any printer settings. I have also changed it back to the NEW(true) printer mode an the exact thing happens. It happens with both webpages and documents. I first realized what what going on when I printed my bank statement and it was missing the right side and bottom of each page. </p><p>THIS IS NOT PRINTER PROBLEM!!!!! Using the EGDE and Explorer browsers, the pages print perfectly so it has to be a Firefox problem. </p><p>Can you please help me solve this problem. I hate to have to use another browser just to print. I have enclosed pictures of what is happening. </p><p>Amy </p>",windows-7;desktop;printing;firefox-900;bug1720621;firefox-9001;,firefox,other,en-US,1428992;,Amylogamy

This results in lost data when printing as sections/lines of text disappear when default used, fit to page used, scale used, etc.... in preview... then mirrored (not printed) on printer/paper.  Can't trust print layout at this point... causes finnicking with print settings to show data on preview, never sure if it will print this way... need reliable PRINT PREVIEW &amp; PRINT functions... please correct </p>",desktop;fix-problems;printing;firefox-900;bug1720621;firefox-9001;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1428979;,grant.leclerc

That should display a menu with an option to export.  In my case, when I click on the three dots I get only these options:  Preferences, Help, Lockwise for Android, Lockwise for iPhone/iPad.  There is no option to export anywhere on the page.  How can I backup and logins so that I can load them on my new computer?  As above, Firefox version is 72.0.2  and I am using Linux Mint 19.3. </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-720;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1428966;,onenoiam

Tengo la versión de Firefox para Linux ejecutada como portable. Es decir, descargo el fichero original.TAR, lo decomprimo y ejecuto Firefox. Estaba utilizando la versión de Firefox 83 pero ha dejado de funcionar DRM y parece que no actualiza (4.10.1582.2) He leído que hay que actualizar Firefox para que se actualice DRM, así que he borrado la carpeta decomprimida de Firefox y he descomprimido la versión 90.0.1 de Firefox. Me ha sorprendido que se haya conservado la configuración de Firefox. Ahora el problema es que se ha conservado la versión antigua de Google Widevine 4.10.1582.2 y no se actualiza automáticamente. ¿cómo la desinstalo para que se instale una versión actualizada?
