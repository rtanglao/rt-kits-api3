Nas duas primeiras segui as indicações das pessoas que me responderam, como fazia antes de postar em relação à tentar tornar o navegador mais leve, mais rápido...NUNCA ACONTECEU! Os desenvolvedores e programadores podem e devem ter o respeito...mas como que 8gb de RAM não conseguem fazer um navegador ser rápido ? Como eu configurar tudo conforme sou guiado POR AQUI, nunca deixou nada rápido? Cada dia mais difícil abrir um site, a maioria leva o tempo de 10 minutos.

In the last few days, Bing always comes up when I open Firefox, but when I open a second tab, the page is Google as it should be. I think this started when I updated. I have checked the default browser setting in Windows 10, and the default search engine in Firefox, and they are both set properly. This is mostly an annoyance, but I would like to know how to change it back to the way I am used to. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-900;firefox-9001;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",davidlellwanger

I have checked and troubleshoot all the basic steps but still, my Mozilla is Crashing. Basically, it's happening when I am using the <a href=""https://www.exactlly.com/blog/index.php/how-to-choose-the-best-erp-for-sme/"" rel=""nofollow"">ERP for SME</a>. Lastly, I have checked and followed these below-mentioned steps  The cache of the websites on your system is helpful to reduce the loading time. But a mismatch in cache computing can cause cache miss and give rise to many problems. Besides, if the cache is corrupted, Firefox keeps crashing into Windows 10. </p><p>To fix the problem, you can delete the cache. </p><p>Step 1: Click the menu and choose Library &gt; History &gt; Clear Recent History. </p><p>Step 2: Set the range to Everything and choose all the checkboxes. Then, click Clear Now. </p><p>Additionally, you can clear the Firefox cache in File Explorer. </p><p>Step 1: Press Win + R, input C:\Users\User_Name\AppData\Local and click OK. User_Name should be replaced with your name. </p><p>Step 2: Locate the Mozilla folder and go to Firefox &gt; Profiles. </p><p>Step 3: Open the folder ending with .default-release and delete these four folders - cache2, jumpListCache, OfflineCache, startupCache. But nothing happened. So if anyone tell me then it will be highly helpful for me. </p>",desktop;websites;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",owenj7920
