The most bothersome thing i have noticed is that when i type anything into the search area it immediately moves from the search bar in the middle of the page to the address bar at the top of the page where i usually just get URL's. It doesnt serve any purpose i can think of and i have never used the address bar to do normal searches before. Is there any way to change my homepage back to the way it was?
