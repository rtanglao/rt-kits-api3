For some reason, it spontaneously started insisting I pick which tab I go to when I try to unminimize it, in the same format that it usually asks about the window. I would like to know how to make it go back to usual, because this is very stressful and inconvenient compared to how it usually is. I didn't change any settings to make this happen, which is why I'm so confused about it. (I did add bookmark folders to my toolbar, but I fail to see how the two would be related.)
