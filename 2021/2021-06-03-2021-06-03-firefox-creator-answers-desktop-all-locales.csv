Half the fixes don't exist on my version of Firefox.

F12 brings up the developer tools and overrides the &lt;shift&gt; function. The page that does allows me to change settings simply doesn't have the option to use the search bar in the splash page instead of the address bar. No, this is not a feature I installed and I can not remove and reinstall it short of deleting and reinstalling Firefox. Which might not even fix it so I'm a little unwilling to do all that work to achieve nothing and possibly lose functionality in the process.  </p><p>Do I consider this a high priority?

This change occurred around the time that a new revision of Firefox was installed.  Surely Firefox would not have made this change?  I hate the appearance.  It makes reading and browser use much more difficult.  Any suggestions on how to get back the previous theme settings?

For some reason, it spontaneously started insisting I pick which tab I go to when I try to unminimize it, in the same format that it usually asks about the window. I would like to know how to make it go back to usual, because this is very stressful and inconvenient compared to how it usually is. I didn't change any settings to make this happen, which is why I'm so confused about it. (I did add bookmark folders to my toolbar, but I fail to see how the two would be related.)
