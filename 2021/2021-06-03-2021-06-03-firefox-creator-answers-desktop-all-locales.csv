Today I have lost hours trying to get my tabs changed so I my eyes are not strained by the glare and and appearance of the frequently used site tiles.  Glare sets off my migraines. One volunteer ""luckett67"" suggested a temporary fix to someone else that helps so I hope it continues to work.  Why am I having these issues: </p><p>1. Tabs I want open above the address bar sometimes disappear.  </p><p>2. DuckDuckGo jumps from the inquiry rectangle to the https:// line on the top, which is not what I am used to. </p>",desktop;other;windows-81;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,"",candy3066

I can select it, and it is listed as ""Enabled"" but the plain grey screen keeps showing not the default.  Also, is there away to go back to Firefox 88.0.1 and not have it update again? I went to Add-ons &amp; Themes and disable automatic updates but I still got the prompt informing me to restart Firefox to update. Is it just me or is Firefox really getting worse with each update? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,1416801;,lmoore44052

I'd like them back where they were, below the shortcut bar. </p><p>I appreciate help, but also, please provide clear instructions for someone that is NOT a FF dev, don't just say ""update your css"". I'm unable to find userchrome.css it doesn't appear to exist in this version. </p><p>If possible, a simple, non Dev approach would be appreciated, such as Settings &gt; Tabs &gt; tick box ""Tabs under shortcut bar"". </p><p>For anyone working on FF development, this is the sort of thing that a lot of users would like to customize, so this setting should be in Settings and it should not be changed from what users had already set.  </p><p>Thanks for your help. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,1416795;,wharminda
