I did not think that I would lose all my bookmarks, add-on, etc.  Is there a way to revert back to the standard version with all my old data?  Or in looking at the profiles I see a default profile, a default-esr profile, and a default-release profile.  This latter profile seems to have my old data when I open the folders and look around.  However, when I try to open that profile in new window it says something about opening an old version and losing data and creating a new profile.  When I do that, I still get a fresh browser with none of my data. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1384034;1384042;,cosmichippo11

OS = Ubuntu 20.04 Firefox ver. = 84.02 (64 bit) </p><p>I can print the page if I use Firefox's Open Menu (three horizontal bars at top right).  But if I use Google Doc's print option, all I get is the save pdf dialogue. If I use Chrome (and not Firefox), then Google Doc's print option works correctly. </p><p>I have checked that my default printer is correct (in Ubuntu, the command is lpstat -s) I have been to the about:config   page in Firefox.  Although the help on the web says ""older versions of Firefox use print.print_printer""   I found that the information regarding the printer is listed with the""print."" prefix (and they all show when searching ""print."".  However, there is no print_printer setting in the list.    Manually adding a print.print_printer   with string value of my printer does not fix the problem. </p><p>Currently, this is a game changer for me.  At work we use Google Docs and Google Drive.  I have been accessing these things from my Mac computer without issue.  But I am now required to use a Linux machine.
