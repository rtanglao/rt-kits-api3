I'm running Linux (Ubuntu) with Firefox 84. I am able to successfully view and ""Open"" the PDF within the browser, and even edit the text properly. However, upon saving or printing, the text gets rendered with a massive font size nullifying the ability to edit in browser. I've been trying to find some online resources without success, and can't seem to find others reporting a similar case. </p><p>I've disabled all extensions and restarted Firefox, but did not notice any change in behavior. Any tips for debugging? Attached are two pics of the PDF form while editing, and then the rendered PDF after saving. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",dailyherold

I did not think that I would lose all my bookmarks, add-on, etc.  Is there a way to revert back to the standard version with all my old data?  Or in looking at the profiles I see a default profile, a default-esr profile, and a default-release profile.  This latter profile seems to have my old data when I open the folders and look around.  However, when I try to open that profile in new window it says something about opening an old version and losing data and creating a new profile.  When I do that, I still get a fresh browser with none of my data. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1384034;1384042;,cosmichippo11

If I use Chrome (and not Firefox), then Google Doc's print option works correctly. </p><p>I have checked that my default printer is correct (in Ubuntu, the command is lpstat -s) I have been to the about:config   page in Firefox.  Although the help on the web says ""older versions of Firefox use print.print_printer""   I found that the information regarding the printer is listed with the""print."" prefix (and they all show when searching ""print."".  However, there is no print_printer setting in the list.    Manually adding a print.print_printer   with string value of my printer does not fix the problem. </p><p>Currently, this is a game changer for me.  At work we use Google Docs and Google Drive.  I have been accessing these things from my Mac computer without issue.  But I am now required to use a Linux machine.
