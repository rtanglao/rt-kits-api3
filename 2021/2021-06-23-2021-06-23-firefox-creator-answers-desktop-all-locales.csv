This could be a really minor thing for some, but its not for others, its fine that its there, but there should've at least been an option to re-arrange the right click menu and either hide ""new tab"" as Im not even sure why that was implemented as you can simply close on the ""+"" signg at the end of your tab to launch a new tab if you need it, from being the first on the list or something along those lines, but I wanted my ""Reload tab"" be the first option on the list when I mouse right click on any page to perform action with it and thus I decided to revert to prev version Firefox Setup 88.0.1 on my Win 10 pc. </p><p>The problem I faced was when I started installing that older version I got this pop up (see attached image) </p><p>Without any serious thought I clicked on create new profile as it wouldn't let me install the older version otherwise, it either had an exit or create new option and once I created new profile it all looked brand new as if i've never owed a firefox before and I've used it for ages, my fav browser.

TL;DR - I think these RCWN requests may give us a false positive when trying to detect users with bad cache settings... so I'd like to be able to ""ignore"" these RCWN requests in our analysis (I don't want to block or otherwise interfere with these requests). </p><p>On a secondary note, is there any info for the end user on why a given resource was raced? It appears that all of the ""(raced)"" resources I'm seeing on my frequently visited sites are less than 2.5KB (often under 1 KB) - just wondering if the algorithm to detect ""slow"" resources is properly scaled for small resources. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,1423465;,stephen.cunliffe
