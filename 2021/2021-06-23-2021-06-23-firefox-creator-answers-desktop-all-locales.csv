In other words, the library is no longer configurable, it will always take this predefined size. </p><p>Can you please solve this problem? </p><p>To give an example of use, using constantly the favorites, I took the habit to leave the window open on the side of my first screen, in the smallest size possible for my use. And I open firefox on the second screen. Here when the window resumes its predefined size, it overflows half on my second screen, passing over firefox. This size is too big, it takes more than 30% of my first screen.

Now that doesn't work any more. I have to assume it is because of a recent upgrade in Firefox version. I have version 89.0.1 and I also miss the box around each tab, which more distinctly visually identifies the tab. Now the only one with a box around it is the one selected. The loss of surrounding box and the inability of dragging the tabs is probably connected.
