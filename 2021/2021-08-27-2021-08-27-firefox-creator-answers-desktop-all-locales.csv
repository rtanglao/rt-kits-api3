This additional line resizes the window height and causes the tab content to resize too. For example youtube starts resizing video window height and width - and this is very annoying.

If I put an address site it won't try to load it (navigate to it) and if I click an address in my bookmark it won't navigate at all either. The first page I open everything is going good, navigate and so on, but with all others new tabs nothing happens. </p><p>Do I do something wrong? </p><p>Thank you for your help.

VT always begins the upload to the VT website by checking for a hash and this worked prior to Firefox 91.0.x, but has failed for all three updates since the last version before 91.0, so failing for 91.0, 91.0.1 and 91.0.2.  The same thing also happens with Thunderbird 91.0.1 from <a href=""http://Thunderbird.net"" rel=""nofollow"">Thunderbird.net</a>, adding this note in case you can communicate regularly with the TBird team. </p><p>I'm glad to do the downloads, verifications and installs myself, for if anything ever goes wrong, then I have the downloaded installers to just re-install Ffx.  But given that a hash isn't found for the downloaded 91.0.x updates, then I of course wonder what Mozilla is using when performing automatic updates.  After all, what we download surely should be what Mozilla uses as well.  So, I'll definitely stick to my preferred way of doing updates and definitely hope that this missing hash problem gets corrected very soon. </p><p>My current browser is still 90.0.2.  It definitely is a ""bit"" buggy, flaky, often quite annoyingly so, but its hash was found and is still found by VT, so .... </p>",windows-7;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-900;firefox-9002;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",mikecorbeil

So basically, if I have a secondary display playing content in fullscreen, the dock and topbar on the main display disappear. If I click away from Firefox, they reappear, but the topbar reappears on top of the fullscreen media as well. Is this intentional? is there any way to simply have fullscreen content playing on one screen without it affecting what's happening on the other? </p><p>Thank you! </p>",desktop;other;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,"",sam.schafer
