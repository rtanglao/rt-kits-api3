So basically, if I have a secondary display playing content in fullscreen, the dock and topbar on the main display disappear. If I click away from Firefox, they reappear, but the topbar reappears on top of the fullscreen media as well. Is this intentional? is there any way to simply have fullscreen content playing on one screen without it affecting what's happening on the other? </p><p>Thank you! </p>",desktop;other;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,"",sam.schafer
