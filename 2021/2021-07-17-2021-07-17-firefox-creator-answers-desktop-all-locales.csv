I am using Firefox because I use to have control over the browser and it was tracking / spying on everything I do like Chrome. Having Firefox automatically update without my permission I see as no different then a virus and spy ware. I am in the middle doing some work and have to stop and loos everything I am doing because you pushed an unneeded unwanted update. This is not acceptable!

Somehow the UI font for my profile changed from the default and I can't find any way to reset it (see bad_ui_font.png) My tabs, menus and preferences all got set to some fixed-width font, and I can find anywhere in the preferences or about:config, or in my profile folder where I can change it back. If I create a new profile, then the UI font is fine (see good_ui_font.png).  But as soon as I login to my firefox account and sync, then the new profile gets the bad UI font. I don't want to have to recreate my profile from scratch and lose all my settings just to correct the UI font. But this is very annoying. How can I restore the default UI font? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,"",postingsforum
