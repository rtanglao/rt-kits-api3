Am now using Firefox 90.0 for Linux Mint 19.3. Printing to US Letter size (which had been broken with ""na_letter"" being stuffed in to the config at one point, but I switched it back to ""US Letter"" and then it started working again a few months ago - Thank you). </p><p>I see some similar questions listed, so this may be simply adding information to something known: </p><p>Printing with ""Fit to page fit"" works fine, with correct preview. Print with scale set to 100% works fine, with correct preview. </p><p>Printing with scale set to less than 100% (say 70% or 80%) showed in the preview the page rescaled as expected. The actual printed output is also rescaled as expected, but the page size gets cropped at the right and bottom by what appears to be the same percentage, ending up with lost content. The bit that does print seems to match what is shown in the print preview perfectly, suggesting it would have been totally perfect if the print area had not been cropped along with reducing the text and image sizes. </p><p>I tried the ""Print using the system dialogue"" option, and the printed result had the same pathology. </p><p>Same problem also happens when I print to PDF. For this I tried doing the same thing twice, both scaled at 70%, and on comparing found that the preview in firefox had also become cropped a bit but not to the same extent. I did not notice any cropping for the first print to PDF, but now seem unable to get back to what I saw originally in the preview, with correct resizing and no cropping. Playing around some more with printing at 100% vs 70% vs 80% to ""fit to page width"", I seem to be getting changing crops happening each time in the preview for the reduced sizes.  </p><p>But the preview and print are both still correct for 100% scaling and for ""fit to page width"". </p><p>Sample web page I used here was <a href=""https://getpocket.com/explore/item/a-shoulder-workout-for-better-posture?utm_source=pocket-newtab"" rel=""nofollow"">https://getpocket.com/explore/item/a-shoulder-workout-for-better-posture?utm_source=pocket-newtab</a> The screen shot shows the preview after the first reduced print to PDF, with no settings changed.

The only other option I can see is if you uninstall and reinstall firefox and see if the problem still persists."" </p><p>Actually it is a common problem. Actually there are tons of post asking directly and indirectly how to do this and you keep dodging the question. Each time you focus on the person's problem and provide an amateur fix to their local problem rather than providing a real solution like giving us the freedom specify where we want the output directed. The inet itself is full of ppl asking this question on other sites, and there are several possible solutions. Like using the windows sound settings option which is only available if your windows is up to date. Or an addon if you like sharing some info with a stranger and all his customers. And lets not forget the dude that made his own software and uploaded it to github 5 years ago, that solution certainly sounds secure right? All three, possible solutions to the problem, amateur but possible. Just like its also possible that the devs of FF are amateurs for not being able to provide the obvious solution for over 10 years now, which is to let us specify it... Or is it lazyness thats the problem? Why provide something that someone else has already provided before you in a much worse way than you would right? </p><p>Que the ""did you try blablabla?"", no I didnt and I wont. Oh wait that wont come because you cant answer my question with another question since I didnt tell you my problem. Now answer the simple question. I want to know how I can specify to firefox which audio output to use, not hear your... brilliant and not to say the least super safe work around. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",alicewhole

I had also noticed the font looked significantly larger and areas on the toolbar like the area to enter a url and the search box next to it also look off.
