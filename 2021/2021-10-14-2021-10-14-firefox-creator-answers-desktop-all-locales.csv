Safe Start. Nothing helps. </p><p>Understandings: 1) No browser is made to run up to 60 open tabs (possibly even more)!!! 2) I run a ""plethora"" (compared to most users) if add-ons; these also bring the use speed down. 3) Resource used: 2GB (with ""mere 30 pages"" open. </p><p>BUT: DESPITE that: I ALSO understand that, considering my system and Network Type, it should not even be problematic with 200 pages open at once. 2GB over 32GB of RAM? Not the slightest issue (and it often runs at 4GB RAM in use). My CPU never runs half high, even when I have like 60 pages open: Should not be an issue then either.

No extreme strain on the system, no background high-resource issues, sure: one or two add-ons in Firefox but these as well do not strain my system, no AV issues, no Firewall issues (I turned that off, I fail to get the need for one as a house-dog-tree user), yet slow performance. Also, while 30'ish tabs running, 2GB used of RAM? My my, what the hell do they do as Site Admins to have these amounts (and NO, I do not do porn, thank you.  :P  I am well aware of other people having insane issues surfing porn, as I helped many of these folks)? Sure, Deviant is a larger one that is open, being a graphical site, but like Quora, FB, Hot- and G-Mail and similar, these ain't, so to get a 2GB usage is weird, I would assume. I said, assume: yes, I am not specifically an internet know-all, I know of networking as a former NOVEL Netware Supervisor under UNIX (also Spupervisor), but Networking in a company is not the same as internet. </p><p>So, what is going on, why is my browser so slow? Having turned of all and 1 page open it's lightning fast, but now ... So, it is the open tabs, and the add-ons, though when turned off, I see no real difference. Brings it to tabs.

Some will time out, others will just sit there. If I try to go to a new website, I get a connection error that says I have no connection to the internet.

Whenever I hit SHIFT+alpha_letter at the beginning of a line OR simply hit the backspace key, the screen suddenly shifts about a page up, closer to top. This shifts the entry area where I'm typing down and off the screen. Just hitting the backspace to correct a typo causes the screen to scroll on its own. I have to scroll back down to the entry box and if I make another typo, it happens again. It is maddening! </p><p>I've restarted in troubleshoot mode and the same thing happens, so it is not an add-on. This is happening on both my Firefox Linux systems AND on a Windows 10 machine, so I don't think it is specifically OS related either. The screen however does stay put, like it is supposed to, using Chrome or Opera. </p><p>Is this a Firefox problem or is FACEBOOK messing with Firefox? </p>",linux;desktop;websites;firefox-930;,firefox,websites,en-US,1450836;1450860;1450931;,nosoy1
