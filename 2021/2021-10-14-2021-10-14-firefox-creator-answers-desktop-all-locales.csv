The first time it happened I was printing multiple photos and had 16 pages of unusable color printouts.  Although I didn't change the print settings manually at all, this problem recurred multiple times after I cleared the settings and although everything was fine when I left work last night, it was back to HUGE for the first print outs this morning.

1353954,2021-10-13 17:49:40 -0700,2021-10-14 08:28:51 -0700,FACEBOOK - Typing a comment causes the screen to scroll on its own.,"<p>Starting as of today (Oct 13), the FACEBOOK screen suddenly moves when I am typing a comment. Whenever I hit SHIFT+alpha_letter at the beginning of a line OR simply hit the backspace key, the screen suddenly shifts about a page up, closer to top. This shifts the entry area where I'm typing down and off the screen. Just hitting the backspace to correct a typo causes the screen to scroll on its own. I have to scroll back down to the entry box and if I make another typo, it happens again. It is maddening! </p><p>I've restarted in troubleshoot mode and the same thing happens, so it is not an add-on. This is happening on both my Firefox Linux systems AND on a Windows 10 machine, so I don't think it is specifically OS related either. The screen however does stay put, like it is supposed to, using Chrome or Opera. </p><p>Is this a Firefox problem or is FACEBOOK messing with Firefox? </p>",linux;desktop;websites;firefox-930;,firefox,websites,en-US,1450836;1450860;1450931;,nosoy1
