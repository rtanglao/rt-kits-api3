Certificates, keys, and SecretKeyEntry. I would like to know the content of a SecretKeyEntry with the alias ""StoreXKey"". Firstly, is extracting the plaintext of a SecretKeyEntry possible? I seem to think so because of links: <a href=""https://technosock.blogspot.com/2007/12/token-knowledge.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://technosock.blogspot.com/2007/12/token-knowledge.html</a> and <a href=""https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/KeyStore.SecretKeyEntry.html#getSecretKey"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/security/KeyStore.SecretKeyEntry.html#getSecretKey</a> </p><p>First link gives a way to do it ( which doesn't work for me ) the second link gives us a few methods, namely .getEncoded() which can supposedly be called on a SecretKeyEntry to get the byte array information. </p><p>Here is my code thus far, all results hit a null pointer exception when using the getEncoded message. I am sure the SecretKeyEntry exists in the NSSDB. </p><p>String configFile = ""config.cfg""; Provider provider = Security.getProvider(""SunPKCS11""); // I am confused on how to incorporate the config file as well. /* provider = provider.configure(configFile); // Does not work */ Security.addProvider(provider); </p><p>String defaultPIN = ""--.--.--.--.----.-...-.--""; try{ </p><pre>  KeyStore ks = KeyStore.getInstance(""PKCS11"");   ks.load(null, defaultPIN.toCharArray());   KeyStore.SecretKeyEntry skEntry = (KeyStore.SecretKeyEntry) ks.getEntry(""StoreXKey"",null); // Do I need a password protector here?   System.out.println(new String(skEntry.getSecretKey().getEncoded())); &lt;-- Error is thrown here.  </pre> <p>}catch (Exception e){ </p><pre>  e.printStackTrace(); </pre> <p>} Any help / advice or links are appreciated. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1450917;,az19agent

For some reason my print settings change to HUGE so that when I print, unbeknownst to me (because the preview looks fine), only maybe 1/4 of the page prints on one page. Yesterday I had to clear the print settings (help, more troubleshooting, print, clear saved settings) several times. The first time it happened I was printing multiple photos and had 16 pages of unusable color printouts.  Although I didn't change the print settings manually at all, this problem recurred multiple times after I cleared the settings and although everything was fine when I left work last night, it was back to HUGE for the first print outs this morning. It is a big waste of paper and ink and is very frustrating. I'd like to know what is causing it and if there is a permanent way to fix it. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",joyce26

Whenever I hit SHIFT+alpha_letter at the beginning of a line OR simply hit the backspace key, the screen suddenly shifts about a page up, closer to top. This shifts the entry area where I'm typing down and off the screen. Just hitting the backspace to correct a typo causes the screen to scroll on its own. I have to scroll back down to the entry box and if I make another typo, it happens again. It is maddening! </p><p>I've restarted in troubleshoot mode and the same thing happens, so it is not an add-on. This is happening on both my Firefox Linux systems AND on a Windows 10 machine, so I don't think it is specifically OS related either. The screen however does stay put, like it is supposed to, using Chrome or Opera. </p><p>Is this a Firefox problem or is FACEBOOK messing with Firefox? </p>",linux;desktop;websites;firefox-930;,firefox,websites,en-US,1450836;1450860;,nosoy1
