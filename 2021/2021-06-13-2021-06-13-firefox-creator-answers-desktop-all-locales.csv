I do not particularly mind privacy wise since I'll log into them with the same account anyways, but as far as I understood, there should be absolutely no way this should happen. Cookies should be isolated by domain, I have uBlock Origin installed which prevents cookie sharing between domains by setting some CNAME records in subdomains (Uncloak canonical names), and afaik Firefox does not automatically read the google account cookies and share them around - if it did, that would be even more serious. So what is happening here and how can I change that? This seems to be a serious issue that I'm honestly not comfortable with out of principle since I chose the strictest settings. </p>",linux;desktop;cookies;firefox-890;,firefox,cookies,en-US,1421162;1421168;,lev.gaeher

If now I browsed the same pages that made the mess, nothing would probably happen. </p><p>I thought it had to do with the swap, but the system hanged both when the swap space was enabled and when it was disabled. </p><p>I saved a copy of the profile (and the cache) after the last crash, if they could be useful. The last time I had actually to force the shutdown of the computer, because there was no way to regain control over it. </p><p>Any ideas? </p><p>Thank you for your answers! </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",brancalessio
