I do not particularly mind privacy wise since I'll log into them with the same account anyways, but as far as I understood, there should be absolutely no way this should happen. Cookies should be isolated by domain, I have uBlock Origin installed which prevents cookie sharing between domains by setting some CNAME records in subdomains (Uncloak canonical names), and afaik Firefox does not automatically read the google account cookies and share them around - if it did, that would be even more serious. So what is happening here and how can I change that? This seems to be a serious issue that I'm honestly not comfortable with out of principle since I chose the strictest settings. </p>",linux;desktop;cookies;firefox-890;,firefox,cookies,en-US,1421162;1421168;,lev.gaeher
