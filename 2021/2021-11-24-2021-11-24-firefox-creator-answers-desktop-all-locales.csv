Where is this color-difference stored? I have thousands of WikiSpecies files I have accessed, and they all show the violet ""accessed"" color if I ever have opened the file to read its contents. The problem is that when Ubuntu has to be reinstalled, I can add references to all my files, but the color-changes seem to be lost.   This is a serious issue, because I currently have over 50,000 files referenced  (and saved in my directory file:///home/jwill/Documents/WikiSpecies/Animalia_Plantae_8) and am still adding to them! </p><p>I think the storage location must be somewhere in one or more of the following files ('_' replaced '/'): </p><pre>   _home_jwill_.mozilla    _home_jwill_.cache_mozilla_firefox     _home_jwill_.cache_MM_firefox    _usr_lib_firefox </pre> <p>Can you please tell me where the list of accessed files is stored?
