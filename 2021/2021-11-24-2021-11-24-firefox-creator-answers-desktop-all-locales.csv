I notice the buffering is not related to any bandwidth related issue. -Firefox reacts slower (or with a small delay) while moving between tabs, clicking on links, etc. This usually happens only after a few hours after launching and browsing with Firefox. </p><p>Most happen after a while since I launch Firefox. And by a while I mean maybe 2-3 hours, and I don't have a ton of tabs open. It becomes slower much, much faster than it used to in the past. </p><p>Now, sometimes it can take Firefox up to 30 seconds to close completely, before I can launch it again. </p><p>I had the same Extensions installed before these issues started happening. </p><p>I tried uninstalling Firefox completely, then manually deleting the remaining profile folder, and do a fresh install of the latest Firefox version. </p><p>I checked the Windows Task Manager, and it shows (14) processes under Firefox. Is this normal? I tried unticking the ""Use recommended performance settings"" and restarting Firefox, but it still reached (14) processes after a couple of minutes. </p><p><br> I am not sure if it is related to Firefox itself. My computer is 5 years old but functioning  properly... </p><p>I did not check if similar issues happen on a different browser. I am just so used to Firefox. </p><p>I had a few weird bug in Windows 10, but those existed for a good while now, and are not similar to the ones I experience while browsing with Firefox. I didn't notice anything similar while watching video files in a Media Player. </p><p>I am not sure if it can be hardware related. All seem to be working properly... </p><p><br> I want to figure out what is causing this.

Where is this color-difference stored? I have thousands of WikiSpecies files I have accessed, and they all show the violet ""accessed"" color if I ever have opened the file to read its contents. The problem is that when Ubuntu has to be reinstalled, I can add references to all my files, but the color-changes seem to be lost.   This is a serious issue, because I currently have over 50,000 files referenced  (and saved in my directory file:///home/jwill/Documents/WikiSpecies/Animalia_Plantae_8) and am still adding to them! </p><p>I think the storage location must be somewhere in one or more of the following files ('_' replaced '/'): </p><pre>   _home_jwill_.mozilla    _home_jwill_.cache_mozilla_firefox     _home_jwill_.cache_MM_firefox    _usr_lib_firefox </pre> <p>Can you please tell me where the list of accessed files is stored?   Whenever I enter a referenced directory, to access it, the color changes; so, Firefox must be able to store a reference to each new referenced directory name. </p>",linux;desktop;other;escalate;needsinfo;ubuntu;firefox-940;,firefox,other,en-US,1461597;1461608;1461612;1461635;1461640;1461645;,jwill1000000
