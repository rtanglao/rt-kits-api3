Recently (most recent few weeks) FF has started issuing popup notices in the lower right hand portion of the browser screen.  These only occur when FF is loaded and active.  How can I tell which, if any, extensions might be responsible so I can resolve and stop these annoying messages?  I've tried trying to determine how and why myself without success.  Any suggestions - thank you. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-900;firefox-9002;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",bobmct
