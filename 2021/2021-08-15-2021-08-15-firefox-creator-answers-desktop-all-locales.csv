Egxample, a search of Y would bring up <a href=""http://YouTube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">YouTube.com</a> as my first result on the drop-down menu. Recently I noticed that when I now clear my browsing history it also removes the memory of my personalized address bar autocomplete url searches and reverts to a standardized dropdown menu not aligned with my personalized searches.

About:config method doesn't work,"<p>Does anyone have a solution to this now (2021) that will only take away the ""Recent"" list when you right click Firefox on the taskbar. Changing <strong>browser.taskbar.lists.recent.enabled = false</strong> doesn't do anything. I even tried making all taskbar.* = false and all that did was take away the ""task"" section but still left the @$!# ""Recent"" section. Using File Explorer I even deleted everything from the ""Recent files"" section and this doesn't do any good.

After downloading a bunch of files and some of them were failed, I hit the clear download button and it cleared all of my download name files even those failed download files ''''<em><strong>WITHOUT A WARNING''''</strong></em>. In older versions of Firefox, in the same situation, it just left those failed download files so I can easily manage what I were missing. I can't find the name of those file anymore because I set the browser in private mode, don't remember the history and I can't get back to the sources where the all download has been taken. I'm running on Windows 10 64 bit, everything runs ok, except this. I can't also find anywhre mentions this change in the new version of Firefox 91 and no way of get it back on the Internet. I'm a 15 years Firefox user, but I've never seen Firefox developers ""Stupid and careless"" like they are now. I don't want to be impolite but I can't stand it anymore. The Firefox developers, Please get back the lovely old Firefox browser for me! </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",pemaxe8783
