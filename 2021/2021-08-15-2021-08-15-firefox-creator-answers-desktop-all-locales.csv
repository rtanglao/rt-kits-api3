They're just empty squares regardless of whether something is checked off or not. I've attached a screenshot below. </p><p>Issue 2: I really, really hate the new proton tabs. I had them disabled by disabling proton, but I guess I forgot to disable auto-updates, because I just opened Firefox to find that they're back, much to my displeasure. It's difficult for me to distinguish tabs from each other at a glance now as they are all the same color with no borders *and* having 'autoplay disabled' and 'playing' and stuff like that in TINY all caps font below the tab label is NOT USEFUL. It is distracting to the eye, and I have to squint and lean closer to be able to read what the heck it's even saying. This is shitty for nearsighted people like me. Moreover, at a glance it is IMPOSSIBLE now to tell which tab sound is coming from. This is a huge step backwards in functionality and accessibility. </p><p>I wasn't using mozilla for aesthetics - I was using it because it functioned and was more stable / less of a memory hog in my experience than chrome, and I appreciated the ease and convenience of syncing across different computers as well as the built in password management. However, I question whether I can continue to use this browser if you're going to prioritize aesthetics over functionality and user preference. </p><p>Seriously - that the tabs DO NOT CONNECT to the page is itself distracting and weird, *but also* that the rest of the tabs blend together and have extra tiny unreadable text rather than the infinitely more distinguishable audio symbol that indicated which tabs had sound playing before is so terrible. </p><p>So.... tl;dr: HOW DO I GET OLD TABS BACK? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,customize,en-US,1435165;1435167;,marshmallowdragon

These are the only sites that seem to be affected. I don't get any error message, they just won't load.  It happens several times per hour and lasts for several minutes and then sometimes they begin loading normally for a while without any intervention on my part.  It sometimes affects Google only, sometimes Gmail only, and sometimes both at the same time.  I have scoured the support forums and have tried everything I could find or think of, including: clear cache/site data, ""forget about this site"" in history, add exceptions to cookies and site data, change enhanced tracking settings, change ""Do not track"" settings, change connection settings to ""No proxy"", disable all extensions and themes (including LastPass, uBlock Origin, and Yet Another Smooth Scrolling WE), refresh Firefox, uninstall and reinstall, and create a new profile.  The problem has persisted despite all of this!  If I close Firefox and reopen it will correct the problem, and the sites will load normally for a while until it strikes again.  Also, if I open a private window the sites will load, if I then close the private window and return to the regular browser tab, that will also allow the sites to load normally for a few minutes before the problem strikes again.  Please help!  I have happily used Firefox as my primary browser for 15+ years, but I am at my wits end and will have to find a new primary browser if I can't find a solution to this problem. </p>",windows-7;desktop;websites;firefox-910;,firefox,websites,en-US,1435166;,jay.ryan.salmon

Changing <strong>browser.taskbar.lists.recent.enabled = false</strong> doesn't do anything.

In older versions of Firefox, in the same situation, it just left those failed download files so I can easily manage what I were missing. I can't find the name of those file anymore because I set the browser in private mode, don't remember the history and I can't get back to the sources where the all download has been taken. I'm running on Windows 10 64 bit, everything runs ok, except this. I can't also find anywhre mentions this change in the new version of Firefox 91 and no way of get it back on the Internet. I'm a 15 years Firefox user, but I've never seen Firefox developers ""Stupid and careless"" like they are now. I don't want to be impolite but I can't stand it anymore.
