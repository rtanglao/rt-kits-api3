The share menu has a nice option to ""Send To Device"" to send a specific tab to another device. I do that, get a confirmation toast that the Tab has been sent... but where can I find it on the target device ? It doesn't open right away (which is what I'd prefer), and I can't find it anywhere else ? </p><p>I tried from Android to Android, from Windows to Android, from Android to Windows... Sending a tab is nice, actually finding it on the target device would be nicer ^^ </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,sync,en-US,1430757;1430759;1430762;1430767;,oonlan

Every time I hit the download button, firefox quickly opens up a new tab but then it instantly closes. And the file doesn't appear on my desktop, which is my saved files location. When I attempt this on google chrome, it works just fine. Anyone know what could be causing this?

So, as I always make a recovery point before updating, I've rolled back my computer to 88 and will be staying there, thank you. </p><p>Now I would like a way to stop the annoying update notice.  Please don't tell me to make files and scripts and mess with the registry...I mean, for goodness sakes, where's the button or the ""opt out"" thingy? </p><p>I will not be updating again until I read that I can keep the look I had without having to 'add-on' or try themes or heaven forbid make my own. </p><p>If security changes were Firefox's reasons for updating fair enough...but how did the look of a piece of software become a security issue?
