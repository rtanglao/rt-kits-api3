This totals in 106219 nodes on that page. Previous versions of FireFox did not had issues with this, other browsers (Opera, Chrome, Edge) have also no issues and render the page in about 2 - 3 seconds. Not so Version 90.0.2 (32 bit). It now takes 4 minutes to render this page completely. Trying to debug this is impossible cause during rendering the browser is not responsive at all. Is this a bug that sneaked in or what can we do? This happens on fresh installs of Windows 10 with fresh installs of FireFox, that said it's not something that could be reset or cleaned etc. Any Ideas as to why FireFox struggles now with above mentioned number of nodes as oposed to earlier versions? </p><p>BR Markus </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",markus08
