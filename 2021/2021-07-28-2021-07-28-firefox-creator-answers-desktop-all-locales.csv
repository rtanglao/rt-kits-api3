If you want a detailed reason from me then let's just say I have old eyes and I agree with all the complaints I've read so far.  So, as I always make a recovery point before updating, I've rolled back my computer to 88 and will be staying there, thank you. </p><p>Now I would like a way to stop the annoying update notice.  Please don't tell me to make files and scripts and mess with the registry...I mean, for goodness sakes, where's the button or the ""opt out"" thingy? </p><p>I will not be updating again until I read that I can keep the look I had without having to 'add-on' or try themes or heaven forbid make my own. </p><p>If security changes were Firefox's reasons for updating fair enough...but how did the look of a piece of software become a security issue?  If this is 'new fresh' I don't want it, I'll just stay old and stale thanks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,"",dittymargoo
