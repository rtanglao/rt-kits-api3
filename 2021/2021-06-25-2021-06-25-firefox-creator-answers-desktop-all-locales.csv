After the update I haven't used it much but when I tried to test my camera in Google Meet 3 days before a meeting it keeps saying Camera is Starting. I don't want to use other browsers because it runs slow on my computer, is there any fix to this? Need help ASAP. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;firefox-8902;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",magerhux

All of a sudden, YouTube does not function properly in Firefox.  Videos will start, and within about two minutes, the video freezes and the spinning circle comes up.  YouTube functions fine in Microsoft Edge.  I have tried to reset everything, but it doesn't make a difference--YouTube isn't functioning as it should on this computer.  I had a Microsoft Windows update on this computer in the last few days, but I don't think it is that because it was working after those downloaded.  What should I do? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,"",rvdvance

Recently clicking on hyperlinks didn't lead to a new window opening, but they do when i make chrome/edge the default browser. Also, when i right click the firefox icon in my taskbar, and click on open new window, a new window doesn't open. i need to drag a tab off screen to create new windows. this is frustrating, and i might need to stop using firefox until it's fixed. please let me know if this is something i can fix on my end, but it seems like a software issue to me </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1423820;,amthomas215
