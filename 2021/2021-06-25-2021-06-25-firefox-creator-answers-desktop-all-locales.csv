I usually keep them each open in a tab all the time, because I don't like having to open and log back into things constantly.  </p><p>I'm running a Mac. The problem started maybe a few months ago. I've tried resetting the browser cookies, downgrading my security settings to moderate, and whitelisting gmail. I do run uBlock, AdGuard, and Privacy Badger, but I also have those on Chrome, and when I did a comparison test I didn't have the same issue there. I can be in the middle of clicking on an email and Firefox will boot me out.  </p><p>This problem is mostly specific to Google. I'm able to stay logged in to other sites (yahoo mail, ravelry, etc.) over periods of weeks or even months. Some other accounts might be affected, but they're ones that usually make me log in more frequently, and that I use less often. </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-890;firefox-8902;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",knicwhit

I have used it with great success until 89.0 then everything went sour. So I tried to go back to 88 but it would not let me use my previous PROFILE. All it allowed was to CREATE A NEW ONE. It gives you only one option, ""EXIT or CREATE A NEW ONE"". EXIT 'stops' future installation, CREATE A NEW ONE and you lose EVERYTHING. I don't remember these issues in the 'old days' of reverting back if one had problems with a new version. I found my old profiles but I do not know to USE my last one.  I was surviving with rel 88 but it crashed 3-5 times a day and today, finally went hard down and would not run. It then gave me 89.0. Terrible. Then here comes 89.02 AND IT CRASHES WORSE THAN 89.0.   Right now my Firefox is worthless so I am now using EDGE which I 'REALLY' dislike but it WORKS unlike Firefox.  What I WANT to do is go to an older version until they get their act together and USE one my OLD PROFILES to save everything. </p><p>DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW TO USE A PREVIOUS VERSION, THEN SELECT A PROFILE TO ""GO BACK""? </p>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,1423831;,jagman55

All of a sudden, YouTube does not function properly in Firefox.  Videos will start, and within about two minutes, the video freezes and the spinning circle comes up.  YouTube functions fine in Microsoft Edge.  I have tried to reset everything, but it doesn't make a difference--YouTube isn't functioning as it should on this computer.  I had a Microsoft Windows update on this computer in the last few days, but I don't think it is that because it was working after those downloaded.
