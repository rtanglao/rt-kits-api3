Their method involves a pop-up window in which to make the payment.  I JUST upgraded Firefox today, and before, I used to at least get the popup window, even if it didn't work; now, I don't even get the window.  I get a brief ""working"" message on the bar across the bottom of the browser, then nothing.  Same in an incognito (private) window.  Don't know what's going on; I haven't changed anything, and this process used to be trouble free, but somewhere along the line, a few upgrades back, it stopped working.  Only thing that's changed might be from Windows updates; don't have much control over that.  Can't even turn off updates for more than a period of time.  Really, if I have to take extraordinary measures to make Firefox work (shut down and re-start in 'safe mode' or something) that I used to be able to do without any trouble at all, maybe it'd be a better idea to just use Chrome (or even Edge) to make purchases with.  THEY have no trouble doing so, only Firefox, so if Windows IS changing things, why isn't it affecting them as well?  Sorry if this is coming across as just tearing down Firefox; it's really not.  I just don't understand why something that worked forever suddenly doesn't anymore, and only in this browser.  I'd LOVE to get this fixed!
