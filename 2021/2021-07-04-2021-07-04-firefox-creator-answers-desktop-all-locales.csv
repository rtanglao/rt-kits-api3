My idea was to create a few containers and fill with their specific tabs, and enable their syncing, so that I could access these task-specific ""tab areas"" aka tab containers across different devices, without affecting the overall ""tab landscapes"". Like or similar to saying ""open all in new window"" in a bookmark folder. </p><p>The container I created is shown on the synced devices, but the tabs are not. e.g. on the desktop PC I have 20 tabs in the container ""Marie"", on the laptop the container ""Marie"" is visible, but no tabs visible/listed/.. </p><p>I enabled the syncing of Open tabs, Add-Ons, and Logins and passwords in the Settings for Sync, and I enabled Bookmark Menus and Firefox Account Sync for the multiple account container addon. </p><p>In case I entirely misunderstood the functioning of this, I'd much appreciate any hints on reaching my intended use case as well. =) </p><p>All the best Silvana </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",Silvana.Leiss

IE, if I am working out of folder X and save a .JPG image into that folder then go to save a .PNG image, it will open folder Y that I last saved a .PNG image into instead of opening the last folder I saved a file into. I end up forgetting about it and saving files into the wrong folder. Firefox did not used to do this. My question is whether or not there is a way to have Firefox save all files I am saving into the folder I saved the file before it into? Not into folders based on which folder I last saved that file extension into. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ElectronicTechno1

My questions are simple:  Is there a plan to get someone to fix the open H264 plugin on Github?  Is that possible, since it was a CISCO product?  (For example, from my very limited exposure to software made by someone else, getting to decrypt, decompile and understand a piece of software is difficult, if the person who made it does not want you to make any changes to it.) Is that's what happening here?     </p><p>Or, Is there a Video plugin planned, that will simply work better than the OPENH264? </p><p>Next, if something does not work within a given browser, can someone smart imagine a work-around, whereby the user could ""right click"" on the video on screen, which would open a menu, providing options such as ""Play this Video in  this browser, using a)  a separate Window, b) using such and such Mediaplayers (list)"" , and/or  ""Play this video outside of this browser using  ....  list of options including another browser, (list) and/or another video/mediaplayer.   </p><p>Clearly, the TYPE of video, and the most compatible Mediaplayer is not provided to the casual user.  And yet, all videos or media items have their own file-extension, such as *.wav, *.gif, *.whatever so that the logic of the app ought to be able to determine what type of file it is, and what mediaplayer to use for it.   And if it does not work on Firefox, for lack of resources, knowledge, ability, or due to patents, etc, then what prevents Firefox from being flexible and invoke Chrome, Opera, Edge and play the desired video in a window of that particular browser.  As a temporary measure, this makes sense to me.  </p><p>I thought that software was called ""soft"", because it was intended to be pliable, changeable, flexible. Instead we are running  into carved in stone, secretive, not knowable software behavior, that must put up with an iron-clad obstacle course of standards, ensuring that things don't work and cannot be changed.  I do NOT KNOW the hidden mysterious environment variables which may need adjustment to make something work.  I am not any kind of computer genius.  But I can think outside of the box, on occasion. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",voodooquantum

You have to click either ""Update"" or Dismiss"" to get it to go away. There is no ""x"" at the upper right on the popup screen, which would allow you to close the screen without clicking either ""Update"" or ""Dismiss"".
