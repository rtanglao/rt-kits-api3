It keeps coming back it seems every time I open Firefox. I clicked ""Update"" a few times, but Firefox never got updated, as far as I can tell. I tried turning off NordVPN but that does not allow an update to occur. Now I just click ""Dismiss"" if I need to see what's behind the popup. You have to click either ""Update"" or Dismiss"" to get it to go away. There is no ""x"" at the upper right on the popup screen, which would allow you to close the screen without clicking either ""Update"" or ""Dismiss"". I worry that by clicking on either I am downloading some malware. William F Briel </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",wfpb94
