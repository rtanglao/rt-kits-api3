IE, if I am working out of folder X and save a .JPG image into that folder then go to save a .PNG image, it will open folder Y that I last saved a .PNG image into instead of opening the last folder I saved a file into. I end up forgetting about it and saving files into the wrong folder. Firefox did not used to do this. My question is whether or not there is a way to have Firefox save all files I am saving into the folder I saved the file before it into? Not into folders based on which folder I last saved that file extension into. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ElectronicTechno1

My questions are simple:  Is there a plan to get someone to fix the open H264 plugin on Github?  Is that possible, since it was a CISCO product?  (For example, from my very limited exposure to software made by someone else, getting to decrypt, decompile and understand a piece of software is difficult, if the person who made it does not want you to make any changes to it.) Is that's what happening here?     </p><p>Or, Is there a Video plugin planned, that will simply work better than the OPENH264? </p><p>Next, if something does not work within a given browser, can someone smart imagine a work-around, whereby the user could ""right click"" on the video on screen, which would open a menu, providing options such as ""Play this Video in  this browser, using a)  a separate Window, b) using such and such Mediaplayers (list)"" , and/or  ""Play this video outside of this browser using  ....  list of options including another browser, (list) and/or another video/mediaplayer.   </p><p>Clearly, the TYPE of video, and the most compatible Mediaplayer is not provided to the casual user.  And yet, all videos or media items have their own file-extension, such as *.wav, *.gif, *.whatever so that the logic of the app ought to be able to determine what type of file it is, and what mediaplayer to use for it.   And if it does not work on Firefox, for lack of resources, knowledge, ability, or due to patents, etc, then what prevents Firefox from being flexible and invoke Chrome, Opera, Edge and play the desired video in a window of that particular browser.  As a temporary measure, this makes sense to me.  </p><p>I thought that software was called ""soft"", because it was intended to be pliable, changeable, flexible. Instead we are running  into carved in stone, secretive, not knowable software behavior, that must put up with an iron-clad obstacle course of standards, ensuring that things don't work and cannot be changed.  I do NOT KNOW the hidden mysterious environment variables which may need adjustment to make something work.  I am not any kind of computer genius.  But I can think outside of the box, on occasion. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",voodooquantum

It keeps coming back it seems every time I open Firefox. I clicked ""Update"" a few times, but Firefox never got updated, as far as I can tell. I tried turning off NordVPN but that does not allow an update to occur. Now I just click ""Dismiss"" if I need to see what's behind the popup. You have to click either ""Update"" or Dismiss"" to get it to go away. There is no ""x"" at the upper right on the popup screen, which would allow you to close the screen without clicking either ""Update"" or ""Dismiss"". I worry that by clicking on either I am downloading some malware. William F Briel </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",wfpb94
