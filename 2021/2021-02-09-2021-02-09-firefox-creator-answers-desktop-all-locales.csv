Why? The files are already saved on the local disk... </p><p>Is there a configuration setting I can change to make Firefox display these files? </p><p>Ideally, ANY local file with a double extension of *1.*2.gz should be decompressed in the browser. Where *1 would be a name and *2 would be a file type that the browser can normally display (like HTML) or load (like Javascript/CSS,etc.). </p><p>If a user really does want to download a local file of this type, there could be a right click option like ""Save Link As Uncompressed"" or an option in Firefox config to switch this behaviour off. </p><p>Needing to run a webserver on the PC just so the browser can display compressed html is a bit ridiculous... </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-850;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",dazdude
