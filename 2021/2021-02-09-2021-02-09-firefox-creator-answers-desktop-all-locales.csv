All was working then suddenly one day the Firefox wont open any pages, it just stays blank. No google, no internal or external website. Tried the Private mode of Firefox and still the same. Cant even open Developer Tools. Cannot go to clear the cache or anything. Basically the Browser just sits blank. Cant click on reload button as its greyed out. Try to go and select 'Options' menu and nothing happens. Try about:config and does not work.  </p><p>I saw some forums on Firefox forums itself suggesting possible possible malware, so I removed firefox, removed the folders from my user's AppData folder, run the symantec endpoint protection to be sure and no issues were found. Then reboot Windows and re-installed Firefox last week and it started to work. Today, I have hit the same problem again. So not sure whats going on. Anyone has faced something similar? Other browsers like Chrome and Edge are working okay. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jbhathena
