The file was opening just fine a week ago.  It opens just fine when I download / open it with Excel desktop.  It opens just fine when I use Chrome.  There was one FFox update between the last good open and now and I suspect that is what is causing it, but I don't want to roll back for security reasons.  Is anyone else having this issue? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jazklavier

This started a couple months ago and I haven't made any changes other than FF updates and MS updates.  To fix this I just run CCleaner and start FF back up, then all runs fine for a day or so.    Sometimes I go into Tools, Settings, Privacy &amp; Security, Cookies and Site Data and clear Cache (not cookies).  It is normal to see cache at around 511 MB of cache.  It starts out fresh at 55.1 MB.  I start FF with 8 tabs open.   FF is the only application that I start.  I didn't use to have this problem, not sure when exactly started.    I do have Performance at ""Use recommended performance settings"".  No ""hardware acceleration"" is checked.   Now I do recall some time ago I did not check Use ""recommended performance settings"" and I checked the number of threads or something like that would be used, I forget exact terminology, but that option seems to have gone away with one of the FF updates </p><p>Running FF 94.0.2 (Yes I know 95 is out) Dell Optiplex  8GB  Intel Core i5 Windows 10 Pro 21H2  19044.1387 </p><p>No new addon using Flagfox, Tab Reloader, NoScripts, Undo Close Tab, Webroot Threat Shield and Facebook Container.    These have been used for years with no issues.  </p><p>FF Task manager shows most things low, the highest memory usage Gmail at 27MB.  </p><p>Right now when using Microsoft Task Manager  (I just started FF) I find it using 15 processors for 752MB.   Sometimes I have seen up to 40 FF processors.   Most are not using any CPU or other resources.   Microsoft Task Manager shows 6% CPU,  47% Memory,  2% Disk, 0% Network,  5%GPU.  Not at all busy, but running okay now, will take awhile to start the running slow.   </p><p>Now after all that, is there anything I should be checking or changing?    Just went up to 23 FF processors running via viewing MS Task Manager.  Still no load on resources. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",diverjer
