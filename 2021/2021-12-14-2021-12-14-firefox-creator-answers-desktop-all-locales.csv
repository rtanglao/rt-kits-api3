The ""helpful"" links in the answers were equally unhelpful, see above paragraph. The answer is erroneous, condescending and frustrating.  </p><p>Years ago I was loathe to switch from Netscape but eventually moved to Firefox, I had zero intentions of ever signing up for a firefox account but maybe it's the bitter argument that I've just had with an ex but the answers so infuriated me I had to post this response. </p><p>If you're going to treat everyone like an idiot, at least answer the question. I couldn't care less if I get flamed, too old to care. I never understood the unwritten but mostly written rule of necroposting, but if you're going to archive a post remove it from search engine results too and yes, I understand search engines aren't obligated to follow such rules.  </p><p>But I also know why noone does this, search engine results bring visitors. If you're going to give me the moral high ground set the rules in whatever robots.txt meta tags or http headers people are using nowadays to block indexing archived posts and have the archived results searchable via internal search but we all know very few sites are going to do it. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1466605;,rob30001
