I like the ""Fall Puppy"" theme, but it turned the background black. Changing the background color to white does not correct the problem. (tools=&gt;settings=&gt;General=&gt;fonts&amp;colors=&gt;colors) I don't want to disable the theme. In the past I think I could edit the preference file to override the theme background color.  I there away to edit the ""Fall Puppy"" background default? </p><pre>Guidance Please. </pre>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-910;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",wildrice

Until now, it automatically filled in passwords, but now it constantly reports ""unlock firefox"".  It happened once, but it was one day, so everything was fine again.  Now it constantly reports for each application. </p><pre>Thanks in advance! </pre> <p><strong>Ikiss@sbb.rs</strong> Postovani Zasto mi kod popunjavanja pasworda recimo na aplikaciji Twitera javlja ""otkljucaj firefox""? Do sada je sam automatski popunjavao pasworde ali sad javlja stalno ""otkljucaj firefox"". Jednom se to desilo ali je to bio jedan dan, pa je ponovo bilo sve u redu. Sada stalno to javlja za svaku aplikaciju.  Unapred hvala Ikiss@sbb.rs </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,sr,"",ikiss
