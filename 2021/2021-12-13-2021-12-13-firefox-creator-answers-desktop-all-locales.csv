I used it this morning (11/12/21) without issue but when I tried it around 6PM CST US I got PR_CONNECT_RESET_ERROR on everything I tried to load. There was no updates that I am aware of and I tried all of the solutions provided on sites I visited up to and including disabling anti-virus with no success. For now I've uninstalled the product until a solution has been found. Thank you to anyone who may be able to assist in this problem.

What used to happen was the Firefox Document icon would appear next to the shortcut, no matter the shortcut URL... but now, the website's favicon shows up. I hate this :'( It causes there to be several icons in my Windows Explorer which is just ugly (in my opinion) and makes it difficult for me to differentiate the folder types, at least for a few seconds. Sooo... my question is - how do you change the default icon for ALL Internet Shortcuts so that it never shows the website's favicon and only the Firefox Doc icon? </p><p>I have researched a solution for an hour now and nothing has worked... I have made sure FF is my default browser, changed the registry values within Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT to the location of the new icon, and even changed the values for every other browser I have downloaded. What is strange is that the registry changes worked for Chrome/Edge... but not Firefox, my main browser (98% of the time). :'( Can anyone help me? Also, I uploaded a pic to show what the Favicons are - just quick shortcuts I made, all through drag-n-drop. Left column is from Firefox, middle is from Edge, and right column is from Chrome. </p><p>To be specific, here are the registry locations I have changed so far: </p><p>Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\FirefoxHTML-308046B0AF4A39CB\DefaultIcon Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\FirefoxURL-308046B0AF4A39CB\DefaultIcon Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ChromeHTML\DefaultIcon Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\MSEdgeHTM\DefaultIcon Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\InternetShortcut\DefaultIcon </p><p>And I changed them all (temporarily - for testing) to ""C:\Windows\System32\url.dll"",0 which is just the old IE icon (white page with IE logo in bottom-left) </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,other,en-US,1466147;,TrustKibou

I did as you suggested as well as removed Cloudflare from the Windows registry using the registry editor. This just began since the latest Firefox update last week. I have 2 lap tops, and on both have 3 browsers. This occurs on either version of windows only when logged in as non administrator.      I hope you will report this to Mozilla to fix this discrepancy as quad9 is also a great DNS resolution solution and is faster from my location. I have been using quad9 for the last 2 years and never had this issue until latest Firefox release! Edge and Brave browsers are not any issue. Firefox is able to bypass both my router and windows pro settings whenever non admin login is used! I set to use DoH ""Non Proxy"" and it did not work either, nor removing Cloudflare from registry. I set my my router and Windows both to use QUAD9. How Firefox can bypass my configs (ip4 and ip6) when logged in as a standard user is beyond my level of expertise. Someone please report this bug. Much THANKS Happy Holidays to all. Firefox was always my preferred browser until last week. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",storch11
