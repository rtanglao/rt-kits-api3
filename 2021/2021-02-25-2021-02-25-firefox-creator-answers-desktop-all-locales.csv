When I click on the URL in the email, the address bar may start empty. It may be displayed correctly. I changed the option ""Home page and new window"" from Firefox home (default) to a blank page, and it improved. After that, even if I returned to the default, it did not reproduce. Please let me know. Is this the correct specification? </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",kiyoshi.ueno

Is there a simpler way or something so I can be sure to keep the bookmarks I have since I have quite a number of them? Hope this information helps you figure out the issue I had earlier and how to not have it happen again at some point which I hope won't be the case. Thank you in advance if you reply to this post. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",Anduma22

The oldest pic I have is from 23/11/20. Firefox was running without no problems, then this started. </p><p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/lko72lB"" rel=""nofollow"">Gallery</a>  </p><p>The problem is High cpu usage from time to time. Making firefox slower and also freezing tabs. It's so annoying. Made me use Edge that runs incredibly smooth, I was impressed( I can even watch media in 1080p with no problem).  </p><p>Then I noticed through the task manager that the 'Host service Windows font cache service' is always present, as you can see in the gallery. I didn't find anything related to that. </p><p>Tried starting in safe mode, refresh, uninstalled and installed today(24/02) and nothing worked. This is driving me crazy because I love using the browser.  </p><p><strong>My PC Setup is:</strong> Windows 10 Home i3-4130 8GB ram no video card </p><p>And I use the free avira antivirus. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",gabriel.willames

Would it be possible to get this 'simplify page' back on the new print window? I have not a screenshot with that option to show, sorry for that. Thank you in advance.

They set it to open in Foxit Reader and checked the box to do it automatically each time but it always goes back to the default setting. I confirmed that the Application settings in Options is set to use Foxit Reader for PDFs and I even followed the troubleshooting step for this issue and renamed the handlers.json file.  </p><p>Also each time they try to download a PDF a prompt comes up asking for an admin password (see the 3rd image). These computers are on a domain, so the UAC prompt isn't unusual but we don't restrict them from being able to download files. But I'm having the same issue as well and I'm not on the domain, so I think this is more of a symptom then a cause. </p><p>Is this a bug in the latest update? I was troubleshooting a printer setting issue for them the day before yesterday. Did some testing on my computer and theirs, got it worked out that Foxit works best for their needs when printing a PDF from a web app. Then yesterday afternoon they began to have issues where they couldn't print at all. I checked it out and all of our computers updated to Firefox v86 and everything is now working differently now in terms of handling PDFs.  </p><p>Thanks in advanced, </p><p>Josh </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",jleary
