A similar question has been asked before but the workaround, switch, fix was not evident or workable.  I have already checked the Printer settings and it appears that there is nothing in the machine that can be changed. Does anybody have any idea of what is going on here ?  There is no memory of anything previously being changed Re: printing page format--it just started for no apparent reason. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",PillBustr3

But for that to happen, first you must login to your Facebook account. The problem is that when I click the button ""login to post"", nothing happens - as if I didn't click it at all. I suspect the reason for that are the integrated anti-tracking options in Firefox 89. So the question is: how do I get this plugin to work in Firefox 89? </p><p>P.S. Until a month ago I was temporarily using Chromium as default browser and there the FB plugin had no issues. Chromium has no anti-tracking options which is why I think this function in Firefox is the reason for the FB plugin not to work. </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-890;firefox-8901;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1423130;,rado84
