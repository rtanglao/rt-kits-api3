But for that to happen, first you must login to your Facebook account. The problem is that when I click the button ""login to post"", nothing happens - as if I didn't click it at all. I suspect the reason for that are the integrated anti-tracking options in Firefox 89. So the question is: how do I get this plugin to work in Firefox 89? </p><p>P.S. Until a month ago I was temporarily using Chromium as default browser and there the FB plugin had no issues. Chromium has no anti-tracking options which is why I think this function in Firefox is the reason for the FB plugin not to work. </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-890;firefox-8901;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",rado84
