Despite Firefox autocomplete logs and passwords I waste a lot of time for it especialy with two factors veryfication. How I can roll this function back to old happy time when google and social networks remember my browser and I just open it in one click?  Changing settings on privacy and security page doesn't help.

Ich würde diesen Affen von MaxiSchrott gern endlich einmal mit dem Rohrstock eins auf die Finger geben, denn bei jedem Update darf ich meine wertvolle Lebenszeit auf irgendeinen Bugfix verschwenden, der mich nicht die Bohne interessiert. Ich komme aus einer Zeit, da galt der Spruch ""Never change a runnig system"" und so halte ich das auch heute noch, es sei denn, ich werde von höheren Instanzen dazu gezwungen. Ich will, dass diese Scheißkisten laufen, ohne dass ich ständig was dran schrauben muss. Da waren die Autos mit den alten Vergasern noch weniger anfällig. Hat jemand eine Idee, wie ich dieses Problem (kein Ton, kein Abspielen von Player-Inhalten) beheben kann? Neuester FF ist schon installiert, Rechner auch schon xmal neu gestartet, alle möglichen Audio-Einstellungen schon übverprüft - daran liegt es also nicht. Das ist der Grund, weshalb ich mich dagegen wehre, immer mehr meiner Intelligent und Verantwort an diese Scheißkisten abzugeben. Sie machen dumm, verantwortungs- und hilflos.  </p><p>Hi all, on Friday the IT department in our company rolled out the latest update of Windoof, since then I get neither a sound when I play UTube content in FF, nor does FF play files that are embedded in a player on a website (Fehelermeldung that the content can not be played). I would love to finally give these monkeys from MaxiSchrott one on the fingers with the cane, because with every update I get to waste my precious lifetime on some bug fix that I don't give a damn about. I come from a time when the saying ""Never change a runnig system"" was true and that's how I still hold it today, unless I'm forced to by higher authorities. I want these crap boxes to run without me having to constantly screw something to them. That's when the cars with the old carburetors were even less prone to failure. Does anyone have an idea how I can fix this problem (no sound, no player content playing)? I already installed the newest FF, restarted the computer several times, checked all possible audio settings - so that's not the problem. That's the reason why I'm resisting to give more and more of my intelligence and responsibility to these crap boxes. They make you stupid, irresponsible and helpless.  This is a automated translation because I have not enough time to write it twice and, of course, all English speaking providers meanmwhile use machine translated text to ""support"" us, which is horroble to understand. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",tuxa.doedl
