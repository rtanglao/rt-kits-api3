Since about 12th February this year attempted access just times out saying the site is busy or down. I get the same problem using other browsers. Firefox flags a certificate/name/address error warning which can be bypassed but not very convenient and possibly unsafe. The owner of the website asked me to try the IP address as a test and it works perfectly. Why is Firefox suddenly flagging this problem after 6 years of using this site without any issues? The website owner says no other users have reported any problems. There are 2000+ users. I have tried clearing the cache, disabling add-ons and resetting Firefox. Using CMD tracert I have discovered the IP address called by <a href=""http://hrca.net"" rel=""nofollow"">hrca.net</a> on my laptop is not the same as the one supplied by website owner. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated. </p><p>Vic Mumby </p>",windows-7;desktop;websites;firefox-850;firefox-8502;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",v.mumby

Would you like to make it your default browser?""

I click the default button but the problem repeats next time anyway. </p><p>FF is always my default browser. My preference is already set for it to be the default (FF &gt; hamburger menu &gt; Preferences &gt; General &gt; Startup &gt; Always Check if Firefox is Your Default Browser is already checkmarked), my distro (Fedora 33 &gt; Gnome 3.38.3 &gt; Settings app &gt; Default Applications &gt; Web) has it as the default, ctrl-clicking a linked URL in LibreOffice Writer opens FF with that URL in the address bar, and I always approve the alert to make it my default. It still asks. </p><p>FF was my default browser. It came with Fedora 32 and I kept Fedora evergreen so that now it's F33 and still evergreen.

Under that, it continuously says ""Firefox is not your default browser"". Clicking the ""Make Default…"" button changes the button's shade but no dialog appears (although that's what ""…"" portends) and nothing else happens. Uncheckmarking the option and clicking the button recheckmarks the option, but still nothing happpens. I have Chromium 88.0.4324.150 (Developer Build) Fedora Project (64-bit) and Tor 10.0.8 but neither one is the default browser (Chromium upon starting says on the initial screen it isn't and Tor says it isn't in about:preferences) and I use them less, Favorites bar &gt; Show Applications &gt; ""browser"" (without quote marks) doesn't bring up any other browsers, and I don't think I have any other browsers on the laptop. </p><p>This happpens consistently.
