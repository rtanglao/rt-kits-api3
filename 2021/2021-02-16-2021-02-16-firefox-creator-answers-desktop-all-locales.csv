While using Firefox, the system audio periodically drops with no system acknowledgment (drivers don't know the sound dropped). This means that sound will not play in Firefox or in any other application on the PC. (The system also won't play test sounds through Control Panel) The moment I close all windows in Firefox, the audio to my system returns. Any chance this is a common issue? <em>Does anyone know why my computer's sound unexpectedly drops from time to time?</em> Any help is appreciated  </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-850;firefox-8502;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mason22571

I hate it!  All the shortcuts have the same icon.  Any way I can change this?  ""Properties&gt;Change icon"" does not fix this.

I am running Windows with the High Contrast Black mode because that seems to be the best option for my color vision.  (Windows 7 seemed much better.)  Anyway, I go to the Options-&gt;Colors page, uncheck use system colors, set the colors I want, and choose override the colors on the page with the always option.  And, nothing happens.  I do not see the colors I want.  Is there some other parameter in about:preferences I need to change?  Thanks for your help. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ModelCitizen
