It is recommended to use a new SSiD name on the new router verses the old one to stop issues with IoT devices. If I use a new recommended SSiD name, Firefox v90 takes well over 2 minutes to load. Google Chrome and Edge load instantly. If I do use the old SSiD Firefox loads normally again but I have problems with a bunch of my IoT devices on the network. I have tried setting the loading page to blank, clean installs, refreshing Firefox and playing with other settings in about:config. (Were does Firefox keep tabs of the network name so I can just clear it?) Is it in the registry? Windows 10 Pro 64 PC - New ASUS RT-AX86U router. Any help would be appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",malenart
