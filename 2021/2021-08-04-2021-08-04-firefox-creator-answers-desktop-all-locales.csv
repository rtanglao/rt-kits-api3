When I placed my cursor on the icon it said, ""If you use your real email address here, Facebook may be able to track you. Click to learn more."" See attached screenshot. But, clicking did nothing. </p><p>I'm pretty sure I'm safe since the email address I use to login to work is different from the one I use for Facebook, but could someone please shed more light on this? </p><p>Thanks! ~Elise </p>",mac-os;desktop;tips;firefox-900;,firefox,tips,en-US,1432458;,arrowsandspurs

It is recommended to use a new SSiD name on the new router verses the old one to stop issues with IoT devices. If I use a new recommended SSiD name, Firefox v90 takes well over 2 minutes to load. Google Chrome and Edge load instantly. If I do use the old SSiD Firefox loads normally again but I have problems with a bunch of my IoT devices on the network. I have tried setting the loading page to blank, clean installs, refreshing Firefox and playing with other settings in about:config. (Were does Firefox keep tabs of the network name so I can just clear it?) Is it in the registry? Windows 10 Pro 64 PC - New ASUS RT-AX86U router. Any help would be appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1432459;,malenart
