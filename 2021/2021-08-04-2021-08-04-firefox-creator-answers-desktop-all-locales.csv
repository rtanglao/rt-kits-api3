Uso firefox da praticamente sempre , e non mi è mai successa una cosa di questo tipo , quindi non so proprio come comportarmi.. Da una decina di giorni su youtube non va più la funzione CC , i sottotitoli in pratica. Ho provato con altri browser e con  loro vanno . Il pulsante c'è , ma quando lo clicco non succede nulla. Ho provato a ripristinare le impostazioni , pensando che magari si fosse nascosto in un angolo dello schermo :D , ma non è cambiato nulla. Ho smanettato con tutte le impostazioni disponibili x i CC , ma nada. Se qualcuno avesse un qualche suggerimento su come risolvere la questione pacificamente gli sarei debitore ... Altrimenti mi toccherà porre fine all'esistenza di questa incarnazione di firefox e reinstallarlo sperando che cosi si risolva il problema , ma preferirei riuscire a sistemare il problema senza avere una volpe sulla coscienza :D ....

I have a 2-frame page, one side is weather, the other side is AQI.  Because the AQI web site doesn't allow frames, for a long time I just load the JPG that shows the AQI map for my area.  (It has a static name.)  So I load a JPG in the right-hand frame.  The other day, I right-clicked and downloaded the image so I could e-mail it to a friend.  Ever since then, Firefox wants to download the image.  Firefox no longer shows the image in the right-hand frame.  Instead I was getting the save dialog, which I set up to have it always open in Firefox, which now opens it in another screen.  If I go into Settings (or wherever it is) and find ""Applications"" and tweak jpg, it does not give me ""show in Firefox""; the closest is ""preview in Firefox"" but THAT only shows up in OTHER applications, not jpg.  I did some searching, and found a handlers.json file, but that did not fix this maddening problem.  How do I get Firefox to simply go back to showing jpg in the browser?  I tried deleting some cookies, but since this goes back more than 24 hours, all Firefox lets me do is delete everything, and I do not want to do that.  How do I fix this?

In any case, I am not sure, if anyone replies, how I am alerted, etc.  So I guess I'll check back.  (OK, I see below there's a check box for alerting me when/if someone answers.) I could attach an image after I reset to ""ask,"" but what would be the point?  I am sure anyone reading this knows what this looks like.  The question is: why won't Firefox just show the jpg?
