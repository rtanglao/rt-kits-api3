And you can even put a cursor in it. However, as soon as you start typing something, the cursor shuffles into the address bar and the text is entered there! </p><p>This is absolutely schizoid behavior! The worst UI is simply impossible to imagine! </p><p>YES, I KNOW I CAN USE THE ADDRESS BAR AS A SEARCH BUT I DON'T WANT! </p><p>Why didn't you give users any choice? Don't you care about your own users? This is absurdly allogical behavior of the interface! What fool could have thought of such a thing ?! </p><p>Besides the fact that it is corny inconvenient, there is another extremely important disadvantage. Users suffering from cataracts put a dark theme for a reason - they otherwise see badly. </p><p>So what happens when the user has a dark theme and the start page displays a huge whitelist at the top of the screen as they enter text, what do you think? I can tell you - a user with poor eyesight is blinded for a second. </p><p>Guys, when will you start thinking before changing the browser for the worse? Seriously, Firefox has lost its entire user base over the past few years. This is very disappointing. </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ex-er-sis

Usually, when I right-click anywhere on the page to bring up a context menu and then decide I don't want to use any of the options on it, I can click on the page and the context menu disappears. Now, though, they don't go away unless I hit escape. I tried Firefox with the proton options enabled and disabled and in safe mode and regular mode and without any css personalization and it is the same regardless. Is this a bug? I'm on Windows 10 laptop. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",lisianthus1

I got a good antivirus too and there's no problem there. I can Ctrl+A the page and the text just isn't there(like the picture) or it's just a very small blank space(the links in the text are clickable in the small blank space) I tried the Hardware Acceleration method, the windows clear text method, and the text color method too. zooming in or out makes no difference. most sites have no problem or they're missing a very small amount of text on certain pages not the whole site. all of these sites work perfectly fine in chrome and opera. </p><p>is this a problem with a new update or something? </p><p><br> here's an image, all the places I highlighted with red, used to have texts! </p>",desktop;websites;windows-81;firefox-890;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",F3RYX
