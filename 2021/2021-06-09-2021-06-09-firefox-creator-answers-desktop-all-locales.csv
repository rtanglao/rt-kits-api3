Many times, when I restart Windows, especially if there has been a FF update, several things happen.  One, which always happens, is that FF “forgets” that it is already the default browser. Two, which happens often, is my setting for “Ask to save logins and passwords for websites” gets changed to “no.”  But occasionally, and this is the reason I’m writing, is clicks on external links open a new window, rather than a new tab (and this time, it’s always a small window which won’t respond to alt spacebar X to maximize it). I’ve checked about:config (don’t remember what page) per another web search, and confirmed that FF is set to open a new tab for internal links and to do the same for external links as is done for internal links. I’ve gone to about profiles and it shows three profiles, two of which say they are in use, so apparently the click on the internal link is opening a new profile.  (I don’t care about profiles; I tried them once for some reason I no longer remember and it didn’t work so I don’t care about profiles). So can anyone guide me on what I need to do?  The default profile has “beta” in it, but this was a long time ago. The “easiest” thing might be getting rid of all my profiles but I don’t know how to do that, and I certainly don’t want to have FF forget all my passwords, etc.   I greatly appreciate any help I can get. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,"",zarky1

I cant see anything and it's hurting my eyes. I can move over to Chrome and try to import all my bookmarks etc, but before I do, can anyone tell me is there a way to change the grey back to blue?

Recently the VPN configuration was changed to use split tunneling to improve our internet connection. Since then I have had several DNS resolving issues in Firefox. </p><p>We use an on premise DNS server as an alternative to `localhost` domain names so we can access other developers' environments and so a few services can do the same. Our URL structure is like projectname.[optional personal identifier.]localhost.[type].nl. Without the [optional personal identifier], or when nothing is configured for it, the ip address is 127.0.0.1. </p><p>In Linux' OpenVPN configuration I have ""Use this connection only for resource on its network"" enabled for IPv4 and IPv6 is disabled (to benefit from split tunneling). With that enabled Firefox usually fails to resolve such development hostnames. </p><p>- As far as I know I do not have DoH enabled (and the about:networking log further down tells so too). - I do have `dnsmasq` enabled (with configuration for the above domain formats to route to 127.0.0.1 also) in an attempt to fix some issues before the split tunneling was configured correctly. And in an attempt to try and get Firefox to handle these DNS resolving issues. - `dig` on the command line for the same domain works just fine. - Adding hostnames to /etc/hosts works. But that's becoming a chore, working on dozens of projects over months. </p><p>Why is Firefox failing to resolve such domain names?
