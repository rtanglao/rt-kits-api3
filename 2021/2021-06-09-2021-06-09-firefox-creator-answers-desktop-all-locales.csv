Any help you can provide with this problem would be appreciated. </p><p>Thanks </p><p>Steve Norton </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",subecca

Nothing.   It always times out.  I even created a new profile to start from scratch only to have the same error of the site timing out.  I created a new profile and got the same result.  I am running current up-to-date version of Window 10 (64-bit).  Have Verizon FIOS and am connecting to their router via wi-fi.  Anyone have an idea of how to resolve this?  I cannot ask Netflix since I cannot connect to them.  I can connect to Amazon Prime Video, BBC Iplayer but not Netflix.   Would appreciate any guidance.

And you can even put a cursor in it. However, as soon as you start typing something, the cursor shuffles into the address bar and the text is entered there! </p><p>This is absolutely schizoid behavior! The worst UI is simply impossible to imagine! </p><p>YES, I KNOW I CAN USE THE ADDRESS BAR AS A SEARCH BUT I DON'T WANT! </p><p>Why didn't you give users any choice? Don't you care about your own users? This is absurdly allogical behavior of the interface! What fool could have thought of such a thing ?! </p><p>Besides the fact that it is corny inconvenient, there is another extremely important disadvantage. Users suffering from cataracts put a dark theme for a reason - they otherwise see badly. </p><p>So what happens when the user has a dark theme and the start page displays a huge whitelist at the top of the screen as they enter text, what do you think? I can tell you - a user with poor eyesight is blinded for a second. </p><p>Guys, when will you start thinking before changing the browser for the worse? Seriously, Firefox has lost its entire user base over the past few years. This is very disappointing. </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,1419772;1419787;,ex-er-sis

Usually, when I right-click anywhere on the page to bring up a context menu and then decide I don't want to use any of the options on it, I can click on the page and the context menu disappears. Now, though, they don't go away unless I hit escape. I tried Firefox with the proton options enabled and disabled and in safe mode and regular mode and without any css personalization and it is the same regardless. Is this a bug? I'm on Windows 10 laptop. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1419794;,lisianthus1
