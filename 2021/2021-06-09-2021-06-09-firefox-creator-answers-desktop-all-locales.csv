What fool could have thought of such a thing ?! </p><p>Besides the fact that it is corny inconvenient, there is another extremely important disadvantage. Users suffering from cataracts put a dark theme for a reason - they otherwise see badly. </p><p>So what happens when the user has a dark theme and the start page displays a huge whitelist at the top of the screen as they enter text, what do you think? I can tell you - a user with poor eyesight is blinded for a second. </p><p>Guys, when will you start thinking before changing the browser for the worse?
