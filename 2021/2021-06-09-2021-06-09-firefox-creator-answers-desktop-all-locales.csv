Recently the VPN configuration was changed to use split tunneling to improve our internet connection. Since then I have had several DNS resolving issues in Firefox. </p><p>We use an on premise DNS server as an alternative to `localhost` domain names so we can access other developers' environments and so a few services can do the same. Our URL structure is like projectname.[optional personal identifier.]localhost.[type].nl.

With that enabled Firefox usually fails to resolve such development hostnames. </p><p>- As far as I know I do not have DoH enabled (and the about:networking log further down tells so too). - I do have `dnsmasq` enabled (with configuration for the above domain formats to route to 127.0.0.1 also) in an attempt to fix some issues before the split tunneling was configured correctly. And in an attempt to try and get Firefox to handle these DNS resolving issues. - `dig` on the command line for the same domain works just fine. - Adding hostnames to /etc/hosts works. But that's becoming a chore, working on dozens of projects over months. </p><p>Why is Firefox failing to resolve such domain names?
