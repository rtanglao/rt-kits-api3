I will periodically delete browser history typically for time ranges of either a couple hours, the whole day, or once in a while everything; the checkboxes I have selected are `Browsing &amp; Download History`, `Form &amp; Search History`, and `Cache`. It seems that clearing history will most likely mean that the ETP 2.0 feature will now think I've not visited certain sites within 45 days and will purge trackers including anything that saved my logins on these sites like Twitter and various Google sites, unless I toggle it off in the config.  </p><p>But when I toggle off this feature, what exactly do I lose out on with tracking protections? Am I essentially opting out of ETP 2.0 when I toggle off this config property? I would like to be able to retain my logins while still being able to periodically clear history like I've been doing before, and also ideally not be opting out of what might be a lot of tracking protection, if possible. Note that I do for sure use private windows whenever possible but sometimes I need to use normal windows and subsequent history deletions instead. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Alexandros_Homegas
