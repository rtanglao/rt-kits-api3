I have this really annoying glitch where I'll bookmark a page, and Firefox will occasionally duplicate that bookmark hundreds of times. I've gone in and deleted the duplicates, but then the problem re-occurs, so I'm trying to figure out how to finally fix this! I've already spent several hours looking through your help forums and trying to fix it, but nothing seems to work. Here's what I've done: </p><p>I turned off sync on all my devices. I also noticed that I had the iCloud synch extension on one of my computers, so I removed that, since I read that might cause some issues. Then I went and cleaned up the bookmarks on one of my computers, deleting all the duplicate entries, and I exported an HTML version of my bookmarks to my computer and also created a backup .json file. I refreshed Firefox on that computer. And I changed my sync password, since I read somewhere that that would supposedly force my old data to be deleted from Firefox's server. </p><p>Then I turned sync back on on that one computer, hoping that the latest version of my bookmarks that were on that computer would now update to Firefox's server. But instead of replacing the old bookmarks file in the cloud, it simply added back the old duplicate bookmarks to my computer (which apparently never got deleted from Firefox servers, despite the password change). Super frustrating. Isn't there a way to force a one-way sync, so the version of the bookmarks file that I have locally -- which has the latest changes -- takes priority?? </p><p>I then tried going to ""Import bookmarks from HTML,"" hoping that the version I had previously saved would replace this bad, outdated version I had downloaded from the server, but that didn't seem to do anything (I guess import only adds new bookmarks but doesn't delete existing bookmarks?). Could I import the json file instead? If so, how do I do that? I've considered deleting all my bookmarks and then importing the html file again to see if that fixes it, but it looks like the html file doesn't include the bookmarks on my toolbar. Is that correct? If so, I don't want to lose them. </p><p>Not sure what this is so glitchy and so difficult to fix.

When I did, I found there is a limit to how many tabs Sync willl display at once from another device. That limit is 1,271 tabs, which is not all of mine - I'm pretty sure I had more than that open in a </em>single one' 'of my seven open windows (though probably only the one window had that many).  </p><p>Also, with the new Firefox update, while I can open all 1,271 at once, that just leads to Firefox crashing. When similar things happened in the past, I could open, say, fifty at a time, and kill Firefox's process every time it became too much for my computer, then reopen firefox with all those tabs open but not active, however with FF 89 I only seem to be able to open one or all.  </p><p>To make matters worse, those 1,271 tabs I can see seem to be randomised each time, or at least randomly ordered, so I wouldn't even be able to methodically open all 1,271 with my usual method of killing firefox and reopening it. </p><p>Is there any way I can send the 1,271 straight to bookmarks, or open the <em>entire</em> session from the old install, or view more than the 1,271, or open the <em>old</em> synced tabs view, where I could open as many or as few as I wanted to, instead of all or (basically) nothing? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,sync,en-US,1420899;,foofmoonshot

Just getting to the point of getting to this page where I am writing this post has seen THREE Firefox crashes, as switching tab to my email so as to get the verification code for my mozilla account was seemingly too much for Firefox to handle. Viewing Facebook messages and scrolling up to see comments made earlier in the day sees the layout of the page completely screwed up (main content shifted to bottom right corner, scrollbar shifted elsewhere, part of the page blank) and at that point trying to switch to another tab creates a strange hybrid situation where some of the contents from both tabs is merged together and is then the only content visible no matter which tab is then clicked on. Using Google Maps works for about 30 seconds and then the entire page flashes repeatedly with every move of the mouse, before this triggers a browser crash. I can be reading content on a news website and suddenly the tab crashes for no reason, and in most cases the browser then crashes thereafter. Restarting the browser and the news page tab will be shown and begin to load but then immediately crashes. These are just some of the issues that have occurred within just the past 2 hours, but this is a cumulative effect as Firefox has been becoming increasingly unstable to this point after updating to version 89 earlier in the week.... No other changes have been made since updating Firefox, here has been no Windows 10 updates, no other applications have been installed or updated, no other software has been either added or removed.  </p><p>I could run the previous version of Firefox for several days, leaving the computer running but idle for a few hours each day, and still come back and resume where I had left off without issue. Now with Firefox 89 it is struggling to even go 30 minutes without tabs or the entire browser crashing. When can we expct a fix, or is there otherwise a way to roll back Firefox to version 88 without having to do a full uninstall/reinstall...? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1420823;,mazeteam
