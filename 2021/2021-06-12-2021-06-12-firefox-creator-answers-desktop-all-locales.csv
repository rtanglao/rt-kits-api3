When I download a video / file, the internet is disconnected in the middle, and it takes a while to connect, then the download starts again from 0%! It wastes both my time and the internet. If the power connection is disconnected while downloading again - I don't get any backup of that file when I connect to the internet after the power connection is restored ...! However, other browsers have this advantage. I like Firefox a lot, but this short time memory loss system bothers me a lot. I hope to fix this issue in the next update.

I am not an IT geek and I'm not comfortable doing things like changing CSS code - if I knew how to do that stuff, I'd be using Linux not Windows. Since I'm stuck with Windows, I rely on a good browser like FF v.88 to take care of the technical stuff. </p><p>Version 89 seems to be OK with Proton shut off, but I hear this is a temporary fix. I also don't know if shutting off Proton fixed the spacing nightmare in Bookmarks - I lost mine reloading v.88 and haven't had a chance to look for them. (v.89 is on the PC upstairs - this one is still on v.88.) </p><p>For some context on the anger at FF's change, those of us who use Facebook on a regular basis were forced into a horrendous update in late 2021 which barely works, and Facebook continuously changes code, fixing what isn't broken. To find that the browser we've relied on for years did the same with no warning is very upsetting. </p><p>I'd like to get a message directly to Mozilla but ""Submit Feedback"" has been shut down for over a week. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,1420782;,fidservant
