Tried to refresh with no success. Tried to uninstall and reinstall but it will not do a full uninstall. And when I reinstall, it just re-installs the same glitchy version and it will not do a fresh install. After install, the same bookmarks from the glitchy version are present and the app will still not work. It's completely unusable.  Any thoughts? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jga2000

After going to a new page, the button is highlighted as if it were functional, but pressing it does nothing. It does not go back or show the recent history. Neither going to a different site nor opening a new tab or window helps. Rebooting solves the problem temporarily. </p><p>I have not determined whether the problem arises after visiting any particular sites. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Cruzing

I don't know if that's what I want. </p><p>I would like to have a simple selection in FF Preferences to turn OFF the Proton stuff. I am not an IT geek and I'm not comfortable doing things like changing CSS code - if I knew how to do that stuff, I'd be using Linux not Windows. Since I'm stuck with Windows, I rely on a good browser like FF v.88 to take care of the technical stuff. </p><p>Version 89 seems to be OK with Proton shut off, but I hear this is a temporary fix. I also don't know if shutting off Proton fixed the spacing nightmare in Bookmarks - I lost mine reloading v.88 and haven't had a chance to look for them. (v.89 is on the PC upstairs - this one is still on v.88.) </p><p>For some context on the anger at FF's change, those of us who use Facebook on a regular basis were forced into a horrendous update in late 2021 which barely works, and Facebook continuously changes code, fixing what isn't broken. To find that the browser we've relied on for years did the same with no warning is very upsetting. </p><p>I'd like to get a message directly to Mozilla but ""Submit Feedback"" has been shut down for over a week. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",fidservant
