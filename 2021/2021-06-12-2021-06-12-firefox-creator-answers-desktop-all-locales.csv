Just getting to the point of getting to this page where I am writing this post has seen THREE Firefox crashes, as switching tab to my email so as to get the verification code for my mozilla account was seemingly too much for Firefox to handle. Viewing Facebook messages and scrolling up to see comments made earlier in the day sees the layout of the page completely screwed up (main content shifted to bottom right corner, scrollbar shifted elsewhere, part of the page blank) and at that point trying to switch to another tab creates a strange hybrid situation where some of the contents from both tabs is merged together and is then the only content visible no matter which tab is then clicked on. Using Google Maps works for about 30 seconds and then the entire page flashes repeatedly with every move of the mouse, before this triggers a browser crash. I can be reading content on a news website and suddenly the tab crashes for no reason, and in most cases the browser then crashes thereafter. Restarting the browser and the news page tab will be shown and begin to load but then immediately crashes. These are just some of the issues that have occurred within just the past 2 hours, but this is a cumulative effect as Firefox has been becoming increasingly unstable to this point after updating to version 89 earlier in the week.... No other changes have been made since updating Firefox, here has been no Windows 10 updates, no other applications have been installed or updated, no other software has been either added or removed.  </p><p>I could run the previous version of Firefox for several days, leaving the computer running but idle for a few hours each day, and still come back and resume where I had left off without issue. Now with Firefox 89 it is struggling to even go 30 minutes without tabs or the entire browser crashing. When can we expct a fix, or is there otherwise a way to roll back Firefox to version 88 without having to do a full uninstall/reinstall...? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1420823;,mazeteam
