Within Firefox itself (not emails or off site pages) it STILL insists that COLOUR is spelt wrong &amp; it allows me to spell NITE (not day) incorrectly. i have an Oxford dictionary in front of me &amp; can reference a WEBSTERS all day long.  There are many, many countries that have English as their primary language, Ghana is one &amp; some South Pacific Islands (now the French have buggered off) The Seychelles off Africa have English as their official language &amp; you can bet 'they' would have odd spellings. So no English (Australian) that's why the word Galah doesn't even get a look in. A Galah, by the way, is a VERY common Australian bird &amp; in anyone's language. I'm guessing there is NO American word for Cockatoo too.  I will have to look that up in my Funk &amp; Wagnalls. Funk &amp; Wagnalls was an American publisher known for its reference works, including A Standard Dictionary of the English Language, and the Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard (reference Wikipedia). Well, well, not only Webster trying ton undermine (Bastardize) (its actually S not a Z) standard English but Fucken Wagnall was in on it too! </p><pre>Anneeeway just a heads up. using Firefox Browser (64-bit) on a Windows 7 Ultimate (Service Pack 1) I guess support for Win7 will be gone soon anyway Microsoft will see to that. </pre> <p>Looking for a suitable LINUX replacement.

I have my start page set to Google. Then when I refresh the page it usually opens but sometimes I need to refresh more than once. Then after that I can surf normally. Does anyone know what causes that? Is it an issue with my ISP or my router or something else? I though it might be the New Tab Override extension, but disabling it won't solve the problem. I have a 100 Mbps cable connection. I do not notice the same problem with Chrome. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-910;firefox-9101;,firefox,websites,en-US,1444228;1444231;1444232;,john2621
