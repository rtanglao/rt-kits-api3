I have my start page set to Google. Then when I refresh the page it usually opens but sometimes I need to refresh more than once. Then after that I can surf normally. Does anyone know what causes that? Is it an issue with my ISP or my router or something else? I though it might be the New Tab Override extension, but disabling it won't solve the problem. I have a 100 Mbps cable connection. I do not notice the same problem with Chrome. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-910;firefox-9101;,firefox,websites,en-US,1444228;1444231;1444232;,john2621
