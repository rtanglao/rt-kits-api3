Within Firefox itself (not emails or off site pages) it STILL insists that COLOUR is spelt wrong &amp; it allows me to spell NITE (not day) incorrectly. i have an Oxford dictionary in front of me &amp; can reference a WEBSTERS all day long.  There are many, many countries that have English as their primary language, Ghana is one &amp; some South Pacific Islands (now the French have buggered off) The Seychelles off Africa have English as their official language &amp; you can bet 'they' would have odd spellings. So no English (Australian) that's why the word Galah doesn't even get a look in. A Galah, by the way, is a VERY common Australian bird &amp; in anyone's language. I'm guessing there is NO American word for Cockatoo too.  I will have to look that up in my Funk &amp; Wagnalls. Funk &amp; Wagnalls was an American publisher known for its reference works, including A Standard Dictionary of the English Language, and the Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard (reference Wikipedia).
