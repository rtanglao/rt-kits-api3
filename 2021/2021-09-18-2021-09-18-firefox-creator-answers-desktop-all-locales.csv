But I would also be OK with having it back because I have an account. </p><p>Any ideas on this ? </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,"",JoeJupa

Na versão anterior os espaços eram menores, mais itens podiam ser visualizados de uma única vez. Nesta nova versão 92.0 os espaços ficaram muito grandes entre os itens. Parece que nas outras versão o espaço usado era de 1/8 agora o espaço é 1/6. Obrigado </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-81;firefox-920;,firefox,bookmarks,pt-BR,"",ezayan

Within Firefox itself (not emails or off site pages) it STILL insists that COLOUR is spelt wrong &amp; it allows me to spell NITE (not day) incorrectly. i have an Oxford dictionary in front of me &amp; can reference a WEBSTERS all day long.  There are many, many countries that have English as their primary language, Ghana is one &amp; some South Pacific Islands (now the French have buggered off) The Seychelles off Africa have English as their official language &amp; you can bet 'they' would have odd spellings. So no English (Australian) that's why the word Galah doesn't even get a look in. A Galah, by the way, is a VERY common Australian bird &amp; in anyone's language. I'm guessing there is NO American word for Cockatoo too.  I will have to look that up in my Funk &amp; Wagnalls. Funk &amp; Wagnalls was an American publisher known for its reference works, including A Standard Dictionary of the English Language, and the Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard (reference Wikipedia). Well, well, not only Webster trying ton undermine (Bastardize) (its actually S not a Z) standard English but Fucken Wagnall was in on it too! </p><pre>Anneeeway just a heads up. using Firefox Browser (64-bit) on a Windows 7 Ultimate (Service Pack 1) I guess support for Win7 will be gone soon anyway Microsoft will see to that. </pre> <p>Looking for a suitable LINUX replacement.
