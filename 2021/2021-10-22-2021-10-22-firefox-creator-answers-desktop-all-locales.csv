I reinstalled it and it will not open. I did a refresh and it would not work.

There's no message or anything asking if I want to boot it into safe mode. I don't care about keeping previous data for Firefox like profiles or bookmarks. I do not know what else to do. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",vagemedal
