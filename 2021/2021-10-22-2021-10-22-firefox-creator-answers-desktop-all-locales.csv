Some websites I was using perfectly ok in Firefox before now show as tiny text/font size and or generally looks wrong (in firefox) and nothing I do seems to resolve the issue, for example I'm viewing some websites at 130% but some text on the page is still too small. I can view the same sites in chrome with no issues at all at normal 100% level, The best example I could give I can't paste here for obvious reasons, my hargreaves lansdown pension values text is all squashed together so individual text that shows on one line on chrome (correctly) shows as condensed into 2 lines in firefox, the text is big but the values beside it are not for example, any increase in the zoom level doesnt really resolve this issue, yes the text gets bigger but I shouldnt have to read it at 150% zoom !!! but 100% is waaay too small, and the values size is not in sync withe the text beside it. I count myself as fairly savvy technically, I've tried all sorts including clearing cache and cookies and checking settings etc in firefox but this one has me stumped,  some sites work ok but it looks like Firefox may be struggling to cope with some sort of display extension that some sites are using to display some parts of their page Any ideas please ?
