So why does a Bing page show up when I want to use FIrefox? </p><p>Secondly, why do items I don't want or no longer need appear in my 4 rows of tabs I can click on to access that website? This is frustrating, especially when I can't get rid of one I don't care for. </p><p>Also, making this like Microsoft, where it may take some time to actually ask for help almost makes me want to go back to them. I wanted more than they had. </p><p>T. Rogers mrtbaron2@outlook.com </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",mrtbaron2

Is this a settings change after recent update? Virus or malware. To unlock account asks to upload photo of license which I don't feel is right. Any help appreciated.
