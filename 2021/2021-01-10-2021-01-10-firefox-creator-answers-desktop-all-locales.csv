All types of political views use your products.  I for one have used your product since before it actually worked well.  But through the years I endured the issues to stay loyal and help the cause to improve your browser usage numbers.   Based upon your recent announcement I am more than happy to move on to something else for my browser needs,  so you can enjoy your dropping product usage percentage world wide.  Given the current days and the ""children"" running various companies you won't be alone at the bottom.  i am sorry to see your years of work flushed because you want to get political and threaten retaliation on those who don't hold your views   I just wonder which group you will determine should be blocked next.   I am moving on to a browser company that doesn't care what the people who use their product believe or their political persuasion.  By the way, I have technical support influence on a wide number of sites and people.   My recommendation to them will be to discontinue use of your product to avoid future issues with their political beliefs.  Hopefully  those exiting your product won't become exponential and you'll have a chance to hire ""adults"" to run your business, if you get a second chance. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",kcknutson
