The old Firefox process must be closed to open a new window.","<p>I shut down my PC without closing the Firefox brower tabs and I started getting this message the next time I re-booted and tried to start Firefox. --- ""Firefox is already running, but is not responding. The old Firefox process must be closed to open a new window."" ---  </p><p>I read thru the different support forums and tried various answers/suggestions - no luck. Bottom line, I have uninstalled the browser, deleted all the old Mozilla folders from the machine and downloaded the .exe to try to re-install the browser. However, the installation crashes at about 70% completion and I still get the message listed above. I am running on Windows 10 and the PC is up to date with all patches.  </p><p>I would appreciate if anyone can help me figure this issue out. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",ankrnl01

Want to go back, but SAVE active tabs.","<p>This may be messy, sorry. I hated the new FireFox appearance, so stuck with 78 on MacOS 9. I never approved the update, but somehow, my FireFox upgraded after a crash. Of course, it gives me the constantÂ : </p><p>Error code: SEC_ERROR_LIBRARY_FAILURE </p><p>I want to go back to 78. (I am aware of security considerations, I use other browsers for that.) </p><p>I tried reading the forums, but do not see this question. </p><p>I am hoping if I can log in to FireFox 82 to my account somehow, it will save the active tabs. (there are 100 active tabs yes, because of end of year issues) FireFox 82 cannot log in. </p><p>I saved my profile, ran 78 and it lets me log in, but with a new profile, so I cannot open previously open tabs. </p><p>So my question is: How can I import the active tabs and all bookmarks into FireFix 82? (assuming I need to do a reset?) How can I get the active tabs into FireFix 78? (preferred, as I do not like the new look in 79+) </p><p><br> thanks!!! </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",garlic1

If I select ""Open with Firefox [Developer Edition]"", the following things happen: </p> <ul><li> The PDF is downloaded to ~/Downloads </li><li> The PDF is opened in a new tab, with that new tab's location bar holding a file:///... URL to the downloaded PDF </li></ul> <p>What I would instead like to happen is: </p> <ul><li> The PDF is downloaded to some temporary directory where I won't have to worry about deleting it manually </li><li> In whatever tab the PDF is displayed in, the location bar contains the URL where the PDF was (temporarily!) downloaded from </li></ul> <p>How can I achieve this? </p><p>Not having the URL where a PDF was opened from is very annoying when, for example, I open a bunch of PDF search results to read and review, and I later want to share links to some of those PDFs.  Best I can do to find their URLs to give to others is then to try and remember which tab corresponds to which search result, or do mine the downloads tab. </p><p>Contrast this with Chrome: I click a Google result for a PDF and <em>the PDF just opens in the current tab with the URL to the PDF in the location bar</em>.  No dialogs, no PDF files hanging around in my home directory, and I can just copy the URL to the PDF the same way I'd copy the URL to any web page. </p><p>Thank you! </p>",mac-os;desktop;beta;other;firefox-850;,firefox,other,en-US,1382682;,dale5
