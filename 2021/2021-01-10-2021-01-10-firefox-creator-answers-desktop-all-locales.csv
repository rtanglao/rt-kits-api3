Waiting does nothing and if I stop it, I can't make the post. I use Facebook heavily for business so this is a MAJOR issue. Clearing the cache, cookies, and site data does NOT fix the issue. I've not had an issue with this before now, and I've been using Firefox for years. I have been using the Facebook container for several months, but this is the first I've had an issue. Is this a Firefox issue, or a Facebook issue?

Employee Self Service (ESS) we need to use IE for that. But unfortunately Firefox Updates even destroy IE functionality for SAP ESS.  What happen is, that IE crashes and Firefox is opened! (Eventhough firefox is not standard browser! It's chrome!) Only solution is to completely remove all firefox installations company wide from all employee laptops! Until then, we have after each (enforced) firefox update enormous traffic on our first level support hotline. </p><p>Thus: How can Firefox Updates be permanently prevented?
