I'm getting it now, FF 90.0.2 64-bit, Windows 10 Pro N, Build 19041.vb_release.191206-1406. System updated. Not very often it starts playing for a fraction of a second. Videos and GIFs everywhere else (as far as places I normally go) plays as it should. Troubleshoot mode didn't solve it; hardware acceleration tweak neither. No crash logs. </p><p>Tried on the Edge and everything is fine. </p><p>Question: does the suggested ""fix"" on <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/fix-video-audio-problems-firefox-windows"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/fix-video-audio-problems-firefox-windows</a> embraces this issue as well? If so, sorry, but might be time to change browsers. The reason I'm using Windows 10 PRO -&gt;N&lt;- is exactly not to have to remove Windows Media Player and related ""bloat"" from my system. This isn't one of those crybaby threats I hate to read: it's a necessity. </p><p>I must ask: why on Edge, on the same machine, the same problem doesn't exist as in Firefox. </p><p>Suggestion for mentioned article: might be helpful point users (also) to the right place of The Media Feature Pack for N and KN versions of Windows 10, on <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48231"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48231</a> </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,other,en-US,1429768;,LuizCasteloBranco
