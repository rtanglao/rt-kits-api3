Currently, (90.0..1), there is just a send to container option, which doesn't exactly accomplish what I am looking for. </p><p>This is purely QoL, but it would speed things up quite a bit. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",bradkasson

Keep asking me the STUPID. QUESTION. WHY. I. WANT. TO. LOGOUT. That my friend is the MOST STUPID THING TO DEMAND TO LOGOUT! WTF! Is Mozilla finally gone NUTS?! I BET I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE. Man Mozilla. Used your stuff since the BEGINNING it was MADE. BUT DAMNIT! DON'T YOU DO THIS ""FORUM SUPPORT"" Like that DAMN GOOGLE! Argh this is SO STUPID!! !  Oh the BEST ONE is NOT BEING ABLE TO CHANGE THAT DAMN PICTURE ON THE TOP RIGHT!!!       /\ RIGHT UP THERE! SCREAM!!! YOU JUST BEAT GOOGLE. Wtf! MAN WTF? Oh I KNOW I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE HERE. YOUR. DAMN. MENU. BUTTON. DOES. NOT. WORK. DAMNIT!!! Put it this way AS OF Today if YOU DO NOT GIVE ME AN ANSWER. Boy you BETTER hope these real experts have the answer. I AM SO PISSED OFF AT YOUR STUPID ""KIDDY MENUS"" man. WE INSTALL FIREFOX OVER CHROME BECAUSE WE ARE MOSTLY EXPERTS YOU DINGBATS! And for F**K SAKE! BACK. UP. THE. PASSWORD. INFORMATION. WHEN. WE. CHANGE. OR. RESET. THE. SERVICE. SO. WE. CAN. GO. BACK. TO. IT. IF. WE. NEED. TO. Why didn't you think of this already?! Stored backup on the client's DEVICE. Remember. It is ENCRYPTED. Argh. Please someone who is a real expert help me with this. The ones who take their own time. To help. Your all amazing. Wish those asses would have a help staff... Hah. I will give them a break. Google is the antichrist of huge companies with names like Microsoft and... cough copy lifting. Can they NEVER come up with it from SCRATCH? This is like Jeff Goldbloom in Jarassic Park! (I KNOW I sp'ed on that.) Ever notice how ALL the new software ""kind of works"". Makes me sick. Anyway. Remember him saying they didn't make it themselves. Just slapped a Google label on it.. hahah... Am sure there are MILLIONS OF us that feel that way. I figure he had the perfect description. Who the hell makes the ""change your avatar"" not work and EXPECT you to TRUST them with ALL your PRIVATE passwords. Logins. And be this moronic! Never thought I would be saying that about Mozilla. Wtf Happened? You hire people from Google? I am feeling all your guys pain for you man. This is some real stupid sh*t! Talking about wasting time when you don't have a beer. I just lost all my damned passwords. Because it did not save them at all. Having the DAMNED ENCRYPTED FILE ON OUR HARDWARE will NOT ""compromise"" it. WHY didn't you think of this already? I REALLY wanted that beer. I was SO PISSED I almost did something I have NEVER done before. I ALMOST installed Microsoft's explorer crap for Android. Hah. How fitting they put that on Google. That is SUCH a smack in their face. Anyway, here's your image everyone hates to see. I am sure... Go figure. Now that button down there does not work. No. I turned off all add-ons, even the extra protection in Firefox is off. And I can not press that DAMNED ""Browse..."" button. Wtf man. I really wish I had that beer...  </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",delathor
