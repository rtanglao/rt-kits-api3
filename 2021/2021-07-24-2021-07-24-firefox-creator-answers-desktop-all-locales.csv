The last time it crashed 6 times in a row then WIPED out my copy and gave me a new copy, BLANK of everything. I am no rookie to Firefox as my first version was 1.0 when I converted from Netscape Navigator long ago. The rub is PROFILES. I have too many to manage now and need to get rid of some but Moz:lla in their infinite wisdom does not put a date, what was the LAST one.... and one has to search to find the LAST profile that has your latest modification, data, etc.  I am fearsome in deleting any as they do not seem to be in any order and I get a SERVE warning when trying to delete. Since the new releases crashes all the time, to do critical work I have to resort to UGH, ""EDGE' until Moz://a gets a solid release and hopefully STOP TRYING TO COPY EDGE AND CHROME.  </p><p>Any advise will be appreciated.
