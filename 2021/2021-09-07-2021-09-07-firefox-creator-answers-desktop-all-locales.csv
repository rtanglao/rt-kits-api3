I went to check my email and the layout was totally different and all the messages that were in my inbox and junk folder were gone!!! As a matter of fact, ALL of my saved emails and folders are gone!!! Where did they go? How do I get them back? How do I restore the previous Outlook view? It seems as if every time I get used to a layout you change it. This is a crock!!! I save things, such as emails that are important, and I place them in folders that I have created, so I know where they are and you guys just change it and throw away my folders? How do I go back to the previous version of Firefox? Or, how do I go back to the previous version of outlook so I can get my folders, saved emails, as well as my inbox back? If you are going to do this type of thing then give us the option of retaining our emails and the look and feel that we are used to. Some of us have trouble remembering things and change is difficult!!!! </p>",desktop;other;windows-81;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,1441258;,kjayhouse15
