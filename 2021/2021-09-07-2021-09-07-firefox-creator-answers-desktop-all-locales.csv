It doesn't happen in Chrome or Edge browsers. Not always, but a quiet a few times when I press the letter 'a' on my keyboard when I'm filling out a field in a form or something, it automatically presses enter!? So if I'm typing my email address in a field for example, mr@doma.... the forms takes me to another field or sometimes acts like enter was pressed. The 'a' button is no where near the TAB or ENTER button and I'm not accidentally pressing them. It's driving me crazy and I hope someone can help me fix it as the way this is going, I might have to stop using Firefox which is Not what I want! I have looked online for help but it's hard to find anything like this as I can't even describe the problem?! I went to my google home page, typed this 'firefox presses enter when I type a' to get some help online, but as soon as I typed the last letter 'a', it loaded a page which had nothing to do with what I wrote. Sometimes refreshing the page works than it occurs randomly. I just tried to replicate it but no go. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1441295;,aus-sam
