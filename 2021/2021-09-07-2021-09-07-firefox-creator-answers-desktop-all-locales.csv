It doesn't happen in Chrome or Edge browsers. Not always, but a quiet a few times when I press the letter 'a' on my keyboard when I'm filling out a field in a form or something, it automatically presses enter!? So if I'm typing my email address in a field for example, mr@doma.... the forms takes me to another field or sometimes acts like enter was pressed. The 'a' button is no where near the TAB or ENTER button and I'm not accidentally pressing them. It's driving me crazy and I hope someone can help me fix it as the way this is going, I might have to stop using Firefox which is Not what I want! I have looked online for help but it's hard to find anything like this as I can't even describe the problem?! I went to my google home page, typed this 'firefox presses enter when I type a' to get some help online, but as soon as I typed the last letter 'a', it loaded a page which had nothing to do with what I wrote. Sometimes refreshing the page works than it occurs randomly. I just tried to replicate it but no go. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1441295;,aus-sam

I went to check my email and the layout was totally different and all the messages that were in my inbox and junk folder were gone!!! As a matter of fact, ALL of my saved emails and folders are gone!!! Where did they go? How do I get them back? How do I restore the previous Outlook view? It seems as if every time I get used to a layout you change it. This is a crock!!! I save things, such as emails that are important, and I place them in folders that I have created, so I know where they are and you guys just change it and throw away my folders? How do I go back to the previous version of Firefox? Or, how do I go back to the previous version of outlook so I can get my folders, saved emails, as well as my inbox back? If you are going to do this type of thing then give us the option of retaining our emails and the look and feel that we are used to.
