Now it will cut out after 10 to 60 seconds. the video continues with out problem.  I have re-installed the latest version twice and down restarts and cold boots. Chrome is not exhibiting this behavior when I go the the same sites, ie; MSNBC and CNN. Everytime that micros**t has an update it buggers up my sound. This is the first time I have not been able to fix it. Way to go micros**t. So how to fix or is a code modification needed?

I know I can try and set up a local web server for development but that's beside the point. </p><p>According to this previous Mozilla post linked below I can set privacy.file_unique_origin to false, and it's suppose to override the security setting. This does not work for me, setting it to false and closing all browsers and testing the HTML file again, I still see the CORS error. Is this setting now useless in the newest version of Firefox? Is there a different config setting I need to adjust? </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1264280"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1264280</a> </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",vallamost
