This is not a problem when using chrome/chromium, and my PC is more than powerful enough to handle this, with a rtx 2060 and an i5-10500. On chrome I've watched 4 streams on twitch at once with no issues, but on Firefox it starts becoming choppy with only 2 open. Anyone know how to fix this? I don't really want to use chrome anymore.

Check the New Tab Page to see the change right away and modify the number of rows accordingly if needed. </p><p>Which I technically have yet to change, because I prefer more than the 4 row limit you set.
