In case you install firefox on Windows 7 and your htm, html files are showing blank white icon instead of little foxxy one, all you need to do to go for registry as below: - I am using Firefox v.84, ues problem is there since firefox v.2 - - Type regedit and go for ""HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\FirefoxHTML-308046B0AF4A39CB\DefaultIcon"", perhabs you see a differentt number beside FirefoxHTML or even no number - - Double click on Default key and change the value to ""C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe,1"", not to mention without """" - Don't forget to backup whole your registry before editing it - Restart and you will probably see the Firefox icon on your saved html files </p><p>Good luck </p>",windows-7;desktop;tips;firefox-840;firefox-8402;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",fixxxer_ki

When I access a web site for the first time, Firefox (version 84.0.2 [64-bit] under Windows 10) displays that site's Favicon in Firefox's search history. If the site then changes its Favicon, Firefox does not update its own copy of the site's Favicon and continues displaying the old one. I had a site like this in my search history but I had not bookmarked it. The site changed its Favicon but the icon displayed in Firefox's search history remained unchanged. I later bookmarked the site, thinking that this might inspire Firefox to update the Favicon but it did not; Firefox displays the old Favicon in its bookmarks as well. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,1384674;1384680;,daveziffer

This supposition propmpt me to perform few hardware tests - memory, GPU, audio card,etc. Everything checks out fine with the basic test and diagnostic tools I've used. </p><p>The worse system crashes have happened while on the <a href=""https://buckhill.com/tubing-2/snow-tubing/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://buckhill.com/tubing-2/snow-tubing/</a> wesbite trying to purchase passes. Along the way for signing the waiver, the site brings up a graphical pad for capturing the guest's signature using the mouse. Several attempts have ended with horrendous system crashes (I had to locate the hardware reset button on my system, which took a while), never in the same spot in the process. Similar issues have happened on my wife's laptop (Windows 10 OS) while using Firefox on this site. I had to use a different browser to complete this purchase, for both my kids sanity and my system health. (for whomever is interested in troubleshooting this site, just follow the prompts and add guests - the purchase step is the very last one). </p><p>I should mention that Firefox' own crash page (about:crashes) shows no sign of any crashes. Other times, the Firefox window just dissappears without any warning, and no traces of crash information in Firefox nor OS event system. My system is configured to save a memory minidump in the event of crashes - there were none. </p><p>In this context, I could be wrong, but narrowed the culprit down to Firefox itself. In my opinion, whatever Firefox is doing to bypass OS basic protection mechanisms (and let's be honest - on Windows these can be better) and cause such hard failures are a dangerous vulnerability that should be investigated. </p><p>Any ideas and suggestions on diagnosing this or what to capture for aiding with troubleshooting, are appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;bsod;firefox-840;firefox-8402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1384648;,danluca22

I am using Kaspersky Cloud Security, looking for unusual (hard to really say what that is) network and app activity and making apps ask before running or using the network.  I saw an event reported by K that had a bunch of versions of various browsers, one of which was Safari that I never have used.  I asked them but then realized that was just something that edge or K tacked on to identify somethnig else. </p><p>However, I did notice that Chrome was being used, apparently by edge, as my browser.  My understanding is that chrome is used a lot by hackers for various things.  I'd rather not use it.  That's why I installed Firefox. </p><p>So I did a search of my pc for ""chrome"" and up came the thing in the title of this question:  ChromExtMalware.store.  I was fairly surpised that it would actually be called that.  But I did find by searching the web that it's malware. </p><p>beyond that, several other things came up, chrome.nm-server-v2.manifest.json, same thng without the v2, plugins.chrome.manifest. </p><p>So apparently I not only use edge but chrome. </p><p>Can anyone tell me whether I simply do not understand how this is all structured and its all fairly safe, or, if it lookw like i'm right nd something is fishy, is there reason to imagine that Firefox will make it easier to control these things? </p><p>thanks for taking a moment to look this over.  I really do need some guidance, so if you are willing but you need more info, please reply and request it. </p><p>Note:  The image and issue, if the image uploads, is not on this PC.  It is on my Microsoft Surface.  This machine has problems as well, but I haven't not see that here - yet.
