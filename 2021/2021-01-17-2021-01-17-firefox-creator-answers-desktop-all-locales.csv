I am using Kaspersky Cloud Security, looking for unusual (hard to really say what that is) network and app activity and making apps ask before running or using the network.  I saw an event reported by K that had a bunch of versions of various browsers, one of which was Safari that I never have used.  I asked them but then realized that was just something that edge or K tacked on to identify somethnig else. </p><p>However, I did notice that Chrome was being used, apparently by edge, as my browser.  My understanding is that chrome is used a lot by hackers for various things.  I'd rather not use it.  That's why I installed Firefox. </p><p>So I did a search of my pc for ""chrome"" and up came the thing in the title of this question:  ChromExtMalware.store.  I was fairly surpised that it would actually be called that.  But I did find by searching the web that it's malware. </p><p>beyond that, several other things came up, chrome.nm-server-v2.manifest.json, same thng without the v2, plugins.chrome.manifest. </p><p>So apparently I not only use edge but chrome. </p><p>Can anyone tell me whether I simply do not understand how this is all structured and its all fairly safe, or, if it lookw like i'm right nd something is fishy, is there reason to imagine that Firefox will make it easier to control these things? </p><p>thanks for taking a moment to look this over.  I really do need some guidance, so if you are willing but you need more info, please reply and request it. </p><p>Note:  The image and issue, if the image uploads, is not on this PC.  It is on my Microsoft Surface.  This machine has problems as well, but I haven't not see that here - yet.  So the shared configuration is for this pc. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;firefox-8402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",rabidbilly

A form has been created which needs a date to be entered. The form was created by another person with a drop down calendar or by entering the date using dd/mm/yyyy. When I open the form through Google Drive on my computer using Firefox (my browser of choice)the drop down calendar does not operate and the date is formatted MM/DD/YYYY. Through ""Options"" on the home page the language is set to English (Great Britain) and the date is said to be taken from my Windows settings. My Windows settings for the date formatting are correct at dd/mm/yyyy. If I change browsers to Chrome the form is accessible with its correct formatting. Your assistance would be appreciated </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",eric.detheridge44

Knowing that all cookies will be blocked I logged into office 365 and allowed manually cookies through ""view page info"" I then selected ""set cookies""  to allow expecting full access to office 365 mail, but this did not occur. What happened is I logged into office 365 and could see the icons and my login name but could not read the mail. </p><p>Office 365 gave the message ""we couldn't sign you in please try again"" yet I could see my log in name and the office 365 icons for mail, calendar etc.. just not the actual data. If I allow cookies in Browser privacy (which i take it allows cookies always) it woks. </p><p>I bring this up because it seems like something is missing in cookies that is not represented in FF.What is the difference between browser privacy cookies and allowing it through view page permissions?

I have run the Ookla speed test through Edge and my download is 212.94 Mbps and my upload is 11.76 Mbps and uses the Spectrum Syracuse Server.  Running Spectrum speed test on Edge registers Spectrum Syracuse as the optimum server and download is 236.2 and upload 11.6.  Both are using my Spectrum server in Syracuse, NY. </p><p>When I run Ookla through Firefox I got 227.17 down and 11.63 up.  Spectrum's speed test through Firerefox's Syracuse server 231.8 up and 11.5 down. </p><p>However for a while earler this evening when I ran both programs on both browsers and both through Syracuse's servers I was getting downs of 0.0 to 0.7.  I reset the modem and router and still had low speeds but shortly after I got the readings I wrote in the first two paragraphs. </p><p>What would be the reason for this?  Anything particular with Firefox?  Something I should look out for in the future?  Partially a curiosity while the other part being proactive. </p><p>Thanks for anybody who can take time to answer. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;firefox-8402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",figureguy1

I do get the prompt about 'would you like to open this container in [wrong container]' and I click the option not to do so while also having checked the box that says to remember this decision, but the check box seems to do nothing.  I've checked the box countless times to no effect.  I seem to have permanently created this state which is highly frustrating.  I don't want this site opened in any container.

Where is the list of websites per container stored?  Is this somewhere in the about:config or in a raw, human-readable file on my filesystem somewhere?
