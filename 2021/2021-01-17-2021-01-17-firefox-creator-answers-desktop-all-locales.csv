There have been many companies that are trying to achieve that but they lack something that the Mozilla Foundation has (to some point) and that's Trust from their customers. Also i don't see how Mozilla will survive in the future without providing future-proof services. Another thing is that in 2021 i really find it weird that there's not an easy way (off the social network) to contact Mozilla if someone has a new idea about their services (even if its stupid).  </p><p>Anyways thanks for your time </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",superjohnv

This supposition propmpt me to perform few hardware tests - memory, GPU, audio card,etc. Everything checks out fine with the basic test and diagnostic tools I've used. </p><p>The worse system crashes have happened while on the <a href=""https://buckhill.com/tubing-2/snow-tubing/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://buckhill.com/tubing-2/snow-tubing/</a> wesbite trying to purchase passes. Along the way for signing the waiver, the site brings up a graphical pad for capturing the guest's signature using the mouse. Several attempts have ended with horrendous system crashes (I had to locate the hardware reset button on my system, which took a while), never in the same spot in the process. Similar issues have happened on my wife's laptop (Windows 10 OS) while using Firefox on this site. I had to use a different browser to complete this purchase, for both my kids sanity and my system health. (for whomever is interested in troubleshooting this site, just follow the prompts and add guests - the purchase step is the very last one). </p><p>I should mention that Firefox' own crash page (about:crashes) shows no sign of any crashes. Other times, the Firefox window just dissappears without any warning, and no traces of crash information in Firefox nor OS event system. My system is configured to save a memory minidump in the event of crashes - there were none. </p><p>In this context, I could be wrong, but narrowed the culprit down to Firefox itself. In my opinion, whatever Firefox is doing to bypass OS basic protection mechanisms (and let's be honest - on Windows these can be better) and cause such hard failures are a dangerous vulnerability that should be investigated. </p><p>Any ideas and suggestions on diagnosing this or what to capture for aiding with troubleshooting, are appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;bsod;firefox-840;firefox-8402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1384648;,danluca22
