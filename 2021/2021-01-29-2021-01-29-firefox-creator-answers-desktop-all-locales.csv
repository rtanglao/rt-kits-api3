Until the upgrade to Firefox 85, I could use Keepass2 to open websites requiring login names and passwords.  Now (most of the time) Keepass2 is not opening the websites I need to go to.  I think something happened when you put in the option to use Firefox 85 to import or use the Keepass2 data base to maintain maintain login names and passwords in Firefox 85.  Please check on this and let me know what the problem is and if I need to do something in either Keepass2 or Firefox 85 to fix this.  I want to continue using Keepass2 to enter login names and passwords and not have them remembered by Firefox 85. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;firefox-8401;,firefox,other,en-US,"",judynjima

I have two firefox computers and syncing is active. </p><p>I am trying to restore a previous version of my bookmarks (using the bookmarks library, Import and backup menu, restore function).  My problem is that at one of the following sync (ie within usually a couple of hours max) the previous set of bookmarks is systematically restored by sync. </p><p>I have un-registered / re-registered both computers, tried to use a different backups (from recent history or from a file export), tried to run sync immediately after the restore... nothing helps. </p><p>I activated log on success for sync. Apparently the restore is just ignored as I get this: <em> </em> Sync.Engine.Bookmarks.BookmarkSyncUtils	DEBUG	pushChanges: Processed change records: {""weak"":0,""skipped"":0,""updated"":0} <em> </em> and later, suddenly the browser realises that lots of bookmarks are missing and cancels all the changes: "" Sync.Engine.Bookmarks.BookmarkSyncUtils	DEBUG	pushChanges: Processed change records: {""weak"":0,""skipped"":0,""updated"":4764} "" </p><p>Has anyone faced the same issue? Is there a way to force a unidirectional push from the browser to the server? Thanks </p><p>PS: FF 85, one on Win10 and the other on MacOS Big Sur. Same behaviour on both machines. PPS: The machines are in two different locations. It is impossible for me to force the change simultaneously on both computers. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;syncerr;bookmarkrestore;firefox-850;,firefox,sync,en-US,1387858;,alex.v

Then I noticed that when I print Emails the sender and subject are blocked out by what looks like a bar code.  I disabled all add-ons but nothing made a difference.  When using the other browser, Safari, which I don't want to use since Apple stopped supporting this OS it doesn't happen and every Email prints out just fine.  Also, if I print with a screen shot the bar code doesn't appear.  I am a very low level user and any help would be appreciated.
