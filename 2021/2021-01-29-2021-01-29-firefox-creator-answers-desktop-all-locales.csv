Problem: Firefox uses 500MB memory with 0 tab, uses more with more tabs This is not a question raised by computer noobs but i am sure that something goes wrong in my computer. I asked my friends and their firefox uses 200MB with 1 tab This is very strange. I would provide all debug information if you need. The picture provided is captured after clicking ""minimize memory usage"" on about:memory </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1387809;1387810;,123erichappy123

I cannot imagine there is a need for this upgrade frequency and cost of effort.   I am left with the idea that you use this as a free method of awareness building and advertisement.

I created a firefox account in firefox browser in Windows first, and imported bookmarks, etc., from my chrome browser. Next I installed firefox in my Ubuntu OS, and it worked fine, the account can be logged-on and everything was synced. </p><p>I get the problem when I install firefox on my Mac. I installed the same firefox browser version as I installed on my Windows, except that it was for the Mac. I tried to log-on with the account before, but it asked me to create a new account, even if I use the same email address to register my firefox account before on Windows. So, do firefox use the same account on Windows and Mac? Is there a fix to this problem? </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,sync,en-US,1387796;,yangyi0318
