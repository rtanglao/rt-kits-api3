Windows 10,"<p>Summary: On windows 10, getting error messages on websites including big names like <a href=""http://logitech.com"" rel=""nofollow"">logitech.com</a> after firefox updates from 84.0 to 85.0.  Reinstall of 84.0 and sites work again.  Other major browsers also work fine. </p><p>Specific error message is:   Secure Connection Failed"" ""An error occurred during a connection to ***websitehere***.  PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR.""  ""The page you are trying to view cannot be shown because the authenticity of the received data could not be verified."" </p><p>Troubleshooting: - I did an uninstall on the machine and deleted all mozilla folders from program files / app data followed by a fresh install of firefox 85.0 on machine, didn't help. - I uninstalled firefox again and wiped folders then installed 84.0 and turned off updates.  All websites work fine.  After auto update to 85.0, sites don't work again. - Cleared cache/history/etc and even created a new profile.  Nothing helps. - Doesn't happen on all machines I don't think but is starting to appear on several and that number has been increasing over the last 2 days.  I haven't looked to see if I could find someone's machine that has 85.0 and is working besides mine yet. </p><p>Side note: - I received a replacement laptop on Wednesday for work and did all windows updates prior to installing any programs, domain join, etc.  As part of the program loadout I install, firefox is included in that list.  I installed 85 available from the website and <a href=""http://logitech.com"" rel=""nofollow"">logitech.com</a> works fine. </p><p>Ending comment: - Appears to be some kind of issue that happens right after firefox does it's update and whatever the root cause is sticks behind after an uninstall and deletion of all the folders.  Maybe something in the registry? </p><p>With how many computers this is starting to show up on now, it would appear that this should be noticed by others and I wanted to reach out and make sure Mozilla is aware. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",bcook6

I can only think this has driven less avid users to decline interaction with firefox, basically driving them to other browsers or means instead of persisting with firefox. You've launched an older version of firefox is the most notorious pop-ups that has ever been delivered from firefox. the message goes on to read: </p><p>Using an older version of Firefox can corrupt bookmarks and browsing history already saved to an existing Firefox profile. To protect your information, create a new profile for this installation of firefox. </p><p>Most every time I open a file by this means it is through the file local system clicking on an html file and other times it occurs from an application on this computer directing me to a site where I should obtain specific information. I want you to remember that every time we save a pages those saves are in the file/folder combination of html that reside to on the computer; and, every time we wish to open one of these we are addressed with this less than ideal situation. </p><p>This advice has several deficiencies. First off as I see is that instead of offering a means to update the current version of firefox the user is given no alternative except to 'create a new profile'. How can this be a better alternative than an update? </p><p>Frustration that derive from this interaction is: </p><p>one, when I open a file I usually would like it opened in a specific profile so that all the data becomes associated with that profile </p><p>two, not only the time it takes to create a new profile and the lapse in an uninterrupted thought process but what to do with all the one-off profiles that are created in order to handle this particular situation. Further, every time a user wishes to open a file of this nature there is never an alternative means to tackle this reoccurring problem. For years it has been the same end-run-about. </p><p>In addition, this dialog seems flawed as we can always open the file with right-click file and select 'open with' through the file system in which the html file reside on the computer; but not when directly clicked on. If you try to search and read for the accepted answer to this issue you will find the answer is a bit more complicated than the average user will endeavor to install. More, I have seen that I can open the browser through the profile dialog box and never is it more than one version off yet I still have to deal with the frustrating pop-up. </p><p>Can we get an update button on the 'You've launched an older version of firefox' dialog box? </p><p>Thanks in advance!

This is placed on the Tool Bar where its easy for a user to use. Until now, its been working perfectly but with this latest update to FireFox we are seeing the pop-up blocking being activated with the yellow message bar at the top.  Now this would be ok if we only had to allow the pop up once (by clicking allow site), but unfortunately the bookmarket button has to be able to work on all sites, which is the whole point of the button. So its impractical to keep allowing it every time its used. Disabling the pop-up blocker completely then works, but then the browser is open to other pop-ups. Is there any way to allow bookmarklets to display a pop up and not display a pop-up message? Without having to disable the entire pop-up functionality. Can the FF developers allow for user placed bookmarklets to not be pop-up blocked. Maybe an exception added for that. They are placed manually by the user so are allowed by the user only. </p><p>Thanks for reading.
