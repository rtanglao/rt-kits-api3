This is placed on the Tool Bar where its easy for a user to use. Until now, its been working perfectly but with this latest update to FireFox we are seeing the pop-up blocking being activated with the yellow message bar at the top.  Now this would be ok if we only had to allow the pop up once (by clicking allow site), but unfortunately the bookmarket button has to be able to work on all sites, which is the whole point of the button. So its impractical to keep allowing it every time its used. Disabling the pop-up blocker completely then works, but then the browser is open to other pop-ups. Is there any way to allow bookmarklets to display a pop up and not display a pop-up message? Without having to disable the entire pop-up functionality. Can the FF developers allow for user placed bookmarklets to not be pop-up blocked. Maybe an exception added for that. They are placed manually by the user so are allowed by the user only. </p><p>Thanks for reading.

Then I noticed that when I print Emails the sender and subject are blocked out by what looks like a bar code.  I disabled all add-ons but nothing made a difference.  When using the other browser, Safari, which I don't want to use since Apple stopped supporting this OS it doesn't happen and every Email prints out just fine.  Also, if I print with a screen shot the bar code doesn't appear.  I am a very low level user and any help would be appreciated.
