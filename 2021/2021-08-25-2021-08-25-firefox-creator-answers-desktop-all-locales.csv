I shut down my computer, started it up again and now I can't open Firefox. I can't run it as an administrator, I can't open it in safe Mode, I can't access the Profile Manager. When I open the task manager, the process appears and then immediately disappears. </p><p>So far I've tried the following: </p><p>1. Updating 2. Unistalling / Reinstalling 3. Deleting Profiles manually 4. Disabling Hardware acceleration (In Windows 10 Safe Mode) 5. Installing a Previous version. </p><p>This is a massive dissapointment for me, I really liked using the browser and it looks like I'll have to uninstall it indefinitely. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",sigmund_psi
