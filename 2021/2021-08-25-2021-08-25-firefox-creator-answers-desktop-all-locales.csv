It have always had a GOOGLE search bar in the center of the screen and it has worked correctly - now whenever i try to input words into the GOOGLE search bar located in the center of the screen it defaults and jumps to the URL/Web Address Bar at the near top off the screen - this jump to the address bar is VERY distracting and inconvenient! How can I revert to using ONLY the search bar in the center of the screen? I have worked on this for two solid days and none of the recommended fixes have worked. I have uninstalled and reinstalled Google and Firefox numerous times but now it always defaults any Google search to the address bar! THIS MUST STOP!!! Thanks!!! Sincerely!!! </p>,windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ekbass

I shut down my computer, started it up again and now I can't open Firefox. I can't run it as an administrator, I can't open it in safe Mode, I can't access the Profile Manager. When I open the task manager, the process appears and then immediately disappears. </p><p>So far I've tried the following: </p><p>1. Updating 2. Unistalling / Reinstalling 3. Deleting Profiles manually 4. Disabling Hardware acceleration (In Windows 10 Safe Mode) 5. Installing a Previous version. </p><p>This is a massive dissapointment for me, I really liked using the browser and it looks like I'll have to uninstall it indefinitely. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1438008;1438015;1438034;1438045;,sigmund_psi
