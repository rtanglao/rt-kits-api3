It have always had a GOOGLE search bar in the center of the screen and it has worked correctly - now whenever i try to input words into the GOOGLE search bar located in the center of the screen it defaults and jumps to the URL/Web Address Bar at the near top off the screen - this jump to the address bar is VERY distracting and inconvenient! How can I revert to using ONLY the search bar in the center of the screen? I have worked on this for two solid days and none of the recommended fixes have worked. I have uninstalled and reinstalled Google and Firefox numerous times but now it always defaults any Google search to the address bar! THIS MUST STOP!!! Thanks!!!
