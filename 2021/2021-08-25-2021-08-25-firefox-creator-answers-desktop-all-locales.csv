I posted in an incorrect thread. Luckily jscher2000 answered my problem when directing me here to a new thread.  My display had changed to a pop-up display. He suggested I try F11 and hey prestos! I now have a (slightly modified) standard screen display with all functions restored. </p><p>Many thanks Mr jscher2000! </p>,desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",jcpettit

I'm trying to setup my RSS reader on work pc, which is running Windows 10. The task is to open the URL with automatic reader mode enabled.  On my laptop (Ubuntu) I've made it with command 'firefox about:reader?url=%s'. But on Win10 I cannot find CLI options for that. RSS reader gives me the input field to specify the path to firefox.exe, and I wonder if I can use options there. Screenshot's attached below. I've tried to search CLI options on that site, but cannot find that article. Old link (<a href=""https://www-archive.mozilla.org/docs/command-line-args"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www-archive.mozilla.org/docs/command-line-args</a>) haven't got 'reader view' option on it, either. Is there a way to do what I want? Thanks for your help! </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",kemechedzhiev

I must admit, I haven't confirmed this yet as I've only just finished reading it. I believe the user.js could not lock settings anyway? </p><p>I do have about 80-100 settings that I want to integrate. I can't simply replace their prefs.js because they will have undoubtedly set some preferences for themselves, which we do not forbid (yet). </p><p>So, without wiping out any preferences users may have set for themselves, how can I integrate the settings I need, assuming the GPO doesn't cover every conceivable preference? </p><p>disclaimer: Yes, I realize it is possible that some of the settings I'm going to integrate *might* conflict with preferences they've set for themselves. That will be dealt with internally by policy communications. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",citizen1138x

It have always had a GOOGLE search bar in the center of the screen and it has worked correctly - now whenever i try to input words into the GOOGLE search bar located in the center of the screen it defaults and jumps to the URL/Web Address Bar at the near top off the screen - this jump to the address bar is VERY distracting and inconvenient! How can I revert to using ONLY the search bar in the center of the screen? I have worked on this for two solid days and none of the recommended fixes have worked. I have uninstalled and reinstalled Google and Firefox numerous times but now it always defaults any Google search to the address bar! THIS MUST STOP!!! Thanks!!!
