I got hold of another computer recently, and I just installed Manjaro Gnome on it as well. I started Firefox, and suddenly I see a UI change, which I don't think is an update, but who knows. In this version of firefox the search bar (along with the new tab, refresh, pocket, etc buttons) are abobe the tab list (which spans the full width). You can see it here <a href=""https://imgur.com/a/idqp5jb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://imgur.com/a/idqp5jb</a> </p><p>Moreover, i tried changing themes via the Add-ons Manager and they can't be applied.   </p><p>When using the Troubleshooting mode, Firefox is back to normal!

The addon changed FF's window close button behaviour so that when pressing the window close button only the current tab was closed. This was very convenient and fast way to close a tab because it did not require careful mouse aiming (when window is maximized) or keyboard shortcut. Just move mouse pointer to top right corner of the screen and click. </p><p>My understanding is that it is not possible to do similar addons anymore. But I was wondering is it possible to get similar behaviour by using firefox autoconfig file? </p><p>There are two events that I have found: - quit-application-requested - browser-lastwindow-close-requested </p><p>I don't know which one is the correct one and how to change it's behaviour. </p><p>I guess I must use Services.obs.removeObserver method but no idea how. </p>,desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",phunkiesoul

I have already followed solutions in similar problems like this (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1310742"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1310742</a>), which did not work. First I used shadowexplorer to recover sessionstorebackup files from a restore point on 10/15, most of which did not seem to open anything when using them with the scrounger tool. One of them did open, however it only showed 2 tabs when I would have had hundreds. None of these files did anything when I renamed them to sessionstore.jsonlz4 and placed them in the appropriate folder, even if I deleted the original sessionstore file. Firefox also seemed to be able to recover tabs which I opened after the loss of the original tabs, and renaming and replacing of the sessionstore file until I tried deleting the entire sessionstore backups folder. </p><p>I also tried simply doing a system restore back to 10/15, which also failed to help. After doing a system restore, I also tried the whole process of recovering sessionstore backup files and replacing them again, however nothing changed again. I also tried recovering the sessionstore.jsonlz4 file directly and using that to replace my current sessionstore.jsonlz4 file, but that also did not work. The replacement files do seem to contain tabs, as most of them are around a couple MBs large, but after I place them in and restart firefox they get reduced in size back to almost nothing. </p><p>The only thing I have not tried is using files from an even older restore point on 10/12, although after having restored to the 10/15 point my 10/12 restore point seems to have disappeared. I can try undoing the restore in order to try to view the 10/12 restore point again, but this process takes multiple hours and I would rather not. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1452371;1452376;1452379;1452380;,andrewln627
