The right-click menu and the 3-bar menu often fail to work on the first few tries, but eventually open. (And in the case of the 3-bar menu, it often opens without certain options, like ""Settings,"" ""More tools,"" and ""Help,"" though these usually appear after waiting a few seconds.) Other menus, like drop-down menus on website or several pop-ups for addons, don't work at all, no matter how many times I try. </p><p>The issue isn't solved by starting in Troubleshooting mode (insofar as they can be reproduced -- some things, like the add-on popups, can't be since the add-ons are disabled) or by clearing the cache. </p><p>I'm running Firefox Nightly 95.0a1 (2021-10-06) (64-bit) on Arch Linux, though the same issue seems to affect Firefox 93.0. </p><p>Thanks very much in advance for any help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",raghav1

Sul mio PC Windows 10 Pro ho installato il lettore contactless USB2 ""OMNIKEY 5022 CL"", il software di gestione della CIE ""CIE-Middleware_1.4.1.0.exe"" ed eseguito il ""primo accesso"" (quello che richiede l'intero PIN di 8 cifre); inoltre nella ""gestione dispositivi"" di Firefox ho caricato la CIEPKI.dll. Firefox (93.0 64bit), nelle impostazioni, dopo aver appoggiato la card e digitato il PIN, mostra il certificato della CIE e nei ""dispositivi"" indica il lettore connesso. Però, quando accedo ai siti della PP.AA. o all'I.N.P.S. o ad ARUBA (per attivare SPID), anche dopo aver disattivato antivirus e firewall, mi viene segnalata l'impossibilità a proseguire: in particolare il sito di ARUBA dice chiaramente che non riesce a leggere la smart card. Devo segnalare che ho anche un altro lettore, solo a contatto, incluso nel PC e dunque non facilmente rimovibile per eventuali prove. Qualcuno mi sa dire se devo modificare delle impostazioni del browser o c'è qualcosa da aggiornare/aggiungere al S.O.? Moltissime grazie in anticipo e cordiali saluti.

One of them did open, however it only showed 2 tabs when I would have had hundreds. None of these files did anything when I renamed them to sessionstore.jsonlz4 and placed them in the appropriate folder, even if I deleted the original sessionstore file. Firefox also seemed to be able to recover tabs which I opened after the loss of the original tabs, and renaming and replacing of the sessionstore file until I tried deleting the entire sessionstore backups folder. </p><p>I also tried simply doing a system restore back to 10/15, which also failed to help. After doing a system restore, I also tried the whole process of recovering sessionstore backup files and replacing them again, however nothing changed again. I also tried recovering the sessionstore.jsonlz4 file directly and using that to replace my current sessionstore.jsonlz4 file, but that also did not work. The replacement files do seem to contain tabs, as most of them are around a couple MBs large, but after I place them in and restart firefox they get reduced in size back to almost nothing. </p><p>The only thing I have not tried is using files from an even older restore point on 10/12, although after having restored to the 10/15 point my 10/12 restore point seems to have disappeared.
