I have wasted hours on this to no avail. I export...and when I look for the file it is nowhere to be found. I tried exporting it to several disks and it simply does not disappear. This has never been a problem before, and it is discouraging me from returning to Firefox. How absolutely devilishly frustrating. Can anyone help?
