Ive been using G-mail as the primary email website for bothe the accounts. since Google chrome is lagging my system, i decides to use both the accounts in firefox. But firefox isn't allowing me to easily swith between two accounts without typing the password. also i would like to sign in my gmail in each account without typing the password. What i mean to say is, when I switch to my persoanl account, when i open G-mail, i want all the mails related to my personal account. and whenever i switch to my university account, i want all the mails related to university. with out separately signing in. but here whenever i open gmail via my university account, here all i recive are my personal mails and i dont want that. also the bookmarks which i have saved in my personal account, i dont want that to appear in whenever i swtch to my university account. also the saved password must belong to its account and shouldnever be merged. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,sync,en-US,1458436;,sreehari852002

The problem is that every time I tried to sign in Metamask is not recognizing the password ( I'm 100% secure it's the right one) and I'm forced to remove the MM extension and re-install again Metamask from the seed phrase, what it's not normal and it's very dangerous because I had to expose the seed words every time to sing in in MM. With others Browsers this is not happening. I will appreciate your help in this matter </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1458302;,geoconstrumex
