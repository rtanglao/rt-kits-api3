However, I have been observing Firefox download behavior and I am pretty sure Firefox would download as much of the file to system drive as possible, until the system drive is full, then moving onto the destination drive, which has been a huge inconvenience, because of the huge video files that I am dealing with. </p><p>I have already cleared the file and the .part in the destination drive, but failed to locate the rest of the temp file in my system drive.

I also have Malwarebytes and Avast Premium Antivirus running together.  My last Windows update was about two weeks ago (11 Nov 2021).  My Firefox browser is currently 94.0.2. </p><p>I have noticed this four times.  I typically browse Reddit but sometimes it's with Youtube.  This is normally the scenario:  1)  Launch browser; 2) navigate to website; 3) keep tab open for several hours and in many cases my laptop will go to sleep at least once; 4) at some point after waking up PC, logging in then continuing to browse, a warning banner in Firefox will tell me ""This website is slowing your browser down.  Stop it?"", but if I wait at least 5 seconds it will automatically clear; 5) launch Task Manager - which is not easy because of what is going on but after 30-60 seconds it will appear; 6) notice that memory usage is extremely high and most processes are coming to a halt; 7) close Firefox and thing return to normal after 30-45 seconds.  I've attached some before and after screenshots.  The ""before"" is after browsing Reddit for about 3 hours and my laptop went to sleep twice; the ""after"" is when Firefox was closed (two tabs were open - one Reddit, the other Youtube) and then waiting about 30 seconds.  Firefox instances take a little time to disappear from Task Manager, apparently. </p><p>Lots of variables to consider here:  Latest antivirus program not working well?  Extensions?  (I have three extensions - Adblock Plus, Privacy Badger and Ecosia Search)  Perhaps Firefox itself?  Motherboard/DIMMs that is/are overdue for the landfill?  Windows sucks? (rhetorical). </p><p>I guess I am not really looking for help but instead just want to log this as a heads-up to anyone who is encountering the same problem under the same conditions.  I will continue experimenting with refreshing my instance of Firefox and possibly turning off browsers/antivirus components in a selective manner to see if it makes any difference.  There is also the possibility that a Windows Update has broken something so maybe a restore point is in order here. </p><p>Thanks again for offering such a great product. </p><p>- Ngo </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-81;firefox-940;firefox-9402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1462527;1462537;,ngowun

Nothing. </p><p>If anyone at Firefox would care to explain the secret, I would appreciate it so I can stop wasting time searching this solution. </p><p>Don't use euphemisms like some instructions do which only confuse simple answers.
