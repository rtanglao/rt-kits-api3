Nothing. All I want to do is switch my sign in accounts. I have two. Firefox confirms this. When I go into Accounts, following existing procedures to establish a second sign in, I type in second email with response telling me this account already exists. I know that. I can even see it in the Passwords/Accounts section. </p><p>But nothing, nothing appears anywhere telling me how I can simply switch from existing sign in to the other. Nothing. </p><p>If anyone at Firefox would care to explain the secret, I would appreciate it so I can stop wasting time searching this solution. </p><p>Don't use euphemisms like some instructions do which only confuse simple answers. Please simply state Step 1, Step 2 etc </p><p>One such support page said something like select one account and click ""Preferred"" or the like. Saw nothing like this in my Account settings. </p><p>thanks Larry </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,"",smithl
