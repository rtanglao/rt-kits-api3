Mainly that was because I do not see any other way to log into another mac system without it.  I can sync an ios device with the qr code scan but not another mac system. </p><p>So from the account profile I went to Change Password and changed the password to some new securely generated password. </p><p>Now in my saved passwords, I see that the new password is saved for ""(no username)"" account and the old password is still there for my user name.   </p><p>But when I try to log into FF browser on another mac system with my user name, neither password works.  They are both ""incorrect"". </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-940;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",lk6
