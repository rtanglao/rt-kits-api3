I've never had trouble using these services before. Since the update on September 7, I've been unable to work normally in MemoQWeb. When I open up a file and start translating, the workspace repeatedly reloads (every few minutes) as if I'd just opened the file. Every time this happens, it boots me back up to the first segment in the file and loses any unconfirmed input I'd been in the process of typing into the open segment at the moment of reloading. I don't have this problem in Edge (I checked), but Edge is my emergency fallback browser and isn't set up with useful translation add-ons like my Firefox account. This is slowing down my workflow a lot, and I would deeply appreciate help getting it resolved. &lt;3 </p><p><a href=""https://fuji.memoq.com/sunflare/webpm/webtrans/online-tasks/ongoing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fuji.memoq.com/sunflare/webpm/webtrans/online-tasks/ongoing</a> </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",tobuishi

For two days now, however, I have been having issues with the spacing within words. It looks like there is an extra space between the letter M while other letters tend to look pushed closer together. Thinking that I accidentally hit the space bar twice I tried to delete it, but instead it deleted the entire letter. I checked the rest of my Documents and had to realize that almost all of them are affected. </p><p>Firefox tells me it's up to date (Version 92; when I click on Help → About Firefox it tells me there are no new updates) as is my operating system (Windows 10). I deleted every browser extension I had, cleared the cache and cookies in Firefox, and restarted my laptop, but this didn't fix the spacing issue portrayed in the images below. The line spacing has been at 1.15 and the Document has been aligned left before and after this happened, so I've ruled that out as causes as well. Changing the font to another and back did not help either. </p><p>This issue does not appear in browsers such as Microsoft Edge and Chrome. </p><p>I reached out to the Google Docs support community (<a href=""https://support.google.com/docs/thread/127217355/documents-have-sudden-spacing-issue-between-letters?hl=en"" rel=""nofollow"">link to the thread here</a>) thinking it was an issue with the website itself. The people giving advice in this thread suggested that Firefox is having rendering issues since it only occurs in (my) Firefox browser and that I contact a Firefox forum, so here I am. </p><p>If anyone has advice on how I could fix this or who else I should contact, I'd be more than happy to hear it! </p><p>Diana </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,websites,en-US,1445781;,immortalskeleton13

Por exemplo, um deles é o duckduckgo, inclusive como opção de pesquisa no meu firefox. Eu já procurei exaustivamente mas não consigo identificar o erro para além disso. Só para passar por algumas das soluções comuns que não funcionaram: </p><p>- Não estou usando proxy - Já tentei com e sem extensões - Já ativei e desativei DNS over HTTPS - Já mudei meus servidores de DNS - Horário do computador está ok - Já tentei com outro perfil do firefox - Firefox tem permissão de firewall - Tentar em outra rede </p><p>Única coisa que parece funcionar é fazer flush de ip pelo prompt de comando e reiniciar o sistema, porém preciso fazer isso de 20 em 20 minutos, porque resolve por pouco tempo antes de dar o erro novamente. Quando ele começa a funcionar, o navegador está reconhecendo o certificado, com identificação de proprietário e homologação, até espontaneamente não reconhecer mais. </p><p>Eu creio ser alguma configuração no computador pós-formatado, pois este erro também acontece no Opera, porém não no Edge.
