Clicking on the star icon (it's red in my browser, not blue) does absolutely nothing. </p><p>But typing Ctrl+D or clicking on the empty star icon in an un-bookmarked page DOES save the URL, but I don't get a chance to choose the location of the new bookmark. Because the dialog box no longer appears, FF automatically places it into one of my existing bookmark folders. The only way I can manipulate bookmarks is to select ""Manage Bookmarks"" and manually cut-n-paste inside the Library window. </p><p>I ran FF in troubleshooting mode, but I got the same results. </p><p>My ""about:config"" says that ""browser.bookmarks.editDialog.showForNewBookmarks"" is set to true. </p><p>When I first started saving bookmarks in a fresh version of FF 92.0, the dialog box that allowed me to choose the location always came up, but at some point, it stopped appearing. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;firefox-920;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",rbudd

(The Hill, <a href=""https://thehill.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://thehill.com</a>, is particularly annoying with this.) However, I need to see content that some other sites embed in JWPlayer, so I can't use the nuclear option of blocking the cdn for jwplayer in my hosts file. </p><p>Are there any settings or add-ons available that allow by-domain blocking of JWPlayer? (I don't care if it's a ""whitelist"" or ""blacklist"" approach, so long as I can manually determine which sites play and which don't.) </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Jaws13

If I change it to remove the `Consolas,Liberation Mono,` it gets fixed, but when `Liberation Mono` is installed+highlighted and I only remove `Consolas,` it doesn't work til I remove `Liberation Mono,` as well. Note that both `Consolas` and `Liberation Mono` resolve to ""Noto Sans Mono"" ""Regular"" in fc-match, which is my default monospace font. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-920;,firefox,other,en-US,"",coolreader18
