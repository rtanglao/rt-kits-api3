Apareceu uma caixa de texto, após abrir pela quarta vez, falando que as extensões podiam estar causando isso e que eu deveria abrir o navegador em modo de segurança. Tinha duas opções na caixa, abrir e restaurar, eu cliquei em abrir pensando que iria abrir no modo de segurança, mas na real, todas as minhas extensões abriram junto, foi uma sessão normal, mas pra minha surpresa e tristeza as abas não restauraram. Fui no menu do histórico pra tentar abrir manualmente temendo o pior, e o pior aconteceu, não tinha nada selecionável, o Firefox entendeu como se não existisse sessão anterior, apesar das configurações não terem sido alteradas e o histórico estar todo memorizado. </p><p>Existe um jeito de recuperar essas abas? Eram cerca de 2500, poxa, fiz questão de organizar tudo, tinha material de estudo de múltiplas matérias, todas em em ordem de prioridade, mangas organizados por gênero e em ordem de preferência, vídeos aleatórios do Youtube que deixei pra ver depois, também em ordem de preferência, games pra baixar que deram um trabalhão pra achar, e outras coisas. </p><p>Em fim, existe alguma forma de recuperar essa sessão?
