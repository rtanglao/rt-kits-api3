File damaged!,"<p>Almost 4-5 months I can't download anything with suspicious code inside (repack or keygen, or test compiled file, 4ex. from Github) cause FF defense blocks it every time even when it's disabled! And even when I manually allow to download this zipped file, I get an error message of damaged archive file format!  FF crashes and damages my files!!! (Don't try to point on my other defense software - I don't use it and everything is disabled, and other browsers works good). This is very important bug for me, so I already think to change and migrate to Opera or another browser. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",MikeVaghur

As example I create my default exts mode (ublock, firefox notes, multi-account containers), but also time by time I save webpages by SingleFile extension, also I use proxy extensions so I create list for it. Lists may be as additional (default + proxy) as independent from scratch (proxy only). </li></ul> <p>Why?
