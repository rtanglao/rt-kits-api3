(The problem occurred in the Devloper Edition of version 89, and version 89 was released to regular Firefox without a solution. When I start playing a video in Google Drive, it plays fine for the first few minutes, but then suddenly the video stops and the video screen goes black, and there is no response when I press the play button. The only solution to this is to reload the web page, but this is very inconvenient as the video stops in the middle and when you reload again it starts playing from the beginning. </p><p>Sorry for my bad english. Thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",toride531

Whether using natural or lightbulbs or fireflies. </p><p>It also threw out most of the screen/toolbar settings! </p><p>This ""upgrade"" is going to drive me away from FF asap because neither of us can no longer read the screen!!!  </p><p>Its the lack of contrast.  It's the new, much smaller, default font size.  And lack of demarcation to the tabs as they align with one another side by side.  Like a snow-blind whiteout. </p><p>It also threw out most of the toolbar itself and altered many of the FF ""setting"" selections that were previously our defaults or elections. </p><p>These are basic attributes which the ""upgrade"" to  FF has just unilaterally changed. </p><p>Now, as the user I have to 1)  seek out and 2) comprehend more complex instructions like ""about: config"" and jockey between that and M'soft windows settings???  And then hope I get it right????    </p><p>FYI I did try via another user-help response. Some relief there with font size, but it looks like a fun house mirror w/ weird size toolbar and onscreen font size.   And  it took me an hour and alot of holding my breath to see if I got it jiggered okay.  </p><p>Or seek out and try out any number of color font/screen themes which might work well??-- if I were my grandkids gaming all night under the bedcovers.   </p><p>Folks have graciously put in the time, effort and creativity to make various pretty and graphically appealing themes. Scrolled through pages and pages and have loaded over a dozen try-outs, but unusable/impractical.  </p><pre>I am not a expert user, dont want to become one, and if FF goes the way of the buffalo and the ""vcr"" programming  (haha!) then so be it. </pre> <p>However, you have always had a great product, and we want you to continue to be successful!! </p><p>Why oh why is it fouled up so badly?? Please don't make me switch to gawd-awful Edge or other browser after being a loyal FF user for years! </p><p>I had to reconfigure the entire toolbar setup this afternoon so less- computer-capable, and more importantly less visually-able spouse could use his few desired websites.  Wasted valuable hours on unnecessary and exhausting task.  </p><p>Am going to attempt the revert to older version of FF as stated in another thread just so I can get back to work and keep my visually and computer challenged spouse happy! </p><p>Rarely write in to help sheets, forums or social sites, but this absolutely must be addressed! </p><p>FF staff PLEASE fix or at least make the former version more obviously, and readily available!! </p><p>Sincerely, loyal users </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",kootiekat
