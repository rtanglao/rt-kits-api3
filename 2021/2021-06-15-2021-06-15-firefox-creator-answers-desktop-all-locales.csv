Youtube and streaming video sites stutter so badly that I'm lucky to get 2-3 frames per minute even if the audio holds up. firefox-89 is also slow on other fronts, no, excuse me, it's DEAD slow on all fronts. </p><p>I have a large number of windows and tabs and cutting that number by 25 to 30% has no noticable effect. </p><p>After searching for solutions, the top suggestion was to disable ""proton"", but no that had only a tiny effect. </p><p>What are the mozilla people thinking? My guess is that they are not thinking. </p><p>Another worthy question is, how did this awful piece of software get distributed by the fedora project. </p><p>Look, I've been using mostly firefox since it's beginning, but come on, this is ridiculous. </p><p>I downgraded to firefox-81 but now some of my streaming services have stopped working because of an unsupported browser. Additionally, gmail does not work after the downgrade. </p><p>I know I'm not a loner in this and I know that firefox-89 is not the most recent version to disappoint in a major way.

(The problem occurred in the Devloper Edition of version 89, and version 89 was released to regular Firefox without a solution. When I start playing a video in Google Drive, it plays fine for the first few minutes, but then suddenly the video stops and the video screen goes black, and there is no response when I press the play button. The only solution to this is to reload the web page, but this is very inconvenient as the video stops in the middle and when you reload again it starts playing from the beginning. </p><p>Sorry for my bad english.

It's the new, much smaller, default font size.  And lack of demarcation to the tabs as they align with one another side by side.  Like a snow-blind whiteout. </p><p>It also threw out most of the toolbar itself and altered many of the FF ""setting"" selections that were previously our defaults or elections. </p><p>These are basic attributes which the ""upgrade"" to  FF has just unilaterally changed. </p><p>Now, as the user I have to 1)  seek out and 2) comprehend more complex instructions like ""about: config"" and jockey between that and M'soft windows settings???  And then hope I get it right????    </p><p>FYI I did try via another user-help response. Some relief there with font size, but it looks like a fun house mirror w/ weird size toolbar and onscreen font size.   And  it took me an hour and alot of holding my breath to see if I got it jiggered okay.  </p><p>Or seek out and try out any number of color font/screen themes which might work well??-- if I were my grandkids gaming all night under the bedcovers.   </p><p>Folks have graciously put in the time, effort and creativity to make various pretty and graphically appealing themes.
