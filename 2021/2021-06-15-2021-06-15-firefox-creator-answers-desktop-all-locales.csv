Each site hosts a software-defined radio receiver that can be tuned by the user, independent of other users tuning the radio.  AM broadcast, shortwave broadcast, ham radio and longwave broadcasts can be tuned in and listened-to off the air and streamed to your computer from all over the world. </p><p>I run the latest version of Firefox (89.0) (64-bit) on Linux Mint 20 Cinnamon. </p><p>In Settings, I search for cookies, and find <strong>Cookies and Site Data</strong>, and check the box for ""Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed.""  Then for every site I want cookies to persist from session to session, I ""Manage Exceptions,"" and place the web address in that list, then <strong>allow</strong> every one of them.  </p><p>In History, the next heading down, ""Firefox will: Use custom settings for history.""  Here I used to save for the session, first- and third-party cookies.  This has been removed from history.  However, I still ""clear history when Firefox closes.""  In the related Settings, I have only Cache and offlline website data marked for removal. </p><p>The webSDR sites all have a place to put a name or radio callsign.  This is saved with a cookie.   </p><p>So I don't have to type that in every time, I click on the lock on the address bar.  Brings down a menu.  On ""Connection (not) secure, there is an arrow on the right.  Click there to bring up connection security information and then click the bottom line, ""More information.""  I land on another drop-down's Security tab.  I use the tab to the left, called Permissions, and find ""Set cookies.""  Remove the checkmark to use default (session cookies) and select the Allow button. </p><p>Just two lines below that has a ""Store data in persistent storage,"" with ""Use default"" checked.  <strong>I need to check this out!</strong> </p><p>Allowing cookies has saved me from having to re-enter my name on the webSDR site, but the page tells me that if I store a memory preset, that is saved on <em>my</em> computer with a cookie.  So I don't get it that my name is saved, my presets are not saved and when I query the site's cookies, there ARE none! </p><p>Here is my work-around:  In Delete history when Firefox closes, and its related settings, I now only clear cache, and unchecked to clear offline site data.  I tested two  sites and I am keeping my preset pushbuttons. </p><p>Now:  I have just reinstated clearing offline site data when FF closes and have set one of the sites' permissions to allow persistent storage. </p><p>I will submit this report and close and reopen Firefox, check the site for retention of the memory preset and report back here. </p>",linux;desktop;cookies;needsinfo;firefox-890;,firefox,cookies,en-US,1421657;,FirefoxinUbuntu

1340676,2021-06-15 00:13:10 -0700,2021-06-15 00:13:10 -0700,"Couldn't Mozilla develop something like ""Firefox Lite"" for the desktop?","<p>I think that such a project would have multiple purposes: First off, you would take fewer things from Gecko, making for a more compact code base (I mean, does everyone want Video-in-Video and Pocket? Couldn't you integrate the most popular add-ons and remove add-on support? I like 'em, but don't they add bloat?). That could make the entry into development easier. Second off, it'd show people that Blink isn't the only engine you can base a browser off of. And if the code base is truly the same (includes Quantum), and more of a subset, it's probably easier to maintain and get security updates to than, for instance, Pale Moon. As fork developers are only able to backport security patches when Mozilla releases them, that problem would be greatly reduced if the project was made within Mozilla. Third off, having a lightweight browser might enable more people to use Mozilla products, as they could run the browser on weaker hardware. If the developers are able to focus on making that browser lightweight, it wouldn't be crucial for Firefox Standard to run on everything, and you'd still be able to reach more people. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",tachobrenner
