Somehow the problem only appeared after I added that last one. All profiles have the same syntax; I checked the files. Neither one is set to be the dominant one. Typically, I don't use more than one at a time. </p><p>I also use Claws mail. Whenever I get any mail with a link I want to check out, I just used to click on that link and it opened in a new tab in the FF browser profile that was currently open. Similarly, whenever I wanted to see the HTML version of a mail, I right-clicked on the html-icon and chose open. Again, it picked the open browser. </p><p>Now, though, whenever I pick either one of those options above, I get the ""Choose User Profile"" box. If I pick the profile that is currently open, I get an error telling me that it's already running.  </p><p>Since I mostly read email when I use the no-work FF profile, I tried to add ""firefox -P NotWork -no-remote --class NotWorkProfile"" but that also resulted in the choose user profile box to open. </p><p>My current work-around is to copy the link and open it in a new tab, or pull the whole mail into the tab to see the HTML version. Quite annoying. </p><p>Is there any way to get it to ignore all other profiles but the currently open one? Thank you for anyone who has an idea. Let me know if there's anything else I may add to explain the situation. </p><p>[My apologies if this isn't the right forum; I'm also attempting to ask this question in the Linux Mint and Claws forums, if those exist.] </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-870;,firefox,other,en-US,1404482;,addicted2h

No site Mega pede pra baixar o gerenciador de downloads, mas ele já está no pc. Mesmo baixando ele continua não reconhecendo o app. No entanto o problema não é da máquina, pois no Google Chrome e no Edge, funciona normalmente. Podem ajudar? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,fix-problems,pt-BR,"",nricardo.sousa

So i have never ever used MS Edge for logging into FireFox and Mozilla accounts.  But low and behold, MSEdge now has these Login and PW's for these accounts. </p><p>I had brought up this observation, in the recent past, regarding how MSEdge aggregated all my logins and pw's from FireFox.  And the response was for me to use a Master Password. </p><p>But this isnt the solution or the issue at hand. </p><p>The concern is why does Edge believe it is entitled to aggregate my FireFox PW's?  And when does it do so?  And how does it tap into the encrypted FF files?  Yet, Edge has not aggregated the bookmarks in FF. </p><p>Something is not right nor ethical. </p><p>Interestingly, perhaps FireFox users that lose their logins and passwords in FireFox browser can tap into MSEdge to restore them?  Seems like a reasonable solution. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,other,en-US,"",databaseben
