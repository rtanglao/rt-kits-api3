No site Mega pede pra baixar o gerenciador de downloads, mas ele já está no pc. Mesmo baixando ele continua não reconhecendo o app. No entanto o problema não é da máquina, pois no Google Chrome e no Edge, funciona normalmente. Podem ajudar? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,fix-problems,pt-BR,"",nricardo.sousa

I will never be able to get it back, it was a work email address from a previous employer.   </p><p>I had already registered a secondary email address but it won't let me switch it to primary without confirmation to the current primary address.

So i have never ever used MS Edge for logging into FireFox and Mozilla accounts.  But low and behold, MSEdge now has these Login and PW's for these accounts. </p><p>I had brought up this observation, in the recent past, regarding how MSEdge aggregated all my logins and pw's from FireFox.  And the response was for me to use a Master Password. </p><p>But this isnt the solution or the issue at hand. </p><p>The concern is why does Edge believe it is entitled to aggregate my FireFox PW's?  And when does it do so?  And how does it tap into the encrypted FF files?  Yet, Edge has not aggregated the bookmarks in FF. </p><p>Something is not right nor ethical. </p><p>Interestingly, perhaps FireFox users that lose their logins and passwords in FireFox browser can tap into MSEdge to restore them?  Seems like a reasonable solution. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,other,en-US,"",databaseben
