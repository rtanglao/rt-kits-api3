Private browsing does not save cookies or history, but does it make previously saved cookies and history from un-private browsing available? </p><p>I ask because there is advice in a couple of YouTube videos about how to search for keywords to use in your new videos.  This advice is that when hunting for potential popular search keywords, using a new private window to do the search will cause YouTube to do an ""unbiased"" search. That is, it will not be able to look at your YouTube history to determine viewing preferences when it presents you with recommended (auto complete) searches. </p><p>(Oops.

I will never be able to get it back, it was a work email address from a previous employer.   </p><p>I had already registered a secondary email address but it won't let me switch it to primary without confirmation to the current primary address.  Is there a way around this issue, or am I stuck with my account set permanently to a dead inbox? </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,sync,en-US,1404259;,darrell.bunger

So i have never ever used MS Edge for logging into FireFox and Mozilla accounts.  But low and behold, MSEdge now has these Login and PW's for these accounts. </p><p>I had brought up this observation, in the recent past, regarding how MSEdge aggregated all my logins and pw's from FireFox.  And the response was for me to use a Master Password. </p><p>But this isnt the solution or the issue at hand. </p><p>The concern is why does Edge believe it is entitled to aggregate my FireFox PW's?  And when does it do so?  And how does it tap into the encrypted FF files?  Yet, Edge has not aggregated the bookmarks in FF. </p><p>Something is not right nor ethical. </p><p>Interestingly, perhaps FireFox users that lose their logins and passwords in FireFox browser can tap into MSEdge to restore them?  Seems like a reasonable solution. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,other,en-US,"",databaseben
