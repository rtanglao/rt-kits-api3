I compared the contents of places.sqlite from before and after the switch. (I can do this because I made a backup of the old places.sqlite.) And I noticed that many entries of moz_historyvisits are missing in the new database. I made a graph about this, in which I am using pythons sqlite3 library to inspect the databases moz_historyvisits.visit_date column. For every visit_date I checked if it is still present in the new database or if it got lost. The pattern seems highly irregular. </p><p>Does firefox intend to maintain a complete history? By which criteria did individual history entries get lost? Is there a way to restore a complete version of my browser history from my account? </p><p>Any help is appreciated. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,"",garrettmay

Saw others having many problems similar to mine &amp; you might mention to them that FF87.0 may now be more advanced than the various systems that they are not able to login to after the FF87.0 update. I was using MSEdge to access my blocked sites &amp; almost went back to FF86.0.1. </p><p>Problems with Youtube full screen not working persist. Could be a spyware tool embedded by Google that is broken now. Not a big enough problem to force me to roll back version of FF. Saw many others were having online video problems since update. I don't have an answer for them. </p><p>Guessing as privacy protection increases our access problems will also increase as hacks, spies &amp; adware try to battle back. Me?

I play a free online game on Firefox. It used to work well, but when the game stopped using Flash - there were problems. (I'm also announced the maintenance of the game, but maybe the problem is also in Firefox) This is a Kizi game called Royal Story. It is a free online game where you build a kingdom and perform tasks there. (<a href=""http://Kizi.com/games/royal-story"" rel=""nofollow"">Kizi.com/games/royal-story</a>) Really fun! You will not see the game on the page completely, but will need to turn on full screen mode in the game's internal settings. That full screen no longer works, the game can’t be seen in full, and playing is really hard.

Pelaan ilmaista nettipeliä Firefoxilla. Aikaisemmin se toimi hyvin, mutta kun peli lopetti Flashin käytön - tuli ongelmia.  ( Olen ilmoittanut myös pelin ylläpitoon, mutta ehkä ongelma on myös Firefoxissa ) Kyseessä on Kizin peli nimeltä Royal Story.

Et näe peliä sivulla kokonaan, vaan pitää laittaa päälle täysi näyttö tila pelin sisäisistä asetuksista. Tuo täysi näyttö ei enää toimi, peliä ei saa näkymään kokonaan ja pelaaminen on tosi vaikeaa. Pitääkö Firefoxin ja pelin ylläpidon korjata tämä yhdessä vai onko tämä joku säätö mihin pelaaja voi vaikuttaa? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,fix-problems,fi,"",PurpleLady
