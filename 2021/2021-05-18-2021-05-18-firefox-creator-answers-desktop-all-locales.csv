It even has the checkbox already ticked as if it is fkn retarded. I have refreshed firefox and nope I have uninstalled firefox and reinstalled it nope. I have checked all the forums about it and even made it so that the system cannot alter the default torrent program. Still, nothing works. I am so angry coz it used to be fine.

All fully up-to-date.  </p><p>This problem only started recently: When link is clicked in FF to open certain pdf files, a new, fully formatted FF window opens, but the body is blank white and the pdf never loads. Doesn't happen with all pdf files listed on the ""referring"" page, but just some of them on a certain well-known and trusted web site, and it's very reproducible.  </p><p>Setting FF to open pdf files in Adobe Reader doesn't help. Same ones open but the others still won't. Other people tell me they have no problems opening those pdf files in FF.  </p><p>I completely uninstalled and re-installed FF but that didn't help. Doesn't matter how I set the security/privacy options, have Ghostery on or off (only extension installed).  Use recommended performance settings is enabled, DNS over HTTPS is off, tracking protection can be standard or strict, etc.  </p><p>If I click Manage Exceptions under Enhanced Tracking Protection, there's no way to enter any exceptions so I can't exempt the website in question. </p><p>If I keep trying to open one of those pdf files, FF becomes <em>totally </em>unresponsive. Task Manager lists ~4-5 FF entries but I can't End Task for most of them, and I typically have to reboot PC.
