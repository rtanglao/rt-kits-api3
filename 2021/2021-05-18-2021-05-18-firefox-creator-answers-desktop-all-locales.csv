Problémy jsou dva a předem prosím, odpovědi typu přeinstaujte si FF, restartujte v nouzovém režimu, popř upgradujte na Wokna 10 si ušetřte. Už jsem zkusil znovu naistalovat FF (ovšem po něm v registrech zůstalo úplně všecko, tudíž přeinstalace je sporná), dokonce naformátovat HDD, vše naistalovat znovu, včetně platného Nod32, pořád se to stává. První problém je v tom, že některé stránky (naposledy Microchip) se po několika kliknutích zblázní, dokonale se roztrhá skladba stránky, zůstane jen obrovský psaný text bez fontů a ikonka obnovení/zastavení načítání začne bláznivě měnit symbol otočné šipky na x rychlostí asi 10x za sekundu. Nahoře se objeví nějaké příkazy čtečce (?!), jako zatrhávací políčka, ale nic z nich nefunguje. Zbývá stránku jen totálně na několikerý pokus zavřít, nebo sestřelit FF ze Správce, když se ani to nepodaří... Stává se to náhodně v čase i prostoru (tedy na různých stránkách a vždy po náhodné době). Doufám, že alespoň toto stihnu dopsat. Druhý problém je v tom, že se mi náhodně po stisku klávesy (teď to bylo obyčejné ""M""), objeví v dolní části ladící okno. Dá se zavřít, ale je to otravné a netuším, jak se toho zbavit. Díky za případnou pomoc a uvítám někoho, který má podobné zkušenosti. </p>",windows-7;desktop;websites;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,websites,cs,1413496;,bd7421d1

Same ones open but the others still won't. Other people tell me they have no problems opening those pdf files in FF.  </p><p>I completely uninstalled and re-installed FF but that didn't help. Doesn't matter how I set the security/privacy options, have Ghostery on or off (only extension installed).  Use recommended performance settings is enabled, DNS over HTTPS is off, tracking protection can be standard or strict, etc.  </p><p>If I click Manage Exceptions under Enhanced Tracking Protection, there's no way to enter any exceptions so I can't exempt the website in question. </p><p>If I keep trying to open one of those pdf files, FF becomes <em>totally </em>unresponsive.
