There is o record of having visited any site called oracle prior to it having appeared on my system, and having contacted them since in order to ibtain more information regarding oracle co-browse has yielded very  little as they simply deny responsibility and refuse to discuss anything they do since I am not a customer of theirs.    I would like to know how this came to appear on my browser as it appears to be some sort of click-to-play option which I thought firefox did not allow?!?  I try to stay clear of things that might jeopardize my security or privacy and certainly would never intentionally allow for anyone to share my screen so how can i find out where this came from and how to prevent it from ever appearing again?

And help with Session Sync add-on,"<p>I am currently using someone elses computer because mine wont connect to the internet for some reason. But that computer should be getting fixed soon, so I wanted to take the bookmarks from this computer and be able to view them on my own later. Also, I fear I may have added too many bookmarks and add-ons because Firefox has been running extremely slowly lately. So I was going to give it a reset, which would result in losing everything. I can simply get the add-ons again but I want to be able to keep my bookmarks. I've been using an add-on called Session Sync, which bookmarks every tab you have open all at once. However, when I went to export those bookmarks, it says: ""Saved session are stored as bookmarks. It's recommended to use Firefox Account to sync your bookmarks. Currenly you can only use Firefox Bookmark Manager (CTRL + SHIFT + B) to export/import all your bookmarks (which includes all Session Sync saved data). Session Sync detects automatically all updated bookmarks after an import."" </p><p>So, I did what it said and exported my bookmarks but I signed in to my firefox account first. Perhaps that is what messed things up. Because now, every single bookmark I saved individually (not using Session Sync) is gone. When I look at my bookmarks, I see things I do not even recognize. I probably bookmarked them months ago, so I don't remember. There is certainly no trace of pages I have bookmarked recently, including today.  When I take a look at the exported bookmarks, it's the same thing. None of the recent indivual bookmarks are there are absolutely none of the Session Synced bookmarks are there at all.  So what happened to them? Why didn't Session Sync's bookmarks get included in the export like it said it would? Could have it been because I signed into my Firefox account which hadn't been used in a long time, so it swapped out the bookmarks on this computer with the ones from my account?  I thought I'd try signing into this computers owner's account and hope things go back to how they were before but neither of us even new she had one or remember the password. I was going to reset the password but then it says we may lose all the bookmarks, which would defeat the purpose. But it only says it's a possibility. Is that true? Is there a good chance I will not lose them?  </p><p>All I want is my bookmarks back and to be able to keep the ones from Session Sync. I did not expect this to turn into such a pain. </p><p>Thank you for any assistance, it is very, very much appreciatedÂ :) </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-81;firefox-850;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",Redstar2613
