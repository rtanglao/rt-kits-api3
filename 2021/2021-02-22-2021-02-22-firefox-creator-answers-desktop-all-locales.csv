My mail and other shortcuts have disappeared and don't want to re-import from Edge or the older program.  I don't want to sync it, just get the e-mail and find time to install a software that doesn't want to install, but has nothing to do with Firefox. I have been trying all afternoon and don't have any recourse but to go back to Windows if I can't get this resolved. </p><p>I have an existing problem because this computer was new a year ago and came with a free Office Max 1 year tech service. They remapped both the browser and this  desktop and could not get it so I could access my files from both computers and save on this one. We were going thru my daughter's cancer, husband's stroke and my arm surgery and I couldn't come downstairs often. Finally called them one last time and seemed to work, but next day was a mess and I couldn't even get on the internet. I did get that straightened out and moved to Firefox. Worked fine until we had a storm and Microsoft got in on the reset after the snow storm. Now Firefox won't let me have my mail on this computer without syncing -- has always worked fine. Actually if I send a file to myself that is too big, it just went into the sent box and when I could get downstairs I could open it, work on it and send back the same way. </p><p>I do have a friend who can help me reset the computer when this covid thing is over and he has time to get here as he is quite busy with Boeing computers and our church computers-- I'm afraid to reset the computer without being sure all my card and WP programs are saved and will work. In the meantime, if I can just get this darn e-mail set up, I'll be satisfied. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",d-s-strahan
