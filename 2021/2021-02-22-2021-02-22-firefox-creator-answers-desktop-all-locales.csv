I am contacting here because I am redesigning my website, and in the process have found that there are problems with Firefox. Specifically, I am upgrading the Photography section of my website, which currently looks like this: <a href=""http://www.dominicsimpson.co.uk/photography.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dominicsimpson.co.uk/photography.html</a> </p><p>My upgrading includes employing Bootstrap frameworks to make the images scale gracefully, while within a responsive container that already exists. In addition, when the user mouses over an image, the image transforms nicely with descriptive text over a blue colour, rather than what is there at the moment, where the user has to click on the image to have a larger one come up in a separate window with a description watermarked in it. </p><p>I am finding that Firefox is not displaying the images in this new work-in-progress. This is despite the fact that: 1.	I have upgraded to the latest version of Firefox, and have deleted extensions, cookies and cache, as well as checking settings in the Configuration page of Firefox 2.	Other web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Opera, have had no problems displaying the images </p><p>You can see the new code here on GitHub, together with the CSS: <a href=""https://github.com/DominicSimpson/photography"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/DominicSimpson/photography</a> </p><p>The photography section of the CSS is on line 1951 onwards (it’s a huge file). </p><p>Is there some kind of code that I can add to the CSS that would make the images appear in Firefox?

And help with Session Sync add-on,"<p>I am currently using someone elses computer because mine wont connect to the internet for some reason. But that computer should be getting fixed soon, so I wanted to take the bookmarks from this computer and be able to view them on my own later. Also, I fear I may have added too many bookmarks and add-ons because Firefox has been running extremely slowly lately. So I was going to give it a reset, which would result in losing everything. I can simply get the add-ons again but I want to be able to keep my bookmarks. I've been using an add-on called Session Sync, which bookmarks every tab you have open all at once. However, when I went to export those bookmarks, it says: ""Saved session are stored as bookmarks. It's recommended to use Firefox Account to sync your bookmarks. Currenly you can only use Firefox Bookmark Manager (CTRL + SHIFT + B) to export/import all your bookmarks (which includes all Session Sync saved data). Session Sync detects automatically all updated bookmarks after an import."" </p><p>So, I did what it said and exported my bookmarks but I signed in to my firefox account first. Perhaps that is what messed things up. Because now, every single bookmark I saved individually (not using Session Sync) is gone. When I look at my bookmarks, I see things I do not even recognize. I probably bookmarked them months ago, so I don't remember. There is certainly no trace of pages I have bookmarked recently, including today.  When I take a look at the exported bookmarks, it's the same thing. None of the recent indivual bookmarks are there are absolutely none of the Session Synced bookmarks are there at all.  So what happened to them? Why didn't Session Sync's bookmarks get included in the export like it said it would? Could have it been because I signed into my Firefox account which hadn't been used in a long time, so it swapped out the bookmarks on this computer with the ones from my account?  I thought I'd try signing into this computers owner's account and hope things go back to how they were before but neither of us even new she had one or remember the password. I was going to reset the password but then it says we may lose all the bookmarks, which would defeat the purpose. But it only says it's a possibility. Is that true? Is there a good chance I will not lose them?  </p><p>All I want is my bookmarks back and to be able to keep the ones from Session Sync. I did not expect this to turn into such a pain. </p><p>Thank you for any assistance, it is very, very much appreciated :) </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-81;firefox-850;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",Redstar2613

Then, instead of opening Sync settings as I expected, Firefox began to sync immediately.  In fact the activity blocked Firefox for a while, preventing me from accessing sync settings at all.  After getting into the settings,  I disabled some things in sync settings, but don't know what undesired ""cross-fertilization"" may have already occurred between my Firefox installations.  How can I find out?  How can I get control of Firefox's syncing behaviour?

When I scroll down, the video reappears in the bottom right of the screen in a tiny window, and there seems to be no way to disable whatsoever. </p><p>I have looked everywhere to no avail. It seems to be a flaw in Firefox, given that there is no obvious way to prevent it from appearing. I have tried hiding it with Adblock Plus, and other similar extensions. But it only half blocks it, and only the current one that's appearing. If I reload the page, it reappears in full. It's usually labeled 'watch (the) video'. </p><p>It is extremely annoying. I thought this was the 2020s, not the 1960s. Surely there is a way by now to prevent this intrusive feature from appearing at all. Does anyone know any magic tricks?  </p><p>The first attachment shows the video embedded on a news website. The second one shows the offending pop up when one scrolls below the main video. I have never heard of any way to get rid of it, despite having used Firefox for a while now. </p><p>Cheers </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",sta_2300

This is not true for all other web browsers who display the site perfectly.  This has only happened in the latest release of Firefox, previous versions were ok.  I am at a loss to understand how this has happened and would appreciate any help in overcoming the problem.

Is this necessary as safari doesn't need this, and if so, is it easier just to use safari as default browser instead of firefox?  Or can this be changed in settings without harming my security, as I'm using it on my mac from home.  Some things work better with Firefox, but it I have to login and enter a password each time to use it, then it makes it cumbersome to use Firefox as a default browser.

My mail and other shortcuts have disappeared and don't want to re-import from Edge or the older program.  I don't want to sync it, just get the e-mail and find time to install a software that doesn't want to install, but has nothing to do with Firefox. I have been trying all afternoon and don't have any recourse but to go back to Windows if I can't get this resolved. </p><p>I have an existing problem because this computer was new a year ago and came with a free Office Max 1 year tech service. They remapped both the browser and this  desktop and could not get it so I could access my files from both computers and save on this one. We were going thru my daughter's cancer, husband's stroke and my arm surgery and I couldn't come downstairs often. Finally called them one last time and seemed to work, but next day was a mess and I couldn't even get on the internet. I did get that straightened out and moved to Firefox. Worked fine until we had a storm and Microsoft got in on the reset after the snow storm. Now Firefox won't let me have my mail on this computer without syncing -- has always worked fine. Actually if I send a file to myself that is too big, it just went into the sent box and when I could get downstairs I could open it, work on it and send back the same way. </p><p>I do have a friend who can help me reset the computer when this covid thing is over and he has time to get here as he is quite busy with Boeing computers and our church computers-- I'm afraid to reset the computer without being sure all my card and WP programs are saved and will work. In the meantime, if I can just get this darn e-mail set up, I'll be satisfied. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1393777;,d-s-strahan
