I added some back to the laptop I was working on, but when I switched to my other one, they were not there. Do extensions not sync? Add-ons are included in items being synced on my settings page. I was hoping to find they never disappeared from that laptop so I could see which ones to add back. I'm on a Windows 10 machine. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",docmon67
