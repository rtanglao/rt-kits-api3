For quite a long time (I'm not sure when since it has been long enough that I have more or less accepted it at this point), I am having an issue with page loading while I have an Ad Blocker installed. It doesn't matter which one it is, as long as I have one installed and enabled, it takes around 3-5 minutes for any page to load when I first start Firefox. This is especially prevalent when I have just started up my computer, compared to if I had used Firefox just a while ago and am opening it again, in which case the duration is shorter, but still around 2-3 minutes. </p><p>I have tried multiple ad blockers, such as uBlock Origin, AdBlock, AdBlock Plus and AdNauseam, but I'm facing this issue with all of them. I know it's the ad blocker because whenever I disable it, the pages which were otherwise not loading, load immediately, but with ads. If I enable the ad blocker again, I still have to wait the duration I would otherwise have to, for the page to continue loading or website to continue working. </p><p>I would like to know some way around this issue aside from disabling the ad blocker altogether, or a suggestion for a different ad blocker would also be welcome, as long as I can get rid of this issue. </p><p>Current Firefox version: 86.0.1 (64-bit) </p><p>I've had this issue persistently over several versions over the last couple of years. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",rohitchaoji
