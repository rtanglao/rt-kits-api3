I also didn't need to login to FF each time I started it on my old computer, but FF on the new computer makes me login every time I restart.

The ""quick searches"" feature that pops up when I highlight text is a lot more annoying then useful, so I turned it off... and it seems to re-enable itself randomly. One time I disabled it, and after <strong>5 seconds,</strong> it re-enabled itself. So annoying. I've made so many accidental searches with that stupid feature. I mean, how many people copy text just to search it up? Even then, they can highlight the text, right click, then click ""Search (engline) for (text)"".  </p><p>The point being, the feature is re-enabling itself randomly, and it's getting on my nerves. </p><p>I don't see any option within the settings to turn it off. Any ideas? </p><p>Thanks, </p><pre>    Stephen </pre>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,customize,en-US,1415959;1415964;1415965;1415966;1415974;,skcroushore
