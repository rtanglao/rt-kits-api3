Arriva fino al punto dove dovrebbe esserci questa minirassegna stampa e non scorre più in giù sulle altre notizie, premetto che da dopo la reinstallazione non ho più inserito nessuna estensione. Il sistema operativo che uso è Windows / a 64 Bit ultima versione e Firefox è la versione 89.0 a 64 bit. Come antivirus uso Trend Micro Maximum Security (ho provato anche a stopparlo ma non cambia niente) La cosa che mi fa più rabbia è che su tutti gli atri browser che ho quali Chrome, Opera e perfino Internet Explorer 11 funziona benissimo, A qualcun'altro è capitato questo problema?
