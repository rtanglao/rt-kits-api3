The logo of my schools appears as a broken image in Gmail/Google drive etc. when I use Mozilla Firefox (Ver 93.0) to login into my account. The problem does not happen if I use other browsers like Chrome or Microsoft edge. Could you please look into this problem. I am attaching a screenshot. </p><p>Thank You Samarjeet Chanda </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,websites,en-US,1451756;1451761;1451809;1451820;,mechanical.samarjeet
