Now it won't load a single page. I'm posting this question from the Chrome browser, which works so much better than Firefox right now. I am using a Windows 10 OS if that info is needed. My question is: Why does the Firefox browser refuse to work now? I type in a URL and it wont even show a loading bar, it just sits there, I can't even access the settings page, nothing is working at all with this browser. I can still see the bookmarks bar but when I click on them, nothing will load. What is wrong with Firefox? </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",bluespade00
