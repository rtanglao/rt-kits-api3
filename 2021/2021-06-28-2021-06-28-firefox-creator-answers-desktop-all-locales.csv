My gmail, calender and other sites keep losing connection, and if I try to navigate to <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> it simply doesn't go: no error message, no loading timeout, the tab just behaves as if I didn't ask it to go at all. All these problems are intermittent, but I'd guess I'm getting about 90% downtime. </p><p>I've found that I can solve this problem by cycling ""Query OCSP responder servers to confirm the current validity of certificates"" under the security settings. When I disable this all the google services promptly work again for a little while, before failing. Then I reactive it, they come back online for a few minutes, then I need to disable it again to get another period of functionality.  </p><p>I've already tried running in safe mode, disabling all my addons, reinstalling firefox, making sure it has an exception on my firewall, and enabling trackers on google. None of these have helped though. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I can't find any question on forums where cycling the OCSP servers has been necessary! </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-890;firefox-8902;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",allan.s.johnson

Do you monkeise stupid ideas of morons from other companies? 3. Why can not I trust the manager of passwords because each subsequent amendment can have a critical error that will cut me off from the internet? 4. Why are your patches in the browser more dangerous from the most dangerous viruses? 5. Why do you hire human monkeys without brain to design and make changes? 6. When do you stop destroying your own product, which from version 4.0 is getting worse? 7. Why do you remove the right to decide their users with their users? 8. Why do people who use your browser hate you so much? 9. When you start to listen to users, and stop listening to corporate idiots? 10. Is the firefox designer stupid pseudo intelligence or do you have your own brains? </p>",windows-7;desktop;firefox-880;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1424374;,olamagato

In the previous version 88.0 they were much larger and without padding and therefore easier to see. Is it possible to change the icon size and padding. If not, can it be added as a customising feature. I specifically used firefox over other browsers as I much preferred the look and size of the start page with added shortcuts. In version 89.0 this has changed. Please, I need my added shortcuts to be bigger. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",mertonman25

Now it won't load a single page. I'm posting this question from the Chrome browser, which works so much better than Firefox right now. I am using a Windows 10 OS if that info is needed. My question is: Why does the Firefox browser refuse to work now? I type in a URL and it wont even show a loading bar, it just sits there, I can't even access the settings page, nothing is working at all with this browser. I can still see the bookmarks bar but when I click on them, nothing will load. What is wrong with Firefox? </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,1424377;,bluespade00
