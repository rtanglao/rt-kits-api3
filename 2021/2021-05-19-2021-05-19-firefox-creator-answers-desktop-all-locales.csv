O Player carrega corretamente o stream, mas após alguns segundos não consegue continuar a carregar e só fica tentando e tentando continuadamente. </p><p>Isto não acontece no Chrome, nem no modo privado, nem com vídeos normais que não sejam streams. Só com streams ao vivo, só no Firefox, e só no modo normal. Isto acontece no meu ambiente de desenvolvimento local (casa, conexão remota) e na nuvem corporativa. </p><p>É um sistema Angular 8/NodeJs e o player que eu uso é o Clappr. Mudei para o Video.js e o problema continuou. O stream está vindo de um balanceador de carga com 6 servidores filhos, cada um com um servidor Apache que tem um proxy para um servidor Icecast que é a origem do stream. </p><p>[balanceador carga] &lt; [6 servidores filhos com proxy apache ] &gt; [servidor Icecast] </p><p>Eu procurei verificar quais as configurações que eram diferentes no modo privativo que fazem funcionar e acabei descobrindo que desabilitando todo o histórico de navegação (não só o de páginas e downloads ou de formulários) também faria funcionar. </p><p>Alguém sabe me dizer exatamente o que acontece quando o histórico de navegação é desativado ? além de não gravar o histórico, isso tem impacto em mais alguma coisa ? algum tipo de cache, rede ou algo assim ? Alguém tem alguma idéia para fazer o stream funcionar sem desabilitar o histórico ? não posso pedir aos usuários para desabilitarem os histórico para usar meu site. </p><p>Caso haja algum outro fórum onde possa obter uma informação técnica mais precisa, favor informar. </p> <hr> <p>English: </p><p>I have a problem with live video streams in the system I'm developing that happens only in Firefox and only in normal mode. The player correctly loads the stream, but after a few seconds can't continue to load and just keeps trying and trying forever. </p><p>This doesn't happen in Chrome, nor if I load the page in Private Mode, nor with normal videos.

This happens both in local development (home, remote connection) and in the corporative cloud. </p><p>It's an Angular 8/NodeJs system and the player I use is Clappr. I changed to Video.js and the problem continued.

It was the first thing I thought. But the IPS team could not find any blocked traffic. Also if it was that, why would the traffic not be blocked in private mode ? </p><p>So I thought in trying to pinpoint what exact configuration is different in private mode that does the trick and I figured out that disabling all history (not only navigation and downloads or forms) makes it work too. </p><p>Someone knows what exactly happens when the navigation history is disabled ? besides not saving history, it has an impact on something else ? some type of cache, network or something like that ? Someone has any idea to make stream work without disabling history ? I can't ask my users to disable history just to use my system. </p><p>In case there is any other fórum where I can get more technical detailed support please inform. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-810;,firefox,fix-problems,pt-BR,1413602;,nelson777

Having used Chrome exclusively ever since the word Chrome was no longer just, er, hm well Chrome the element, I am now a confirmed Fox, too. </p><p>But I dare say I feel a bit let down by something I saw pop up on my screen, despite following the guidelines that Firefox suggested. That being the advise given to me suggesting separate profiles be created in order to prevent the merging of information between two separate user accounts.  I learned of this much later than when I learned about tab containers in that It would allow two separate accounts logged in the same device to keep from sharing and merging information. But when I attempted to do this, I was warned that book marks and other bits and pieces would merge with the other account signing later. The suggestion was that separate profiles be created. I did that, but when the other profile signed in after the first was logged out, the same warning appeared that tabs etc would sinc with the next account to log in. Please let me know what it is that I have misunderstood.  If this is true, please let me know what the Container and Profiles are really supposed to do as they are not doing what I thought Firefox said it does so well.   If this is the way it is supposed to be, please tell me why anyone would think this is something a user may want.  </p><p>Thank you kindly J </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1413603;1413604;,bajbaj865

Usually it's just one function, like today a captcha verification box didn't respond when being clicked.  Other days, it's just one function on a page, again no action taken.  Switching to Chrome always works.  Is there something I can do to see exactly what is failing and any settings I can check?  Been using Firefox for over 15 years, but starting to get a little weary of having to switch browsers on an increasing basis. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1413609;,nardone.family
