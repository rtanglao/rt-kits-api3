1336602,2021-05-19 10:09:10 -0700,2021-05-19 10:09:10 -0700,Strange network problem while running Firefox on windows.,"<p>Hello there! </p><p>I noticed that I get bad internet speeds lately. The provider advertises it as 1 Gbit / 300 Mbit connection with 300 Mbit / 100 Mbit garanteed speeds. I measured download speeds below the garanteed speed with the Ookla speedtest site.  It turns out that I get the bad speeds only when I use Firefox. When I try it with Chromium, or with the new Edge browser which is another Chromium based browser, I get speeds which I still not really satisfied with, but this is another story and these speeds are seem to be realistic, and these measurements show values above the garanteed speeds.  Now the strange part is, I also get the same bad speeds with Chromium based browser while Firefox is running! What is even more confusing, let say I run a test on both Chromium and Edge with normal speeds, then I launch Firefox for a test I get roughly the same numbers. Now if I leave Firefox open and I run tests on the other browser speeds start to drop and show the usual bad results. Then I run the test on FF and I get the same bad result. Then I close FF and I get the normal speeds on the other browsers. I took around 30 screenshots of these tests and uploaded it onto my google photos. I put the link above: </p><p><a href=""https://photos.app.goo.gl/sjxnMNjWqP8Nuoi1A"" rel=""nofollow"">link text</a> </p><p>I'm really confused and I have no idea if it is Firefox or a Windows thing, but I also run these tests on Firefox developer version, and it behaved the same way. </p><p>Don't hold your thoughts back, if you have any idea about what is going on, or perhaps you know the answer to these issues! </p>",desktop;beta;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",vegh.tibor.mail

Why does Firefox seem hell bent on syncing computers?  I do not want to do this, all my computers are individual machines and have different perposes.

This will take me some valuable time. When I log in here all the other machines are switched off in case it gets worse. So, how do I stop synking from happening?

Create a file called userContent.css, and paste in the following contents: </p><p>``` @-moz-document url-prefix(about:home), url-prefix(about:newtab) { 	.click-target-container *, .top-sites-list * { 		color: #fff !important ; 		text-shadow: 2px 2px 2px #000 !important ; 	} </p><p>	body { 		background: url(/usr/share/backgrounds/flowers-4564439.jpg) !important ; 		background-size: cover !important ; 	} } ``` </p><p>Save the file and open Firefox (no need to restart at this point). </p><p>- replace the url(...) with the image path.

Just with live streams, just in Firefox, just in normal mode. This happens both in local development (home, remote connection) and in the corporative cloud. </p><p>It's an Angular 8/NodeJs system and the player I use is Clappr. I changed to Video.js and the problem continued.

It was the first thing I thought. But the IPS team could not find any blocked traffic. Also if it was that, why would the traffic not be blocked in private mode ? </p><p>So I thought in trying to pinpoint what exact configuration is different in private mode that does the trick and I figured out that disabling all history (not only navigation and downloads or forms) makes it work too. </p><p>Someone knows what exactly happens when the navigation history is disabled ? besides not saving history, it has an impact on something else ? some type of cache, network or something like that ? Someone has any idea to make stream work without disabling history ?

Having used Chrome exclusively ever since the word Chrome was no longer just, er, hm well Chrome the element, I am now a confirmed Fox, too. </p><p>But I dare say I feel a bit let down by something I saw pop up on my screen, despite following the guidelines that Firefox suggested. That being the advise given to me suggesting separate profiles be created in order to prevent the merging of information between two separate user accounts.  I learned of this much later than when I learned about tab containers in that It would allow two separate accounts logged in the same device to keep from sharing and merging information. But when I attempted to do this, I was warned that book marks and other bits and pieces would merge with the other account signing later. The suggestion was that separate profiles be created. I did that, but when the other profile signed in after the first was logged out, the same warning appeared that tabs etc would sinc with the next account to log in. Please let me know what it is that I have misunderstood.  If this is true, please let me know what the Container and Profiles are really supposed to do as they are not doing what I thought Firefox said it does so well.   If this is the way it is supposed to be, please tell me why anyone would think this is something a user may want.  </p><p>Thank you kindly J </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1413603;1413604;,bajbaj865

Usually it's just one function, like today a captcha verification box didn't respond when being clicked.  Other days, it's just one function on a page, again no action taken.  Switching to Chrome always works.  Is there something I can do to see exactly what is failing and any settings I can check?  Been using Firefox for over 15 years, but starting to get a little weary of having to switch browsers on an increasing basis. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1413609;,nardone.family
