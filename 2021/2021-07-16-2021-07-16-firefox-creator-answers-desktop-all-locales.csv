When I have to move another windows across FF, I get a string of repeating images one of the other that I cannot remove until I close that FF page.  (See image below) </p><p>2. When I save a FF page, it does not close itself.  I have to click on the page, refresh it, then I can close it.  Also sometimes it take 20-30 seconds to save and close a page that has mostly text on it, such as an article page from one of the many newspapers I review every day including Financial Times, NYTimes, Wash. Post, etc.  Due to this and other errors, it slows down my work day to where I am forced to spend one to two extra hours workiing to correct these errors. </p><pre>3. When I have FF open, it seems to slow down my entire machine, even though I'm not working at the moment in FF.   </pre> <p>4.  Please fix this.  I work 7-8 hours a day on a project I am nearing 20 years completing.  It gets tiresome in and of itself, but when FF causes me more problems it become exasperating and as much as I want to quit, I can't walk away from this project which has grown to nearly 700 gigabytes in size with millions of pages of html, jpg, pdf and txt files.   </p><p>5. Please help me with a new update that will fix these errors or tell me how I can fix them. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;needsinfo;firefox-900;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1427928;,gruff
