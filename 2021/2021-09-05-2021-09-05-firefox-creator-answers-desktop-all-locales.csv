I somewhat doubt that actually, but the fact is that the 2 other PCs have identical bookmarks sets and are clearly syncing, but this one has a different bookmark set.  </p><p>How to force it to connect?

I use Firefox for years and with the actual problems searching for a replacement did not find another browser, that I myself would consider as equivalent (in first place concerning privacy and ad-free browsing). The problems started with version 83 or 84 and there has nothing changed since. As I have no own Internet connection, I use to store the webpages on my disk to view them later offline. However, in lots more than 50% (probably over 75%) of save trials, Firefox fails! What I try to do is ""Save As"" and then selecting ""as webpage, complete"". In the ""Downloads"" tab, the page appears with the word ""Failed"" (instead of ""Completed"" + file size) below the filename. As I really need this feature, I actually use Google Chrome, that saves the pages properly. But, as I said, I'm not willing to give up the browser I trust and that I consider being simply the best. Thanks for any suggestions. </p>",desktop;websites;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",alylutgen

Well, it is saved, but it is real troublesome to use it compared to my old sidebar. I WANT MY OLD SIDEBAR BACK - ANY HELP?
