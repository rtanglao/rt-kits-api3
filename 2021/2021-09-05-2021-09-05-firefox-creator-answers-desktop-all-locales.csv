I have been a Firefox user for as long as i can remember and for years i have noticed these cursors appearing at weirdest places. you click somewhere on screen at new tab or in setting a cursor would appear. This issue has been there for ages. I don't know why but i get irritated seeing cursor appearing on Firefox logo on new tab. I can only laugh when i see a cursor somewhere i could've never expected. </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,"",maharjanrojaar

I have cable network connection. Max download speed is 1000 Mbps. Test show above 900 Mbps for Edge and Chrome and 5-600 Mbps for Firefox, sometimes it is much slower and sometimes download stops for 5-20 seconds. I therefore tried ""Refresh Firefox"" - and my dear Bookmark sidebar disappeared!! Firefox info told me bookmarks would be saved. Well, it is saved, but it is real troublesome to use it compared to my old sidebar. I WANT MY OLD SIDEBAR BACK - ANY HELP? Kind regards Toralf </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-910;firefox-9102;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1440774;,toralf.wicklund

How am I supposed to use this browser? If you want me to switch browsers, just say so. Just pop up a dialog box that says ""we do not want people using Firefox, please download another browser."" </p>",windows-7;desktop;tabs;firefox-910;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1440768;1440770;1440772;,squidguy
