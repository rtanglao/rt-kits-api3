After a few trials and errors, I think I have identified a pattern but no idea of what the root cause is: </p> <ul><li> the sites I am trying to access all redirect to a different URL; </li><li> I can open the sites just fine if I explicitly type `https://` in the address bar. </li></ul> <p>A few of the sites I am struggling with: </p> <ul><li> <a href=""http://maps.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">maps.google.com</a> (--&gt; <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/maps</a>), but <a href=""https://maps.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://maps.google.com</a> will work; </li><li> <a href=""http://epson.sn"" rel=""nofollow"">epson.sn</a> (--&gt; <a href=""https://support.epson.net/setupnavi/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.epson.net/setupnavi/</a>), but <a href=""https://epson.sn"" rel=""nofollow"">https://epson.sn</a> will work. </li></ul> <p>I noticed that I could open the above URLs just fine in a Private window, so tried the following to no avail: </p> <ul><li> Clear cache; </li><li> Restart Firefox in Troubleshooting Mode (still on as I am writing this); </li><li> Install Firefox Beta side-by-side; </li><li> Completely uninstall Firefox and remove the existing profile, before doing a fresh install. </li></ul> <p>None of the above solutions work and I am a bit stumped.
