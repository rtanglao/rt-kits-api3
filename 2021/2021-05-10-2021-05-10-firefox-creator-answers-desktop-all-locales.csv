The same thing happens when Microsoft is going to update Windows.  Everything slows to a crawl.  At least monster Microsoft puts a little green dot on my power icon to let me know an update is on the way.  Can't you notify me in advance, so I don't get caught in the whirlpool of everything slowing down?  It even slows down my Microsoft Word.  I didn't think my browser would affect that.  PLEASE ANSWER.  I thought you guys were cool alternatives to the big, commercial guys. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",larryhof
