FF is: 88.0 64-bit TB is: 78.8.1 (64-Bit) </p><p>One is: ""Firefox is already running, but is not responding. To use Firefox, you must first close the existing Firefox process, restart your device, or use a different profile."" appears if I click on links in emails. It doesn't matter if they're linked to youtube, are an online version of the email etc. Always the same message. </p><p>I tried to assign Firefox as a standard browser and changed to another one, started the system again, ran Thunderbird and Firefox and it still happened. I tried changing something in the config editor, doesn't help at all. I checked for files / attachments and what should happen with http/https. There's no entry, which is fine according to mozilla help. The settings are the same as before the upgrade. I don't understand why it doesn't work anymore. </p><p>And second problem is: When clicking a email link in Firefox it doesn't open in Thunderbird. Error message is: ""Thunderbird is already running, but is not responding. To use Thunderbird, you must first close the existing Thunderbird process, restart your device, or use a different profile."" </p><p>It also doesn't work if I have run FF and TB in safe mode at the same time or in other constellations (FF in safe mode, TB not and vice versa) </p><p>Any other ideas? </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-880;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",antishape
