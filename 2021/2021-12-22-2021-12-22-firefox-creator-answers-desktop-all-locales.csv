Sucede cuando navegando por la web se elige cualquier artículo y se quiere iniciar una conversación con el vendedor, cuando se hace click sobre el icono chat (arriba a la derecha) la web va al apartado de conversaciones almacenadas pero no da opción alguna de inciar una nueva conversación, sólo puedes continuar con las existentes. He desinstalado todos los complementos que tenía para un inicio en limpio pero el error sigue ahí. Lógicamente he probado con otros navegadores y la web funciona sin problemas, se puede iniciar una conversación con cualquier usuario de wallapop, pero desde la nueva versión de firefox no se puede.

I have installed the UK Dictionary and made it the default for spellchecking. The Windows installation is also supposed to be respecting the OS regional settings. Firefox seems to be totally disregarding the settings and always giving me US as the location and US English for the spellcheck. This has been an issue for months if not years. I understand that many pages will be US biased, that is not a problem. The problems are that my country preference is being detected as US, and that I can not seem to get Firefox to actually use the UK Dictionary. I can supply additional information as required </p>",desktop;beta;other;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,other,en-US,"",UrBob

FF sucks about 500 MB to be run, on top of which it takes 500 MB per tab, and that makes it impossible to run a research on my 8 GB Mac. Yesterday I was looking for a lamp and had no more than 7 tabs open, 3 of which were largely text, 2 were online shops, and 1-2 were websites with pictures. No Facebook or social media, no YouTube. FF froze, made the whole Mac freeze (well, Mac is garbage nowadays but let's leave that out of this topic), and I had to wait MINUTES before I could close it, because the computer was nonreactive.  </p><p>When I check online, I see people being like ""why can't it manage more than 50 tabs?"". 50?!?! My computer dies with a maximum of 10 when it's only text websites! </p><p>So, I guess there's something wrong with this. </p><p>- I don't have many extensions (SimilarWeb, VPN, and Flash Player), I always use incognito so I can't use the plugin that allows me to use several accounts at the same time, so I can't see what's messing with my Mac. - The Activity Monitor (pretty much Task Manager on Windows) shows ""FirefoxCP Isolated Web Content"" for each tab, could that have anything to do with my problem? - CPU usage is very low, some 0.5 to 10% max during heavy use. - I seem to remember I used to have dozens of tabs open in the past, although I can't be sure. Is this a recent problem? </p><p>I really hope there's a way to solve this, because now I always fear that opening FF while on a Zoom meeting might freeze the whole thing. </p><p>Thanks to anyone who might want to shed some light on this big problem. </p><p>Screenshots: RAM and CPU usage with 2 tabs open. Two, taking more than 1 GB of RAM and about 250 threads in total? While using 0.2% of the CPU? I'm lost </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;memoryusage;mac-os-x-1014;firefox-950;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1468408;,muvuth
