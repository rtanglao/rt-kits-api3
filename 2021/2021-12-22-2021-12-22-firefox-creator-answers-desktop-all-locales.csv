FF sucks about 500 MB to be run, on top of which it takes 500 MB per tab, and that makes it impossible to run a research on my 8 GB Mac. Yesterday I was looking for a lamp and had no more than 7 tabs open, 3 of which were largely text, 2 were online shops, and 1-2 were websites with pictures. No Facebook or social media, no YouTube. FF froze, made the whole Mac freeze (well, Mac is garbage nowadays but let's leave that out of this topic), and I had to wait MINUTES before I could close it, because the computer was nonreactive.  </p><p>When I check online, I see people being like ""why can't it manage more than 50 tabs?"". 50?!?! My computer dies with a maximum of 10 when it's only text websites! </p><p>So, I guess there's something wrong with this. </p><p>- I don't have many extensions (SimilarWeb, VPN, and Flash Player), I always use incognito so I can't use the plugin that allows me to use several accounts at the same time, so I can't see what's messing with my Mac. - The Activity Monitor (pretty much Task Manager on Windows) shows ""FirefoxCP Isolated Web Content"" for each tab, could that have anything to do with my problem? - CPU usage is very low, some 0.5 to 10% max during heavy use. - I seem to remember I used to have dozens of tabs open in the past, although I can't be sure. Is this a recent problem? </p><p>I really hope there's a way to solve this, because now I always fear that opening FF while on a Zoom meeting might freeze the whole thing. </p><p>Thanks to anyone who might want to shed some light on this big problem. </p><p>Screenshots: RAM and CPU usage with 2 tabs open. Two, taking more than 1 GB of RAM and about 250 threads in total? While using 0.2% of the CPU? I'm lost </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;memoryusage;mac-os-x-1014;firefox-950;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1468408;,muvuth
