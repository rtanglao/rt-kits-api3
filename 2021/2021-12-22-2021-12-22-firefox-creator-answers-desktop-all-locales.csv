Funny thing is it still works OK with Chrome and I really do not want to go back to using that!  When you go into Settings and select sync and everything is checked and Saved....It still does nothing.  Firefox 95.0.2 64bit Windows 10 pro.  This just stopped working recently and the only thing I can think was added was Norton 360 but I have used Norton antivirus in the past and never had an issue, plus any windows updates.  Really irritating! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,other,en-US,"",davespc01
