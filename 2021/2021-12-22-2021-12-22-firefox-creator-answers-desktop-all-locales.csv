So, please bear with me re how to understand my question. </p><p>I have no idea what I did, but after getting the latest Firefox, I cannot access Reddit.  Let me explain:  I was able to click on each topic/post freely on Reddit.  Now when I visit Reddit, the topics/posts are stagnant and when I click on a topic/post, it goes to another page and I have to click on the URL to read the post.  Also, if there are multiple pages on a post, the only page I can see is the first, I cannot click through to view anything additional. </p><p>It seems that Firefox is blocking Reddit.  I hope this explains this issue. </p><p>Also, I cannot find the ""settings"" for Firefox now... to allow unlimited scroll and to automatically go to a new page. </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;firefox-650;,firefox,websites,en-US,1468456;,covfefe

Used to have no problems until upgrading to Win11, so something sort of broke with the interplay between the two. </p><p>--First noticed on YouTube, no audio for videos.  --Then, lots of other places too. My audio device works fine, plays computer system sounds, local mp3s, etc., it's a bluetooth Bose. But internet vids have no sound. </p><p>In some threads I researched,the solution seemed to be to go through the sound mixer and check output settings. I did that to no avail. Everything seemed fine, although it calls the bluetooth speaker ""headphones."" And then to make sure the browser had the right to use the mic (but the bluetooth speaker has no mic). I did that to no avail. Then, what seemed to work was autoplay settings. Changing the autoplay setting for videos to ""on"" for FF, fixed the problem after rebooting the browser.  </p><p>Or, so I thought. In fact, every time I come back, I have to do it again. Or, I have to pretend to do it again.  The setting to allow autoplay remains correct, as I left it. Oddly, just going back into that portion of settings seems to have some effect. I guess I'm giving it a dirty look. ;) Then, reboot browser, works again, as before. </p><p>I have to do this for every session (or, actually, I'm just loading Edge; it's faster) to get audio fro internet videos.  </p><p>Any suggestions on how to make this fix permanent? Again, the setting stays where I leave it. But it is as if it has to be changed again. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-950;firefox-9502;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",monsieurms

FF sucks about 500 MB to be run, on top of which it takes 500 MB per tab, and that makes it impossible to run a research on my 8 GB Mac. Yesterday I was looking for a lamp and had no more than 7 tabs open, 3 of which were largely text, 2 were online shops, and 1-2 were websites with pictures. No Facebook or social media, no YouTube. FF froze, made the whole Mac freeze (well, Mac is garbage nowadays but let's leave that out of this topic), and I had to wait MINUTES before I could close it, because the computer was nonreactive.  </p><p>When I check online, I see people being like ""why can't it manage more than 50 tabs?"". 50?!?! My computer dies with a maximum of 10 when it's only text websites! </p><p>So, I guess there's something wrong with this. </p><p>- I don't have many extensions (SimilarWeb, VPN, and Flash Player), I always use incognito so I can't use the plugin that allows me to use several accounts at the same time, so I can't see what's messing with my Mac. - The Activity Monitor (pretty much Task Manager on Windows) shows ""FirefoxCP Isolated Web Content"" for each tab, could that have anything to do with my problem? - CPU usage is very low, some 0.5 to 10% max during heavy use. - I seem to remember I used to have dozens of tabs open in the past, although I can't be sure. Is this a recent problem? </p><p>I really hope there's a way to solve this, because now I always fear that opening FF while on a Zoom meeting might freeze the whole thing. </p><p>Thanks to anyone who might want to shed some light on this big problem. </p><p>Screenshots: RAM and CPU usage with 2 tabs open. Two, taking more than 1 GB of RAM and about 250 threads in total? While using 0.2% of the CPU?
