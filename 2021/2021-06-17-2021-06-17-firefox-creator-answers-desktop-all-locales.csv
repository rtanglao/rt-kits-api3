There is no way to lock your account from outside. When they have access to everything you can’t do anything. Now this scammer, he literally runs a scam site has all my info. Google doesn’t have a number to call. Yahoo lady was an idiot, I said I’ve been hacked I want my account locked down they can’t do that. He changed the carts on my pc and deleted the recovery drive. Had access to my phone and did the same to that. Stole most or all of my crypto and there’s no recourse to these people the government is spending trillions of dollars, they can’t setup a number to call. This guy has stole millions from his scam site. Ruined my life and no one does anything. I’m literally on leave from work because I’m a manic depression with suicidal tendencies. I just want a person to talk to who can help. Google, one of the biggest companies in the world has no call center. How ridiculous is that. All my money I had. All my private information stolen. My I’d, my ssn, all my passwords. They need a simple button that says if you’ve been hacked click here. Even if you haven’t and someone is just doing it, it’s better than all the negatives that these people can cause. These losers hide behind the internet ruining lives and these huge companies make it so hard to do anything because they don’t care. They don’t care, we’re just the little people. Its insane that google doesn’t have a number to call for hacks. All companies should because it’s so common and these people are making more money I’ll make in my entire life by sitting behind there desk ruining people’s lives. I’m so beyond every feelings in the world. If this guy was in front of me I would destroy him physically. Firefox lock my damn account .
