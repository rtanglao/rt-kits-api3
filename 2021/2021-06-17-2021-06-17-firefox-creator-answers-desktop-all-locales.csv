After the latest update this is no longer available. Please reintroduce this, as I sometimes fail to see the pop up window which allows me to stop it. If I fail to stop it in time, firefox freezes and I have to reboot every time. This time make it a red window, so that the warning is immediately noticeable.

Then, once it's done loading, the map background disappears, and I'm left with only the names and the pins. Enclosed is a picture of the area around Paris, France, after it ""went dark"". </p><p>If I drag and drop the map, or zoom in or out, the map reappears and is perfectly readable. But as soon as I stop moving it, the map tiles disappear again, and I'm stuck with only the names and pins again. </p><p><br> I've checked under other browsers (Edge, for instance), and the problem seems to occur only on Firefox. I've removed ALL my google-related cookies (because of old answers to problems with Google Maps, saying to try that), and it didn't help. I tried reloading the page, emptying the cache, didn't work either. </p><p>Am I the only one to experience this ?

Foolish me Will I ever learn ?   I can honestly say I see nothing improved from the Firefox I have used for years but found one big problem. The drop down menus have been altered to double or triple spacing, admittedly easier to read but, with years of use, my menus are large and now take forever to find the address I am looking for.  How do I restore single spacing in drop down menus? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,1422093;,dexrek
