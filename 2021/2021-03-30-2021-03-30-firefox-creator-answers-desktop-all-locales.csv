It's true that a couple years ago<a href=""https://www.behangservicenederland.com/behangen-schilderen.html"" rel=""nofollow"">,</a> A Mozilla employee found that YouTube loaded 5x slower on Firefox than Chrome. This was due to Google updating YouTube which relied on an interface which was implemented in Chrome (but not in other browsers). What's unclear is if they were just optimizing for Chrome or deliberately slowing down everything else. Speaking as a software engineer, these kinds of things are very easy to overlook or do unintentionally - there are so many different browsers and bowser versions out there, optimizing for all of them is tough and so it's possible that Google optimized for Chrome and tested to make sure stuff still worked on Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc, but didn't do rigorous performance testing on those browsers. However Google is a big company with many arms and lots of resources so it's hard to say for certain. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",spencerross942

As you know, in preferences I have the option to allow automatic updates or to first be asked before updating, but it's a Morgan's Fork. If you don't allow automatic updates  - which is out of the question - then they are going to bug the pee out of you until you update. That makes me dig my heels in deeper.
