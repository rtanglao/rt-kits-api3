Respectfully, please no lectures about just going ahead and updating or how I should keep my browser updated. We all make personal choices about how we want to manage our technology. I googled this first and found so many other people asking the same question, but no firm solutions. As you know, in preferences I have the option to allow automatic updates or to first be asked before updating, but it's a Morgan's Fork. If you don't allow automatic updates  - which is out of the question - then they are going to bug the pee out of you until you update. That makes me dig my heels in deeper. Either I find a way to turn off these annoying notifications or I am done with Firefox. Any assistance will be greatly appreciated. </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-840;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",kinggeorgewhatever
