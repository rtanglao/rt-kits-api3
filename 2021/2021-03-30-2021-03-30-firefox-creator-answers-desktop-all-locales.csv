I may in the future also add GERMAN and SPANISH. </p><p>4. The main language highlighted is ENGLISH UNITED STATES. </p><p>5.

I have four mail servers: GOOGLE, HOT, YAHOO &amp; VERIZON by way of AMERICA ONLINE. </p><p>7. Here is the problem with MOZILLA FIREFOX that does not occur with GOOGLE CHROME: With CHECK SPELLING clicked-checked on, all of the languages will result error with a red erratic line underneath them, even if correctly spelled. Sometimes an American spelling will have it, apologize, sometimes a British spelling, apologise, and not the other, and sometimes both. Likewise with French and Italian. I may type one message using all four languages, and errors for all.  </p><p>8. If I compose an electronic mail message using GOOGLE CHROME, whether with one language, or I type it using words in all four languages in one message, if the spelling is correct there is not a language error red line. Only when I misspell a word in any of the four, this is what is supposed to happen with MOZILLA FIREFOX,  but it doesn't. </p><p>9. With MOZILLA FIREFOX, I must unclick the CHECK SPELLING to avoid the red line errors,Yet, I won't get a red line error if I should indeed type a word wrongly. With CHECK SPELLING even correctly spelled words in any language result red line error! </p><p>10. Why is this taking place? I have correctly chosen the four languages, chosen United States English as the main language for MOZILLA FIREFOX browser. This never happened with my DELL INSPIRON computer and WINDOWS 7 HOME.

It's true that a couple years ago<a href=""https://www.behangservicenederland.com/behangen-schilderen.html"" rel=""nofollow"">,</a> A Mozilla employee found that YouTube loaded 5x slower on Firefox than Chrome. This was due to Google updating YouTube which relied on an interface which was implemented in Chrome (but not in other browsers). What's unclear is if they were just optimizing for Chrome or deliberately slowing down everything else. Speaking as a software engineer, these kinds of things are very easy to overlook or do unintentionally - there are so many different browsers and bowser versions out there, optimizing for all of them is tough and so it's possible that Google optimized for Chrome and tested to make sure stuff still worked on Firefox, Safari, Edge, etc, but didn't do rigorous performance testing on those browsers. However Google is a big company with many arms and lots of resources so it's hard to say for certain. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1402208;,spencerross942
