When I clicked it open, everything was gone. Bookmarks, tabs, add-ons, etc. </p><p>I looked in profiles and there are three folders, with gobbledygook names. The contents of each seem unique to one another, so I don't think one is the old profile and another is new, simply because the file titles would be the same — right? </p><p>I deleted one and restarted, and Firefox recreated it. Everything was still gone. </p><p>I looked in ""About:Profiles"" and there are two. I made both the default and restarted, same results. Everything still missing. </p><p>Is it possible that Firefox just got rid of the old profiles on the upgrade?  </p><p>Is there another place it could be hiding? </p><p>Hoping for a miracle here.
