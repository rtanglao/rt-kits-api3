This presents no issues at all such as freezing or going slow or closing the browser.  However upon opening Firefox when I have 75 plus tabs, it wont connect or load the tabs for 2 or 3 minutes. I have the option set to only load the 3 pinned tabs on start up and the contents of any other tab is not loaded until I click on that tab. The 3 pinned tabs and any other tab I click on, will try to load but nothing happens then 2/3 minutes later, they will connect and everything is fine until the next time I close it &amp; reopen. I can connect with any other browser or service whilst firefox is trying to load  on opening but it is only firefox that has the issue. Is there another setting in about:config I need to change/increase to prevent this? </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1414680;,samdell
