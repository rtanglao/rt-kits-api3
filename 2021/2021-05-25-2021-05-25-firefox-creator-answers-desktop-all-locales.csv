I do NOT want to open them in new tabs, or to open on the same page as I find them. On my XP machine (which is on 52.9.0 ESR) there's no problem. On this version (86) on Win 10, there only seems to be an option for open in new tab (otherwise it will open where you are), which means I have to remember to right click and select New Window while avoiding New Tab and Private Browsing. This might sound like a fuss over nothing to the followers of fashion, but I have hated tabs from the first time I encountered them.

Generally, I don't wait, but I know that if I wait long enough, at least sometimes, they will load, but the slowness persists after that, so it's not like a network hiccup.  To resolve the problem, I simply close Firefox, being sure to kill all FF processes (often check Task Manager to be sure) and then simply restart Firefox.  Voila!  Lightening fast again. </p><p>If I leave even one FF process running, the problem will persist. </p><p>If, while Firefox is struggling to load, I open another browser, say perhaps Chrome (sorry) and attempt the same site... instant load.  A different site: instant load. </p><p>If I open FF on the computer next to this one that is running Ubuntu, it works just fine.  I do not have this issue on Linux. </p><p>I was connecting over WiFi, but am now hardwired to a switch connected to cable modem </p><p>I am running Windows 8.1 and FF 88.0.1 (64 bit). </p><p>I use Google Voice and have much trouble with it, including slow page loads even when other pages are loading normally.  This is the legacy Voice.  Sometimes, I get the notice that a page is slowing FF down and I believe it is referring to Voice </p><p>I use the following extensions: Firefox Multi-account Containers, Facebook Container, Honey, Internet Download Manager + IDM Integration Module, and Tails Verification. </p><p>My only plugins are the two defaults (or so they claim to be): Open H264 Video Codec and Widevine Content Decryption Module. </p><p>I had disabled DNS over HTTPS as part of troubleshooting this.  As of right now, I have re-enabled it. </p><p>I have reviewed many posts regarding slow page loads.  None of them are quite the same as mine and most are somewhat reversed -- the users report initial slow page loads that get better once the first page loads. I also have not seen any where the problem is so easily (temporarily) resolved. </p><p>Any help will be appreciated. </p><p>Thank you, </p><p>JP Howlett </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-81;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",howlett.jp

I got that the older data from the Firefox Account repository replaced the local mod, not viceversa. I've always thought that the sync operation updated older with newer...
