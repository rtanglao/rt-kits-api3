Also why must you whitelist for instance my Gmail every time I log back in in the same session or after rebooting? It seems like all these once great apps are being compromised more and more as the sorry big tech giants use their propaganda and censoring to mold the public view into this one world government ran by the criminals that puppeteer these social media platforms? You people better wake up and stop all this invasion of privacy and stop using apps that insist on having control of your contacts and the ability to make send and delete texts sms and calls. All my problems are in windows 10 home another joke on humanity . If you made as many errors as the developers and creators in windows 10 you would be fired no questions asked. I'm learning Linux as fast as I can to get away from all this headache. </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,other,en-US,1414647;,1ARICHARDhead
