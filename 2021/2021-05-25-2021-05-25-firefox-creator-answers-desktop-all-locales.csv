When I clicked it open, everything was gone. Bookmarks, tabs, add-ons, etc. </p><p>I looked in profiles and there are three folders, with gobbledygook names. The contents of each seem unique to one another, so I don't think one is the old profile and another is new, simply because the file titles would be the same — right? </p><p>I deleted one and restarted, and Firefox recreated it. Everything was still gone. </p><p>I looked in ""About:Profiles"" and there are two. I made both the default and restarted, same results. Everything still missing. </p><p>Is it possible that Firefox just got rid of the old profiles on the upgrade?  </p><p>Is there another place it could be hiding? </p><p>Hoping for a miracle here. Thanks </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jroberts.ideas

I put the autoconfig.js and the firefox.cfg files all in the right place, but it didn't work. When closed and reopened the browser, it said ""Failed to read the configuration file. Please contact your system administrator."" I figured out that the very last line: </p><pre>pref(""general.config.sandbox_enabled"", false); </pre> <p>was causing it to say that.
