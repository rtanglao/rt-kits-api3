I have been loyal for years, but since moving to a new computer there have been multiple problems, especially with Lastpass password manager. Life draining..... </p><p>After many problems, I did manage to get it to work: IE: By working I mean that I would sign into Lastpass using the icon on the address bar. Then, whenever I opened a tab for a password protected website, it would auto-fill.  </p><p>So, what has gone wrong now is that whilst I can sign into Lastpass (using the icon on the address bar), and the Lastpass dialogue box appears, instead of the dialogue box 'populating', it remains blank (as per the enclosed pic). Something has blocked it.  </p><p>I think this started happening after I added 'AdBlock' to the address bar (I have now subsequently removed it).  </p><p>And why did I have confidence in 'AdBlock'? Because it appeared in the add-ons in the Firefox menu, so I naturally assumed that this was a Firefox recommended add-on.  </p><p>SO, I suspect that AdBlock has caused this problem, but I don't really know. All I know is Lastpass is not working, whereas it does on Chrome.  </p><p>Will I ever get the hours back for time wasted writing this? Or the other previous merry hours of ‘fun’ just trying to restore the Lastpass icon onto the address bar. Simple? Not in a million years!.... </p><p>Over to you. Do you care? Can you sort it?  Or is this going to be the straw that broke the camel’s back?
