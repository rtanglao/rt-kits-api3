Ever since the latest Firefox update, the star ratings accompanying my reviews on my website have shrunk. They used to be the perfect size, but now they're tiny and look ridiculous. The stars I use aren't by code but rather ones than I cut and paste from a saved file. The words are all the same size as previously; it's only the stars that have shrunk. This has affected all the past hundreds of articles on my site as well as the new ones I add. What can I do to make the stars bigger as they were before this unfortunate update? Unfortunately, I don't have an example of how they used to look (because how could I have predicted such a nonsensical and user-unfriendly change?), but attached is how they look now. Thanks. </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;firefox-870;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",mattonmovies
