I have verified with Apple support but this is not 100% a FireFox problem, because it turns out the voice control is very iffy in multiple non-Apple programs (Photoshop, BBEdit), and it is iffy in multiple Apple programs as well--sometimes it works with Mail and sometimes it does not. While I do hope that my advisor will be able to get back to me eventually with a solution, I am searching for other ways to address the issue. </p><p>The biggest problem for my uses is lack of function with with Firefox.  Sometimes it works if I start some dictation in an open textedit file, and then switch to an already open browser window and text box in Firefox.  Sometimes this does not work. </p><p>I did find another conversation in the Apple forums where someone was using chrome and they were able to adjust a chrome setting for ""native accessibility API support"" but even though I found this setting in Firefox about:config and set it to true, I'm still having the problem. </p><p>Any tips on settings that can be adjusted to increase the chances of success with voice control? </p><p>Now on macOS Monterey 12.0.1 and FireFox beta channel 94.0.
