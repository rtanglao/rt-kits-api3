A few hours ago, when I started clicking the ""Back"" button on my house, my Firefox screen could convert to Responsive Design Mode, which is something I did not even know existed before today. If I then click the ""Forward"" button on my mouse, the ""Manage Bookmarks"" window opens. This started all of a sudden. When I click the forward and back buttons on the browser itself, it works fine. The problem occurs when I click the forward and back buttons on my mouse. I have not changed my mouse settings or done anything with the mouse software. My mouse is a Logitech MX Master 3. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,other,en-US,1454975;1454976;1454977;,terrencecain
