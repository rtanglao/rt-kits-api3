I do not want to use the default location which is my user/downloads location.  I use a small SSD as my OS drive and a much larger conventional drive for my files.  Firefox is set to download files to D:\D Drive Downloads but when it downloads files it is sending them to my user/download folder.  I've seen other questions like this but typically has to do with the download BEFORE it completes, ie .part file.  This is after the completion of the download.  There are no special permissions or administrator controls implemented on my machine, it is as it has always been but some version way back Firefox decided that my user/download folder was the only place it was going to save files.
