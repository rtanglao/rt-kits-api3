Basically, no matter what is already open in other tabs, I always want Firefox to follow my directions and open whatever website I type in the URL in my current tab. I don't care if, say, Twitter is already open in an earlier tab. If I type in <a href=""http://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">twitter.com</a>, I want it to open in that tab, not switch to the previous tab.  For example, there may be some sites that update regularly, but I want to hang onto the older version for a bit, so I leave it open. But then if I want to see the newer updated page, Firefox will not allow me to do it. What do I have to search for to switch to True or False to change this? </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",accident55
