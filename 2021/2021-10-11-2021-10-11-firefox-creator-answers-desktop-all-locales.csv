(Wrong favicon) How can i reload favicon of a specific bookmark?

Please give me a solution on this. In some years ago there was an extension with name favicon reloader. It was ok. But does not exist anymore. </p><p>After reinstalling Firefox (to new 64-bit version), I've lost all of my favicons.  I'm seeing that only way to get them back is to individually select each bookmark.  Is there a way to get the bookmarks to go and automatically download their favicons so my bookmarks will be repopulated again? </p>",windows-7;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-930;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1450061;,Vortex.Cubes.CEO

I always run in private mode, so all cookies etc are deleted. I have about 100 login passwords saved, but use a FF primary password. The PC is protected at startup with the standard pin code.

I Have a Dell Latitude E6430ATG and I am running Windows 10 and I loaded a 2016 version of MS Office and suddenly Firefox shows no pages -- everything is white except for the address bar and, when I try to open any web pages, tabs at the top of the page. Any web page (as supposedly indicated in the address bar) is completely blank -- just white space. The ""Open Application Menu"" button is there and I get the drop down menu, but the only things I can access are Bookmarks, History, More Tools and Help. Cannot access Passwords or Add-ons and themes. I did a Malwarebytes search and found no problems. I uninstalled everything (Firefox and Mozilla Maintenance Service), deleted both files/folders, and, using MS Edge (which does load all web pages), downloaded a new Firefox Installer and, supposedly, Firefox went through the installation process and said it was installed. I clicked on the con on my desktop and Firefox open with same result -- address bar and (once I type in or select a suggested web address) tabs at top, but no web pages load and Open Application Menu only gives me access to Bookmarks, History, More Tools and Help. I am stumped. Is there anything in Windows I need to disable/enable to get my example of Firefox to work? If you need more info to suggest solutions, just ask. I am no tech wizard, so please be patient. Thanks. </p>",desktop;websites;,firefox,websites,en-US,1450040;1450041;,silberfile1

If I type in <a href=""http://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">twitter.com</a>, I want it to open in that tab, not switch to the previous tab.
