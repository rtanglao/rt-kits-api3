Maybe this is the right place for the feedback. </p><p>The release note of FF Ver:93 states this:""When available system memory is critically low, Firefox on Windows will automatically unload tabs based on their last access time, memory usage, and other attributes. This should help reduce Firefox out-of-memory crashes. Switching to an unloaded tab automatically reloads it."" </p><p>This is something those of us with modest RAM (4GB, in my case) have been waiting for, for quite a while. But, FF continues to hog significant memory in spite of the claimed changes as above. I don't see any perceivable changes to my system performance thus far even a few days since the update. The issue, as you'd know better, elevated RAM usage invariably causes a continual spike in Paging, leading to excessive Disk (HDD) usage &gt; resulting in an unresponsive system, which eventually ends up in a system freeze (in my case at least). The only way out being a hard power-down and restart of the system. </p><p>I have also set the ""Content process limit"" to 4 in the settings to no avail. We'd appreciate if you could configure FF behavior to adapt when system resources are low than wait for things to be critical. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,other,en-US,1450091;,fflgn

I have tried this on other browsers and it works fine, so the issue is related to Firefox specifically. </p><p>2 - Auto open of documents - When I click on a link to open a PDF I get the pop up asking me what I want to do with it, despite clicking the box saying ""Always do this action from now on"" I still get that pop up every time. I have the ""open in Firefox"" option set in the menu but it is being ignored. </p><p>I have disabled any add-ons for Firefox and tried again but the issue still persists so is not being caused by them. Something isn't right and I've been trying to sort this myself for ages, so hopefully someone can either help or confirm there's a bug somewhere in Firefox that needs fixing.

I Have a Dell Latitude E6430ATG and I am running Windows 10 and I loaded a 2016 version of MS Office and suddenly Firefox shows no pages -- everything is white except for the address bar and, when I try to open any web pages, tabs at the top of the page. Any web page (as supposedly indicated in the address bar) is completely blank -- just white space. The ""Open Application Menu"" button is there and I get the drop down menu, but the only things I can access are Bookmarks, History, More Tools and Help. Cannot access Passwords or Add-ons and themes. I did a Malwarebytes search and found no problems. I uninstalled everything (Firefox and Mozilla Maintenance Service), deleted both files/folders, and, using MS Edge (which does load all web pages), downloaded a new Firefox Installer and, supposedly, Firefox went through the installation process and said it was installed. I clicked on the con on my desktop and Firefox open with same result -- address bar and (once I type in or select a suggested web address) tabs at top, but no web pages load and Open Application Menu only gives me access to Bookmarks, History, More Tools and Help. I am stumped. Is there anything in Windows I need to disable/enable to get my example of Firefox to work? If you need more info to suggest solutions, just ask.
