On the left, an iPad Air 4th Gen (15.01) and on the right a MacBook Air M1 (11.6). One would question if it was the same image. If I flip to Safari on iPadOS, it renders ~the same colour as Firefox on my M1. If I then save the image to ""Photos"" from either Firefox on MacOS or iPadOS and Safari, I get exactly the same colour rendering for all the images saved. </p><p>So it looks like Firefox is getting it badly wrong on iPadOS (the same with iOS 15.01) when it presents its colours. It doesn't matter if I'm in Dark or Light mode.

Everytime i start the OS, i would first create a folder and copy paste it, so firefox would start right where i left it off.  this worked, until i decided to make Kubuntu permanent.  at first things were going good, but after sometime, my OS would stop recognizing my headphones and audio port completely.  at first i blamed it on my OS and went about doing somethings here and there to adjust by.  but looking back, i had installed some DRM to play some video on the net. so in a desperate fix, i replaced the current .mozilla file with a backup i had.  the thing worked like a charm and my audio was fixed and everything was going ok, except for the occasional fixes so that my OS would channel the audio to the right output. that is, until the problem rise again!  this time, i hadn't installed anything like i did previously, so i replaced the .mozilla file again and it worked! but i can't keep doing this and i had also faced the same problem in my windows, resulting my change in OS in the first place (I think its the same issue, because whatever i did didn't fix it and windows is more sophisticated that i wouldn't know).

This should help reduce Firefox out-of-memory crashes. Switching to an unloaded tab automatically reloads it."" </p><p>This is something those of us with modest RAM (4GB, in my case) have been waiting for, for quite a while. But, FF continues to hog significant memory in spite of the claimed changes as above. I don't see any perceivable changes to my system performance thus far even a few days since the update. The issue, as you'd know better, elevated RAM usage invariably causes a continual spike in Paging, leading to excessive Disk (HDD) usage &gt; resulting in an unresponsive system, which eventually ends up in a system freeze (in my case at least). The only way out being a hard power-down and restart of the system. </p><p>I have also set the ""Content process limit"" to 4 in the settings to no avail.

I Have a Dell Latitude E6430ATG and I am running Windows 10 and I loaded a 2016 version of MS Office and suddenly Firefox shows no pages -- everything is white except for the address bar and, when I try to open any web pages, tabs at the top of the page. Any web page (as supposedly indicated in the address bar) is completely blank -- just white space. The ""Open Application Menu"" button is there and I get the drop down menu, but the only things I can access are Bookmarks, History, More Tools and Help. Cannot access Passwords or Add-ons and themes. I did a Malwarebytes search and found no problems. I uninstalled everything (Firefox and Mozilla Maintenance Service), deleted both files/folders, and, using MS Edge (which does load all web pages), downloaded a new Firefox Installer and, supposedly, Firefox went through the installation process and said it was installed. I clicked on the con on my desktop and Firefox open with same result -- address bar and (once I type in or select a suggested web address) tabs at top, but no web pages load and Open Application Menu only gives me access to Bookmarks, History, More Tools and Help. I am stumped. Is there anything in Windows I need to disable/enable to get my example of Firefox to work? If you need more info to suggest solutions, just ask.
