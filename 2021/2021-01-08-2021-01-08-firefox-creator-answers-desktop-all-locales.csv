So I found the instructions: about:config  - went through the process - search for mousewheel.min_line_scroll_amount   When that came up I think I saw three choices, one was Boolean and the instructions said to double click, and change the number.  But when I did, nothing happened.  So I clicked the funny arrows on the far right, and the three options  changed to just True and False.    I got out of it.   </p><p>I don't remember what I left it on, so I went back to check and the three options came up, Boolean, which is dotted, Number and String.  Should Boolean be the one dotted?   </p><p>The far right has a big +   Won't touch it.  But is that how you'd change the scroll speed?    </p><p>I'll probably leave it alone, I can scroll.  </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",Steve09

The security settings in DOMSA have SLL set to 128-bit or higher and use SHA512 which is the highest available. Until Firefox version 82 i would get the error prompt ""Errors code MOZILLA_PKIX_ERROR_SELF_SIGNED_CERT when logging on to DOMSA for the first time, but using the advanced option I could accept and permit this login, after which future logins worked fine. </p><p>Since the release of Firefox v.84 I can no longer use this workaround and have had to force these systems back to Firefox v.82 - which is irritating because it doesn't seem possible to prevent Firefox trying to update and offering me an update dialogue every time I open Firefox. </p><p>The Dell 1950's cannot run a later version of DOMSA and I am not intending to upgrade to a later server OS version right now - and I don't want to go back to having IEII as my default browser. I do not think Dell have released later certificates or security fixes for DOMSA either. So for the time being, I am locked to the above configuration. </p><p>So two questions -  </p><p>How can I fix later firefox versions (v.84 and later) to allow me access to DOMSA? </p><p>If I can't - how do I prevent Firefox v.82 from updating (and from bothering me with update prompts continuously. </p><p>I hope someone out there understands the issues here better than I do and has a workable soloution - preferably one which allows me to contiunue with future Firefox upgrades. </p><p>Thanks / Adrian </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",channel6dk
