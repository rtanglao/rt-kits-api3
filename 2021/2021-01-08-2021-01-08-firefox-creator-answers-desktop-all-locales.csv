In every case I have tried, OneTab is missing from the add-ons in my new installation or profile.

Since the add-on was not present, the data was gone at the second invocation.  However, repeating this process at least allowed me to export the OneTab data from *one* profile on the first invocation.  Unfortunately, this method is completely useless under Windows, as are the recommended approaches of using Firefox sync (with sync turned on for add-ons) or replacing the contents of a newly created profile with the contents of an old or saved one.
