It's taken a while to notice and then figure out the pattern, and here's how it seems to go... </p><p>I launch Firefox, which already has many open tabs; it's set to reopen my previous session. Typically I then open a new tab to check my email, do a DuckDuckGo search, or something else (but the activity/website doesn't seem to matter). Then something in my email or my search will inspire me to open a second new tab. All of a sudden when I do that, the first new tab of the session is gone. So for example if I was checking my email and saw something I wanted to research, I'd open a new tab and all of a sudden the email tab is gone. </p><p>At least a few times I've then opened a *third* tab to go back to the website I just lost, and suddenly the vanished tab will reappear, and I'd then have duplicate tabs on the same website.  </p><p>Much more often the vanished tab does not return until *later.* That is, I eventually close Firefox and eventually reopen it, and suddenly there it is again. I believe, but I'm not certain, that this *always* causes the vanished tab to reappear. It's a pain to rely on this fix, though, especially since it can take something like 20 seconds to reload all those tabs. </p><p>I think this strange behavior only happens when I first launch Firefox -- in other words, only once per session. I've never noticed it hapening a second time in the same session. I can freely open new tabs without fear of losing another (at least none that are in the visible part of the tab row).  </p><p>Anyone else have this issue? Or can you recreate it? </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-840;firefox-8402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",RichardB.

I don't care for help, I don't even care if there's an easy solution to my problem, the fact that it exists is insane. This browser, if left unclosed for a few hours, uses WHATEVER left over space is left on my ram sticks. I have 32gb of ddr4 ram, this means that if I have 18gb/s of ram available in my machine FIREFOX RUNS AT 18/gb A DANG SECOND. That is sinfully high, I know for a fact it's just taking up whatever space is left because if it ran at even a fraction of that memory usage it would be completely useless on almost every computer in the entire world. I'd also like to point out that if you google my exact problem you will find many people like me complaining about firefox using 1-2gb/s AS THAT IS A VERY HIGH NUMBER....mine is running at 9x that number, so either I have a very special version of firefox or this browser just likes to say ""oh you have enough ram to run about 100 instances of a normal web browser at the same time, how about now?"". Like I said please do not offer me a solution to my problem. Please instead figure out why your web browser, which is one of the big three and has been around for well over a decade, is completely filling people's ram decks regardless of how much ram they have for no discernable reason. I should not have restart firefox or change the settings or delete a system file or run a powershell script or any other half baked ""my cousin made this app for his senior thesis"" style solution for your web browser used by TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE to work on my $2000 computer.
