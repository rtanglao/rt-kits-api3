It is probably caused because I chose the choice that setting Bing as my default search engine of all browsers and the application (Bing Wallpaper) reset all those engines. I have tried removing these engines from my settings list then adding them back, but the icons are still invisible. I have not tried to uninstall and reinstall my Firefox. </p><p>My Firefox version: 94.0.2 My OS version: Windows 7 6.1.7601, Service Pack 1 </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-940;,firefox,other,en-US,"",whc1109

However, I am someone who enjoys playing games in their browser. And it occured to me, that firefox seemingly lags and stutters whenever i try to play a game. </p><p>The two games i have tested are Zombs Royale and Wormax IO. These are two very minimalistic games with nothing much to them. The slowest computers can handle them... </p><p>I have a GTX 1080, with 12 gb of rams. I also tested on my laptop, which has unknown specs, but 4gb of ram. </p><p>Both devices performed worse then how they would perform in chromium based browsers. I wish to stick with firefox, as i hear security is a virtue with Mozilla, and Chrome really just wants to steal your data. </p><p>I might add, that i did follow a couple steps to make my browser more secure, I didn't disable stuff like webgl, but i disabled a bunch of other settings, here is the video i followed: </p><p><a href=""https://youtu.be/xxWXLlfqNAo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/xxWXLlfqNAo</a>  </p><p>I did install a few add-ons, such as Privacy Badger, uBlock Origin, HTTPS Everywhere, and nightTab(I had this on chrome, and without it i feel home sick.) </p><p>I am unsure why these problems occur, as far as i know, my computer should be able to handle this. </p><p>I cannot find any other questions related to this, and it is really odd to me. I should also mention, Firefox is also quite slow anyways, it just feels slower than chrome, so i'm unsure if it's an optimization issue or what, but this occurs on all of my computers. </p><p>I hope someone can help me thank you. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-940;firefox-9402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",official.skylightgaming
