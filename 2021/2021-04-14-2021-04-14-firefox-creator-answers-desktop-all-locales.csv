Mozilla updated automatically and I lost all of my tabs (over a 100 tabs, mostly with books I wanted to buy / compare prices), couldn't restore the session and had no history. After a dramatic and prolonged freakout, I actually found help on this site and managed to open the correct upgrades.jsonlz4 files with the jeffersoncher scrounger website. I meant to save all of the links in a word file since I no longer trusted firefox to open my tabs after an update, but real life happened. I kept putting it off and was content to have the tabs on hand as a list on the scrounger website. But then ANOTHER automatic update happened and now I no longer find the old .jsonlz4 file - I have a few really old ones (from 2017 and 2019) but the one from around the time period of the first tab loss only has tabs about restoring lost history. I now, just as before, again have no history to find the tabs with the books I want that way. My question is: I would very much like to have those tabs back - some of those books were meant as gifts and finding them the analog way is possible, but very time-consuming. Is there any way I could find the correct .jsonlz4 file (I even remember the date it was modified as shown in file explorer - or should I just give up the whole affair as lost and no longer waste time on it? I'll try reinstalling firefox after I post this message, but given that it didn't work last time, I'm not very optimistic. </p><p>Thanks in advance, all the best Ana </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",ana.perpar

This is exactly the kind of unnecessary interface change which annoys so many Firefox users. Okay, so why is it bad? Most ""normal"" users don't fiddle with interfaces, they accept it as it is. They expect functions they often use to stay in the same spot. If it's no longer there they think it's gone (and they're frustrated). They surely won't go looking for it in a customization menu. For me as a web designer the screenshot tool was extremely handy when dealing with clients, because it was very easy to explain where to find and how to use it, to send a screenshot of a website problem. Again, many common users don't know how to take screenshots with their system tools, so this was really helpful. Now, instead of explaining where to find it, I'll first have to explain how to customize the toolbar, what the item looks like, how to position it, etc. etc. The simplicity and helpfulness is gone. Suggestion: leave the screenshot function where it is by default, but offer the advanced users a way to make it a customizable item. Everyone is happy. </p><p>P.S.
