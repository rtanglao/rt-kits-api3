Since yesterday, non of the pages in Firefox are loading. On the same computer, using other browsers there are no issues at all. </p><p>I tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox. Purged it as well. Tested with a new profile, (firefox -P...) , same results, nothing loads. No error messages or anything. I will just have the small loading dash on the firefox tab and that's it. </p><p>I can't even access localhost, or the troubleshooting settings or the web developer tools. Nothing will open at all. </p><p>I found this thread mentioning that it might be related to libnss3. But I have the most recent and stable version available already installed: 2:3.42.1-1+deb10u3 </p><p><a href=""https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=981184"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=981184</a> </p><p>I uninstalled firefox, removed the folder .mozilla and just tried to make sure no trace of Firefox is left. Reinstalled it again, same thing... </p><p>I have a VPN, and the same results also with or without the VPN connected. </p><p>Any ideas please? </p><p>Thanks!
