How can I sync in a way that transfers all my bookmarks and folders etc from my desktop computer to other devices, rather than in the other direction.

Firefox must've updated recently and changed things so that my bookmark dropdown menu is gone. Now, when I want to access a bookmark, I have to click on ""manage bookmarks"" which opens a new library window and I have to then find it in there. It's a lot more time consuming and inefficient. Used to just be able to scroll down after one click of the bookmark menu. </p><p>I've searched other answers to this problem, many of which involved people's bookmarks being stored in the ""other bookmarks"" folder and being told to move them into the ""bookmarks menu"" folder which would cause them to dropdown. I've tried moving them into all 3 folders: Bookmarks Menu, Other bookmarks, and bookmarks toolbar, and there is no change. Here is a screenshot of what I see when I open my bookmarks: </p> <ul><li>To clarify, the ""recent bookmarks"" that shows up is of no interest to me and would also like to remove that. I don't want a dropdown of recent bookmarks, I want a dropdown of ALL bookmarks. </li></ul> <p>PLEASE if you can help me I would be eternally grateful. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",custard9
