I do the Jumble puzzle everyday.  I don't know what I did but now, when I open the Jumble page to print it, a second later a second page opens with the about:blank in the address bar at the top of the page.  Before I could click on the print button, a print window would open, I'd click the Print button and the page would print.  I'm not even able to press the print button before the about:blank window opens.  Is there anyway to suppress the about:blank window from opening every time the print window opens on this website: <a href=""https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://desmoinesregister-ia.newsmemory.com</a>.

There is a 0% margin for error on this assessment. </p><p>I am not presenting this issue because I require personal assistance.  I haven’t done a damn thing wrong.  I am presenting this issue, so that it would potentially get noticed by or forwarded to one of the developers, or by a user that happens to relay this issue to them.   </p><p>I am using Windows 7.  Therefore, I am uncertain if the issue extends to Windows 10 and 11.  The issue does not affect the browser’s functionality.  </p><p>In my Windows appearance settings, I have always chosen to have a pale yellow color for the background.  It relieves the harshness of the white colored background when I am typing in Word for extended hours.  I have had this setting for years and never altered it. </p><p>Since 96.0, they finally fixed the Bookmarks lag issue, which was pertinent to Windows 7 users.  The Bookmarks issue began as of 92.0.  I raised that issue as well, and called out the developers as being solely responsible for that.  Unfortunately, whatever the developers did in the 96.0 and 96.01 updates, my pale yellow background setting is now appearing on specific websites that must have a clear background in some parts.  In other words, those backgrounds used to appear as white on these specific websites. Here are two examples of commonly-used websites that now are displaying my background color setting instead of white. The NCAA football website and the BBC website. </p><p><a href=""https://www.ncaa.com/sports/football/fbs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ncaa.com/sports/football/fbs</a> </p><p><a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bbc.com/news</a> </p><p>As stated in my Bookmarks complaint, there is a blatant absence of any methodical thought process by its development team.  They release far too many updates in any given year.  Between the 96.0 and 96.0.1 was less than 24 hours.  That’s how you know that these people are clueless what they are doing.  Then you have this newly introduced issue as a result of fixing others as of 96.0.  It’s a very sad state of affairs over at Mozilla.  It appears to be a hopeless situation. </p><p>If I wanted my background appearance setting to appear on all websites, all I would have to do is set the “Override the colors specified by the page with your selections above” to “ALWAYS”.  I have double checked the color settings in Firefox and confirm that my settings have not altered from default.   The override… setting is set to “Only with high contrast themes” and the background color is set to white.   </p><p>The issue that I just presented is 100% on the developers.  Don’t even bother trying to challenge it.  I was spot-on with the Bookmarks assessment on blame as well.  I only provide accurate assessments on blame.   </p><p>Here’s some advice for the Mozilla developers.  Why not fix this issue and kindly spare us with any further updates for the remainder of the year.  You people are doing a pathetic job. </p><p>This may be a Windows 7 issue only. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-940;,firefox,other,en-US,"",lee.turkstra

Used to just be able to scroll down after one click of the bookmark menu. </p><p>I've searched other answers to this problem, many of which involved people's bookmarks being stored in the ""other bookmarks"" folder and being told to move them into the ""bookmarks menu"" folder which would cause them to dropdown. I've tried moving them into all 3 folders: Bookmarks Menu, Other bookmarks, and bookmarks toolbar, and there is no change. Here is a screenshot of what I see when I open my bookmarks: </p> <ul><li>To clarify, the ""recent bookmarks"" that shows up is of no interest to me and would also like to remove that.
