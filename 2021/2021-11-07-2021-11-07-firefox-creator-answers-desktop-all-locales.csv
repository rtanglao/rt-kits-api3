I lost the profile folder of my old thunderbird account while migrating it to clean install of Win 11 on new pc, and have struggled to get two new addresses. Firefox has finally accepted one as primary and the other as secondary email addresses, but I cannot get it to delete my no longer existing address. I have also changed my physical address but have not seen an option to change that info. Ever since I lost my email account I have been getting thumbnails of every brain rotting thing my partner watches on Youtube, and thanks to Google every site I visit assumes I'm her. My searches are answered in gobbledygook pc language. I dont want incorrect Firefox info and Google to mess up my brand spanking new Win 11 pc or my Microsoft account before I've even used them. My pc was a still boxed, unused win 10 machine that I did not use other than to install win 11. Any ideas what to do would be most welcome. Thanks alot Alan. </p>",desktop;customize;firefox-940;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",alansnotin
