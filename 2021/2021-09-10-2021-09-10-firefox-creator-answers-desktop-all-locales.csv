I specifically switched to FF so I don't have to deal with intrusive sites.  FF I thought claimed to be UNLIKE GOOGLE and was more ""private,"" so why are you putting in a Google browser/plugin/extension and forcing it to run on our PC's?  I have enough crap on it taking up MEMORY and slowing it down, don't force anything people do NOT want.  Just because these might be popular with many does NOT mean everybody wants it.  Get rid of Google, Bing, Amazon, DuckDuckGo, eBay, Wikipedia, and WHATEVER else you are forcing us to run on FF. </p><p>Does FF have an agreement or partnering with these companies to TRACK US where ever we go on the internet?  Looks like it.  Per Wikipedia:  DuckDuckGo earns revenue by serving ads from the Yahoo-Bing search alliance network and through affiliate relationships with Amazon and eBay.  OK, so we have 4 of those   And this at <a href=""https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/best-private-search-engine:"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/best-private-search-engine:</a>  DuckDuckGo displays ads for affiliate sites in the right sidebar, which is a little less aggressive than Google which presents ads at the top of search results. It earns additional profits from commissions from sites like Amazon and eBay, so you may want to be wary if those pop up a lot in search results.  Also: As DuckDuckGo’s CEO, Gabriel Weinberg, explains in a Quora answer, the search engine does use your IP address to serve local results.  </p><p>Why is FF pushing these sites when many of us do NOT use them nor want them?  Why don't you add them as extensions where you can CHOOSE it if you wish?  I found instructions on how to delete them in the FF File Explorer folder because merely deleting them in Settings does NOT remove them permanently as FF has them ""hidden,"" however, they just come back and it messed up other add-ons.  ALSO, these add-on's you are forcing on us is TAKING SPACE on my PC and I resent that. </p><p>I do NOT want to HIDE THEM, I want them REMOVED PERMANENTLY. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",jj

Once 2 days ago and just within the last 30 minutes I opened Firefox.  Instead of opening to my homepage, I got a new Firefox page (white background) asking me something which I really didn't care about.  Instead of wasting my time I clicked the Home icon and went to my Homepage (Yahoo by the way).  The first time it happened (2 days ago) it separated all of my favorites with one line in between each, turned everything in the favorites white (no color).  A pain in the ass to work with, so I finally did a rollback of the OS to August 30th, and then everything was OK.  The Firefox experience just repeated itself 30 minutes ago and boy am I pissed.  The same thing happened to my Favorites sections.  What is going on and how can I fix it without doing an OS rollback ? </p><pre>                                                                                                       Thanks, Sam G </pre>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-920;,firefox,other,en-US,"",sg23p7

To summarize:  </p><p>1. @cor_el, you've been particularly helpful in the past, and I value your input whether or not I agree with your responses, and whether you post those responses as a user or in your official capacity as moderator. 2. Users still hate Proton--the lack of contrast and the inability to reposition pop-up windows in particular. 3. User feedback matters. 4. I will not register for a third-party app simply to give direct feedback to Mozilla. Companies need to increase their capacity to engage with customers directly. Without customers, a company spits into the wind. 5.
