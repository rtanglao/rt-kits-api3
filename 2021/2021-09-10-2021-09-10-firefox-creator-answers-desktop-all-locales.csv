When this first happened I didn't have a firefox account and lost all my bookmarks and had to sign into every single account..

This issue has just happened just now and I do not have any idea what might have caused it other than the update. I use this feature constantly and now that it's gone it's driving me nuts. The middle mouse button still works but the 4th and 5th mouse buttons are now mapped to previous page and next page in Firefox.  </p><p>Operating system: MacOS 10.13 Firefox version: 92.0 Mouse: Logitech MX Anywhere 3 </p><p>Thanks </p>,mac-os;desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",pixdo.et

Once 2 days ago and just within the last 30 minutes I opened Firefox.  Instead of opening to my homepage, I got a new Firefox page (white background) asking me something which I really didn't care about.  Instead of wasting my time I clicked the Home icon and went to my Homepage (Yahoo by the way).  The first time it happened (2 days ago) it separated all of my favorites with one line in between each, turned everything in the favorites white (no color).  A pain in the ass to work with, so I finally did a rollback of the OS to August 30th, and then everything was OK.  The Firefox experience just repeated itself 30 minutes ago and boy am I pissed.  The same thing happened to my Favorites sections.  What is going on and how can I fix it without doing an OS rollbackÂ ? </p><pre>                                                                                                       Thanks, Sam G </pre>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-920;,firefox,other,en-US,"",sg23p7

To summarize:  </p><p>1. @cor_el, you've been particularly helpful in the past, and I value your input whether or not I agree with your responses, and whether you post those responses as a user or in your official capacity as moderator. 2. Users still hate Proton--the lack of contrast and the inability to reposition pop-up windows in particular. 3. User feedback matters. 4. I will not register for a third-party app simply to give direct feedback to Mozilla. Companies need to increase their capacity to engage with customers directly. Without customers, a company spits into the wind. 5. While I am proficient at a number of technology skills, I do not have the capacity to master CSS. </p><p>Thank you. ajk1962f </p>",desktop;customize;windows-81;firefox-920;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ajk1962f
