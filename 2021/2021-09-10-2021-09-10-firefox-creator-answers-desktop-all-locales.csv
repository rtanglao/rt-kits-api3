Our clients can choose to use our authentication (ADFS 4.0) or we set up a SSO option for them (normally also ADFS of some flavor).  The piece that is similar between both is that the domain they authenticate to would not be the same as the application they are necessarily using.  For example my clients have a mixture of on premise and cloud deployments but if they are SSO only pull their tokens from one domain. </p><p>Anyways the real TLDR as I can determine is as follows: </p><p>Has anyone seen a problem with firefox 92 stripping out headers? My scenario is I have an AD FS server that I use for single sign on with a domain name that is different from the application that it federated with. When I attempt to login using Firefox, the traffic flows as: 1. Hit the app url and get 302 redirected to the IDP 2. enter credentials at the IDP and get redirected to the app url 3. the app has an internal and external claims URL, so the internal claims url 302 redirects me to the external url 4. FF brings up the external url, but does NOT pass the MSISAuth and MSISAuth1 cookies from the IDP 5. The app thinks I've not authenticated, so it 302 redirects me back to the IDP 6. The IDP sees the MSISAuth and MSISAuth1 cookies, so it knows it authenticated me and it 302 redirects me back to the app wash, rinse, repeat for 5 times until AD FS realizes that I've done this 5 times, then it throws an error at me to stop the loop. This was working fine in FF 91 and it currently works in Chrome and Edge. The expected flow is almost the same, except that the app get's the cookies presented to it from AD FS. I was thinking this was something to do with Enhanced Tracking Protection. When I selected Custom and unchecked all the options (I think this disables ETP) I still get the cookies stripped from the header. I re-enabled ETP with standard protections and manually added the URLs using the steps outlined at <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1432644#c27"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1432644#c27</a>. Is this a bug where FF doesn't honor the settings to disable ETP in V92? The reason I was thinking that ETP was to blame is the IDP has a domain of IDP.example and the app has the URL's of internalclaim.app and externalclaim.app. </p><p>I feel like I am missing something obviously here but I can't find it.  If I create a CRM deployment using the same domain as our ADFS servers it works fine.  If I use what our public designation is, it fails.  SSO obviously fails.  It only started after upgrading to 92 and that is consistent amount all of our clients.  I have tried to go through every advance config that was touched with the 92 upgrade and nothing there seems to help.  We compared our UAS to a friend of ours who is not having issues since the 92 release and they look the same.  If this was a system 92 problem I would expect the internet to be exploding by now but it is not.  It makes me think there is something I am missing in our fundamental set up but for the life of me I can't identify a missing update, compatibility issue, known issue blah blah blah.  Edge, Chrome, Safari they all still work fine.  It is just the Firefox 92 update that all of a sudden killed our authentication. </p>",desktop;beta;privacy-and-security_1;escalate;developer;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",christopher.butler.02

I specifically switched to FF so I don't have to deal with intrusive sites.  FF I thought claimed to be UNLIKE GOOGLE and was more ""private,"" so why are you putting in a Google browser/plugin/extension and forcing it to run on our PC's?  I have enough crap on it taking up MEMORY and slowing it down, don't force anything people do NOT want.  Just because these might be popular with many does NOT mean everybody wants it.  Get rid of Google, Bing, Amazon, DuckDuckGo, eBay, Wikipedia, and WHATEVER else you are forcing us to run on FF. </p><p>Does FF have an agreement or partnering with these companies to TRACK US where ever we go on the internet?  Looks like it.  Per Wikipedia:  DuckDuckGo earns revenue by serving ads from the Yahoo-Bing search alliance network and through affiliate relationships with Amazon and eBay.  OK, so we have 4 of those   And this at <a href=""https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/best-private-search-engine:"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/best-private-search-engine:</a>  DuckDuckGo displays ads for affiliate sites in the right sidebar, which is a little less aggressive than Google which presents ads at the top of search results. It earns additional profits from commissions from sites like Amazon and eBay, so you may want to be wary if those pop up a lot in search results.  Also: As DuckDuckGo’s CEO, Gabriel Weinberg, explains in a Quora answer, the search engine does use your IP address to serve local results.  </p><p>Why is FF pushing these sites when many of us do NOT use them nor want them?  Why don't you add them as extensions where you can CHOOSE it if you wish?  I found instructions on how to delete them in the FF File Explorer folder because merely deleting them in Settings does NOT remove them permanently as FF has them ""hidden,"" however, they just come back and it messed up other add-ons.  ALSO, these add-on's you are forcing on us is TAKING SPACE on my PC and I resent that. </p><p>I do NOT want to HIDE THEM, I want them REMOVED PERMANENTLY. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1442090;,jj

Once 2 days ago and just within the last 30 minutes I opened Firefox.  Instead of opening to my homepage, I got a new Firefox page (white background) asking me something which I really didn't care about.  Instead of wasting my time I clicked the Home icon and went to my Homepage (Yahoo by the way).  The first time it happened (2 days ago) it separated all of my favorites with one line in between each, turned everything in the favorites white (no color).  A pain in the ass to work with, so I finally did a rollback of the OS to August 30th, and then everything was OK.  The Firefox experience just repeated itself 30 minutes ago and boy am I pissed.  The same thing happened to my Favorites sections.  What is going on and how can I fix it without doing an OS rollback ? </p><pre>                                                                                                       Thanks, Sam G </pre>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-920;,firefox,other,en-US,"",sg23p7
