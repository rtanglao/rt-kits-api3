I've never used Chrome browser and don't have Chrome installed. These idb files take up a large amount of space. Also when first downloaded 85 seemed pretty fast. Now, after a few days it is back to being pretty slow. Could this Chrome stuff be effecting my browser in an adverse way? </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-850;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1388935;1388939;1388940;1388962;,BrothertownBooks
