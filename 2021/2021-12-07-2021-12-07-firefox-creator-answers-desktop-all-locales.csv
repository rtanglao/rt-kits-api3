I have a few news subscriptions, and other sites which require login each time I open them, which is a bit of a nuisance. Some of them have a ""remember me"" checkbox, but it doesn't seem to work-I have to log in each time. Is there a way around this? By the way, the ""Add Images"" button on this page will not let me add a screenshot of the message I am getting. </p><p>thanks </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,other,en-US,1464602;,jimmy31
