As my usual custom I opened my Microsoft Outlook, checked email and went on with my day. Usually I leave that tab open, but for some reason it got closed. About two hours later I tried to open it again and it will not load, nor let me login to my Microsoft365 business account. I contacted Microsoft and spent two hours on the phone with them trying everything to get this to work. What we discovered: Outlook online opens fine with every other browser, and if I do a private browsing page in Firefox it opens. I've changed nothing in my Firefox settings for many months, but suddenly something is interfering with my ability to get into my email. This, in combination with how slooooooooow Firefox has been over the last month or so is tempting to completely switch to a different browser. Not what I want to do, but it's terribly annoying to not be able to get in my email without having two browsers open at the same time. Please tell me this is in the works to be fixed! </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,websites,en-US,1454468;1454469;,tquay

So, it is possible for you to view sensitive information from the Firefox memory cache after you log out an web application and keep Firefox open. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",yong-liang.liu

I'm in my 70's and have no patience or training for sifting though numerous fixes and possible solutions. I've done my best with no improvement.  My husband is having the same issues on his computer.  All my previous efforts erase my sign ins and require me to constantly enter new sign in information for my common websites.   I can use Safari and Chrome without these issues so unless I get some form of personalized help that doesn't require a great deal of technological skill, I'm leaving this browser greatly disappointed in the lack of support. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-930;,firefox,other,en-US,"",bonnygal2
