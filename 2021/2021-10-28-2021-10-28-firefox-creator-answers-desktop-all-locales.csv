I'm in my 70's and have no patience or training for sifting though numerous fixes and possible solutions. I've done my best with no improvement.  My husband is having the same issues on his computer.  All my previous efforts erase my sign ins and require me to constantly enter new sign in information for my common websites.   I can use Safari and Chrome without these issues so unless I get some form of personalized help that doesn't require a great deal of technological skill, I'm leaving this browser greatly disappointed in the lack of support. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-930;,firefox,other,en-US,"",bonnygal2
