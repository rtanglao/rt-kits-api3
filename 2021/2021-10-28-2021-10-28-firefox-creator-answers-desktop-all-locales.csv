I drag them to the Firefox shortcut on the Taskbar and a message pops up “Pin to Firefox?” but when I right click on the Taskbar Firefox link there are only the original shortcuts that were there before this problem began.

Access to the site is entirely possible but the connection seems to stop as soon as you try to view the programs offered… This problem doesn't arise by using Chrome. </p>",desktop;other;firefox-930;,firefox,other,en-US,"",cldjr1

So, it is possible for you to view sensitive information from the Firefox memory cache after you log out an web application and keep Firefox open. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",yong-liang.liu

I'm in my 70's and have no patience or training for sifting though numerous fixes and possible solutions. I've done my best with no improvement.  My husband is having the same issues on his computer.  All my previous efforts erase my sign ins and require me to constantly enter new sign in information for my common websites.   I can use Safari and Chrome without these issues so unless I get some form of personalized help that doesn't require a great deal of technological skill, I'm leaving this browser greatly disappointed in the lack of support. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-930;,firefox,other,en-US,"",bonnygal2
