As my usual custom I opened my Microsoft Outlook, checked email and went on with my day. Usually I leave that tab open, but for some reason it got closed. About two hours later I tried to open it again and it will not load, nor let me login to my Microsoft365 business account. I contacted Microsoft and spent two hours on the phone with them trying everything to get this to work. What we discovered: Outlook online opens fine with every other browser, and if I do a private browsing page in Firefox it opens. I've changed nothing in my Firefox settings for many months, but suddenly something is interfering with my ability to get into my email. This, in combination with how slooooooooow Firefox has been over the last month or so is tempting to completely switch to a different browser. Not what I want to do, but it's terribly annoying to not be able to get in my email without having two browsers open at the same time.
