Now I try to implement automatic ""open link in new tab"" as I had in my previous PC. My internet search was unsatisfactory. The only solution I founf was to right click the link and use the option ""open link in new tab"". This works but is cumbersome compared to the old version. I also found some help to change certain values in ""about:config"" from false to true. But they did not work.
