I've been told by the site that they test (essentially) Chrome...and go with THEIR updates, if it suits their purposes.  They suggested blowing away the ESR history (...cookies and all of it) and restarting ESR.  Afteer that didn't work, I'm presuming the fix the Bank wants is in FF 85.0.2 and not in 78.7.1 ESR.  But, I'm guessing. </p><p>I realize ESR stages ESR releases to follow FF so to allow testing ahead of FF auto update migrations.  It's one reason why I use ESR most of the time.  But, I think it would help if we could have some way to associate ESR's release cycles (Versions) to FF (Versions) with dates and expected.  Maybe it is somewhere.   </p><p>Q.  What is the relationship, if any, between the versions FF vs ESR?  Is ESR 78.7.1 = FF 78.7.1 or what? Q.  If not, what?  Where/What is the relationship and is the timing set or variable on progressions of ESR? </p><p>Thx wgk </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,"",wgkoch

Booted onto my old ssd drive with the same version of windows ten and as far as I know firefox. Firefox works fine on that drive. Ive also found out microsoft edge also works fine on my main m.2 ssd . I have no idea why firefox would be so slow, its like its limiting my speeds . But I checked and the throttling is turned off. I tried to uninstall firefox and reinstall didn't help.  </p><p>I have no idea why speed <a href=""http://test.net"" rel=""nofollow"">test.net</a> shows im getting 40+ mbps and youtube videos or just surfing the web is stuck at 2.5 mbps. any help or ideas would be great.
