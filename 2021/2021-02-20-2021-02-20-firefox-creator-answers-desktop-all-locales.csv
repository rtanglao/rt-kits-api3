This changed with the most recent Firefox update for me (I'm currently on 85.0.1. for Ubuntu). Currently, the default save behavior is for bookmarks to save to the most recent folder you've picked. My preferred behavior would be for all bookmarks to save to ""Other bookmarks"" until I can file them away later. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-850;firefox-8501;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",reginakbuhl

It can be configured to always open a new window, or always open a new tab in the last active window. </p><p>However, I use multiple virtual desktops on linux and when I open a link (from anywhere, really), I'd like it to be opened on the current virtual desktop but also in an existing window if there is one. It should almost be as if the firefox on each virtual desktop behaves independently for this purpose though I don't think actually doing that (one firefox instance per virtual desktop) would be a solution since I do need to move tabs/windows around fairly often as well. </p><p>Is there a way to do that with some settings? </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-850;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",yyc1992

The feedback submission from within the browser is disabled by Mozilla. </p><p>When I have FF (85.0.2 x64, Win10) set to use a toolbar density of ""Touch"", this works for the toolbars themselves, but not the Bookmarks menu.  See the attached screenshot. You can see that the toolbar elements are nicely spaced to make it easier for fingers and finger-simulating stilii, but the bookmarks menu is still densely packed. </p><p>The feedback is to have the toolbar spacing apply to the bookmarks menu too. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",gordol
