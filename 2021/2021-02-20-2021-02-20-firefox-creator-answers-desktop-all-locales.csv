I do not have a VPN but have tried several times in the past week to access IRS refund status site without success.  I can get into <a href=""http://irs.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">irs.gov</a>, but am unsuccessful in accessing the refund status site after entering required input data. The issue has occurred only this past week. </p><p>I'm unaware of IRS issues causing this problem. </p><p>Have not had this issue on any other sites; and I have successful retrieved data in prior years. </p><p>I am not saving any sign on protocols with the irs or any other sites. </p><p>Running Windows 10.  Thanks for any help.  BTW I did get refund information using the telephone, but I want to ensure there's not a hidden conflict of some sort with FireFox. Thanks for any help. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",firefoxwag

The feedback submission from within the browser is disabled by Mozilla. </p><p>When I have FF (85.0.2 x64, Win10) set to use a toolbar density of ""Touch"", this works for the toolbars themselves, but not the Bookmarks menu.  See the attached screenshot. You can see that the toolbar elements are nicely spaced to make it easier for fingers and finger-simulating stilii, but the bookmarks menu is still densely packed. </p><p>The feedback is to have the toolbar spacing apply to the bookmarks menu too. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",gordol
