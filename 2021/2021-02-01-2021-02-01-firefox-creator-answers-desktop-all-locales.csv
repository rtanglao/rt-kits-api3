I have noticed in Firefox that, on some websites, this notification does not show. However, the background of the webpage is still locked - as though it is still expecting a response on the prompt that is not shown. </p><p>For me, this is occurring on <a href=""http://TitanFitness.com"" rel=""nofollow"">TitanFitness.com</a>. As seen in the screenshot, the website greys out and cannot be used. However, the prompt does not show. </p><p>I have automatic Firefox updates on, placed this website on popup exceptions, and allowed notifications. None of these solutions work. I'm not sure what other settings in browser could fix this. This website works on other browsers such as Edge and Chrome. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1388675;,keystone.meyer

Older version of firefox didn't produce these errors, for the exact same websites. Very frustrating. Tried about 4 different workarounds listed in the community forum, but no luck. Does anyone have an idea? Ideally would just like for firefox to ignore all cert related errors. Or to have a continue button to proceed anyway. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1388663;1388664;1388678;,jeffgran
