I tried to really quickly import some things and figured while I was doing it I might as well import everything. I imported all of the information from another persons google account and I'm not certain how I even managed it. It would take upwards of an hour to delete all this information and I'm not sure whether or not when I delete things like passwords on firefox if its also deleting them on google or not. I just need to undo the entire import. I don't need to figure out how to import from my google account or anything at this point I don't really care. Where I think I went wrong is it gave me the option between two google accounts one of them saying a generic name and one saying mine. I forgot that their google account is under my name and that the generic one must have been mine. Is there any way to just undo the entire import? </p>,mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",rileycosminsky
