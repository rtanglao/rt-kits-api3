Older version of firefox didn't produce these errors, for the exact same websites. Very frustrating. Tried about 4 different workarounds listed in the community forum, but no luck. Does anyone have an idea? Ideally would just like for firefox to ignore all cert related errors. Or to have a continue button to proceed anyway. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1388663;1388664;,jeffgran
