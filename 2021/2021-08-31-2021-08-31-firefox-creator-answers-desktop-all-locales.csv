The problem that I am having is that OAUTH tends to bounce around my login through multiple hostnames on the same domain - so I do not seem to be able to add every possible host to the Container's site list. </p><p>When the ""Limit to Designated Sites"" setting is turned on (which is what I want - so I avoid accidentally getting my tabs mixed up) these login requests get opened in the default container - which breaks the login process inside the container. </p><p>Consider this as an example - with the hostnames made up.  I am trying to visit <a href=""http://www.mybank.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.mybank.com</a>.  Upon loading the home page and entering my credentials, I get redirected to <a href=""http://id.mybank.com"" rel=""nofollow"">id.mybank.com</a>.  From there, I end up getting redirected to <a href=""http://onlinebanking.mybank.com"" rel=""nofollow"">onlinebanking.mybank.com</a>. </p><p>Now, I can turn off ""Limit to Designated Sites"" for the first time I login and I can set <a href=""http://www.mybank.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.mybank.com</a> and <a href=""http://onlinebanking.mybank.com"" rel=""nofollow"">onlinebanking.mybank.com</a> to always open in my preferred container.  However, <a href=""http://id.mybank.com"" rel=""nofollow"">id.mybank.com</a> never stays up long enough for me to capture it because it does an instant redirect back to the desired page........and hopefully the middle redirection never changes hosts but they might. </p><p>The simplest solution to this would be to simply add *.mybank.com to my Container's Site List.  Is there a way to do that?  If there is not currently a way, can there be? </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,"",david513

Hi all, recently the Australian government , “Bureau of Meteorology” weather and radar – website has stopped working under HTTPS and FireFox – it does work under Microsoft Edge though (Yuk). . Unfortunately even if under the FireFox internal settings - you disable the need for a HTTPS connection – the website still kicks you out anyway – and any direct call to the site (<a href=""http://www.bom.gov.au"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bom.gov.au</a>) – will just kick you to an endless loop of no achievement – by basically constantly telling you “you cannot use HTTPS” and the HTTP link provided just loops you back to the same place. . For now – the only solution I have found is to leave “HTTPS” on – and create an exception for every single page (very zzzzz).  . So for me , I am only excepting and viewing the local weather radar page and getting all other info from other sources. . Machine specs - Win10 Pro , Firefox Version 91.0.2 (64-bit) . I have also (via Edge) – reported this to the “BOM” in Australia, . I hope this helps someone , as I cannot be the only person in Australia trying to access this site – but having to sign up - to report the problem here, I did find more than a bit off putting. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,1439474;1439480;1439501;,ponytrekker
