I have been using firefox for several years and recently I have lost the ability to cut and paste into emails using the web page email access. it doesn't matter if I try to use the keystroke shortcut, right click, or choose copy/paste from the edit menu, the browser behaves the same way - I can see the edit menu briefly highlight when I activate copy/paste, but nothing happens. I have a macbook pro and an iMac and this is an issue on both running the latest firefox. When I use safari I'm able to copy/paste without issue. So far this does not seem to be an issue with other sites. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,"",johnnnnyj

Hi all, recently the Australian government , “Bureau of Meteorology” weather and radar – website has stopped working under HTTPS and FireFox – it does work under Microsoft Edge though (Yuk). . Unfortunately even if under the FireFox internal settings - you disable the need for a HTTPS connection – the website still kicks you out anyway – and any direct call to the site (<a href=""http://www.bom.gov.au"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bom.gov.au</a>) – will just kick you to an endless loop of no achievement – by basically constantly telling you “you cannot use HTTPS” and the HTTP link provided just loops you back to the same place. . For now – the only solution I have found is to leave “HTTPS” on – and create an exception for every single page (very zzzzz).  . So for me , I am only excepting and viewing the local weather radar page and getting all other info from other sources. . Machine specs - Win10 Pro , Firefox Version 91.0.2 (64-bit) . I have also (via Edge) – reported this to the “BOM” in Australia, . I hope this helps someone , as I cannot be the only person in Australia trying to access this site – but having to sign up - to report the problem here, I did find more than a bit off putting. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,1439474;1439480;,ponytrekker
