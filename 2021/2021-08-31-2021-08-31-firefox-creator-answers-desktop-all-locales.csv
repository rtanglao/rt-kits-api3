Hi all, recently the Australian government , “Bureau of Meteorology” weather and radar – website has stopped working under HTTPS and FireFox – it does work under Microsoft Edge though (Yuk). . Unfortunately even if under the FireFox internal settings - you disable the need for a HTTPS connection – the website still kicks you out anyway – and any direct call to the site (<a href=""http://www.bom.gov.au"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bom.gov.au</a>) – will just kick you to an endless loop of no achievement – by basically constantly telling you “you cannot use HTTPS” and the HTTP link provided just loops you back to the same place. . For now – the only solution I have found is to leave “HTTPS” on – and create an exception for every single page (very zzzzz).  . So for me , I am only excepting and viewing the local weather radar page and getting all other info from other sources. . Machine specs - Win10 Pro , Firefox Version 91.0.2 (64-bit) .
