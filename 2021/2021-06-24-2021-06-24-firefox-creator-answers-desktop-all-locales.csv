Normally you go to a site that is searchable (like Amazon or Twitter) and there is a green + symbol that appears in the top right browser search box in Firefox and you click on that to add it to the search box drop down list. But for whatever reason eBay does not have a green + symbol appear when you go to it. Can it be added or has it been restricted by Ebay rather than Firefox? I'm pretty sure it used to be there. </p><p>Windows 10 desktop Firefox version 89 </p>,desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",dog3456

This was possible in older versions, and when you then updated the browser it maintained this difference - if it was already set.  I did that once but I don't remember how far back on versions that is an option.  Is it possible to do this in 89?  If not, how far back should I go to install, make my home page and home button settings, then update to the current version.  Then we're all good.   </p><p>If you could supply a link to the correct FF file (windows 10, 64bit) that would be even more good. </p><p>thanks </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",callingdoug
