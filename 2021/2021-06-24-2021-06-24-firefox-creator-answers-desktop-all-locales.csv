I live in the US. The feature was working just fine... until I traveled overseas and used my laptop there and changed time zones to where I was visiting. Now that I'm back in the US, the feature is missing. In the settings, I don't see a ""Forms and Autofill"" section in the settings. I checked system locale and it's properly set to us-en. All the settings are properly set in about:config. I've tried everything I found by searching online and nothing helped. I even tried creating a separate profile in Firefox to see if the section shows up under setting with no luck. </p><p>Any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",sarilouis
