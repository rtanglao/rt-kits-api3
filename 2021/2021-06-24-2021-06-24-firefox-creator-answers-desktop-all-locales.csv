There is multiple reviews on it that it doesn't work and there has nothing to be done to that on past year. It still doesn't work on today. And since there is only one option that you can use it is really hindering for someone like me who is dyslexic and really needs it. So is there a way to reach the Mozilla team and get them actually fix it?? I know it is just a small country and there aren't that many millions or billions of people using it so there is no priority for it to be fixed but still it would be nice to be able to get it.
