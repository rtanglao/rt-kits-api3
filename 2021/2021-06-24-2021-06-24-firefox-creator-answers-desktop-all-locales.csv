This is because though I may put, for example, 4:45 PM, the website seems to think that I am in a different time zone, posting at 12:45 instead. This has been across multiple sites, and I have been unable to fix it. Using other browsers, I don't run into this issue, and have checked my time zone on my computer as well to ensure that there's nothing wrong on my end. I've updated my browser, and even uninstalled and reinstalled, with no luck in correcting this error.

Fresh install of Firefox, and the issue is back. It does not happen Chrome or Edge. I have checked on my other devices and they do not have this problem. </p><p>Anyone else have this problem?

I don't see anything listed in the Color program that looks like those can be changed. </p><pre>I was also wondering, is it possible for the team that makes it to make it a stand-alone program like they made in the 90's, so we could fix everything offline first, with a browser standalone that will preview the themes first before posting them. It takes a long time to make them sometimes, and it would be nice also, to let people who are working have the internet. Just a thought. Thanks for working out all the kinks in it.
