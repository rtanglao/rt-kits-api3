All other menus are white background with black font.  I have a really hard time with dark themes and have firefox's set to white, which sets everything to black font on white background.  I notice when I select other themes, though, some of them alter the favorites toolbar selection box background to white font on black background but leaves the menus black font on white background. </p><p>How in the world can I make the favorites toolbar selection box black font on white background?  I do have a ""userChrome.css"" file in the Firefox profile but I have no idea how or what can resolve this. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,"",BPaul_H

Uninstalling Version 90 and re-installing Version 89 fixed the problem. With Version 90 the Print Preview function (which I love) didn't work properly. When I try to Shrink to Fit any page, the first page shrinks, but the second page isn't pulled into the first page. Also, there's missing information on both pages. If there's another solution so I can use Version 90, please tell me. If not, and Mozilla is doing away with Print Preview (and Shrink to Fit), I'll have to do away with Mozilla Firefox. Sorry, but that's the main reason I use Firefox over Chrome. Perhaps I can find another browser to do what I want. I hope not though. </p>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",toddmnuccio

But suddenly, after upgrading to Firefox version 90.0, the invoices I need to print from the portal are cutting off the right 25% of the page.  I tried going into about:config and checking settings and tried several of the tips from the FF community.  Nothing works and I'm absolutely frustrated by this. Hoping someone who has already dealt with this can share their solution. Thanks! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",belinda5
