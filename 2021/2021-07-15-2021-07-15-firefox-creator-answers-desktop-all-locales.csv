Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V no longer work with Google Translate on linux.  I have tested in other browsers and it they all work fine.  Firefox on Windows also works fine, this problem seems specific to linux. </p><p>When you press any of the Ctrl combinations it simply deselects everything and moves the cursor to the end of the text.  Mouse works, but it's not practical if you are cutting and pasting all day long. </p><p>Site: <a href=""https://translate.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://translate.google.com</a> Firefox version: 89.0.2 (64-bit) OS: Ubuntu 20.04 </p><p>Google Translation is critical to my work so my current solution is I no longer use Firefox.

Let's take <strong>Control B</strong> for example: it is generally used (e.g. by every online editor or composer, like Gmail ) to set a bold font at the selected text. In Firefox this triggers instead opening bookmarks list, which is highly confusing. Shouldn't this shortcut be disabled by default?

Is there a way to update automatically the Firefox Browser , without user intervention, something in regent or services or about:config ? (about config is already set to true for updates) All the users are in the domain and use AD files and folders on servers. i am aware of the risks of grading user the right to install...but we are well protected by the enterprise antivirus and multiple filters and firewalls...i just need a way to auto update the Firefox Browser to the latest version (90 i think)...and other versions to be released.
