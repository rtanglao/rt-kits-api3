But suddenly, after upgrading to Firefox version 90.0, the invoices I need to print from the portal are cutting off the right 25% of the page.  I tried going into about:config and checking settings and tried several of the tips from the FF community.  Nothing works and I'm absolutely frustrated by this. Hoping someone who has already dealt with this can share their solution. Thanks! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",belinda5
