I lost 75GB but recovered 52GB from a back up scheme I had. Most important: Now I have them in the act of setting up their trap in my computer, plus I have 3 hardware devices infected with their code. One is a USB type A to USB type C adapter by Belkin. they know the whole thing. I spoke to their security all the way to their corporate offices. As you know they're also a defense contractor. The 2nd device is a 3.3 USB reader by SanDisk (Western Digital). I started telling them until they blocked me. So they only know their device was modify to do evil. But I didn't have time to tell them that 2 additional devices suffered the same thing. So, SanDisk thinks they are the only company. The 3rd device is from Kingston it's 3.0 USB card reader but but the time I finished with SanDisk I couldn't communicate with Kingston. Unless the security force from Belkin told them, they are unaware that their device was used for nefarious purposes by MS and GGL (But attempt to abbreviate.)  Bottom line I have the dramatic footage of 18GB and 3 hardware devices. of their code. I hope these info gets to you. I have to take a tiny break.

Let's take <strong>Control B</strong> for example: it is generally used (e.g. by every online editor or composer, like Gmail ) to set a bold font at the selected text. In Firefox this triggers instead opening bookmarks list, which is highly confusing. Shouldn't this shortcut be disabled by default? Or at least create an extremely evident (e.g. in the welcome page after install) way to disable it.

I work as Help desk support at a company (500+ AD users) and we all use Mozilla Browser (89.0.2 right now). in the past we used Windows XP and Mozilla latest ESR version, but we migrated recently to Windows 10 so we have to use the latest version of Firefox Browser. The problem that im facing now is that the maintenance service and Firefox update needs administrator privileges to update...and i just cant connect to all users and input the administrator password ... Is there a way to update automatically the Firefox Browser , without user intervention, something in regent or services or about:config ? (about config is already set to true for updates) All the users are in the domain and use AD files and folders on servers. i am aware of the risks of grading user the right to install...but we are well protected by the enterprise antivirus and multiple filters and firewalls...i just need a way to auto update the Firefox Browser to the latest version (90 i think)...and other versions to be released.

If there's another solution so I can use Version 90, please tell me. If not, and Mozilla is doing away with Print Preview (and Shrink to Fit), I'll have to do away with Mozilla Firefox.
