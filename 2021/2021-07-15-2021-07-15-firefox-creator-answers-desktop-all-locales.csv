Uninstalling Version 90 and re-installing Version 89 fixed the problem. With Version 90 the Print Preview function (which I love) didn't work properly. When I try to Shrink to Fit any page, the first page shrinks, but the second page isn't pulled into the first page. Also, there's missing information on both pages. If there's another solution so I can use Version 90, please tell me. If not, and Mozilla is doing away with Print Preview (and Shrink to Fit), I'll have to do away with Mozilla Firefox. Sorry, but that's the main reason I use Firefox over Chrome. Perhaps I can find another browser to do what I want. I hope not though. </p>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",toddmnuccio

But suddenly, after upgrading to Firefox version 90.0, the invoices I need to print from the portal are cutting off the right 25% of the page.  I tried going into about:config and checking settings and tried several of the tips from the FF community.  Nothing works and I'm absolutely frustrated by this. Hoping someone who has already dealt with this can share their solution. Thanks! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",belinda5
