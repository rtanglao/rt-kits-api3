I have checked with Safari (ugh) and Amazon appears normally with that browser. I myself had made no changes other than first one, than the second, update; I did the 2nd update immediately thinking it a fix for the Amazon problem and alas..... I am posting a screenshot as example.. </p><p>I did attempt a troubleshooting tip a few moments ago from this site which involved choosing ""set  minimum font size to none"" therefore reducing the text to something only readable by ants...  Changing the preference to ""allow websites to set font size"" improved the ant-text, but not a whole lot. </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;firefox-930;,firefox,websites,en-US,1449524;,die.spam.pig

In this device #1 I had open 17 tabs... </p><p>I got a new laptop and I installed firefox, then I signed in with my FF account to sync all my stuff from my personal laptop to this new device.. but tabs were not synchronized and also when I opened FF in my personal laptop the tabs were gone and the MAIN page was opened... Bookmarks are there but History don't have my recent 17 tabs in 'recently closed' and so they are gone... I thought having a sync account mean the OLD tabs were keep on one device and I can take them to a NEW one.. I'm so sad I lost my tabs... Please help me so this wont happen again </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",karina.nava

Now I can't restore my account.  In the past you sent an email to reset passwords.  This is totally crazy, plus even though a back up was made of my old computer nothing was backed from firefox.   I've lost 3 years of bookmarks and all my passwords </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",lrmart1

I have the newest version that I know of, 93.0, running under Windows 10 64-bit, fully updated. I can print from any other browser and from all installed programs that I've tested to date. I even totally uninstalled Firefox and reinstalled from scratch. No help. I installed Firefox Portable and I have the same problem there.  </p><p>One of two things happen when I try to print (even when I just try to Save to PDF): 1) the print manager says ""Spooling"" but never finishes the job.  I can't clear the queue while </p><pre>   Firefox is running. When I exit Firefox, the job(s) clear out. </pre> <p>2) I get the error message: </p><pre>               Print Preview Error                An error occurred while printing. </pre> <p>I've tried to print using Print Using the System Dialog... choice.  Same outcome.  I've Google searched and have not found anything that helps. Reboots don't affect it. Again, I can print from virtually every other application including other browsers, no problems so it shouldn't be the Print Spooler service. If anyone has any ideas, please let me know.  It would be much appreciated. Thanks much! I will post the resolution when (hopefully not If) I have it. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jlseber
