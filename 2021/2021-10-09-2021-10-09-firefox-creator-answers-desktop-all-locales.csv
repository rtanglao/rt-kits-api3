But now each time I log out of Firefox (and Facebook) and later go into them again it still requires entry of the e-mail address (doesn't ""remember"" it) - I'm an elderly user and not into the depths of the Firefox settings, but guess if someone could walk me through exactly step by step what I need to do I would be so grateful. I guess it is something to do with ""cache"" settings?? </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,cookies,en-US,"",TwoNZWesties

I have checked with Safari (ugh) and Amazon appears normally with that browser. I myself had made no changes other than first one, than the second, update; I did the 2nd update immediately thinking it a fix for the Amazon problem and alas..... I am posting a screenshot as example.. </p><p>I did attempt a troubleshooting tip a few moments ago from this site which involved choosing ""set  minimum font size to none"" therefore reducing the text to something only readable by ants...  Changing the preference to ""allow websites to set font size"" improved the ant-text, but not a whole lot. </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;firefox-930;,firefox,websites,en-US,1449524;,die.spam.pig

I have the newest version that I know of, 93.0, running under Windows 10 64-bit, fully updated. I can print from any other browser and from all installed programs that I've tested to date. I even totally uninstalled Firefox and reinstalled from scratch. No help. I installed Firefox Portable and I have the same problem there.  </p><p>One of two things happen when I try to print (even when I just try to Save to PDF): 1) the print manager says ""Spooling"" but never finishes the job.  I can't clear the queue while </p><pre>   Firefox is running. When I exit Firefox, the job(s) clear out. </pre> <p>2) I get the error message: </p><pre>               Print Preview Error                An error occurred while printing. </pre> <p>I've tried to print using Print Using the System Dialog... choice.  Same outcome.  I've Google searched and have not found anything that helps. Reboots don't affect it. Again, I can print from virtually every other application including other browsers, no problems so it shouldn't be the Print Spooler service. If anyone has any ideas, please let me know.  It would be much appreciated. Thanks much! I will post the resolution when (hopefully not If) I have it. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jlseber
