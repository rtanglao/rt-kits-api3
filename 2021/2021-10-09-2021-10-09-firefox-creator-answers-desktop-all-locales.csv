I understand that this is a new ""feature,"" as explained here: <a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/10/05/firefox-93-protects-against-insecure-downloads/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/10/05/firefox-93-protects-against-insecure-downloads/</a>, however, I in no way desire this behavior. It is an asinine nuisance, and if I cannot disable it, I will have no choice but to revert to an early version of Firefox. My question, then is this: is it possible to disable this check, and simply allow all downloads? If so, how can I do that? </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-930;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1449618;1449621;1449623;,ljbetche

This applies only to Windows 7 users.  The list is very lazy and will actually freeze up.  It takes forever to highlight the bookmark you want and the favicons are delayed in populating.  Refreshing Firefox doesn't work.  Renaming favicons.sqlite and places.sqlite, and those with the -shm and -wal extensions, if existing, doesn't work either.  I don't need help from contributors.  The following message is to the developers &amp;/or whoever bastardized Firefox since the 92.0 update... </p><p><br> As I stated, this is a Windows 7 issue.  The developers should fix this problem for us Windows 7 users.  It was them who caused this issue since the 92.0 update.  Everything worked perfect until then.  Here’s a bright idea for the developers.  How about getting this matter fixed, so that us Windows 7 users can have the same functionality as everyone else.  Stop screwing around with a million and one updates every year.  You people are doing more harm than good.  The people running Chrome are a hell of a lot more intelligent.  No issues whatsoever with Windows 7!  Try that on for size. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-930;,firefox,other,en-US,"",lee.turkstra

Patently, it was funded by whatever company owns Netflicks.  </p><p>The article also makes the outrageous claim that the TV show in question is ""the most controversial sci-fi show on Netflix"", but completely fails to back this up with facts, or any explanation at all. It's clearly just marketing rhetoric to generate interest in the show, because the show in question (which is 20 years old) was notoriously bland, isn't even remotely controversial, no one is talking about it, and there is absolutely no logical reason to re-watch it right now. </p><p>The article also tries to give the impression that the only way to watch this 20-year-old TV show is to sign up to the premium website Netflicks and watch it on a computer screen - which is absurd given that the show is constantly syndicated on TV around the world, and readily available on all home formats including DVD and Blu-ray. </p><p>I would like to know how I can complain about this to Mozilla, because it isn't right at all. If by some chance, this article was non-commercial, it would be a truly terrible, dishonest, badly-written article which completely lacked a point or purpose. But it's <em>so obviously</em> commercial. </p><p>I found countless other disingenuous ""articles"" on that site, all doing a similar thing with other TV shows—driving commerce to Netflicks under the pretense of a false sense of urgency.
