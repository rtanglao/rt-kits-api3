All of this happened mysteriously mid session.  Or perhaps between boots, I don't know.  But I mean not that I know of because of anything I did with firefox and no great new instals or anything.

I went into settings hoping to make this change manually, but .package files were not in the list of content types I could set actions for - no matter what website I was downloading from. Additionally, during the same session, I downloaded a .zip file and DID have the option to check off downloading as a default action. I recently got a new computer and was expecting to have to reconfigure some things, but I can't figure out why I can't set a default for package files in particular. I download a lot of them as mods for the Sims, so this is very frustrating lol. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,other,en-US,"",bernsteinr27
