Many sites will offer the option to 'Login with google/facebook/whatever' rather than creating a new account for that specific site. One really annoying (and dangerous) consequence of 'logging in with google' is that it remains logged in. So for example if I log in to non-google siteX using my google credentials and then hours later open gmail in a different tab I get straight through to my gmail inbox without having to supply any credentials (and indeed any other user of the same machine could do the same). Obviously this highly insecure and dangerous policy of keeping me logged in indefinitely is implemented by Google for their own agenda and has nothing to do with Firefox. The bug in Firefox is that when I clear all data to work around this google problem FIREFOX does not work as advertised. So to try to 'force' a logout from my Google account I go to Firefox -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Privacy &amp; Security -&gt; Cookies &amp; Site Data -&gt; Clear Data, after a few minutes of churning away at my harddrive Firefox informs me that 'Your stored cookies, site data, and cache are currently using 0 bytes of disk space.' For good measure I then hit the 'Clear History' button.  After this I open a fresh tab and go to gmail and I get straight into my inbox, no credentials required, so clearly Firfox is NOT deleting all cookies etc and is mis-reporting that 0 bytes are being used.  So, does anyone know where/how I should report this dangerous privacy bug ? </p><p>Thanks MH </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-880;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",mharpes1
