Someone I do not know in some state that I do not live in. I quickly changed my firefox password and various passwords that may have been compromised.  </p><p>My question is, how worried should I be? How did they get my password or access to a PC with my account active on it. Then why would they be so daft to save their name and address as the autofill?  </p><p>Is there any way I can check when it was made or pass this on to Mozilla support? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",jmconwell54

I went to sign-in and it keeps telling me that I have an incorrect password. It is the correct password because I used it to login here.
