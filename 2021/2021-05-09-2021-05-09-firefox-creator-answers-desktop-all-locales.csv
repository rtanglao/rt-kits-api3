Yesterday morning, same issue, different site. Credit cards weren't filling in. I tried another site and another and another... All the same issue! </p><p>I tried disabling extensions, clearing my cache, quitting and restarting Firefox, and several suggestions on this forum for about:config. Nothing has worked.  </p><p>I don't know if the attached screenshot will help. Hopefully it does. </p><p>I hadn't touched a single setting prior to this happening so I have no idea why it simply decided to stop? </p><p>Thank you! </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",sccjyx

There is nothing else than a 2 kb file in sessionstore backups. Is there anything else I can do, or is all lost? 1200 is a lot, and those tabs hold great value to me. So I'm kind of desperate right now. Any help would be immensely valued! (I will start using a session backup plugin for sure.) </p>",desktop;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",hvitveispike

Depois disso, não consegui mais visualizar minha própria imagem nas reuniões online (google meet ou jitsi meet). Desinstalei o Firefox, apaguei a pasta Mozila (em c:\usuários\nome do usuário\appdata\Roaming\Mozila), instalei o Firefox com a versão antiga 86.0.1 e bloqueei a atualização automática. Resolvi o problema da webcam, porém vou ficar sem atualização do Firefox. Utilizo o Windows 10. Existe alguma configuração na versão atual do Firefox para resolver esse problema? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,fix-problems,pt-BR,"",001.danielsantana
