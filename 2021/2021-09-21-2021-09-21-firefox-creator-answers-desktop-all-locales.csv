I was very annoyed arrowing through the items, listening to them spoken, and finding that NONE of them were correct.  I got lost in one of those darned suggestion systems while finalizing an order and eventually closed Firefox and started the process over.  I had those darned suggestions turned off at one time, but they must have come back on when the last update occurred.  So i want to fix Firefox so that it will simply let me type in the needed information  - address, or whatever is needed - with no suggestions popping up - hopefully so they will stay off PERMANENTLY! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1445133;,knobman
