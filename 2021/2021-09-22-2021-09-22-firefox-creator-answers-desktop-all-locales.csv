I've tried starting firefox with all my extensions and themes disabled, and all that did was make the bar black instead of white. </p><p>This lead me to believe it was the Title bar. However, that's currently disabled. When I enable the title bar, the white bar disappears, but then I'm left with the title bar (which I do not want). </p><p>Is there a way I can have the Title bar disabled and not have this bar appear? </p><p>Worth noting I'm using the Lepton UI mod (which doesn't seem to be responsible for this) and DisplayFusion (which I thought would have been responsible for this, however I cannot be sure).

It could have been something I changed but I don't know what.  From what I understand it may have something to do with the setting Cookies and site data.  I think that if the box that says ""delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed"" is checked then the log ins will not be remembered. The problem I have is that particular setting is ticked and it is shaded and I cant uncheck it.  Can someone provide a simple solution please? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1445317;,millhousehouse

I read that it could be that I had upgraded to a new version of Firefox. Apparently, I had previously downloaded Firefox a while ago and just recently reinstalled it. I guess it remembered. I check marked all the password settings and it still won't save at all. It said that I should downgrade to a previous version 68. Then, it asked which browser and that's where I'm stuck. </p><p>Can someone please help? </p><p>Thank you! </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-920;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",annaleewong732

Tonight I tried to complete a simple ebay transaction.  I wasted more than one hour trying to make a purchase, with Firefox failing at every step.  I opened Microsoft Edge and completed my purchase within literally seconds.  Firefox now blocks me from several of my favorite websites.  My fantasy sports and sports betting websites fail on Firefox but work fine on other browsers.  The entire financial pop up window that is supposed to provide security does not work with my bank's website.  I am trying to find a good reason to continue using Firefox, and I am not thinking of any.  Again, I'm a longtime user and fan but right now the basics are not working with you, Firefox.  Very frustrated. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",bboortz
