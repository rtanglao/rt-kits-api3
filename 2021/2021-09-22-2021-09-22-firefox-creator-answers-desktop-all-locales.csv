Firefox Account doesn't complain, all goes well and personal email works fine as my primary Firefox Account identity.  2021: I attempt to log into Mozilla Support using my newly merged ""Firefox Account"" and receive the following red toast error messages: Error 1: ""The email used with this Firefox Account is already linked to another profile"" Error 2: ""This account is not active.  Please contact an administrator if you believe this is an error"" </p><p>Hopefully that all makes sense, any ideas who to fix this?
