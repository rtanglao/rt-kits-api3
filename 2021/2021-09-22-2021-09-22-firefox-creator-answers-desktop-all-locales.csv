The only way that I can stop it from happening is to click outside of Firefox on a different application and then go back. To attempt to fix this I've tried the following: </p> <ol><li>  restart firefox </li><li> clear the cache, both manually and with ccleaner </li><li> restarted windows </li><li> checked for an update of firefox (I am at the latest version currently) </li><li> diabled sticky keys in windows 10 completely </li><li> tried a different keyboard </li></ol> <p>None of the above fixes have solved the problem that I am encountering.

One individual said that they fix this by changing their Wi-Fi adapter. I had tried to enable and disable this which had no effect.

Tonight I tried to complete a simple ebay transaction.  I wasted more than one hour trying to make a purchase, with Firefox failing at every step.  I opened Microsoft Edge and completed my purchase within literally seconds.  Firefox now blocks me from several of my favorite websites.  My fantasy sports and sports betting websites fail on Firefox but work fine on other browsers.  The entire financial pop up window that is supposed to provide security does not work with my bank's website.  I am trying to find a good reason to continue using Firefox, and I am not thinking of any.  Again, I'm a longtime user and fan but right now the basics are not working with you, Firefox.  Very frustrated. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",bboortz
