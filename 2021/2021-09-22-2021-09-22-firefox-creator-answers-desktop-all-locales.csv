I've been having an issue with Firefox, version 90 and up. On some sites all the text content is missing.

When in ""troubleshoot"" mode everything works. This behavior is not caused by any add-ons or extensions since there are none installed, and the issue occurs even on the new install. Also, disabling ""Allow pages to choose their own fonts, instead of your selections above"" seems to cure the problem, too, but of course that means some websites are unusable since they depend on specific fonts to appear properly. </p><p>I've tried all of the various methods to fix the issue in the Firefox documentation and here in the support forum, including a refresh, and a deletion and a complete new clean install, but nothing solves the issue.  </p><p>The issue does not occur in Chrome or IE, only in Firefox. It also does not occur on Windows 10 and Ubuntu. </p><p>Any help would be appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1445407;,dbh67
