I read that it could be that I had upgraded to a new version of Firefox. Apparently, I had previously downloaded Firefox a while ago and just recently reinstalled it. I guess it remembered. I check marked all the password settings and it still won't save at all. It said that I should downgrade to a previous version 68. Then, it asked which browser and that's where I'm stuck. </p><p>Can someone please help? </p><p>Thank you! </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-920;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",annaleewong732

Tonight I tried to complete a simple ebay transaction.  I wasted more than one hour trying to make a purchase, with Firefox failing at every step.  I opened Microsoft Edge and completed my purchase within literally seconds.  Firefox now blocks me from several of my favorite websites.  My fantasy sports and sports betting websites fail on Firefox but work fine on other browsers.  The entire financial pop up window that is supposed to provide security does not work with my bank's website.  I am trying to find a good reason to continue using Firefox, and I am not thinking of any.  Again, I'm a longtime user and fan but right now the basics are not working with you, Firefox.  Very frustrated. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",bboortz
