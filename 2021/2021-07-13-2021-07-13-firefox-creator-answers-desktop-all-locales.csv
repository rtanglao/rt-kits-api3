Under settings, no app for zoommtg is present nor are there any ways I can find to add one.  I searched all over the web, and tried tweaking/adding settings in about:config, to no avail.  On its own, the zoom client works fine from the command line (""./zoom/ZoomLauncher).   Firefox also works flawlessly (""./firefox/firefox) -- I can watch You Tube videos, log onto bank accounts, even use Google Meet, all without any issue.   When I can visually parse a link, and manually copy the meeting ID and password to the Zoom client, I can even attend a zoom meeting;  However, for links that are not easily parsed in such a manner, I clearly cannot do this.   I am using Firefox 89 and Zoom installed in a new account (clean) in userspace.   I have years of Linux/Unix experience and am sure there is a simple solution.  If I could at least get Firefox to ask for the application to use to handle the link, that would solve the problem!
