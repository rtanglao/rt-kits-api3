Large spaces in between the bookmarked web sites when the window unfolds.  So now, many bookmarks don't fit in the window, and to get to the bottom - the ones I can't see - I have to click the arrow at the bottom.  But making it worse, is that if I do go to the bottom, the next time I open the bookmark tab, the list will open at the bottom (it doesn't revert to the top).  So I'd have to scroll up to get to the ones at the top - AND the ""Other Bookmarks"" tab, where I also store bookmarked sites. </p><p>I list my bookmarks in the order they're in so I can get to the ones I go to most often as fast as possible.  So they're at the top - I don't have to scroll far to get to them.   And the ""Other Bookmarks"" is hidden when the window opens at the bottom.  So I'd have to scroll up to get to that as well.    </p><p>Also, this update changed the size of the command windows - like the copy/paste window, or the window to get the correct spelling of the word.  They're so big, they run from the top of the screen to bottom, instead of a small square.  So you'll have to scroll way up to get to the command or word you want.    </p><p>I did find a way to get it back to what it was: </p><p>1. Open a tab and enter about:config, click OK after the warning 2. Search proton, a few will come up, change all the ones that are true to false.   One was already false so I kept it, and the last one had a 3, which I kept. 3. Exit and open FF. </p><p>This will also revert the right-click command boxes back to small squares. </p><p>I posted this on this message board but this was added: </p><p>==WARNING: There are plans to remove this preference in the next two months The preference setting was created as a toggle for developers when building the new design. Now that the new interface has shipped, the preference will be removed. </p><p>If you have any issues with the new design, please let us know what it is you don't like, and we can try provide more permanent solutions depending on the issue.== </p><p>No!  Do NOT remove this preference!   Either that or just get it back to what it was by default.  I do not want longer bookmark menus and larger command windows.

Under settings, no app for zoommtg is present nor are there any ways I can find to add one.  I searched all over the web, and tried tweaking/adding settings in about:config, to no avail.  On its own, the zoom client works fine from the command line (""./zoom/ZoomLauncher).   Firefox also works flawlessly (""./firefox/firefox) -- I can watch You Tube videos, log onto bank accounts, even use Google Meet, all without any issue.   When I can visually parse a link, and manually copy the meeting ID and password to the Zoom client, I can even attend a zoom meeting;  However, for links that are not easily parsed in such a manner, I clearly cannot do this.   I am using Firefox 89 and Zoom installed in a new account (clean) in userspace.   I have years of Linux/Unix experience and am sure there is a simple solution.  If I could at least get Firefox to ask for the application to use to handle the link, that would solve the problem!
