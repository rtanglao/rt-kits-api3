Large spaces in between the bookmarked web sites when the window unfolds.  So now, many bookmarks don't fit in the window, and to get to the bottom - the ones I can't see - I have to click the arrow at the bottom.  But making it worse, is that if I do go to the bottom, the next time I open the bookmark tab, the list will open at the bottom (it doesn't revert to the top).  So I'd have to scroll up to get to the ones at the top - AND the ""Other Bookmarks"" tab, where I also store bookmarked sites. </p><p>I list my bookmarks in the order they're in so I can get to the ones I go to most often as fast as possible.

So I'd have to scroll up to get to that as well.    </p><p>Also, this update changed the size of the command windows - like the copy/paste window, or the window to get the correct spelling of the word.  They're so big, they run from the top of the screen to bottom, instead of a small square.  So you'll have to scroll way up to get to the command or word you want.    </p><p>I did find a way to get it back to what it was: </p><p>1.
