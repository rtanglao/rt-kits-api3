I am running Firefox 91.0 on a Windows 10 laptop PC and it updates automatically. In my work I have bookmarked about 43 sites in about the last month. Only 10 appear in ""Recently Bookmarked"". Until the last month or so, I would go to Manage Bookmarks and all my recent bookmarks (not just 10) would be displayed and I would be able to move them to different folders I have created in my bookmarks menu. When I do this now, Manage Bookmakrs shows is a much older set of unsorted bookmarks from October 2020 to May 2021, and none of the recent 43. If I go to Recently Bookmarked it shows only the 10. The other 33 seemed to have vanished.  I then searched my own bookmarks menu (with about 150 folders in it) and found all the recent bookmarks were located in one particular folder. I haven't set Firefox to do this. Indeed I cannot find any bookmarks options tab to select where bookmarks are saved by default. Why has this happened? How do I get my recent bookmarks saved in Other Bookmarks like they used to be instead of what seems like a random place in my bookmarks menu? This is quite a recent problem - say the last 1-2 months, since a fairly major update I'd guess?  I also noticed that if I go to the Open Applications Menu tab on the right of the screen, and click on Bookmarks, this dialogue box lists all 43 of my recent bookmarks, not just the last 10. Why does this list all recent and the Recently Bookmarked tab only lists 10? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;escalate;bookmark-limit;windows-10;bug_1;recentlybookmarked;firefox-910;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",info5938

Trying to find a solution I discovered that by switching off the screen and back on again after booting and logging in, Ubuntu then recognised it and worked. When image processing, I need to do the switch off-on before invoking Gimp. I guess Gimp configures its IO at start up so that is understandable. Is there a better way either to configure Ubuntu so that it recognises the cintiq screen correctly at start up, or can I (re)start the system service or deamon that interfaces to it without it switching off-on?
