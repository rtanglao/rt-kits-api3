I can click on that bar, and a blinking cursor appears, indicating that I should be able to type there, but it still puts everything in the address bar.  This only happens with that page, and nowhere else.  Why is it doing this, and how to I make it stop doing that? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,"",aklarii
