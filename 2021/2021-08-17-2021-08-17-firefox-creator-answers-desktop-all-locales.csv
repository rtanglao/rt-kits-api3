I set my first bookmark to go to a specific folder and after that, every single bookmark goes into the same folder. I have to go in and use the ""edit"" function to get the latest bookmark to the right location. What am I missing or doing incorrectly? Thanks in advance to all Gurus who answer. </p>",linux;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-910;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1435829;1435831;1435832;,sandwichbay
