In the past up to version 89 on my FF for desktop I could hover (when using the mouse) over the one or other firefox and it showed me small preview pictures (the ones looking like what is called ""tiles"" from windows explorer)  Since updating to v91 these have gone and all I see now is a list of text description of which tabs I have open in the one, and when toggling then a text line or lines of which tabs I have open there.  I tried some solution already but all it did was packing all the text lines for both browser windows into one large pop-up at the bottom but not any pictures. </p><p>This might be a Windows issue but when searching for it I got overwhelmed with what seems a gazillion solutions and none for what I was looking for.  </p><p>It would be great if you could let me know what to do to get these lovely little preview pictures back, they made my life soooo much easier!  Thanks already for your replies :) </p>",windows-7;desktop;tabs;firefox-910;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",m.schlecking

(Early versions of Ubuntu 18 didn't recognise the screen either and I continued using Ubuntu 16.something, until a new release fixed the problem, then it broke again). Trying to find a solution I discovered that by switching off the screen and back on again after booting and logging in, Ubuntu then recognised it and worked. When image processing, I need to do the switch off-on before invoking Gimp. I guess Gimp configures its IO at start up so that is understandable. Is there a better way either to configure Ubuntu so that it recognises the cintiq screen correctly at start up, or can I (re)start the system service or deamon that interfaces to it without it switching off-on? Thanks for taking the trouble to look at this. Kind regards 13arry 13arker </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-910;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",barry7
