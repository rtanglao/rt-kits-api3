Presently I have upgraded to Firefox version 88  on windows 10 and can not find anyplace to turn this function back on in the configuration section. SOLUTIONS ANYONE, I NEED THIS BACK? </p><p>Note: I want to restore the function under the ellipsis and do not desire to use Ctrl-Shift-S. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Monthow

In the old version, the keyboard shortcut key is a to copy a link, but now it was changed to L. That is really inconvenient. As you know, when you right click a link using the mouse, your right hand is still holding the mouse, and not easy to press the letter L on the keyboard. </p><p>The old menu option is ""Copy Link Locaton"", but the new one is ""Copy Link"". </p><p>Is it possible to customize the keyboard shortcut of right click menu, please? </p><p>Thank you!

This week (21 April 2021), however, a yellow bar appears across the top of the page, saying, on the left-hand side: ""The WidevineCdm plugin has crashed Learn more..."", and, on the right-hand side, ""[Reload page] [Submit a crash report]"". Repeated submissions of crash reports, as well as repeated reloading of the page, results in exactly the same: same yellow bar, same inability to watch videos. Likewise, clicking on ""Learn more"" merely results in the <a href=""http://widevine.com"" rel=""nofollow"">widevine.com</a> page, which states that the company does not service end-users. In addition, last week (14 April 2021), I purchased a video on youtube, and watched part of it. This week (21 April 2021), wanting to watch the rest of the video, all I encounter is: ""Your browser can't play this video. Learn more."" Clicking on ""Learn more"" yields ""Your browser is up to date. You can use YouTube's latest features!"" Repeat ad nauseam. So, it seems that, even though my browser is up-to-date, I am still unable to watch videos on either youtube, hulu, or netflix. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-109;firefox-780;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",maikstrik

The new interface is garbage, and I hate it.  Everything HAS to be a distracting theme.  Stupid. </p><p>But I'm finally trying to upgrade anyway for security reasons.  When I try to use the new version of Firefox, I try to import my bookmarks, and only the bookmarks NOT inside the Bookmarks Toolbar import.  Obviously, this means I can't upgrade, and I sure as hell am not risking upgrading this browser directly, since I have zero faith in Mozilla these days. </p><p>My question to Mozilla: Why can't we just import directly from another version of Firefox like I could if I'd been smart enough to use Chrome instead?  And I receive a bloody warning when I open it, telling me to either create a new profile or quit, so there isn't even an option to import my bookmarks directly!  I'm honestly thinking about just dropping you for Chrome at this point.  It would just be easier. </p><p>My question to everyone: WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO to get my bookmarks toolbar imported?  I export.  I import.  NOTHING. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",mac-os;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-660;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",SunSpirit13
