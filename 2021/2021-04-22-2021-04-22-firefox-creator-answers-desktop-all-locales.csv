The attached image is from the htop command (note that I've been using the laptop at most an hour, and it was compltely powered off before. Unsure why it says such high times.).  Over the past four-ish months, I've seen firefox's new-window command (/usr/lib/firefox/firefox -new-window) function very strangely.  Two instances of the command <em>randomly</em> run for extended periods of time (anywhere from a few seconds to two or three minutes, often towards the longer end), taking up ~100% of the cpu usage for each given one second interval (the time my htop is configured to check). While I'm aware htop records cpu statistics extremely different than task manager (frankly, I'm not quite sure how it measures), this cpu spike takes place with other irregular fluctuations in my laptop, which says to me that the command is in fact doing <em>something</em>. When the cpu spikes occur, I see my cpu temperature rise up to 80 degrees Celsius, and it's frequency hit it's cap for only a handful of threads, while the rest stay completely unchanged.  </p><p>To clarify the extent of the <em>randomness</em> when I say the commands run <em>randomly</em>: this happens without any pattern that I can identify. I've had anywhere from 1 to 10 tabs open, resting in the background from anywhere between a couple minutes to half an hour, and two new-window commands will run, unprompted, as described above. I've been scrolling through an article, and out of no where, the twin commands run. I've loaded up webpages and the commands have run. I've been watching videos, simply opened a new tab (ironic given the command name), just anything you can do on the web browser, and the commands have run. And there have been days where this issue doesn't happen at all.  This can happen numerous times while I'm on firefox. It could happen once, followed by a lot of intervals of the commands running, or it could be a while before the next time it happens. </p><p>The one thing that sticks out like a sore thumb to me is that, as I mentioned at the end of the first paragraph, I see one thread 'catch'  and cause this spike. It's a random thread, it can be a different one each time this happens during a given session on firefox, but I've only every noticed it to be one thread.  </p><p>Not sure what's up. I tried to be as detailed as possible since I could find anything about this on these forums. </p>",desktop;other;firefox-870;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ss8607196

No plugins or addons installed.  </p><p>I tried disabling my anti-virus software.  </p><p>I have FF version 87.0 64 bit version and even tried with an older 32 bit version.  My OS is Windows 10 version 20H2 OS Build 19042.928.  Both are the latest versions at the time of this post.  </p><p><br>  Regardless of what I try, my problem below persists:  </p><p>When I start FF it almost starts but hangs.  I can see it listed in the Task Manager.  There is a little activity with Memory and CPU usage for a few seconds then no more.  I cannot End Task if I try.  It will hang like this for hours.  Eventually I will get the home screen.  If I attempt to visit a website right away it hangs (two dots blinking left &amp; right like a school bus in the tab).  If I do not try to visit a website but wait for a few more hours it will usually connect and be OK.  However, if I open a new tab or Private Window I have the same problem in the new one.  </p><p>Once it is up and running it appears to be working normally except for the new tabs.  I have been hibernating my computer with FF open rather than shut down so that I can use it the next day.  However, after a number of hours or on another day it will suddenly hang again for an unknown reason.  Then I reboot and start the procedure all over.  </p><p>I have tried every fix I can think of for FF.  The problem may be an issue with Windows, but Microsoft has no bulletins or fixes for this one.  I have updated to the latest build/version but nothing has changed.  Very frustrating.  </p><p>Any suggestions beyond the things I have already tried would be greatly appreciated.
