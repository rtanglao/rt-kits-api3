I know how to get the Page Info (Tools/Click Padlock) but noticed in the popup context menu for this version that it is missing now when right clicking on a page or image. Only see View Page Source in the menu. Anyway to get the context menu back so it shows ""View Page Info""? Maybe edit the ""about:config page""? </p><p>Ron </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,"",FoxyDerFox
