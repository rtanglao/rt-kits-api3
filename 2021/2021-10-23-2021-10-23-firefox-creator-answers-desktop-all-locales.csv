Tanto, que he decidido temporalmente cambiar mi navegador predeterminado (por lo pronto uso Explorer) Hasta ahora he revisado todos los detalles que acá se indican para resolver el problema (uso la última versión, los drivers están actualizados, nada de malwares, etc... de hecho, Explorer navega fluídamente), así que asumo es algún inconveniente no atribuible a lo allí citado. Por otra parte, desde hace mucho también uso el complemento AIO Search, pero ahora tampoco funciona con este Firefox. En Explorer sí está funcionando. La verdad me gustaría recuperar la rapidez de Firefox, pues hasta ahora siempre ha sido mi favorito </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,fix-problems,es,1453102;,alfredo.rdelgado

After that, nothing I typed in the URL box came out. I could open new tabs but not able to switch to them. All Chromium-based browsers and Edge in the same system worked fine. </p><p>I did the following trying to fix the problem: I restarted Win10 and ran FF93. Same problem. I restarted using Troubleshooting Mode. Same problem. I reinstalled using the complete package. Same problem. I installed using FF92 and FF91. Same problem. I refreshed FF93 using Troubleshooting Mode. Same problem. I used Win10 Safe Mode to run FF93. It worked. I uninstalled FF93, removed as much as I could all traces of FF and Mozilla in the Win registry, and reinstalled FF93. Same problem. </p><p>In the end, I had to use Win10 Recovery and revert to an earlier date to fix it.  </p><p>The first incident happened about two weeks ago. It happened again this morning. My use of PC has been routine for years, I would say for more than a decade, or at least in the last five years. No extraordinary applications or routines.  </p><p>BTW, I haven't updated my Win10 in years, because doing so often times gave me new mysterious issues to troubleshoot, courtesy of MS. You should very well know Win updates produce issues, and the bug fixes following them produce even more. The annoying thing is I would research on the issues and find out later (sometimes days) that the updates were the culprits.  </p><p>This is the second time it happened to my FF93, and I feel I have to report this to get some idea about why this is happening (only to me?) and how to fix or prevent it without having to go into Recovery (again?). </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,other,en-US,1453077;1453090;1453105;1453158;,mobilesuit600
