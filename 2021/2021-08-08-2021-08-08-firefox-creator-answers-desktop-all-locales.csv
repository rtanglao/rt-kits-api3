I went through this process several times to no avail (yes, even after rebooting my computer). Eventually, I had to export my bookmarks from Chrome as an html file and then open the file in Firefox, which worked well enough in the moment.  </p><p>Now I have rather tragically and belated realized that Firefox is not saving any of my passwords either. It will act like it is, with that little pop-up asking me if I'd like it to remember for me, and in settings, it says that I have autofill turned on. But when I go looking for passwords in the settings, there are no logins found, and if I logout of an account and try to log back in, it doesn't autofill.  </p><p>When I go to settings and ask it to synchronise logins and passwords, I can click the box and it will give me a blue checkmark. I can then hit ""synchronize now"" once and the logins and passwords icon will appear in the ""you are currently synchronizing"" box, but if I hit sync again, the icon disappears and I have to recheck the box. Either way, nothing else seems to change.  </p><p>Then I tried to pair Firefox to my phone using <a href=""http://firefox.com/pair"" rel=""nofollow"">firefox.com/pair</a>, but as soon as the page loads (and before attempting to pair), I get a ""pairing unsuccessful. Try again."" message. Nothing happens if I click the refresh button. It does not refresh.  </p><p>All these problems seem vaguely related, but other than that, I'm completely mystified.  </p><p>Someone please help, for I am a weak-willed consumer who does not consider fighting with my own computer a hobby. I just want this to work, or else I'll have to abandon it and run back into the all-knowing embrace of Google.  </p><p><br> I have a Macbook Air running 11.3.1 </p><p>I have a few plug-ins installed, but these problems started as soon as I downloaded Firefox and before I installed them, so I doubt it's them </p>",mac-os;desktop;sync;firefox-900;firefox-9002;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",columbusclara

The breach report that I received stated: ""Compromised data: Passwords, Phone numbers"", and presumably my email address that was identified at pwned. This breached software firm serves one specific industry area. What puzzles me is that I have no web accounts with any firm in the industry area that is served by the software company that was breached. All my web accounts are written down in a well maintained Word list, and all passwords are unique to each site.  If I have no web account passwords to be breached, then why did pwned report a password breach? In the first few minutes, this being my first breach report, I imagined in panic mode that my email password had been breached, but that makes no sense. My email provider or my desktop would have to be breached for my email password to be revealed. Perhaps the ""password"" breach message is not to be taken literally, that the warning should be interpreted as: <em>If you have a web account with firms serviced by the breached software company, then the hackers have your web account password.</em> I can understand that my email address was breached, meaning associated with my name and phone number, but password?  No mention of my address? Is there some brief, useful wording in this direction that Firefox Monitor could add to these warning emails, giving them context and intepretation, perhaps ""PASSWORDS"" HERE REFER TO WEB ACCOUNT PASSWORDS. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-900;,firefox,other,en-US,1433440;1433445;1433446;1433451;1433464;1433492;1433493;1433494;,Quenchoo
