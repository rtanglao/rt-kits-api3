Nem értem miért kell felülírni a felhasználó beállításait? Azt meg végképp nem értem, hogy miért nem lehet visszaállítani azokat? Miért mutatja azt a beállításokban, hogy úgy van beállítva az indítás, ahogy én szeretné, közben mégsem úgy indul? Mi ez? Vagy az egész arra megy ki, online tartsam a fiókomat folyamatosan?
