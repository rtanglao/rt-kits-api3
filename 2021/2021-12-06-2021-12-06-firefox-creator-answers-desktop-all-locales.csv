I hate having to reach over for the mouse and line everything up to go to the next screen. Since the last update, it seems I can't do that. When I hit the down arrow, or the PgDn key, it skips randomly down the page. This is especially true if I am reading an article with pictures in it. I think this might have something to do with my clicking yes to an inquiry from Firefox that just appeared on the page while I was browsing. It asked whether I wanted to be able to block text with keyboard commands. I'd like to change it back to whatever it was before, but can't figure out how to do that.

Azt sem szeretem, ha bele akarnak kényszeríteni egy olyan rendszerbe, mint ez is ahol egyszerű dolgok miatt is be kell jelentkeznem egy diókba. Ez számomra már nem normális dolog.   Nem értem miért kell felülírni a felhasználó beállításait? Azt meg végképp nem értem, hogy miért nem lehet visszaállítani azokat? Miért mutatja azt a beállításokban, hogy úgy van beállítva az indítás, ahogy én szeretné, közben mégsem úgy indul? Mi ez? Vagy az egész arra megy ki, online tartsam a fiókomat folyamatosan?
