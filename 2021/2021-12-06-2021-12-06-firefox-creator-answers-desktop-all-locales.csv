Looking at various things in <a href=""http://Easysnews.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Easysnews.com</a>, for instance thumbnails, the title for that item used to change from blue (Unvisted Links) to brown (Visited Links) and keep the brown color until I exited Easynews. Now it does not.  In another case, looking at my list of favorite groups, the group name will turn brown as long as my mouse is over it but it will not stick if I select that item. </p><p>I am not using system colors and Override the colors specified by the page with your selections above is set to Only With High Contrast themes.
