The monitor is 1920 x 1080 for 15"". I'm on Windows 10 using Firefox Nightly (96.0a1) but it does the same thing with Firefox (94.0.2). Probably irrelevant but I'm using a colorways theme on both versions. When moving the window to another monitor, the menus appear in their normal sizes.

Nem is értem.... egyszer csak felülírta a beállításaimat és azóta sem lehet visszaállítani. Ez nem csak bosszantó, de de szemtelenség is!!! Úgy látom a Firefox is beállt a sorba és azok közé az alkalmazások közé akar tartozni, amik az felülbírálják az eszköz (pc) tulajdonosának szándékait. Szándékosan kényelmetlenné és kellemetlenné teszik a böngészést. Hosszú ideig a kedvenc böngészőm volt, de most azt gondolom, hogy kénytelen leszek megválni tőle! Sajnálom, de nehezen viselem, ha át akarják venni az irányítást a gépemen, ahogy ezt a MS is tesz már nagyon régen. Azt sem szeretem, ha bele akarnak kényszeríteni egy olyan rendszerbe, mint ez is ahol egyszerű dolgok miatt is be kell jelentkeznem egy diókba. Ez számomra már nem normális dolog.   Nem értem miért kell felülírni a felhasználó beállításait? Azt meg végképp nem értem, hogy miért nem lehet visszaállítani azokat? Miért mutatja azt a beállításokban, hogy úgy van beállítva az indítás, ahogy én szeretné, közben mégsem úgy indul? Mi ez? Vagy az egész arra megy ki, online tartsam a fiókomat folyamatosan? Mert azt biztos nem teszem! Inkább törlöm az alkalmazásukat!
