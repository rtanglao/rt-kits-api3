I have some programs installed on the Windows machine that installed an extension for Firefox. Those programs are not Mac compatible but because of the same account, those extensions were copied to the Firefox installation on Mac. I was wondering if there is a way to isolate the extensions to just the windows installation? Thanks! </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-940;firefox-9402;,firefox,customize,en-US,1464412;,maverickjatt
