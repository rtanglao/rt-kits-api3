I was running bit older version so i don't know if this options were removed when in later versions. There used to be a option in Library and in Library icon on address bar where i could go to my pocket list. Now there is no option, the only button there is to save page in pocket which was always there but no way to go and see them easily. Second option i cant find is ""restart firefox with addons disabled"" i used to use this to check if the problem i am having are because of some addons or what. It was very useful for me but cant seem to find it now in new version. I am running Firefox 88.0(64bit) version. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",cycloneaniket

Chrome doesn't work with my high contrast theme since the last Windows update, so I really need to use Firefox, but I also would like to be able to use this website too. This website doesn't offer a regular login option, you have to use either Facebook or a cell phone. I don't have a cell phone that gets text messages, so I can't do that, so I need to be able to log in with Facebook. I can't find anywhere in my setting where I have it disabled. I even have the site whitelisted (in Trusted Sites) in Ublock Origins to no avail. I may have, at one point, a long time ago, once dismissed a Facebook log in prompt and told it to never ask me again. How would I go about telling it to please ask me again? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",Phaewryn1

And having to do with things mentioned in a text someone sent me. Neither I nor the texter have a Google phone. I don't have Chrome installed, so it's not like I had their browser open. Don't know how they're doing it. It's creeping me out. It cannot be coincidence. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1410541;,FOXFIRE5000

I have cleared my cookies, turned off my add-ons (only have u-block origin), and even started firefox in troubleshooting mode, but the problem persists. I have no clue about what to do at this point. The first part of youtube does load fine, but if I try to scroll down, it just stays blank. Sometimes videos do load, but not the comments. Finally, youtube studio does work, it's just the main site and trying to watch videos that gives me trouble. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",qempireq1

First I'm not very proficient at typing, I use the hunt and peck method, I have to look at the keyboard to type. But it seems like when I hit certain keys like: W, E, R, T, Y or in that area of keys, things happen I do not want. For one, I had to type this in my email and copy and paste here, because the tab that this was open in, kept reloading and I would lose everything I typed.  Even in the email, several times when I hit the E R keys a window would pop up asking if I wanted to leave the page. Or what I was typing would show up in the search block at the top of the email screen. When I'm typing out a comment in YouTube, the tab will reload and I lose everything. Sometimes in my gmail account, typing an email to someone, or in another site like YouTube or a companies website typing out a question or answering one, if the tab doesn't reload, a Bing search popup window opens.I thought it might be my keyboard as it was quite old, but I just replaced it with a new one and the problem has gotten worse. I've run a virus scan and every other scan on Avast that I have and there is nothing and Avast is current. I have the Windows 10 Hotkeys turned off. This is getting really annoying. I do not know if it is a Windows problem or a Firefox problem or a computer problem. So far no one has been able to give me an answer.Are there Shortcut Keys in Firefox, more in Windows 10 other than the hot keys, or is there some other program I need to disable?Please Get back with me on this.Robert </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,1410535;,EIBBOR2654
