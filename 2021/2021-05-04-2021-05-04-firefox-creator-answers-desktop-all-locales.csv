And having to do with things mentioned in a text someone sent me. Neither I nor the texter have a Google phone. I don't have Chrome installed, so it's not like I had their browser open. Don't know how they're doing it. It's creeping me out. It cannot be coincidence. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",FOXFIRE5000

I have cleared my cookies, turned off my add-ons (only have u-block origin), and even started firefox in troubleshooting mode, but the problem persists. I have no clue about what to do at this point. The first part of youtube does load fine, but if I try to scroll down, it just stays blank. Sometimes videos do load, but not the comments. Finally, youtube studio does work, it's just the main site and trying to watch videos that gives me trouble. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",qempireq1

First I'm not very proficient at typing, I use the hunt and peck method, I have to look at the keyboard to type. But it seems like when I hit certain keys like: W, E, R, T, Y or in that area of keys, things happen I do not want. For one, I had to type this in my email and copy and paste here, because the tab that this was open in, kept reloading and I would lose everything I typed.  Even in the email, several times when I hit the E R keys a window would pop up asking if I wanted to leave the page. Or what I was typing would show up in the search block at the top of the email screen. When I'm typing out a comment in YouTube, the tab will reload and I lose everything. Sometimes in my gmail account, typing an email to someone, or in another site like YouTube or a companies website typing out a question or answering one, if the tab doesn't reload, a Bing search popup window opens.I thought it might be my keyboard as it was quite old, but I just replaced it with a new one and the problem has gotten worse. I've run a virus scan and every other scan on Avast that I have and there is nothing and Avast is current. I have the Windows 10 Hotkeys turned off. This is getting really annoying. I do not know if it is a Windows problem or a Firefox problem or a computer problem. So far no one has been able to give me an answer.Are there Shortcut Keys in Firefox, more in Windows 10 other than the hot keys, or is there some other program I need to disable?Please Get back with me on this.Robert </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,1410535;,EIBBOR2654

Tried signing into Firefox Android, same thing, no email received to login.  So I logged into my Mozilla account using Chrome on my phone. Got in fine. I can see the recent login attempts in history.   </p><p>So I try and add a secondary email, which first, wants me to verify my email, which I'm still not getting...   </p><p>I have used this email for Mozilla since 2016, no problem.  Looks like the last email from Mozilla I got was from 3/23/21. I wonder if they are blocking my domain unintentionally or something. I use my own domain for email - <a href=""http://protonus.ws"" rel=""nofollow"">protonus.ws</a> - and I fully control the email on it. Yes I checked my spam folder. Searched the server, last thing from Mozilla was 3/23.  Anyone know who I can contact to see what's up? </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",mozilla225

Rebooted system to previous kernel, but problem still occurred. Downgraded firefox to previous version, but that also resulted in no change. Checked the rpm listing, and found that nss i686 had also been updated in last pass, so did a reinstall of the nss*x86_64 files. Problem disappeared, and firefox was back to loading in seconds versus the 2 minutes and 40 seconds. (Does seem to work ok once loaded).  Reloaded with latest kernel, an it still worked. Upgraded to latest firefox again, and still worked. Ran fine for a full day, but then it started doing the same. Tried the nss reinstall, but no change. Rebooted machine, no other changes, and it went back to working?? </p><p>Have the strace dump file that is about 4M - line numbers that issue happens. 2687	ppoll([{fd=10, events=POLLIN}], 1, {tv_sec=119, tv_nsec=999420000}, NULL, 8) = 1 ([{fd=10, revents=POLLIN}], left {tv_sec=46, tv_nsec=773625894}) </p><pre> 4422	ppoll([{fd=14, events=POLLIN}], 1, {tv_sec=119, tv_nsec=999274000}, NULL, 8) = 1 ([{fd=14, revents=POLLIN}], left {tv_sec=113, tv_nsec=850834948}) </pre> <p>Total of 57123 lines firefox.bad </p><p>A run without the errors is about 50866 lines long and has no ppoll lines?? </p><p>Only seen error with firefox, so not sure if it is related to firefox or firefox with something else in system?? </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-880;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mikes5
