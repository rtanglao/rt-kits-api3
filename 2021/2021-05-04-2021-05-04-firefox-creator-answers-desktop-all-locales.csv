I can still search for the firefox app and open it that way or I can start it from the START page that comes up when I hit the windows key on the keyboard. But I am not allowed to drag and drop it onto the taskbar as it says it's already there. It's sorta there I guess because FF is open right now while I type this and this open tab is indicated on the taskbar. If I were to close the FF window there would be no FF logo on the taskbar. </p><p>Right clicking the firefox app in the start list that comes up when I left click on the windows icon in the lower left or hit the windows key on my keypad gives me options to unpin FF from the start page or unpin it from the taskbar. I don't want to do that. </p><p>I did something to mess this up and I can't fix it. I want the FF logo back on my taskbar so when I power up the machine I can click on the logo in the taskbar to get to the browser with all my previously open tabs back. </p><p>The latest Windows 10 a Lenovo yoga laptop if it matters. </p><p>Thanks </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,"",buythiscanoe

First I'm not very proficient at typing, I use the hunt and peck method, I have to look at the keyboard to type. But it seems like when I hit certain keys like: W, E, R, T, Y or in that area of keys, things happen I do not want. For one, I had to type this in my email and copy and paste here, because the tab that this was open in, kept reloading and I would lose everything I typed.  Even in the email, several times when I hit the E R keys a window would pop up asking if I wanted to leave the page. Or what I was typing would show up in the search block at the top of the email screen. When I'm typing out a comment in YouTube, the tab will reload and I lose everything. Sometimes in my gmail account, typing an email to someone, or in another site like YouTube or a companies website typing out a question or answering one, if the tab doesn't reload, a Bing search popup window opens.I thought it might be my keyboard as it was quite old, but I just replaced it with a new one and the problem has gotten worse. I've run a virus scan and every other scan on Avast that I have and there is nothing and Avast is current. I have the Windows 10 Hotkeys turned off. This is getting really annoying. I do not know if it is a Windows problem or a Firefox problem or a computer problem. So far no one has been able to give me an answer.Are there Shortcut Keys in Firefox, more in Windows 10 other than the hot keys, or is there some other program I need to disable?Please Get back with me on this.Robert </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,1410535;,EIBBOR2654
