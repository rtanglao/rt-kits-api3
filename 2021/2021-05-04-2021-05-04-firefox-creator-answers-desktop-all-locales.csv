Tried signing into Firefox Android, same thing, no email received to login.  So I logged into my Mozilla account using Chrome on my phone. Got in fine. I can see the recent login attempts in history.   </p><p>So I try and add a secondary email, which first, wants me to verify my email, which I'm still not getting...   </p><p>I have used this email for Mozilla since 2016, no problem.  Looks like the last email from Mozilla I got was from 3/23/21. I wonder if they are blocking my domain unintentionally or something. I use my own domain for email - <a href=""http://protonus.ws"" rel=""nofollow"">protonus.ws</a> - and I fully control the email on it. Yes I checked my spam folder. Searched the server, last thing from Mozilla was 3/23.  Anyone know who I can contact to see what's up? </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",mozilla225

At same time, google chrome will load in seconds, just like firefox when it is working correctly. </p><p>First time it happened was after an upgrade to latest kernel, so thought that might have been it. Rebooted system to previous kernel, but problem still occurred. Downgraded firefox to previous version, but that also resulted in no change. Checked the rpm listing, and found that nss i686 had also been updated in last pass, so did a reinstall of the nss*x86_64 files. Problem disappeared, and firefox was back to loading in seconds versus the 2 minutes and 40 seconds. (Does seem to work ok once loaded).  Reloaded with latest kernel, an it still worked. Upgraded to latest firefox again, and still worked. Ran fine for a full day, but then it started doing the same. Tried the nss reinstall, but no change. Rebooted machine, no other changes, and it went back to working?? </p><p>Have the strace dump file that is about 4M - line numbers that issue happens. 2687	ppoll([{fd=10, events=POLLIN}], 1, {tv_sec=119, tv_nsec=999420000}, NULL, 8) = 1 ([{fd=10, revents=POLLIN}], left {tv_sec=46, tv_nsec=773625894}) </p><pre> 4422	ppoll([{fd=14, events=POLLIN}], 1, {tv_sec=119, tv_nsec=999274000}, NULL, 8) = 1 ([{fd=14, revents=POLLIN}], left {tv_sec=113, tv_nsec=850834948}) </pre> <p>Total of 57123 lines firefox.bad </p><p>A run without the errors is about 50866 lines long and has no ppoll lines?? </p><p>Only seen error with firefox, so not sure if it is related to firefox or firefox with something else in system?? </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-880;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mikes5
