This also happens when I start Firefox in safemode, and when I start my PC in safemode with networking.  I have cleared the cache, I have deleted each extension, I have even deleted each and every bookmark. I have deleted, redownloaded, and reinstalled the latest version of Firefox.  I have even done a full reinstall of Windows 10.  My HDD is less than two months old, and shows no errors when scanned.  This problem does occur with other browsers, but not for the same length of time, Chrome will use 100% of my HDD for one minute, tops.  Once Firefox stops doing whatever it is doing to my HDD after an hour or so, it will run in the background using 0% of my Disk.  Through all of this, the Memory use goes no higher than 18%, and CPU no higher than 45% for a few seconds. </p><p>If I open a second tab in Firefox, or a separate instance of Firefox, it does not use the HDD very much at all. </p><p>If I close all Firefox instances and then reopen a new one, it will, again bog down my HDD for about an hour. </p><p>The unacceptable solution I've come up with is to open Firefox immediately after turning on my PC and to leave it running in the background for that entire time. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",stephen.m.taggart
