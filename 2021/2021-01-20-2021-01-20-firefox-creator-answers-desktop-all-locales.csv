If this is the wrong place, please forgive my error and make sure it gets to where it should be. </p><p>Although I believe Firefox, as the last mainstream browser not owned or operated by a major tech company, is critical to keeping a more independent web, I'm very frustrated with a 'quirk' in developer mode. </p><p>It seems to unpredictably, randomly switch to 'original sources'. Normally it is an annoyance, not a critical issue, but this evening I was working on restyling a page's CSS, had gotten a fair chunk of work done, and of course, hadn't saved my progress. When I selected an element and went to edit it, Firefox pulled up the original source instead of the modified files I had been working on, and then overwrote everything that I had previously changed after I made the edit. </p><p>The fact that I didn't save my work is on me and I accept that, but the fact that Firefox decided to switch to the 'original source' instead of the modified files I had been working on without problems for over half an hour, and then offered no way to get back to the modifications I had been making, is not. </p><p>After experimentation, the 'original source' checkbox doesn't seem to do anything when I toggle it, which indicates to me that it's either buggy or the interface is not clear about what and where things are being changed. I only remember this becoming a problem relatively recently, so I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt and assume that it's broken, but whether it's a bug or it's intentional behavior, it ought to be changed. </p><p>Thanks for your time, attention, and patience. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,1385352;,james163

Malfunction observed:  After uninstalling ""Adob flash player"" dated January 13,2021 and upon the requested installation of VLC 3.0.12 with web plugin, Mozilla plugin and Active X plugin activated, it is impossible to open the ""Free box TV"" function or button or application. Indeed a double click on this button invariably leads to the edition of the message: ""impossible to watch TV, you must install "" flash player ""plugin (which no longer exists since January 12,2021)or the VLC plugin which is a NPAPI one (not allowed by Firefox). Everything happens as if the installation of VLC had not been detected. I tried with 2 other browsers: microsoft Edge and Avast secure browser with an identical malfunction  NB: the VLC player works nominally and allows to read the TV network stream from the freebox server. Questions: Q1: Do I have to install the extension or the module ""Open in VLC media player"" in the Firefox browser in order to open  the ""Freebox TV"" application?  Q2: Do I have to wait for a further Freebox development of this function which would be based on HTML5?  with my thanks </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-840;firefox-8402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",christian.bainier
