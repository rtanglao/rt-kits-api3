Malfunction observed:  After uninstalling ""Adob flash player"" dated January 13,2021 and upon the requested installation of VLC 3.0.12 with web plugin, Mozilla plugin and Active X plugin activated, it is impossible to open the ""Free box TV"" function or button or application. Indeed a double click on this button invariably leads to the edition of the message: ""impossible to watch TV, you must install "" flash player ""plugin (which no longer exists since January 12,2021)or the VLC plugin which is a NPAPI one (not allowed by Firefox). Everything happens as if the installation of VLC had not been detected. I tried with 2 other browsers: microsoft Edge and Avast secure browser with an identical malfunction  NB: the VLC player works nominally and allows to read the TV network stream from the freebox server. Questions: Q1: Do I have to install the extension or the module ""Open in VLC media player"" in the Firefox browser in order to open  the ""Freebox TV"" application?  Q2: Do I have to wait for a further Freebox development of this function which would be based on HTML5?  with my thanks </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-840;firefox-8402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",christian.bainier
