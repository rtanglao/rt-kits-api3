Almost nothing in there is bookmarks. Near every page saved to the ""Other Bookmarks"" folder is a seemingly random page from my history (deleted and not) up to within a recent few months, which it then becomes my actual primary bookmarks (which I'll have to move, great to know my bookmarks started getting saved to a different folder). Is this meant to serve as an invasive ~highlights from your history~ a la your homepage thumbnails when none are pinned? Or is it some kind of absolutely wacky error with it trying to stuff my history into bookmarks? I'll emphasize just so it's not mistaken, up until the last few pages, every single page saved in ""Other Bookmarks"" is a random page from my history in chronological order, they are NOT bookmarked and have no reason to be. What causes this and why is this even a thing? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",Merrios
