Used to have an emblem for each one at the top right of my Firefox Home page but the Extension emblems or icons aren't there anymore. These Extensions are enabled. I can verify that. For instance I know I have the Weather Extension but without the icon to click on I can't open it. How can I put these icons back so I can use them? I looked under options on the General Page and I saw where you can drag icons from there back to the upper toolbar but the icons for my Extensions aren't there to drag back. The Extension icon is there...   looks like a piece of a puzzle. I dragged that to the toolbar but when I click on it it goes to a page showing that my extensions are enabled. But I still can't open the Weather extension on that page. I know if I had the weather icon back on the upper toolbar it will show me the weather.

However, I recently got a new Mac and now when I try the same thing it's not working. Whenever I first open Firefox after downloading it, it opens as the correct (older) version, however it does not seem to be able to connect to the internet and I get the spinning wheel that never ends, and then whenever I close out of Firefox and reopen it, it automatically updates to the newest version. I have multiple times gone into the settings on Firefox and changed my preferences to check with me before installing updates and I've gone into the settings of the App Store to make sure it's not automatically updating any apps or programs. My computer is currently running OS version 11.1 (Big Sur) and I'm wondering if maybe this version is too new to be compatible with Firefox 68 ESR?

If security is important then it's important to make it easy for users to see where links go before clicking on them. Full stop.
