When i turned it on today the window on my right hand monitor opened correctly.  However, the window on my left hand monitor had these problems (see the uploaded image) it was not full screen. It was split into a window at the bottom of the screen that showed the expected contents and a black window at the top of the screen that took mouse input. Note the 'KCOM webmail...' popup by the mouse cursor over the upper window. A right click on the desktop had no effect on the left hand monitor, as if something considered the window full screen. After restoring down the window on the right hand monitor a right click on that desktop showed the expected menu. I recovered from the problem by moving the mouse cursor over the black window until the 'Maximise' popup appeared and clicking. The window then became full screen and has behaved correctly since. I have xpdyinfo and xwininfo outputs in case they are useful. I upgraded from Ubuntu 16.04 to 18.04 about 2 weeks ago and have been using Firefox almost daily since then.

However, I recently got a new Mac and now when I try the same thing it's not working. Whenever I first open Firefox after downloading it, it opens as the correct (older) version, however it does not seem to be able to connect to the internet and I get the spinning wheel that never ends, and then whenever I close out of Firefox and reopen it, it automatically updates to the newest version. I have multiple times gone into the settings on Firefox and changed my preferences to check with me before installing updates and I've gone into the settings of the App Store to make sure it's not automatically updating any apps or programs. My computer is currently running OS version 11.1 (Big Sur) and I'm wondering if maybe this version is too new to be compatible with Firefox 68 ESR?
