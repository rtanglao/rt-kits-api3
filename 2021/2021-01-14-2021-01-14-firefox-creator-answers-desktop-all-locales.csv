How in the world do we view the URLs of links in Windows 10 now? The status bar has been totally disappeared, and although there are a number of add-ons, so many of them are about other kinds of status, or only show the URL in limited circumstances, that I'm having trouble figuring out which ones offer the basic view-URL-on-hover.  Does anyone have recommendations? </p><p>Even better, who can explain why it's a good idea to make it hard for users to see this absolutely vital information?  If security is important then it's important to make it easy for users to see where links go before clicking on them. Full stop. And even if the web were somehow magically totally safe, people don't want to waste their time and bandwidth playing guessing games. We want to know what something is before we bother to open it up. Why is that so very hard to understand????? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",fastauntie1

It works great but when I maximize the window (not F11 full screen, but Windows OS Maximize Window), this button disappears. Seems like a bug; I can't think why you would want that button to be removed when the window is maximized. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1383737;,jwdunham
