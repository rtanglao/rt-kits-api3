They are multicoloured.. Attached image I have tried in safe mode and same occurs.   Looked at Fonts and tried various changes with no success. When firefox opens existing windows and tabs may not have the problem.  A new tab such as this one will be ok.  Move to new window and problem occurs.  But not consistently ok or not. This has been occurring intermittently for some time. Any ideas please?  Thanks for your help. </p>,windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-930;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1450343;,iainhamilton6649

It sure is not perfect, but it certainly help maintain my online security. </p><p>So what on earth has happened? I can long on using my saved master password using both Chrome, and Bing ( the latest Microsoft browser - can't remember the name). I don't like to use either. I strongly prefer FireFox. </p><p>Beginning within the last month (I think -  not exactly when) all of a sudden the LastPass log on procedure  changed. Now, only with FireFox, when I click the LastPass icon a dialog box appears asking me to accept Permissions. I click accept, and the log on window appears. The program no longer fills in my email address, nor my stored master password. On the other browsers it does just as it used to do on FireFox. </p><p>Moving to the bottom of the LastPassword (using FireFox) log on dialog box to advanced options I always choose to activate the ""save email"" and save ""password"" options. Even when I manually enter my email address and master password LastPass does not save either my email or master password. </p><p>Mozilla needs to fix this! LastPass is one of the most popular password managers, and this situation is harmful to Mozilla and FireFox reputations and therefore popularity. Purely out of convenience I find myself using Chrome again often. This makes me unhappy on a lot of levels. Please get it done: Fix LastPass on FireFox! </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",d.brew.mayfield
