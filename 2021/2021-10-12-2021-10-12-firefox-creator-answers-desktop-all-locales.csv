I have checked settings but everything seems to be Ok. Unfortunately have had to use Chrome for those sites I previously browsed with Firefox and avoid having to login manually.

It sure is not perfect, but it certainly help maintain my online security. </p><p>So what on earth has happened? I can long on using my saved master password using both Chrome, and Bing ( the latest Microsoft browser - can't remember the name). I don't like to use either. I strongly prefer FireFox. </p><p>Beginning within the last month (I think -  not exactly when) all of a sudden the LastPass log on procedure  changed. Now, only with FireFox, when I click the LastPass icon a dialog box appears asking me to accept Permissions. I click accept, and the log on window appears. The program no longer fills in my email address, nor my stored master password. On the other browsers it does just as it used to do on FireFox. </p><p>Moving to the bottom of the LastPassword (using FireFox) log on dialog box to advanced options I always choose to activate the ""save email"" and save ""password"" options. Even when I manually enter my email address and master password LastPass does not save either my email or master password. </p><p>Mozilla needs to fix this! LastPass is one of the most popular password managers, and this situation is harmful to Mozilla and FireFox reputations and therefore popularity. Purely out of convenience I find myself using Chrome again often. This makes me unhappy on a lot of levels. Please get it done: Fix LastPass on FireFox! </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",d.brew.mayfield
