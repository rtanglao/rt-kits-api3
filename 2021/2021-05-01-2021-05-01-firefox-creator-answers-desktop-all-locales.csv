Examples of sites where I can no longer use Firefox and the problem(s) I encounter are the following: <em>shop disney</em>- can't log in; <em>shutterfly</em> - can't log in; <em>my webmail</em> - can read the email but can't send or reply;<em>my local newspaper</em> - can't do anything such as, reading the digital edition or place ads.  </p><p>Can someone please tell me Firefox is not going to become obsolete?

Troubleshoot Mode keeps the app from crashing, but the individual windows crash within 30 seconds.
