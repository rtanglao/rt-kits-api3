The funny thing is that the list is scrollable by mouse and arrow (up/down) keys, so it wouldn't be necessary to extend the list that far down. Just until the lower boundary of the current firefox windowwould have been sufficient. </p><p>The result is that I can't see (nor select) the usernames that are listed below the screen. </p><p>Firefox 75 64 bit on Fedora 32. </p><p>I hope this description was clear enough as I'm hesitant to include a screenshot showing all usernames involved on those site. </p><p>For anyone who wonders why so many logins: it's a list of email adresses currently in use in a webmail service. </p><p><br> Thanks. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-750;,firefox,other,en-US,"",arie_firefox.com

Usually I would just middle-click to scroll sideways but with some addons this is not possible (eg. LastPass only shows the ""Upgrade to Premium"" part and nothing else if it is in the Overflow menu). I love the minimalist black&amp;white look of my current Firefox setup so having the red LastPass icon outside of the Overflow menu would ruin that. Other addons just look bad with all that extra white space, like Windscribe (which should have a very small Addon window). </p><p>Is there some way to change the size of the addon window or report this as a bug to have it behave like addons should? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ntruter42

This has nothing to do with web sites, just the menu/bookmarks, toolbar icons, etc. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,customize,en-US,1385725;,oxymoron62

I see the template, but the items on the calendar won't load. I know it's not the calendar itself because it loads fine in Chrome and on all my android devices. I made sure all the add-ons were taken off. I refreshed. I cleared the cache. Erased history. Nothing worked. </p><p>I finally gave up, backed up all my bookmarks, and deleted Firefox. I downloaded it fresh and installed it again. Same problem! The calendar won't load. I found others complaining, but no one had a solution. </p><p>Not to be a conspiracy theorist, but a friend told me this was part of a ""browser war"" and Firefox would no longer support a variety of sites and apps. Is that true? Or do you have a solution. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",rkoreto
