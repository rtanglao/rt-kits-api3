I see the template, but the items on the calendar won't load. I know it's not the calendar itself because it loads fine in Chrome and on all my android devices. I made sure all the add-ons were taken off. I refreshed. I cleared the cache. Erased history. Nothing worked. </p><p>I finally gave up, backed up all my bookmarks, and deleted Firefox. I downloaded it fresh and installed it again. Same problem! The calendar won't load. I found others complaining, but no one had a solution. </p><p>Not to be a conspiracy theorist, but a friend told me this was part of a ""browser war"" and Firefox would no longer support a variety of sites and apps. Is that true? Or do you have a solution. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",rkoreto
