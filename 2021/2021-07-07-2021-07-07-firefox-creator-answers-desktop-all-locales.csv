All else operates normally.  5-yo Dell Inspiron 5559, W10 build 19042.1052.  </p><p>A surprise unsolicited add-on update -- allegedly of Video Download Helper-- is highly suspected. However, coincidentally, I had just uninstalled MS Office 365 and One Drive, and the first indication of trouble was persistence of startup error notification, ""Cannot open /cannot locate vcruntime140.dll,"" though ostensibly, it was indeed properly in the directory folder.  Signs pointed to a contaminated Visual C++ runtime error but its reinstallation netted nothing. </p><p>FF Options &amp; Settings are not accessible but Bookmarks &amp; History are.  (2) re-installations netted no change except at #2, bookmarks toolbar shifted left-justified from center, the smaller secondary Search window with its dropdown search-engine options disappeared, and my default DDG engine was replaced by Gewgoyle after allowing popup offering ""a fresh look."" </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ssenour
