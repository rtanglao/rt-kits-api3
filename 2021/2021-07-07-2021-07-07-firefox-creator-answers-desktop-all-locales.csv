The UI loads without any issues. However, no pages can be loaded, including Firefox's own pages like ""about:preferences"" or ""about:performance."" I completely removed all traces of Firefox from the computer twice (using Revo Uninstaller's advanced mode), but the problem remained after each reinstallation attempt. On the second of those reinstall attempts, I checked the Console after trying to load one of those control pages and found the error messages shown in the attached screenshot. What is happening, and how can I get Firefox working again? </p><p>(Note: Since I have completely uninstalled Firefox again since taking this screenshot, there is no troubleshooting data to send.) </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,1426167;1426168;1426183;,tomus.wat

All else operates normally.  5-yo Dell Inspiron 5559, W10 build 19042.1052.  </p><p>A surprise unsolicited add-on update -- allegedly of Video Download Helper-- is highly suspected. However, coincidentally, I had just uninstalled MS Office 365 and One Drive, and the first indication of trouble was persistence of startup error notification, ""Cannot open /cannot locate vcruntime140.dll,"" though ostensibly, it was indeed properly in the directory folder.  Signs pointed to a contaminated Visual C++ runtime error but its reinstallation netted nothing. </p><p>FF Options &amp; Settings are not accessible but Bookmarks &amp; History are.  (2) re-installations netted no change except at #2, bookmarks toolbar shifted left-justified from center, the smaller secondary Search window with its dropdown search-engine options disappeared, and my default DDG engine was replaced by Gewgoyle after allowing popup offering ""a fresh look."" </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ssenour
