The UI loads without any issues. However, no pages can be loaded, including Firefox's own pages like ""about:preferences"" or ""about:performance."" I completely removed all traces of Firefox from the computer twice (using Revo Uninstaller's advanced mode), but the problem remained after each reinstallation attempt. On the second of those reinstall attempts, I checked the Console after trying to load one of those control pages and found the error messages shown in the attached screenshot.
