It will display the background map image but fails to display the radar overlay image of precipitation, clouds, etc.  I suspected at first that perhaps that might be caused by AdBlock Plus or other security/privacy software to block pop-ups; but after whitelisting both sites, examining potential options on my Firefox browser, clearing browser history, and reinstalling Firefox, I'm still unable to display radar images on either weather URL. </p><p>The failure to display radar overlays is the only symptom I've noticed.  I have no difficulty displaying radar images on my cellphone or using Edge on the laptop, so it would seem the problem is somewhere in the laptop or Firefox software; but the problem on the laptop began with no apparent connection to any updates of software, Firefox, or anti-malware, which sometimes cause unexpected problems.  I'm totally baffled! Do you have any suggestions for elsewhere to look? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",rshriner

But if I press Alt+click a link in the page, the link does not open in a new tab (while Shift+click can open in a new window as expected). I'm not sure if it's a problem, but I hope Firefox can have this feature so that opening a link in a new tab can be more convenient. </p><p>Besides, in some browsers, drag a link to a nearby place will open in a new tab. However, in Firefox, this manner does not work, unless I drag a link to the tabs bar. </p>",desktop;beta;tabs;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1381145;1381147;1381151;,SolidBlock

I usually have 3 FF profiles running, about 10-20 tabs each and when it suddenly does this - I can restart them all but when it is suitable for me. </p><p>The only solution I can see so far is disabling updates via group policies (which is not well documented, where do i put this policies.json on fedora? need to google that). </p><p>Any other ways to keep updates and FF running until I decide when to restart?
