For me it's this simple:  I DON'T WANT THOSE DARNED SUGGESTIONS!

But if I press Alt+click a link in the page, the link does not open in a new tab (while Shift+click can open in a new window as expected). I'm not sure if it's a problem, but I hope Firefox can have this feature so that opening a link in a new tab can be more convenient. </p><p>Besides, in some browsers, drag a link to a nearby place will open in a new tab. However, in Firefox, this manner does not work, unless I drag a link to the tabs bar. </p>",desktop;beta;tabs;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1381145;1381147;1381151;,SolidBlock

Is there a way to keep FF working in such situation? I usually have 3 FF profiles running, about 10-20 tabs each and when it suddenly does this - I can restart them all but when it is suitable for me. </p><p>The only solution I can see so far is disabling updates via group policies (which is not well documented, where do i put this policies.json on fedora? need to google that). </p><p>Any other ways to keep updates and FF running until I decide when to restart?
