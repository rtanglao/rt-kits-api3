I've had this problem before at the end of last year. After a while it got better. But now I have to wait again. I scanned windows with various anti-virus and anti-malware programs. I have absolutely nothing. I only use Microsoft anti-virus.  I have run many repair options on the net. I have also uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox.

Google Docs/Sheets always generates a PDF when told to print. These PDFs are not opening in Firefox. If I set Firefox to 'always ask', I receive the prompt for what to do with the PDF from Google, and here I can open it in Preview (I am on Mac) or tell it to open in Firefox and it will open a new tab and display the PDF. But if Firefox is told to always open the PDF itself, then no new tab opens with the PDF, and the PDF doesn't load in the existing tab either. Is there a way to have Firefox always open up PDFs -and- have the Google generated PDF open properly? </p><p>If it helps, I am on MacOS Big Sur 11.2, but have seen this with previous versions of the OS. Firefox is up to date (85.0.2), but I've also seen this happen with earlier versions of Firefox. I have tried this with all extensions off as well as the usual extensions on.

But FF security an privacy has got so good now I'm having problems with online shopping and security used by PayPal and Ebay. I have FF set as default browser but I can also use Chrome, which I know is very leaky, both are connecting to the same VPN IP. and DNS server. </p><p>Chrome options are set vanilla, i.e privacy (lack of!) and security are as it ships default. My FF options are now set with private browsing off and cookies trusted for Ebay and Paypal. Fingerprint detection might be an issue because I know many sites are using it. My FF cookies are cleared at shutdown but cookie exceptions are set for these sites. </p><p>Ebay checkout using a PayPal option  links to the PP site login, then returns to their checkout basket. Very often FF just sits there with a screen waiting for the final confirmation. If I switch to Chrome the final checkout and payment confirmation succeeds. I have noticed on FF there's TLS transfer activity (handshake?) during this waiting period when nothing happens. These payment checkouts don't seem to like private browsing either, which I have had to turn off. </p><p>Until recently this was just a nuisance, until one auction site decided my login credentials had been compromised and blocked account access. </p><p>Unless somebody has the solution, I'm wondering if I can set options in Firefox to start with minimal privacy aka Chrome, then increase the level in stages until secure checkout breaks?

I tried going into task manager to close it manually which didn't work. I tried shutting off my laptop altogether which didn't work either. I also tried doing the refresh option after uninstalling and reinstalling and that did not work. This is the only application on my computer doing this, and it is not an internet issue because I am asking about this while using microsoft edge. I am not sure what to do and am becoming frustrated because a lot of passwords I don't have written down are attached to my firefox browser and I just don't like microsoft edge or chrome as much. I attached a photo of the error I am getting, as well as the blank webpage I get when I try to use the program. If anyone has any advice on this or knows how to fix the issue I would appreciate any help greatly. Thanks so much! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",lexilou902
