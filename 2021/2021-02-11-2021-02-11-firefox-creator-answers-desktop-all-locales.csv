I had to uninstall the update and re-install 85.0.  </p><p>Is there a known issue that will be fixed soon? It's time-consuming to go through the uninstallation/reinstallation process and I'm afraid to say yes to the update until I know I won't have to keep doing this.

Furthermore, you can stick your liberal viewpoints straight up your fucking ass. Your pushing for censorship of millions of americans just because your afraid of what will happen when they get pissed, newsflash, that is why the constitution contains the 2nd amendment. To scare the government away from making stupid choices. I will be uninstalling Mozilla anything permanently, and I hope your fucking company goes bankrupt.

I tried going into task manager to close it manually which didn't work. I tried shutting off my laptop altogether which didn't work either. I also tried doing the refresh option after uninstalling and reinstalling and that did not work. This is the only application on my computer doing this, and it is not an internet issue because I am asking about this while using microsoft edge. I am not sure what to do and am becoming frustrated because a lot of passwords I don't have written down are attached to my firefox browser and I just don't like microsoft edge or chrome as much. I attached a photo of the error I am getting, as well as the blank webpage I get when I try to use the program. If anyone has any advice on this or knows how to fix the issue I would appreciate any help greatly. Thanks so much! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",lexilou902
