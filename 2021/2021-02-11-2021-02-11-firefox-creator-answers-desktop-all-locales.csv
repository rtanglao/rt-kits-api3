And why should I fiddle with my Windows or driver settings to make a browser happy, anyway?  That seems more like a sign of browser problems for obvious, logical reasons. </p><p>I have attached screenshots of the same webpage snippet on Chrome, Edge, Opera, and Firefox.  The Firefox image is the last, bluest, and incorrect rendering of the webpage colour. </p><p>I have tried going into the Color menu and cancelling the override option (selecting ""Never"" in the drop-down menu).  I've even gone into advanced settings and set gfx.color_management.mode to 0 - nothing works. </p><p>If anyone can help with this it would be much appreciated. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-850;firefox-8502;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",liquidfractal

I also tried doing the refresh option after uninstalling and reinstalling and that did not work. This is the only application on my computer doing this, and it is not an internet issue because I am asking about this while using microsoft edge. I am not sure what to do and am becoming frustrated because a lot of passwords I don't have written down are attached to my firefox browser and I just don't like microsoft edge or chrome as much. I attached a photo of the error I am getting, as well as the blank webpage I get when I try to use the program.
