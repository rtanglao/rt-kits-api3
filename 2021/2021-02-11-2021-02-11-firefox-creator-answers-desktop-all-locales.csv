In Edward Jones account and selecting a check to view (this is an image not a copy) and print once the check is shown you hit print (this produces a copy of the check) and the check blows up bigger than the screen and in Firefox no matter what scale you choose in the printer preferences the right third of the check is not shown.  I even tried tagging input at 11X17 and output letter. But in Chrome when hitting the print button the check blows up but Chrome has more options and then I can scale it to 60% and then the whole check shrinks and is visible, printing then produces the whole check. I do not see in Firefox a way to scale the copy of the image after the image is converted to a copy from a financial institution.  If you know of a way please send the steps to do it. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-850;,firefox,other,en-US,"",DwyerCorporation

It needs to stop!,"<p>Ever since I installed the last update, 84, which caused a host of problems I will not go into, an unanticipated one was that I can non longer output to PDF as Firefox automatically changes it to Firefox HTML Files.  I can view them in Acrobat, but the subtle difference makes it impossible for Word Perfect to recognise them if I  need to import them back (as in when something gets lost and all I have is the PDF).  Please, community, do NOT tell me all I need to do is use MS Word to fix this.  This is NEVER going to happen, now or ever!  Now that this made clear, what, if anything can I do?  And why would Firefox have anything to DO with me converting WP files into PDF?  Clearly there is some greedy little finger stuck somewhere, because the proof is in the long list of files I now have that are no longer PDF.   I have opened them in Acrobat and saved them again, but they still show up as FIrefox HTML Files.  Aaargh! Help, please!  It's driving me mad! </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ljorde

I tried going into task manager to close it manually which didn't work. I tried shutting off my laptop altogether which didn't work either. I also tried doing the refresh option after uninstalling and reinstalling and that did not work. This is the only application on my computer doing this, and it is not an internet issue because I am asking about this while using microsoft edge. I am not sure what to do and am becoming frustrated because a lot of passwords I don't have written down are attached to my firefox browser and I just don't like microsoft edge or chrome as much. I attached a photo of the error I am getting, as well as the blank webpage I get when I try to use the program. If anyone has any advice on this or knows how to fix the issue I would appreciate any help greatly. Thanks so much! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1391314;1391319;,lexilou902
