When I imported the personal .json file on the Mac, the bookmarks did get imported but all jumbled up - the folders were still there but empty and all the bookmarks were just dumped in random order in the Bookmarks Menu root folder. So I tried synchronising profiles instead which didn't work either. </p><p>Now I'm back home and of course the synch has messed up the bookmarks on my PC as well. I deleted everything, restored the bookmarks from the personal .json again, and it does restore them properly for about 2 seconds and then all of the neatly sorted bookmarks in their folders get overwritten again by the jumbled mess. The same thing happens when I restore from the automatic restore point instead (from a day before my holiday). </p><p>I have disconnected the snych, restarted and updated several times, and tried this on both PC and Mac with both the personal and work .json files, with the same result every time. I have about 1200 bookmarks in total so I would love to be able to fix this without going through all of them to put them back into their respective folders manually. Any idea how I can fix this? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-81;firefox-950;firefox-9502;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",seppukuu

In Firefox it is directly under the mouse.  So usually any tooltip popup in firefox is unreadable, mostly.  One can infer the content sometimes. </p><p>How do i change that?  Or what is the problem? </p><p>I'll try and include a screenshot.  Hmm, the screenshot didn't include the mouse.  I think i can do a video with OBS and then a screenshot of that. </p><p>Interesting, somehow in the screenshot from the obs video it shows 2 mouse pointers.  One is very small and the tooltip is just below that, but the other is larger (the one I see) and it covers the tooltip. I'm using the standard windows mouse settings for larger mouse pointers. I just tried using the 'old' mouse settings to select a larger mouse and it behaves the same way. If I select size: 1 in the new size settings, and the old settings i have 'windows system' mouse, then the tooltip is under the pointer but the size is too small for the pointer. I then changed to another mouse setting in the old selector ""inverted extra large"" and you can see the tooltip because of the 'inverted' nature of the pointer, but the tooltip is still partially covered by the pointer. </p><p>Ideally the choice would be to put the tooltip above the mouse pointer rather than below.  When you increase the size of the mouse pointer it only increases down, not up.  The point of the pointer is always at the top. </p><p>I'm going to try one more thing, increasing the size in the new settings after having selected ""inverted"", but i recall that it changes to the new pointer style.  Ah, there is an inverted setting in the new options as well, and if i select that instead of the gray color i was using then one can read the tooltip through the mouse. </p><p>So, then my question becomes ""can I put the tooltip above the mouse pointer?"" Because it is still covered by the mouse pointer as is.  I don't see anything in 'about:config', so far. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,tips,en-US,1469983;1470000;,jamvaru
