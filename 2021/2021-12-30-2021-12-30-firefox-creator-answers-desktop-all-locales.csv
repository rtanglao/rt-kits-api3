New bookmarks keep disappearing after sync. In the latest scenario, I had added multiple bookmarks to multiple folders (within the bookmarks toolbar folder) on Laptop A last week. I worked on Laptop B yesterday, but did not make any changes to bookmarks. I hadn't used Laptop B in a couple of weeks. Today I went back to Laptop A and all the new bookmarks I had added last week were gone! The new folders I added were still there though. I do not have enabled on mobile devices. Sync is only enabled on these laptops. </p><p>In another instance, I was only using Laptop A. One bookmark I had on the bookmarks toolbar that I use all the time disappeared. I would add it back and in a couple of days it would disappear again. This kept repeating for several weeks. Laptop B was never powered on during this time. I was able to work around it by placing the bookmark in it's own folder.  </p><p>I'm really pissed that a weeks worth of research is now lost.

In Firefox it is directly under the mouse.  So usually any tooltip popup in firefox is unreadable, mostly.  One can infer the content sometimes. </p><p>How do i change that?  Or what is the problem? </p><p>I'll try and include a screenshot.  Hmm, the screenshot didn't include the mouse.  I think i can do a video with OBS and then a screenshot of that. </p><p>Interesting, somehow in the screenshot from the obs video it shows 2 mouse pointers.  One is very small and the tooltip is just below that, but the other is larger (the one I see) and it covers the tooltip. I'm using the standard windows mouse settings for larger mouse pointers. I just tried using the 'old' mouse settings to select a larger mouse and it behaves the same way. If I select size: 1 in the new size settings, and the old settings i have 'windows system' mouse, then the tooltip is under the pointer but the size is too small for the pointer. I then changed to another mouse setting in the old selector ""inverted extra large"" and you can see the tooltip because of the 'inverted' nature of the pointer, but the tooltip is still partially covered by the pointer. </p><p>Ideally the choice would be to put the tooltip above the mouse pointer rather than below.  When you increase the size of the mouse pointer it only increases down, not up.  The point of the pointer is always at the top. </p><p>I'm going to try one more thing, increasing the size in the new settings after having selected ""inverted"", but i recall that it changes to the new pointer style.  Ah, there is an inverted setting in the new options as well, and if i select that instead of the gray color i was using then one can read the tooltip through the mouse. </p><p>So, then my question becomes ""can I put the tooltip above the mouse pointer?"" Because it is still covered by the mouse pointer as is.  I don't see anything in 'about:config', so far. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,tips,en-US,1469983;1470000;,jamvaru
