This seems to be an unimportant thing, but having the button on the toolbar reduces space, especially if we take into account that there are other buttons showing information. (Img1) </p><p>But the worst thing is when some web pages appear in pop-up windows that do not show any buttons. So, how can I take a screenshot if the capture button does not appear. (Img2) </p><p>Please keep in mind that there are some people that need to take several screenshots and it is faster to activate the capture and select the desired area both with the mouse. </p><p>Since the feedback page seems to be not working, I write it here with the greatest respect, to get this to the developers. </p><p>Thank you in advance. </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",darkjorge1013

It always shows a different area or only a part of the original selection. When I take the same screenshot in the Edge web browser and paste it into an email in Thunderbird it works correctly. I would like it to work correctly in Firefox. Thank you Jean<strong>bold text</strong> </p>,desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",pdqman

One could not even copy and paste it.  </p><p>This happened despite the fact that even under MSDOS 6.22 such links were easily automated and functional.

You can ""open image in new tab"" but that is not the same thing and is not what I'm trying to do. The inconvenience of this removal is driving me mad. ""View Image"" was literally the only thing Firefox had for me over Chrome and I would really like it back. Is there any way to customize or modify Firefox to regain this option? Or if a developer is hearing this, can you bring back that option somehow? I don't want to run an older version of FIrefox just to have it work, especially with the security risk that poses. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,1408747;1408749;,winsterton
