You can ""open image in new tab"" but that is not the same thing and is not what I'm trying to do. The inconvenience of this removal is driving me mad. ""View Image"" was literally the only thing Firefox had for me over Chrome and I would really like it back. Is there any way to customize or modify Firefox to regain this option? Or if a developer is hearing this, can you bring back that option somehow? I don't want to run an older version of FIrefox just to have it work, especially with the security risk that poses. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,1408747;1408749;,winsterton

When I search something using the url/search bar, search suggestions appear beneath. I like this, and don't want to get rid of the feature, but the fact that it is highlighted in bright blue is pretty hard on my eyes. I was wondering if there is a way to lower the brightness, or make it transparent? Any help would be very much appreciated! </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,1408745;,kuriouskat646
