Firefox tarayıcısını uzun zamandır alternatiflerine tercih ederek hem mobil cihazlarımda hemde bilgisayarlarımda ana tarayıcım olarak memnuniyetle kullanıyorum. Teknolojik açıdan kendimi sizden yardım alacak ve sorunumu rahatça anlatacak kadar yeterli buluyorum. Kullandığım cihazların ana performanslarında herhangi bir sorun olmadığını en başta belirtmek isterim. Bilgisayarda kullandığım tarayıcım (Son sürümü güncel) Maalesef bir süredir sekmeler arasında gezerken donma olarak tabir edilebilecek kısa aralıklı takıntılar yaşıyorum. Bu takılmalar sadece mozilla tarayıcımda gerçekleşiyor ve takılmanın bitmesini beklerken diğer tarayıcılara geçiş yapmak zorunda kalıyorum. Çok uzun süredir kullandığım mozilla tarayıcımda ilk kez böyle birşey başıma geldiğinden bir süre düzelmesini bekledim ancak 2 kez yeni güncelleme gelmesine rağmen sorunum çözüme ulaşmadı. Bu sorun özellikle sekmeler arasında hızlıca gezerken ortaya çıkıyor. Sorunun tarafınızca daha iyi anlaşılabilmesi için size ekran alıntısı şeklinde bir video gönderebilirim. Eğer ihtiyaç duyarsanız lütfen bana hazeralimusa@gmail.com adresinden ulaşın. İyi çalışmalar dilerim. </p>,desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,tabs,tr,1408874;,hazeralimusa
