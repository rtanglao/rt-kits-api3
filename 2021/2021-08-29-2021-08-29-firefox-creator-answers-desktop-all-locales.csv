I don't know why it happens. I am using the Firefox browser for 2 years and I don't face this type of issue before. Do I need to clear the browser cache? Or need to update the browser as I am running an old version of Firefox. Support help needed, Thanks! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1439076;,Arec-Johnson

But he had saved his profile folder. So I installed the latest version of firefox and loaded all the content from the saved profile folder into the new profile folder - and he got his old ff back again. But all his pwds where gone - but that's okay, I made a printout of it all. Now he comes back to me with the problem, that none of the pwds enterd new will be stored. I was via teamvier on his pc - and he was right. I enterd a pwd, press the save button, get into the page, quit the page, call the page again - no pwd appeared. I compared all the setup parameter with mine, where everything works fine - there was no difference.  So what can I do ? Is it a lockwise problem ?
