I open the browser and rather than open to the size of my monitor it opened to 1/4 size, next time I opened the browser it opened normally, next time 1/4 size and so on. I've looked at settings and it looks ok (not that I've changed anything recently) When it opens 1/4 size I click the top right to open full size and the 1/4 size browser moves from te left side to the right, the I click the top right full screen and it opens full screen with tools.
