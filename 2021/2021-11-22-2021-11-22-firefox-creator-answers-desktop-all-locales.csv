Though my theme says it is enabled. I have no idea what is causing this accept that it happens when I log in to my account. I have uninstalled my Firefox and cleaned out all registry and appdata folders for a clean install. I then re-install fresh and login to my account and BAM my theme resets every time I restart my browser. I have also closed all logins in my account. </p><p>As you can see in the image my theme is enabled but the theme is not showing. When I disable and re-enable it it will come back but when I close my browser and open it back the theme shows for about 2 seconds but reverts to this theme you see in the screenshot. </p><p>I hope this makes sense, this is very confusing. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-940;firefox-9401;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",kalebmartens
