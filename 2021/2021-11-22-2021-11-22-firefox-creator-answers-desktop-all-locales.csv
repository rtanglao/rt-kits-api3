However, for me to do this I need to know if there is any possibility for the Visual Effects (background) of Google Meet to be compatible with the browser (Firefox), as there is with the base Chromium. Also, I expand my question to Skype for the Web. </p>",desktop;websites;firefox-940;firefox-9401;,firefox,websites,en-US,1460993;,bsabrunosouza1

Though my theme says it is enabled. I have no idea what is causing this accept that it happens when I log in to my account. I have uninstalled my Firefox and cleaned out all registry and appdata folders for a clean install. I then re-install fresh and login to my account and BAM my theme resets every time I restart my browser. I have also closed all logins in my account. </p><p>As you can see in the image my theme is enabled but the theme is not showing. When I disable and re-enable it it will come back but when I close my browser and open it back the theme shows for about 2 seconds but reverts to this theme you see in the screenshot. </p><p>I hope this makes sense, this is very confusing. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-940;firefox-9401;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",kalebmartens
