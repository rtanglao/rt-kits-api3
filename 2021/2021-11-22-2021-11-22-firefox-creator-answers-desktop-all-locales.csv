I would like to present the problem from my side and propose a not difficult but useful solution. </p><p><br> ""Synced Addons *and settings* for Normal and Developer Edition separately"" is a feature I need and require from Mozilla. I don't want to have developer-only extensions and settings from Developer Edition in the normal browser. I also don't want to create a separate account because I won't be able to view Developer Edition browser content on my phone.   </p><p>The best would still be share search history and bookmarks with both browsers and the phone. </p><p>""Synchronization channel selection function and synchronization content"" could be a solution.  On a normal browser I create a ""normal"" synchronization channel and there I choose all the elements to be synchronized.  On Developer Edition I create a new ""developer"" channel and choose sync: history, tabs, bookmarks, addons and settings. Additionally, I choose the existing ""normal"" channel for synchronization of history and bookmarks. And I sync my phone with the normal channel. </p><p>Please consider such a feature in Firefox browsers ;))) </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",Artuu

Piccolissima premessa prima di arrivare al punto: uso con soddisfazione Firefox e thunderbird con il lettore di schermo Nvda, essendo non vedente, per cui prego, se possibile, invece di condividere screenshots (cosa che io faccio per chi vede ovviamente :) , ma che invece, diretti a me, mi obbligano a diverse operazioni fra cui l'uso dell'Ocr ed estrapolazione di testo da imagini, fattibile, ma se potete, risparmiatemelo :)  ), ecco, invece di usare screenshots, Vi domando gentilmente di usare links o testo, grazie. PROBLEMA DAZN: purtroppo, nonostante tutti i vari accorgimenti: usare il cavo Lan ovviamente e non il wi-fi, controllare specifiche e tanto a ltro (i requisiti della rete e di tutto il PC soddisfano superampiamente quanto richiesto), è tutto aggiornato, mi occupo di Tecnologie Assistive e di PC e dunque qualcosina ne capisco ed ecco perchè sono qua a dire che la riproduzione dei video dei match di Serie A in Italia, ad esempio, ma tutti gli incontri o i programmi in diretta live streaming, con Firefox reggono per circa 40/45 minuti, poi viene consumata molta CPU, i video iniziano a saltare ed anche l'audio ed alla fine Firefox è come se cedesse e sono costretto ad uscire dal sito di Dazn. Anche la disattivaizone dell'accelleraizone Hardware non cambia nulla. Peraltro, direi importante: con Chrome il problema non sussiste ed i video continuano tranquillamente senza eccessivo consumo di risorse, però, in tutte e 2 i browsers, compare sempre un Error Code 65128.00 accompagnato dalla dicitura: ""Con questo browser non si possono riprodurre video, utilizza un altro browser per guardare Dazn"". Il che non è vero, perchè anche se compare l'errore Chrome continua ed anche Firefox per un po'; poi , come detto, si interrompe come descritto. Ho una connesione fibra potente e ben funzionante in una zona ben servita e, come sottolineato, tutti i requisiti ampiamente soddisfatti. Siccome sono comunque affezionato a Firefox che ha peraltro migliorato il suo Player molto accessibile con il lettore di schermo Nvda, mi scoccia usare Chrome e spero si possa fare qualcosa in quest'ambito. Ho anche verificato il Media Pack, ma è naturamente tutto agigornato ed installato e poi questo problema è riconducibile all'interaizone esclusivamente tra Firefox e Dazn, ho effettuato appunto tante prove anche reinstallando Firefox ed usandolo dopo il suo ripristino e senza componenti aggiuntivi, ma tutto resta come ho descritto. Anche sul canale Youtube di Dazn, con interruzioni un po' più brevi, però dopo un certo tempo avviene lo stesso.Ringrazio tutti per avermi sopportato e per il Vostro supporto. </p>",desktop;websites;firefox-940;firefox-9401;,firefox,websites,it,"",barramaurizio68
