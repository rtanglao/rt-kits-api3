I set everything back up and it worked for a day. Then, I left my browser up for two days without closing out and when I came back to my PC, the links don't work. The favicons are now not showing either anymore. I've looked online but didn't see any instructions I felt confident to follow in order to fix. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks, Alex </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",lohaaj
