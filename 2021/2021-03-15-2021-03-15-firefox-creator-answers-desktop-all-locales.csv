Please feel free to be very technical with me because I am a help desk analyst in the corp. sector with25 years experience. </p><p>This problem only happens in FireFox; it does not happen in Google Chrome and I don't use any of the MS browsers or any other browsers.  This problem also does not happen on my Apple devices nor on either of my 2 Samsung Smart TVs.  This only happens on YouTube (YT) in FF and not on any other web site. </p><p>When I click on things in YT it routinely takes me to the incorrect linked item/location/video.  It has gotten so bad that I am using Chrome more than FF for YT which is annoying because most of my saved bookmarks/links are saved and up to date in FF not Chrome because I got fed up with Chrome taking too many system resources up.  I have already cleared my cookies and cache and disabled extensions but it still doesn't fix the problem.  I don't want to just willy nilly blow away my YT history and I don't believe that the problem is with my YT history on YT's/Google's servers because if it was then it would be happening on other browsers and other devices, which as stated it is not.  Essentially in a nutshell click on ""A"" and I get ""Z"" or ""W"" or ""N"" but never get to the ""A"". </p><p>I would like to reserve uninstalling FF and reinstalling it as a no choice last resort option because I have certain things saved that I don't want to have to attempt to rebuild.
