(suggestion)","<p>I do a lot of looking at websites and then finding a particular word or phrase in a webpage. My Ctrl-F is remapped by my audio software so I can't use that key combination. Right now I move my touchpad cursor to the top right with the three bars, click that, and choose ""Find in This Page..."".   It would be great if right-clicking in a page would show that as one of the options, as ""Save Page as..."" is.  I rarely save a page but very often search within a page. </p><p>Thanks and please keep up the great work! </p><p>M.A. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,other,en-US,"",markadams707

I set everything back up and it worked for a day. Then, I left my browser up for two days without closing out and when I came back to my PC, the links don't work. The favicons are now not showing either anymore. I've looked online but didn't see any instructions I felt confident to follow in order to fix. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
