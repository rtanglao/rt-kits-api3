I followed the instructions to import my bookmarks and forgot that I was logged into my work chrome account, so those bookmarks were imported. When I followed the same procedure using my personal google account, the procedure did not work. Is there a way to import bookmarks from multiple google accounts into Firefox? Any help here would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",jake.ap.rogers

I recently had to close my browser a couple times to restart my mac. When I re-opened Firefox, the previous open session was gone. It would be nice if the browser had a way of saving not only the very last previous open session but earlier ones. </p><p>Maybe someone knows how to easily access those.  It seems as though Chrome has started saving earlier sessions. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-870;,firefox,other,en-US,"",john.wroughton

This doesn't happen automatically at a certain point in time, it only happens when I close all windows. I already tried the about:config thing that was in the solution for another person who had a similar problem, but it didn't work.

I tried creating a new places thing. It didn't work, and oddly still let me restore my old session and kept my bookmarks, which it said I'd have to re-install. I'm only running two extensions, U-block and NoScript. It will go Unresponsive, remain so far minutes at a time, briefly return and then immediately go unresponsive again, just long enough for me to close a tab or shut down. Nothing I have done seems to fix this. I am on the latest Windows 10, Desktop, latest Firefox. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1401774;,WindthinD
