I tried disabling Performance acceleration - it doesn't help. Sometimes the stream works for hours and then it stops and resumes a couple of times.  </p><p>I usually have one tab open with the radio stream, others tabs with news, etc. How can I fix this problem?  </p><p>As I say, Chrome - never an issue, I can stream all day with any interruptions and it's not my broadband, as I am on a Superfast fibre.

Now, when I type the word in the search bar and then I click at a certain search engine icon, Firefox does not automatically move me to this search engine's website - I have to press Enter to load this website.
