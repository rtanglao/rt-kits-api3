I now have a shortcut menu bar full of links to work resources that I can't even access as they are behind the work firewall.  </p><p>Could there not have been a backup made of what I had open? Does it not make sense that if there are tabs open it is not up to FF to decide to close them? Could there not have been a prompt that asked ""Hey we want to sync.""

The problem with Firefox is that once in a while the stream just stops for 10-30 seconds and resumes. I never encounter this problem with Chrome. I tried disabling Performance acceleration - it doesn't help. Sometimes the stream works for hours and then it stops and resumes a couple of times.  </p><p>I usually have one tab open with the radio stream, others tabs with news, etc. How can I fix this problem?  </p><p>As I say, Chrome - never an issue, I can stream all day with any interruptions and it's not my broadband, as I am on a Superfast fibre. Does this have something to do with Firefox prioritizing the other tabs? Can I somehow monitor this by launching Firefox from the console to grab any errors? </p><p>Thanks,  Richard </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-780;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",richlion2

As we know, when you start typing anything in the search bar, at the bottom of it Firefox displays icons of different search engines, like Google, Wikipedia or IMDB. </p><p>In previous versions of Firefox, after typing a word in the search bar, I only had to click once on the search bar icon (for example Wikipedia), and Firefox was automatically loading the website I clicked at, with search results. However in the past 3-4 weeks (after one of the updates) it has changed. Now, when I type the word in the search bar and then I click at a certain search engine icon, Firefox does not automatically move me to this search engine's website - I have to press Enter to load this website. So actually it is necessary to make to clicks - one on the icon, and second one the ""Enter"" to start the searching.  </p><p>I know it is a trivial problem and it takes only one moment to press ""Enter"", however I got used so much to clicking on icon only to start the searching, that after few weeks it still triggers me that I need to additionally press another button :) Can someone help with that, or is it normal now in Firefox? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",p.mateusz1990
