This doesn't happen automatically at a certain point in time, it only happens when I close all windows. I already tried the about:config thing that was in the solution for another person who had a similar problem, but it didn't work. This has been going on for about a month or two now. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",nik.mwango

I tried creating a new places thing. It didn't work, and oddly still let me restore my old session and kept my bookmarks, which it said I'd have to re-install. I'm only running two extensions, U-block and NoScript. It will go Unresponsive, remain so far minutes at a time, briefly return and then immediately go unresponsive again, just long enough for me to close a tab or shut down. Nothing I have done seems to fix this. I am on the latest Windows 10, Desktop, latest Firefox. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",WindthinD
