As we know, when you start typing anything in the search bar, at the bottom of it Firefox displays icons of different search engines, like Google, Wikipedia or IMDB. </p><p>In previous versions of Firefox, after typing a word in the search bar, I only had to click once on the search bar icon (for example Wikipedia), and Firefox was automatically loading the website I clicked at, with search results. However in the past 3-4 weeks (after one of the updates) it has changed. Now, when I type the word in the search bar and then I click at a certain search engine icon, Firefox does not automatically move me to this search engine's website - I have to press Enter to load this website. So actually it is necessary to make to clicks - one on the icon, and second one the ""Enter"" to start the searching.  </p><p>I know it is a trivial problem and it takes only one moment to press ""Enter"", however I got used so much to clicking on icon only to start the searching, that after few weeks it still triggers me that I need to additionally press another button :) Can someone help with that, or is it normal now in Firefox? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",p.mateusz1990

I followed the instructions to import my bookmarks and forgot that I was logged into my work chrome account, so those bookmarks were imported. When I followed the same procedure using my personal google account, the procedure did not work. Is there a way to import bookmarks from multiple google accounts into Firefox? Any help here would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",jake.ap.rogers

I tried creating a new places thing. It didn't work, and oddly still let me restore my old session and kept my bookmarks, which it said I'd have to re-install. I'm only running two extensions, U-block and NoScript. It will go Unresponsive, remain so far minutes at a time, briefly return and then immediately go unresponsive again, just long enough for me to close a tab or shut down. Nothing I have done seems to fix this. I am on the latest Windows 10, Desktop, latest Firefox. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1401774;,WindthinD
