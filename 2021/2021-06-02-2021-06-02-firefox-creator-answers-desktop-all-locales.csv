Along with that is new memory hardware that I have physically installed into the PC. When installing Firefox and attempting to get my bookmarks, search history, etc synced with the fresh installation, I noticed that it is wiped clean. </p><p>I don't remember if I ever disallowed Firefox to sync my data across the browser, but after looking at one of Mozilla's support articles such as this one: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/ive-lost-my-firefox-sync-account-information"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/ive-lost-my-firefox-sync-account-information</a> ... it states that ""We encrypt your data with a key derived from your password in order to keep it safe on the server."" </p><p>I cannot recover any of my data from the sync feature, so I'm wondering if a member of Mozilla Support could restore my data to my account? I tried looking for a direct contact page that includes a company email, phone number, or anything, but it seems like this is the only page for Mozilla-related support I can find, or rather, Thunderbird. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",Prismo

With this new version, the size of the bookmarks menu has been increased. There is now an enormous amount of wasted space between each entry, and this is causing me massive inconvenience when I'm trying to do basic browsing. Although my bookmarks are organised sensibly and tidily, this increase in menu size now means that I have to <strong>SCROLL</strong> the menu to find some of my entries near the bottom! That's ridiculous. I used to be able to navigate my bookmarks quickly, and this is important as I often have several tabs open at once as I co-ordinate tasks between different web pages. I now have to use <strong>much</strong> more mouse movement, and I have to use the mouse <strong>scroll wheel</strong>, just to perform basic tasks. This is slowing me down <strong>A LOT</strong>. How can I revert the bookmarks menu back to its previous size? How can I remove the wasted and unnecessary space between my bookmark entries? How can I speed up my browsing again? I have tried using the ""CTRL+mousewheel"" feature to adjust the zoom and size of my web pages, but unfortunately this has no effect at all on the user interface, including menu sizes, so it doesn't help solve my problem. Any help offered would be appreciated. If there is no solution, I guess I will have to revert back to the previous version of Firefox and turn off automatic updates somehow. It would be a shame to be forced into that, but if that's what it takes to regain control over my browser, then I'll have to do it. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",keith.c.ballard

The old Firefox process must be closed to open a new window.”",<p>I’ve repeatedly tried both possible options (Close Firefox or Cancel) offered in the “Close Firefox” box referenced as “Subject” above and gave it loads of time to allow Firefox to open.
