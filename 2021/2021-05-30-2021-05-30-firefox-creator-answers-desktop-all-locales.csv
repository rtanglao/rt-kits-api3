Previously all I had to do was briefly connect to my network access that file from that organization using the Firefox version on the XP machine to download that file directly to the program that needs it. </p><p>I tried that this week May 2021 only to receive an error message from somewhere to ""Try Internet Explorer"". </p><p>I have a workaround solution involving my W10 machine and a thumb drive to transfer that 1K text file manually,  but the process of direct transfer to the XP machine used to work, and is much more convenient. </p><p>What has changed, such that the Firefox version on the XP machine no longer works?  </p><p>Ideas please. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jtomlinson22

Say CTRL+SHIFT+C - it is a short for copy in terminal, so I often use it in Firefox, then I see the administration console and inspector.

And there are a few others annoying shortcuts (ctrl+d), etc.  </p><p>Add-ons proves to be useless for this task.
