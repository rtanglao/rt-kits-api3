Of course any NORMAL thinking person would update it at whatever location its at.   This is like using a belt sander to sweep a porch. I've changed my update settings so I can be warned when Mozilla next intends to use a weapon of mass destruction to fix some obscure security concern. Also....my password didn't work when trying to log in.  I reset it to the very same password and now I can log in.  More insanity.  I do wonder what kind of people run this company.  Or should be call it a mental institution.  They do such a great job in some areas then turn around and do just ridiculous things in other areas.   Why can't other people make a browser like Opera used to be before it got seduced by Chrome?   That was a great browser.  That offered real control.  Firefox is pretty good except management seem to be unthinking noobs.  How else to explain such demented decisions?

Therefore, when I turned off that anti-censorship App, my FF failed to view any webpage. Before I could understand the true reason for this inability, I had uninstalled the latest FF version 88.01 and then reinstalled this version (or early version), adding backup xxx.default into Profiles (C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\) and making proper configuartions in .ini files, but FF would not work properly, even after trying a few times of un- and re-installations. Guessing the system might have been ruined for improper manipulation, I even restored Drive C from the early backup system (Win 10, which is good) using Ghost 11, and then installed FF again, for a few time. However, no matter what the version installed is, 84.01, 85 or 88.01, they are all ""handicapped"". I've been using FF for 10 years, and this is the first time I meet this big problem. It is really frustrating... The problems are:   1. No connectivity, while all the other browers are good for viewing webpages. 2. Nearly all buttons, menus are just unfuntional. When I turn off FF, I have to do it via Task Manager by end task. I have collected many pages in Favoriates, and stored many usernames and passwords for useful websites. Therefore I hope you friends could kindly help me with this FF problem. And if it cannot be solved, which I hope not, I would desire to have a solution to properly export data in my backup xxx.default (favourites, usernames &amp; passwords) into Windows Edge and Google Chrome. Thank you very much! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1415671;1415673;1415676;1415682;1415686;1415695;1415697;,bora_al
