For over a week now, firefox has been erroring on a heap of websites (I got 3 page and loading errors just trying to log into this site, so it's not an unsecure webpage problem.)

Once it's gone through, it'll usually allow you to use that site for at least a while before starting to error again.  </p><p>I've disabled all addons except my adblocker, norton safe search and privacy badger add ons (all of which I've had for ages with no problems).
