Within Firefox (it could be the first time since powering up my machine), I am automatically logged in to some sites when I first visit them. I don't know why this is happening. Nothing is saved in Lockwise, and all options under ""Logins and Passwords"" are unchecked (including save and fill passwords). I don't have any syncing. I experience the same behavior if I boot in safe mode. I have LastPass, but this behavior happens even if I'm not logged in to that. </p><p>The strangest thing is... I am also automatically logged in to my email website even though it has multi-factor authentication enabled. The auto-login doesn't send any notifications to my authentication device. </p><p>Is there some magical setting that I am somehow missing?

I have a (supposedly) rather specific question (or request if you will) concerning the urlbar, search results, and any about:config settings, custom css, add-on or whatever else may get me there. (maybe skip to last paragraph) </p><p>I've configured my FF, so that anything I enter in the urlbar opens a new tab, I've also set the urlbar drop-down results to include everything they can (to my knowledge), bookmarks, tabs, history, search results. That's how I like it to be, basically. What I don't like so much is that when I enter something that *I* know is not going to be a web search on my part, I don't want the urlbar to automatically add corresponding search results to the top of the drop-down list. Not so much because they're actually there, but because most times it takes about 3-5 seconds for them to appear in the list, so (from unwanted experience) I now wait until the search results appear and the list is ""finished"" before I click on anything in it (lest I may click the wrong entry, which messes things up, the history, potentially my tabs (depending on what I may accidentally click), and tiny bits of my time and nerves.) </p><p>Results from bookmarks, history and tabs are almost instantaneous, so they shouldn't be the problem (as long as digging through the history doesn't stall web searches in some way). </p><p>I don't want to put the separate searchbar back on the toolbar. The keyboard shortcut Ctrl+K is now specifically for initiating a search with the default search engine, which makes me think there should be a more apparent reason for the distinction between Ctrl+L and Ctrl+K in matters of ""entering stuff in the urlbar"" and ""actually wanting to search from the urlbar"". (or megabar or what it's called) </p><p>I'm looking for a way to have search results still available through the drop-down list of the urlbar, but only when I actually want to search for something by using search engine shortcuts (including Ctrl+K). Basically, a combination of the separate searchbar (except it's addressed via shortcuts), and the urlbar as it is now (except without automatic web search results). Any ideas? (and thanks for reading my mess in case you did that) </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",wolfsschnute
