The domain was on GoDaddy servers in order to redirect to a specific page on the Wix site instead of the home page (Wix does not support this option using its own DNS servers). </p><p>They noticed that *only* when using Firefox on Windows 10 was there a security error code that blocked access to the site, giving the following message: </p><p>Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead </p><p>Firefox detected a potential security threat and did not continue to <a href=""http://www.minditrimblementoring.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.minditrimblementoring.com</a>. If you visit this site, attackers could try to steal information like your passwords, emails, or credit card details. </p><p>What can you do about it? </p><p>The issue is most likely with the website, and there is nothing you can do to resolve it. You can notify the website’s administrator about the problem. </p><p>Learn more… </p><p>Websites prove their identity via certificates. Firefox does not trust this site because it uses a certificate that is not valid for <a href=""http://www.minditrimblementoring.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.minditrimblementoring.com</a>. The certificate is only valid for the following names: <a href=""http://shortener.secureserver.net"" rel=""nofollow"">shortener.secureserver.net</a>, <a href=""http://www.shortener.secureserver.net"" rel=""nofollow"">www.shortener.secureserver.net</a> Error code: SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN View Certificate </p><p>-- </p><p>This was not able to be replicated on the same system on Chrome, Edge, or iPhone Safari browsers. They had to click ""Advanced"" and then ""Accept the Risk and Continue"" </p><p>There is no error message for the actual root domain of the website. From what I understand, Firefox reroutes the DNS to a partner service for security (in this case <a href=""http://shortener.secureserver.net"" rel=""nofollow"">shortener.secureserver.net</a>), which is not happy with the redirect setup. </p><p>For now, I have switched over to Wix servers so that no one trying to access the site receives security warnings.  </p><p>The client would like to retain the ability to redirect to these to specific pages on the site, but they are concerned about people being turned away from getting a big ol' security risk warning if they are using Firefox.  </p><p>So here's my question again (so you don't have to scroll back up): Is there any way to satisfy Firefox's third party routing so that a secondary unattached domain can be redirected to a subfolder of another domain? </p><p>Thank you for any insight - this is *not* my realm, as I help people with branding and design work and am not a developer / coder. </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-860;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",boxospamilove

I have a (supposedly) rather specific question (or request if you will) concerning the urlbar, search results, and any about:config settings, custom css, add-on or whatever else may get me there. (maybe skip to last paragraph) </p><p>I've configured my FF, so that anything I enter in the urlbar opens a new tab, I've also set the urlbar drop-down results to include everything they can (to my knowledge), bookmarks, tabs, history, search results. That's how I like it to be, basically. What I don't like so much is that when I enter something that *I* know is not going to be a web search on my part, I don't want the urlbar to automatically add corresponding search results to the top of the drop-down list. Not so much because they're actually there, but because most times it takes about 3-5 seconds for them to appear in the list, so (from unwanted experience) I now wait until the search results appear and the list is ""finished"" before I click on anything in it (lest I may click the wrong entry, which messes things up, the history, potentially my tabs (depending on what I may accidentally click), and tiny bits of my time and nerves.) </p><p>Results from bookmarks, history and tabs are almost instantaneous, so they shouldn't be the problem (as long as digging through the history doesn't stall web searches in some way). </p><p>I don't want to put the separate searchbar back on the toolbar. The keyboard shortcut Ctrl+K is now specifically for initiating a search with the default search engine, which makes me think there should be a more apparent reason for the distinction between Ctrl+L and Ctrl+K in matters of ""entering stuff in the urlbar"" and ""actually wanting to search from the urlbar"". (or megabar or what it's called) </p><p>I'm looking for a way to have search results still available through the drop-down list of the urlbar, but only when I actually want to search for something by using search engine shortcuts (including Ctrl+K). Basically, a combination of the separate searchbar (except it's addressed via shortcuts), and the urlbar as it is now (except without automatic web search results). Any ideas? (and thanks for reading my mess in case you did that) </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",wolfsschnute
