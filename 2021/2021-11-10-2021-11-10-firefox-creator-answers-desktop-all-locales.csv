In fact they are abusive sites that shout out for being able to permanently disable forwarding. Yet these sites offer information that is hard to find else where. Why on earth isn't it an option for a setting that allows the user to decide how many times a site is allowed to forward to other sites that spam, or even attack users?? I have used Firefox for many years, but I have to say how disappointed I am over this lack of protection options. A PERMISSIVE PROTECTION IS NO PROTECTION AT ALL. Please update Firefox to give users this choice? Presently in spite of my loyalty, and reliance on Mozilla Firefox I am looking for alternatives. So far my search has been fruitless. Please help with this before I find that alternative? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",lenwenzel.lw

Today I found that I have too many back-ups and started deleting the old FF Profiles. Most of it will delete normally. But it will NOT delete the JSON files.
