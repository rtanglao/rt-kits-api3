I did not notice when the problem started but firefox has been deleting my history everyday. I log in next day and there is no record of any previous history. I mostly browse on normal mode not the private, also the history settings are also checked not to clear browser history when firefox closes. Also I did not have a mozilla accoount previously before writing this question. Could it be the reason behind firefox deleting the history ? Would you please tell me what can be the issue and will I be able to resolve it on my own ?  Thank you ! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1457960;1457969;,manasimuley2497

In fact they are abusive sites that shout out for being able to permanently disable forwarding. Yet these sites offer information that is hard to find else where. Why on earth isn't it an option for a setting that allows the user to decide how many times a site is allowed to forward to other sites that spam, or even attack users?? I have used Firefox for many years, but I have to say how disappointed I am over this lack of protection options. A PERMISSIVE PROTECTION IS NO PROTECTION AT ALL. Please update Firefox to give users this choice? Presently in spite of my loyalty, and reliance on Mozilla Firefox I am looking for alternatives. So far my search has been fruitless. Please help with this before I find that alternative? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",lenwenzel.lw
