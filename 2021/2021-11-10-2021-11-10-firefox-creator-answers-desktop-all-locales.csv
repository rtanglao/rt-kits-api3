My users and I have been experiencing an issue where if a new installation of Firefox occurs, a new profile is created. This issue is a big problem when it comes to bookmarks. After some research I found this article which supplies some guidance: </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1280298#:~:text=If%20you%20use%20a%20profile,how%20your%20data%20is%20stored"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1280298#:~:text=If%20you%20use%20a%20profile,how%20your%20data%20is%20stored</a> </p><p>However, this does not cover the full picture. We have this problem no matter what version of Firefox is installed: new, same or old. Here is my testing protocol to reproduce the issue </p> <ul><li> Fresh install of Firefox (v 93.0). ~/Application Support/Firefox does not exist </li><li> Launch Firefox </li><li> Import Bookmarks </li><li> Quit Firefox </li><li> Install the same version of Firefox (v 93.0) </li><li> Launch Firefox </li><li> A new profile is created (bookmarks are not there) </li><li> Navigating to about:profiles lists the old profile, and I can manually make the old profile the default </li></ul> <p>This is a huge issue for us, as we use Firefox to ssh proxy into our internal resources. These configurations are attached to the profile, and its very inconvenient for end-users to loose their proxy and bookmarks whenever we need to apply a security update for Firefox. </p>",mac-os;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-930;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",roman.sammartino
1357391,2021-11-10 11:14:07 -0800,2021-11-10 11:14:07 -0800,"Mozilla is now redirecting my Downloads to OneDrive, not my local hard-drive as intended","<p>I am trying to get rid of OneDrive on my newly purchased Windows 11 Dell computer -- because it is a fact that Microsoft has no idea how to assure security of my stuff (see yesterday's zero-day vulnerabilities in Excel, eg).   BUT when I go to Mozilla/Settings/Files/Downloads/ Save files to, Browse ..., and Select Folder 'Desktop' and then a folder I have newly created on my Desktop [called 'FFox downloads'], the name is changed to ""C:\Users\[mynamedfolder]\OneDrive\Desktop\FFox downloads⁩"".  And it is NOT possible to edit the text in the 'Save files to' to remove the 'OneDrive' path within the Mozilla box.  And there is no warning that the desired location has been altered to send it to Microsoft and the cloud, not the hard drive in my office. </p><p>Details:  When I look via Start File Explorer, 'This PC' contains 'OS(C:)'. which is my Local Disk per Type--clearly hardware, not cloudland).  However, within 'This PC' also exists 'Desktop', containing the folders I see on my monitor/desktop, including a new folder I created there, as one always could before, called 'FFox download' to try to use it to save downloads locally, ie without sending the actual download (and/or a copy of same) to the cloud.  BUT, with Windows 11, a look at Properties admits its 'physical'  location is actually 'C:\Users\[mynamefolder]\OneDrive\Desktop!  Also, under OS (C:) exists Users, containing a [mynamefolder] name, with a OneDrive folder within it, and Desktop within that, my intended local FFox download folder within that.  HA!! Obviously it is not Mozilla's fault that Microsoft is being sneaky.  I suspect Microsoft is redirecting or copying everything on my Desktop, which in the past would exist only on my 'Local Disk', to cloudville.  I have been unable so far to figure out how to fix this:  do you by chance know, if so I would be most grateful.  And I suspect others who wish to protect their information will, too.   </p><p>Workaround:  For now, I have created a new folder on OS (C:), called 'LocalDesktop', and within it a new folder, 'Localdownloads'.  This seems to work, in that FFox will accept that as the place to send downloads.   </p><p>ACTION ITEMS: I suggest Mozilla put a bold Warning that your FFox downloads in Windows 11 will no longer go to you alone, and certainly not insert the phrase 'OneDrive' into the 'Save files to' box when those words were NOT chosen via 'Browse...'. </p><p>[What I don't know, so far, is whether Microsoft is also copying the contents of this local folder to OneDrive, and I fear that if so there will be no warning given of this security breach.] Thank you, and thank you Mozilla for providing Firefox to the world, Rich </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",rareevesmd

I did not notice when the problem started but firefox has been deleting my history everyday. I log in next day and there is no record of any previous history. I mostly browse on normal mode not the private, also the history settings are also checked not to clear browser history when firefox closes. Also I did not have a mozilla accoount previously before writing this question. Could it be the reason behind firefox deleting the history ? Would you please tell me what can be the issue and will I be able to resolve it on my own ?

In fact they are abusive sites that shout out for being able to permanently disable forwarding. Yet these sites offer information that is hard to find else where. Why on earth isn't it an option for a setting that allows the user to decide how many times a site is allowed to forward to other sites that spam, or even attack users?? I have used Firefox for many years, but I have to say how disappointed I am over this lack of protection options. A PERMISSIVE PROTECTION IS NO PROTECTION AT ALL. Please update Firefox to give users this choice? Presently in spite of my loyalty, and reliance on Mozilla Firefox I am looking for alternatives. So far my search has been fruitless.
