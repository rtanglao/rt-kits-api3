Having responded to the msg several times, I phoned 53 bank and am told that there is a glitch with/at Firefox; (they) have had several complaints and to contact your support desk. </p><p>I can get there using Microsoft Edge but prefer using Firefox. Until recently (within the month) I have had no problems accomplishing a connection using Firefox. About the same time (don't know if there is a connection) I am getting error msgs, no msgs, no connects, while attempting to connect to gmail and other programs. Suddenly there is a very slow connection and a lot of info msgs re handshakes etc flashing in the lower left of my screen. Have tried reinstalling Firefox to no avail. Computer repair says computer OK. Still no connection with the bank.   s/ [Bruce Moore, bemoore60@gmail.com] </p><p>Bnk msg ::::::::: </p><p><strong>Oops, something went wrong.
