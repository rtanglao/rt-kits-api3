Es cuestión de minimizar y maximizar el navegador, cambiar de pestañas, entre otros, para que la calidad de la tipografía de la barra de direcciones vuelva a a normalidad, pero quería saber si hay algún modo en el que puedo arreglar o configurar para que esta calidad no se degrade en ningún momento. </p><p>Dejo una imagen para que vean la comparación.

I know it contains some important stuff like passwords, but can anyone access that or are they safely encrypted? Not just that though, everything else as well? Because I kinda need to use the app as it's important but I also don't wanna run it outside the sandbox as it seems suspicious now </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,1454675;,rokon1322
