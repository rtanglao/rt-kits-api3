Other sites from google like Gmail and Gdrive are still accessible. I don't know if I'm posting this right, and got no idea what information should i include, but here it goes. It shows something like this: </p> <ol><li> Numbered list item <a href=""http://www.youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.youtube.com</a> has a security policy called HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) </li></ol> <p>And here's the error code: </p> <ol><li> Numbered list item Error code: SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER </li></ol> <p>I tried Refresh Firefox, it worked, but the problem came back. I tried Forget This Site from history, then restarted firefox, it worked, but the same problem occures on the next day. I even went and reinstall my firefox, but it keep getting back. So far, the only solution I found that actually work is by changing the security.enterprise_roots.enabled to true, but I'm not sure if it's safe to do that for a long term. As a side note, I only use windows defender as my antivirus. </p><p><br> So, is there any way i can do to get rid of this error for good? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",blackwaltzer

Why?","<p>This is a problem I first noticed on Google Chrome, and since FF uses the same engine, I'm not surprised it's present in Firefox as well. </p><p>Say I browse to a page. I start downloading a large file -- say, Windows10.iso, at nearly 6 GB. I navigate to a new page in a new tab, and eventually, I think I don't need that other tab open, so I click on the in-tab ""x"" and close it. Immediately when I do that, the download if Windows10.iso STOPS. The Download list shows that it was cancelled. But it wasn't, you see. Why does Firefox do that? It's a very annoying ""feature/BUG"". Is there any way to stop this behavior? </p><p>Chrome and Edge do the same thing. Chrome was the first one I noticed this in. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-860;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",rogerfranz

Firefox will not open my gmail account or even let me search for Google to get to my emails that way. It will not open, not even the search result. Is something wrong with Firefox?
