Why?","<p>This is a problem I first noticed on Google Chrome, and since FF uses the same engine, I'm not surprised it's present in Firefox as well. </p><p>Say I browse to a page. I start downloading a large file -- say, Windows10.iso, at nearly 6 GB. I navigate to a new page in a new tab, and eventually, I think I don't need that other tab open, so I click on the in-tab ""x"" and close it. Immediately when I do that, the download if Windows10.iso STOPS. The Download list shows that it was cancelled. But it wasn't, you see. Why does Firefox do that? It's a very annoying ""feature/BUG"". Is there any way to stop this behavior? </p><p>Chrome and Edge do the same thing. Chrome was the first one I noticed this in. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-860;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",rogerfranz
