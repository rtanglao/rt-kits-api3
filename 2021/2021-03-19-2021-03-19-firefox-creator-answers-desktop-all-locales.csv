This included the update to remove Adobe Flash player, which I suspect may be what caused my problem. Ever since then, many videos will not play in Firefox, with the error ""MEDIA_ERR_SRC_NOT_SUPPORTED"". Youtube works fine, as do videos on some other sites, and playing videos locally in a different media player also works fine. </p><p>Here is one example of a non-working video I tried to watch today (sorry it's not in English - just wait a bit and the error will appear): <a href=""https://baseball.yahoo.co.jp/senbatsu/video/player/6241841034001"" rel=""nofollow"">https://baseball.yahoo.co.jp/senbatsu/video/player/6241841034001</a> </p><p>I am not using an N or KN edition of Windows, so Windows Media Player is installed, and the Media Feature Pack is not available to install. I have tried clearing my cache, disabling all my extensions, and disabling hardware acceleration, but nothing has worked. It's getting to the point where I'm worried I'll have to reinstall Windows entirely, which would be a major pain. </p><p>This problem also occurs in Chrome, IE and Edge, so it is not a Firefox-specific issue - but I wasn't sure where else to go for help. Does anyone have any idea what might be causing this, and how to fix it? </p><p>Many thanks to anyone who can help! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-860;firefox-8601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Bob2004

Immediately when I do that, the download if Windows10.iso STOPS. The Download list shows that it was cancelled. But it wasn't, you see. Why does Firefox do that? It's a very annoying ""feature/BUG"".
