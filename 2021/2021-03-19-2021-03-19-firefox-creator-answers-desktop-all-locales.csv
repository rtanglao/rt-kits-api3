So I did a full backup (again) and cleared (in most cases by deleting large files) as much space as I could giving the upgrade over 48GB of free space. It STILL failed. Next I did a forced upgrade to v1909 which succeeded but wiped out all configurations including Firefox. </pre> <pre>But not a problem, so I thought, as I have a full backup on my external drive - BUT, to my dismay, the Restore failed to find it, so all I have to work with is a two week old Incremental backup and got back 'most' of my original config except for Chrome, Edge, Opera and, of course, Firefox..  </pre> <pre>Now (finally) the question: What files do I need to restore to get me back to where I was 2 weeks ago? I tried restoring the latest available 8v7yijby.default from the AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles directory, but it just wiped out the three new bookmarks I made and set Firefox back as if I were a complete newbie and not a 20+ year veteran.. </pre> <pre>Any knowledgeable and helpful suggestions of what I can do from here on?

I'm using Firefox 86.0.1 (updated 13 March I think) on a Mac. Recently Firefox has been crashing a lot and I used 'Restore session' to restore my tabs (7 windows, 111 tabs).  I used Restore Session because the Tab Session Manager app has been stuck on 06.02.21 for ages (6 windows/50 tabs, for some reason it only shows that session, and nothing since). This morning I had to restart my Mac and this time Restore Session only restored the last two tabs I opened, maybe because I have been tinkering with Firefox preferences in order to solve the problem (trying to find out where the Tab Session Manager backup folder was for instance, which I couldn't). So my question is: how can I restore my olds tabs of 7 windows/111 tabs? Ideally with the session I am using now, which would make it 8 windows/122 tabs in all) And I have an additional small query: in my attempts to solve the above, I clicked the small red 'Autosave browser exited' (on the right of 'Add tag' in Tab Session Manager) in order to see if that helped. I must have clicked the small X because 'Autosave...' disappeared and I can't find a way to restore it. My thanks to all of you who help nincompoops like me. </p>",mac-os;desktop;tabs;firefox-860;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",gfinley
