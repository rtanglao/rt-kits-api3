I'm using Firefox 86.0.1 (updated 13 March I think) on a Mac. Recently Firefox has been crashing a lot and I used 'Restore session' to restore my tabs (7 windows, 111 tabs).  I used Restore Session because the Tab Session Manager app has been stuck on 06.02.21 for ages (6 windows/50 tabs, for some reason it only shows that session, and nothing since). This morning I had to restart my Mac and this time Restore Session only restored the last two tabs I opened, maybe because I have been tinkering with Firefox preferences in order to solve the problem (trying to find out where the Tab Session Manager backup folder was for instance, which I couldn't). So my question is: how can I restore my olds tabs of 7 windows/111 tabs? Ideally with the session I am using now, which would make it 8 windows/122 tabs in all) And I have an additional small query: in my attempts to solve the above, I clicked the small red 'Autosave browser exited' (on the right of 'Add tag' in Tab Session Manager) in order to see if that helped. I must have clicked the small X because 'Autosave...' disappeared and I can't find a way to restore it. My thanks to all of you who help nincompoops like me. </p>",mac-os;desktop;tabs;firefox-860;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",gfinley
