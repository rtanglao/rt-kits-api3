Up until recently, it's worked flawlessly on Facebook. Now, within the last week or so, I can no longer type in the comments box on someone else's post.  The cursor is there and flashing but when I type, the cursor only flickers but no text.  Other browsers don't have this issue so I'm confident that it's nothing to do with my FB profile.  Typing in the search box or creating a new post works fine.  I just can't type comments. </p>",desktop;other;windows-81;firefox-560;,firefox,other,en-US,1466698;,RuLEoF2

Following various other similar questions, I've used ShadowExplorer to grab the previous.jsonlz4,  recovery.baklz4, and recovery.jsonlz4 and through the use of <a href=""https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/scrounger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/scrounger.html</a> I have confirmed that they are the correct browsing session or are close enough. I cannot get Firefox to use these files when they're in the Users/<em>Name</em>/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/<em>string of characters</em>.default-release folder (renaming the current iterations to replace them &amp; even removing them from the folder didn't work, it still restored my session of looking up how to restore the session before that one), and I'm worried that it's because they aren't complete sine the scrounging tool eventually stops showing characters in its display (instead it's four zero's arranged in a square) and it can't identify beyond the first 5 tabs. There weren't any truly important tabs open, mostly stuff that I came across by chance that I thought I'd look at sooner than I did and will be difficult to find again and a backlog from various YouTubers I'm subscribed to because I hate ""watch later"". Is there anything I can do, or should I just give up on restoring this session? </p>",desktop;tabs;escalate;windows-10;sessionrestore;firefox-950;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",SomeInternetPerson
