So I make use of Home Page folders extensively, so I can create links to websites, some which translate automatically and some which keep the language without translation. </p><p>I am using Nova Launcher (App version 7) which offers home page backup facility. I recently accidentally deleted a folder and used the Nova Restore to bring everything back. In theory, if I migrate to a new phone I can do the same and restore all of my home pages. I create a lot of folders and load them with Apps or Shortcuts to website URLs. Because I invest a lot of time creating folders I want to be able to back them up. </p><p>I contacted Nova Support (TeslaCoil Apps) and their response was: </p><p>""Nothing went wrong actually. Google doesn't allow shortcuts to be backed up and restored due to security and privacy reasons."" </p><p>So I asked them why Chrome &amp; Brave shortcuts were backed up but not Firefox they said: </p><p>There are some types of shortcuts that get backed up, and some don't. That's all up to Google on how they are created and what they are labeled as. </p><p>So my questions are: </p><p>1) Are the Nova Support talking Bull-sh*t? </p><p>2) Can Firefox (Android) be modified to create a type of shortcut, like Chrome or Brave, that can be backed-up? </p><p>3) When Firefox creates a shortcut, can it create a different type of file with the settings allowing backup? </p><p>Thanks in advance for answers. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",NickZ123

In fact, I can't find a way to widen it at all.  For years I had an add-on which accomplished the task (called something like ""Places Full Titles""), and more recently -- after the add-on stopped working -- a few lines in my userChrome.css which accomplished the same.

It was: </p><pre>#personal-bookmarks .bookmark-item, #bookmarksMenuPopup .bookmark-item { max-width: none !important; } </pre> <p><br> Is there any newer css code -- or any alternate approach -- that will accomplish the same thing?

There weren't any truly important tabs open, mostly stuff that I came across by chance that I thought I'd look at sooner than I did and will be difficult to find again and a backlog from various YouTubers I'm subscribed to because I hate ""watch later"".
