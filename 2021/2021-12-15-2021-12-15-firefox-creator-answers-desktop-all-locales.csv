This can be seen on <a href=""http://testufo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">testufo.com</a> as well as in general when scrolling pages).  </p><p>The issue I'm having with Nightly is that it often leaves background processes open in Task Manger after exiting. This does not occur in stable as far as I can tell. These background processes are causing issues when trying to update Nightly via the menu, as Nightly closes and tries to update but the background processes remain. The only thing to do is to kill the processes (sometimes as many as 20 of them) and then Nightly is able to update by itself and restart.  </p><p>I've noticed that the command line for some of these processes show links that I have clicked from outside of Nightly (In Discord for example), but the processes do not immediately appear when clicking links and seem to appear at random while using the browser. Some of them also show stuff along the lines of ""contentprocess"" and ""gecko-crash-server-pipe"" which seems to be normal firefox.exe processes that run in the foreground, perhaps before being ""converted"" into background processes which in turn won't close. </p><p>Another thing I've noticed is when these background processes exist, it causes lag and other issues in, as well as a huge delay when clicking links outside of Nightly. </p><p>This has been going on for about a month (through all the daily updates) since I've installed Nightly. I've tried disabling add-ons, refreshing, and even completely uninstalling, wiping all traces of, and reinstalling Nightly, to no avail. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",marcmy

I did manage to find my previous bookmarks json file in a folder in my Mac but I couldn't load them into Bookmarks but I can access them all, from an odd location.  I had it set up perfectly for my needs which I did over time, but it's all gone. All the add ons disappeared and most not available on 95.0. I've been using FF since the beginning of FF and never had this problem.  In the past there was a notification to upgrade which I could accept or decline but that seems to  be gone. In those instances I'd keep my old profile and make a new one and could revert back to the old one if needed which 99% of the time I didn't need to. But this time it just updated when I opened it so I couldn't back up the old profile. Web Security is not an issue for me as I have the best app for that plus VPN on all the time. Even when I lived in Communist China I never had any security issues. </p>",mac-os;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-950;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",diqiuren8

Following various other similar questions, I've used ShadowExplorer to grab the previous.jsonlz4,  recovery.baklz4, and recovery.jsonlz4 and through the use of <a href=""https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/scrounger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/scrounger.html</a> I have confirmed that they are the correct browsing session or are close enough. I cannot get Firefox to use these files when they're in the Users/<em>Name</em>/AppData/Roaming/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/<em>string of characters</em>.default-release folder (renaming the current iterations to replace them &amp; even removing them from the folder didn't work, it still restored my session of looking up how to restore the session before that one), and I'm worried that it's because they aren't complete sine the scrounging tool eventually stops showing characters in its display (instead it's four zero's arranged in a square) and it can't identify beyond the first 5 tabs. There weren't any truly important tabs open, mostly stuff that I came across by chance that I thought I'd look at sooner than I did and will be difficult to find again and a backlog from various YouTubers I'm subscribed to because I hate ""watch later"". Is there anything I can do, or should I just give up on restoring this session? </p>",desktop;tabs;escalate;windows-10;sessionrestore;firefox-950;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",SomeInternetPerson
