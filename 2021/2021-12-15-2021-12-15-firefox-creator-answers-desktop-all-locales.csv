This can be seen on <a href=""http://testufo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">testufo.com</a> as well as in general when scrolling pages).  </p><p>The issue I'm having with Nightly is that it often leaves background processes open in Task Manger after exiting. This does not occur in stable as far as I can tell. These background processes are causing issues when trying to update Nightly via the menu, as Nightly closes and tries to update but the background processes remain. The only thing to do is to kill the processes (sometimes as many as 20 of them) and then Nightly is able to update by itself and restart.  </p><p>I've noticed that the command line for some of these processes show links that I have clicked from outside of Nightly (In Discord for example), but the processes do not immediately appear when clicking links and seem to appear at random while using the browser. Some of them also show stuff along the lines of ""contentprocess"" and ""gecko-crash-server-pipe"" which seems to be normal firefox.exe processes that run in the foreground, perhaps before being ""converted"" into background processes which in turn won't close. </p><p>Another thing I've noticed is when these background processes exist, it causes lag and other issues in, as well as a huge delay when clicking links outside of Nightly. </p><p>This has been going on for about a month (through all the daily updates) since I've installed Nightly. I've tried disabling add-ons, refreshing, and even completely uninstalling, wiping all traces of, and reinstalling Nightly, to no avail. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",marcmy

I manage several public Facebook pages and post updates and my own camcorder film on a regular basis, usually with no problem.   Recently, when I go back into the pages some of my posts are not visible to me and seem to have disappeared. I think it is possible that other people can see them.  Sometimes they appear again only to disappear again when I log back in! Also I am unable to view some posts, using Firefox, on other peoples Facebook pages though I am able to do so using Safari.
