Two images, not one.  Pasting text results in a single paste, as would be expected.  What's wrong with image pasting? </p><p>Appears to only happen in Firefox.  Tried with Edge and composition worked fine. </p><p>I found that high-lighting an Image -- (NOTE:  ""jpg"" -- ====&gt; NOT "".png"") and then COPY, followed by a PASTE into Gmail produces the correct ONE image.- </p><p>However, if the Image is "".png"", and I move cursor OVER the Image, then Right-Click, select COPY Image and then go to Gmail and issue either a CTRL+V or PASTE, I get 2 images. </p><p><a href=""https://support.google.com/mail/thread/103422010"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/mail/thread/103422010</a> </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ariariari

Everything is configured in the operating system settings. When playing music and videos through the player, there is surround sound. I am well aware that the browser produces stereo sound, but it can be decomposed into a 5.1 channel. In Google Chrome, this feature is implemented, but I like the Firefox browser.

I'd like them to stick to Latin Modern instead. </p><p>The only possibly related setting I've found is `<a href=""http://font.name"" rel=""nofollow"">font.name</a>-list.serif.x-math` in about:config, whose value is `Latin Modern Math, STIX Two Math, [â€¦]`. I tried to manually change the font family specification of some text to see if Firefox could use Latin Modern Math to begin with, but apparently it can't (see first screenshot attached), while it loads STIX allright (second screenshot). Latin Modern is not the first locally installed typeface I haven't been able to use, but it's the first one I have really tried to (I don't remember which one the other typeface was). </p><p>My Latin Modern font comes from TeX Live 2019 installed using the TUG installer, not Fedora's package manager. `fc-list | grep -i ""latin modern math""` returns `/usr/local/texlive/2019/texmf-dist/fonts/opentype/public/lm-math/latinmodern-math.otf: Latin Modern Math:style=Regular`.

Thing is, Firefox crashed on me. Again. And now my profile is yet again, deleted. I tried doing the same thing I did but it didn't work. But there's actually two Firefox folders, one that refuses to leave my desktop (I was actually planning on asking for help on this one) and one that I put in the Application Support place. None of it is working though. It could just be because my computer has some issues though, (it's an old one, 2-4 years old and the sides are a bit damaged because somebody forced it into a tiny box and sent it back and I've also dropped it a few times, although I don't think that would impact it, and also Firefox crashes every so often when I open my bookmarks)  this isn't the first time Firefox has crashed, only the first time it crashed and erased my profile. If it helps, I was clicking on my add-ons to get a tomato timer to go (after reinstalling it because some of my add-ons didn't work) and then it crashed, with the twirly rainbow circle. I force quit the app and came back. Voila.  If anybody has any help, please do. I have work to do and I don't fancy doing it with this hanging over my head. </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-870;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1401969;,amylastlast123

What is even more weird - the presentation above works perfectly fine in Oculus Browser. Do you have any idea what might be the reason of such behaviour?
