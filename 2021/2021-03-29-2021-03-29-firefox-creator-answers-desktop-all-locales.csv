However, when I download files, Firefox automatically dumped the files into the Windows Temp folder.  It never asked me where to save the files. I think this is a bug in this most recent version of Firefox (It used to ask me where to save the files in previous versions.)  I suggest the Firefox team to correct this issue. It may seem a minor inconvenience, but it is distracting as I have to try to ""dig out"" the downloaded file among the sea of files in the Windows Temp folder. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1402125;1402137;,for2b2c

Firefox works fine for some websites, loading them quickly and loading everything on the website, but for other websites it just doesn't. Some websites will only partially load, mainly pictures/thumbnails and comments being the problem, sometimes the problem is fixed when I reload, but it usually persists. Youtube is a website that very clearly shows my problem, I have added 2 screenshots of that. Sometimes Firefox just flat out refuses to load anything in a tab, which is only fixed if I open a new tab and try there, or wait insanely long.  </p><p>I have tried loading websites in different browser, never running into the same problems there.  My internet is also not bad enough to have problems loading.  I have tried deleting cookies and cache, turning tracking protection on or off, making a new Firefox profile, starting in safe mode, refreshing firefox and reinstalling firefox, but none have solved the issues.  </p><p>I hope somebody can help! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1402130;1402132;1402135;,aidensmid.t

If multiple thumbnail images are selected then a playlist is created and the videos will playback sequentially in the order selected. In Firefox, after playback of the video corresponding to first thumbnail image selected, the video player (JWPlayer) shows a message ""Video can't play because the file is corrupt"". However, clicking again on the ""PlayVideos"" button will begin playback of the second video and so on. The sequential playback of the playlist functions properly in Chrome, Safari, and MSEdge. In an effort to resolve this issue, I did check the autoplay function in Preferences and it is set to allow both video and audio but did not solve the problem. I would very much appreciate any suggestions as to how to resolve this issue. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-870;,firefox,other,en-US,"",fshill

Once I have 20 instances of paint, I save one to set the path. I then close all the others at once allowing me to save them as png by only pressing enter and a number for a name. This way I save 15 images per minute. My problem is after 7 years of saving images this way I keep pressing the (now) wrong button. This may seem like a small problem, but remember this adds up fast when dealing with a lot of files. ""Save image as"" is inferior in every single way: It does not allow me to save multiple images at once, it uses jpg by standard and I have to write the .png manually. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",otkuda

What is interesting, I have installed also Firefox Reality directly on Oculus and I am experiencing practically the same issue with small difference - before I see these messy interiors an additional notification in terms of... disabling WebXR appears. In both cases I have tried multiple things - changing flags, running desktop Firefox with forced nvidia Control Panel settings (RTX 2060), reinstalling both desktop app and the one in Oculus but with no results... What is even more weird - the presentation above works perfectly fine in Oculus Browser. Do you have any idea what might be the reason of such behaviour? I would be grateful for any clues and possible solutions. </p><p>Thank you in advance. </p><p>Best regards, Paweł </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",pavl0v
