What is interesting, I have installed also Firefox Reality directly on Oculus and I am experiencing practically the same issue with small difference - before I see these messy interiors an additional notification in terms of... disabling WebXR appears. In both cases I have tried multiple things - changing flags, running desktop Firefox with forced nvidia Control Panel settings (RTX 2060), reinstalling both desktop app and the one in Oculus but with no results... What is even more weird - the presentation above works perfectly fine in Oculus Browser. Do you have any idea what might be the reason of such behaviour? I would be grateful for any clues and possible solutions. </p><p>Thank you in advance. </p><p>Best regards, Pawe≈Ç </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",pavl0v
