This is a huge nightmare to me since I save hundrets of images every day and this makes it very difficult for me to do so. </p><p>To understand why it is such a big issue to me, I will explain how I save images: My process works by opening tabs I want to save in the same folder, copying the image via the right click menu and pasting them into ms paint. Once I have 20 instances of paint, I save one to set the path. I then close all the others at once allowing me to save them as png by only pressing enter and a number for a name. This way I save 15 images per minute. My problem is after 7 years of saving images this way I keep pressing the (now) wrong button. This may seem like a small problem, but remember this adds up fast when dealing with a lot of files. ""Save image as"" is inferior in every single way: It does not allow me to save multiple images at once, it uses jpg by standard and I have to write the .png manually. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",otkuda

But there's actually two Firefox folders, one that refuses to leave my desktop (I was actually planning on asking for help on this one) and one that I put in the Application Support place. None of it is working though. It could just be because my computer has some issues though, (it's an old one, 2-4 years old and the sides are a bit damaged because somebody forced it into a tiny box and sent it back and I've also dropped it a few times, although I don't think that would impact it, and also Firefox crashes every so often when I open my bookmarks)  this isn't the first time Firefox has crashed, only the first time it crashed and erased my profile. If it helps, I was clicking on my add-ons to get a tomato timer to go (after reinstalling it because some of my add-ons didn't work) and then it crashed, with the twirly rainbow circle. I force quit the app and came back. Voila.  If anybody has any help, please do. I have work to do and I don't fancy doing it with this hanging over my head. </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-870;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1401969;1402041;1402042;1402043;1402047;,amylastlast123

What is interesting, I have installed also Firefox Reality directly on Oculus and I am experiencing practically the same issue with small difference - before I see these messy interiors an additional notification in terms of... disabling WebXR appears. In both cases I have tried multiple things - changing flags, running desktop Firefox with forced nvidia Control Panel settings (RTX 2060), reinstalling both desktop app and the one in Oculus but with no results... What is even more weird - the presentation above works perfectly fine in Oculus Browser. Do you have any idea what might be the reason of such behaviour? I would be grateful for any clues and possible solutions. </p><p>Thank you in advance. </p><p>Best regards, Paweł </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",pavl0v
