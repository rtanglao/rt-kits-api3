When I did, all of the bookmarks ended up in the root and all of the folders I made to organize my bookmarks were empty. I didn't really care because I found the bookmark that I was looking for and then restored the new backup that I had made prior to restoring the older one. </p><p>Same thing happened, all of my bookmarks ended up in the root and all of my folders were empty again. That's way too much work to have to put them all back in the folders manually and surely it's not designed to work that way. </p><p>I did a system restore from several days earlier and that didn't fix it either. I also tried restoring an automatic bookmark, several of them, that didn't work either. </p><p>I have the latest version of Firefox installed and it was before I started any of this. I can't find the version number because ""About Firefox"" only says ""Firefox is up to date"" under Firefox Browser. Your software below has identified it as version 87.0.  Running Windows 8.1. </p><p>This is really aggravating, I haven't got time for this crap. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-81;firefox-870;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",olese

Thing is, Firefox crashed on me. Again. And now my profile is yet again, deleted. I tried doing the same thing I did but it didn't work. But there's actually two Firefox folders, one that refuses to leave my desktop (I was actually planning on asking for help on this one) and one that I put in the Application Support place. None of it is working though. It could just be because my computer has some issues though, (it's an old one, 2-4 years old and the sides are a bit damaged because somebody forced it into a tiny box and sent it back and I've also dropped it a few times, although I don't think that would impact it, and also Firefox crashes every so often when I open my bookmarks)  this isn't the first time Firefox has crashed, only the first time it crashed and erased my profile. If it helps, I was clicking on my add-ons to get a tomato timer to go (after reinstalling it because some of my add-ons didn't work) and then it crashed, with the twirly rainbow circle. I force quit the app and came back. Voila.  If anybody has any help, please do. I have work to do and I don't fancy doing it with this hanging over my head. </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-870;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",amylastlast123

What is interesting, I have installed also Firefox Reality directly on Oculus and I am experiencing practically the same issue with small difference - before I see these messy interiors an additional notification in terms of... disabling WebXR appears. In both cases I have tried multiple things - changing flags, running desktop Firefox with forced nvidia Control Panel settings (RTX 2060), reinstalling both desktop app and the one in Oculus but with no results... What is even more weird - the presentation above works perfectly fine in Oculus Browser. Do you have any idea what might be the reason of such behaviour? I would be grateful for any clues and possible solutions. </p><p>Thank you in advance. </p><p>Best regards, Pawe≈Ç </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",pavl0v
