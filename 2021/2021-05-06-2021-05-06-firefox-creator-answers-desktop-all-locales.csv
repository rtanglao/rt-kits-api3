This issue has been ongoing for over a year though. I never would have thought that a simple task as entering a web address in the address bar and hitting enter would become so difficult, though for a while now this seems to be the case and to the point to where I'm considering not bothering with the Firefox browser anymore. I do enjoy where Firefox is now in current development and the way it looks as well the great performance. However, when basic functionality such as typing in a web address and hitting enter becomes difficult all the aforementioned positives become less and less relevant. It seemed to all start when development came to redesign the appearance of the UI, not sure what version. Basically, what I come to experience now roughly 90 percent of the time I type a web address in the address bar and hit enter is the browser does nothing. Sometimes it takes 5 to 6 tries with having to put the mouse courser back into the address bar and hitting enter multiple times before the browser decides it want's to go the website. Same issue occurs when opening a bookmark in another tab, switch to the tab and the site isn't loaded, have to hit enter multiple times before the web address will begin to load. Seems also that any setting regarding tabs background loading isn't present anymore in the settings either. Same issue will occur when selecting a favorite that comes up while typing in the address bar. </p><p>Recently I had reinstalled my entire operating system and was hopeful that this issue would be resolved by doing so with a fresh install of Firefox too, though the issue is still present. </p><p>I have no add-ons or themes that modify the address bar, nor any search add-ons. In fact, this issue occurs with no add-ons installed at all. The only thing I can think currently is that it is an issue and or bug of some kind within the search and or address bar settings current design.  </p><p>My settings here are attached as images. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-880;firefox-8801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1411094;,Jack0027
