There is nothing in my Options in the menu to turn on read receipts it just isnt that easy or everyone would know it by now. So what works with Firefox browser to get email read receipts without the recipient knowing? Do I need to use another browser? </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,"",cargal68

It says You have chosen to open impression. Which is application/octet-stream fromÂ : https://impression.link. Then it asks what firefox should do with this file? Two options: Open with &amp; then a browse dropdown. Or save file. I'm already looking at the news item in the browser, so I don't need an option to open the item. And I don't want to save it. Just read it. I don't knbow why this pop up suddenly appeared but it is very annoying. My searches have found the pop up is not necessariuly dangerous, but there is no information provided on how to get rid of it. Anyone else experienced this issue? And is someone able to tell me how to get rid oif it? Thx. (Pop up image attached). </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",the5campbells
