Why doesn't FF have this function? </p><p>I know there is a system with keywords, but this is less efficient I think. You have to set up the keyword and then remember it.  I don't think the keyword system itself is bad, but I don't see why there couldn't be a 'tab to search' function with all possible websites, in addition to the keywords system. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-860;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",super-anthony

It says You have chosen to open impression. Which is application/octet-stream from : https://impression.link. Then it asks what firefox should do with this file? Two options: Open with &amp; then a browse dropdown. Or save file. I'm already looking at the news item in the browser, so I don't need an option to open the item. And I don't want to save it. Just read it. I don't knbow why this pop up suddenly appeared but it is very annoying. My searches have found the pop up is not necessariuly dangerous, but there is no information provided on how to get rid of it. Anyone else experienced this issue? And is someone able to tell me how to get rid oif it? Thx. (Pop up image attached). </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1410954;1410955;,the5campbells
