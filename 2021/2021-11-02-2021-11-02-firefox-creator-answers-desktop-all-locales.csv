I was excited to use the desktop browser again and sync everything. After I got signed in, customized my header layout, got my addons, all my settings, etc., I moved on to something else and closed Firefox. The next time I opened it, I noticed my profile picture in the toolbar wasn't changing from the default. When I clicked it, it said sign in and had a sync button, and a 3rd empty option. If I tried to sign in it would  automatically take me to my account settings, as if nothing was wrong, and if I tried to sync it would ask me to sign in but load forever upon clicking confirm. But so many dropdown options and dialog boxes were blank, it was sort of broken. I refreshed Firefox and it let me login again but after I went through it all, it happened again. I uninstalled the few addons I had, still happened. Tried messing with some delete-upon-close options I saw someone suggest in another help thread, didn't work.  After trying over and over and getting very overwhelmed and disappointed, I finally noticed that it only happens once I set my theme to one with a gif as the header image. If it's a still image it keeps me logged in as usual. But if it is animated I end up with this error again.  </p><p>So, I guess my question is, can anyone please tell me why this happens? Is it something I can fix? I can live without an animated theme but I was excited for it, I even made 2 myself but also tried existing ones and this happened with each one. Is there something I should do to make it work? If no one has any answers maybe this will at least help someone else trying to search for it.  </p><p>Thank you so much! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,customize,en-US,1455878;,triplelaserphase

Then re-install v69 so it doesn't tell me I'm installing an old version?  Or will the ""todays date"" data within the Profile screw it up anyway? Copying the Profile file list &amp; getting it to this computer to post here would take a lot of time &amp; effort.

I was unable to make my v69 profile the default for either v72 or v93, don't know why not. </p><p>THE AUTO INSTALL SHOULD ONLY GO TO THE NEXT REV, NOT THE MOST RECENT, WITHOUT USER PERMISSION. </p><p>So I trashed most everything and installed v69 again from the dmg file. When I opened it, I quickly went to Prefs/Gen and un-toggled the Auto Update.  It asked me if I wanted to cancel &amp; I did.  <strong>This is only possible because I have a slow DSL line.
