No outages in my area (Twitch works fine on my phone) 2.	Tried Firefox in Troubleshoot mode (which disables all extensions) Twitch still broke. 3.	Tried Incognito and Troubleshoot mode, Twitch still broke. 4.	Cleared cookies and cache, plus Incognito and Troubleshoot mode, Twitch still broke. 5.	Tried a different browser, Twitch works fine on Edge 6.	I tried all of the above using a 4G Hotspot instead of my fibre connection, same issue </p><p>I’ve done some side by side testing of Edge and Firefox today, streaming the same content on each at the same time.  Twitch runs fine on Edge.  Twitch loads on Firefox and the chat looks fine.  The chat arrives simultaneously on Edge and Firefox, it’s just the audio and video won’t play on Firefox.  The audio and video don’t work on the ads either. </p><p>Watching a Youtube game stream side by side on both Edge and Firefox gives a slightly different result.  Again, the chat feed is almost simultaneous, maybe a fraction faster on Firefox.  However, while the audio and video run fine on both Edge and Firefox, there is a 15 second lag on Firefox.  Both are playing full 1080 video. </p><p>So there is a definite issue with how Firefox is buffering audio/video content.  The 15 second delay between the audio video stream and the chat I am seeing today with Youtube is what I was experiencing on Twitch over the weekend.  I noticed it on streams that include a chat window on the video.  I wasn’t overly concerned about the latency issue, as long as I had audio and video.  Both of those stopped working for Twitch on Firefox yesterday.  It could be that Twitch has slightly richer content than Youtube and that’s why Twitch isn’t working at all on Firefox? </p><p>OK, so I’ve installed the Twitch app for Windows and done some side by side testing with that.  Interestingly, the app has a couple of seconds latency over Edge but it works fine.  I shall use the app for now but would prefer to use Firefox if the buffering/streaming issues can be resolved. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mark.nzl

Although that seems to be fairly elemental information that is unnecessary, even if there is a good reason to keep it, must that message window always be in the same position?  That is really a problem as it obscures one's ability to navigate on a page upon which he may be working.  Look at the attachment.  The FF window is covering the location where I want to put my cursor to work on that page that is in the background.  In this case, I wanted to make sure the cursor was positioned in a different place for another screenshot I might put there (below the existing one). </p><p>Since I'm familiar with pasting or copying the screenshot and how to do that before this window opens, how can I remove for all screenshots, now and in the future, this window opening? </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-81;firefox-930;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",LManross

Now, when I go to sign in, it no longer recognizes my user name and says there has been an error - that my user name is incorrect. The situation has not changed when I turn off Relay Extension and restart Firefox. I used the relay address to sign in just for the heck of it, and that doesn't work either. I can log into my Weebly site with Safari though - which means that something went wrong with Firefox and not Weebly. I had also used Relay on my Craigslist account and my accounts were automatically shut down. At the time, I did not think it was due to the Relay, but now I wonder. I had to open a new account with a new email address in order to use Craigslist again. (I have an ongoing ad). Anyway, I think there might be something wrong with Relay. </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;firefox-930;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",jyoti2

I was excited to use the desktop browser again and sync everything. After I got signed in, customized my header layout, got my addons, all my settings, etc., I moved on to something else and closed Firefox. The next time I opened it, I noticed my profile picture in the toolbar wasn't changing from the default. When I clicked it, it said sign in and had a sync button, and a 3rd empty option. If I tried to sign in it would  automatically take me to my account settings, as if nothing was wrong, and if I tried to sync it would ask me to sign in but load forever upon clicking confirm. But so many dropdown options and dialog boxes were blank, it was sort of broken. I refreshed Firefox and it let me login again but after I went through it all, it happened again. I uninstalled the few addons I had, still happened. Tried messing with some delete-upon-close options I saw someone suggest in another help thread, didn't work.  After trying over and over and getting very overwhelmed and disappointed, I finally noticed that it only happens once I set my theme to one with a gif as the header image. If it's a still image it keeps me logged in as usual. But if it is animated I end up with this error again.  </p><p>So, I guess my question is, can anyone please tell me why this happens? Is it something I can fix? I can live without an animated theme but I was excited for it, I even made 2 myself but also tried existing ones and this happened with each one. Is there something I should do to make it work? If no one has any answers maybe this will at least help someone else trying to search for it.  </p><p>Thank you so much! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,customize,en-US,1455878;,triplelaserphase
