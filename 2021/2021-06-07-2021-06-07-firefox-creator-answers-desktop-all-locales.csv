It seems that when I try to go to Netflix or Amazon Prime Video the browser crashes almost instantly, and usually shuts my whole computer off. It doesn't go to a blue screen, the computer just decides it's time to reboot. Now again, I'm using an older machine (and I can't afford a new one), but this was never a problem until this latest version of Firefox. </p><p>I am also not a fan of the aesthetics in this version and I'm wondering if I can revert back to an older version where the crashing was less frequent.
