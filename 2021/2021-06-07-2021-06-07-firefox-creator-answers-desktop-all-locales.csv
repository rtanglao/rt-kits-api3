At subsequent startup, FF showed a ""New Tab"" -- blank -- instead of my Homepage.  ""New Tab"" never changes. </p><p>I switched to the Microsoft ""Edge"" browser, which allowed me to import my ""Bookmarks"" (created in FF), and  offered me a working link to Mozilla Help.  ""Edge"" works fine in every respect. </p><p>Mozilla ""Support"" steered me to an article about changing what was displayed on the ""New Tab"" -- ""Change your New Tab page content"" -- but the ""Personalize"" button wasn't anywhere to be found, so it didn't help me.   </p><p>And the ""Settings"" item was where it should be on the hamburger menu, but picking the item just returned to the ""New Tab"" </p><p>By picking from a list of recent links dropped-down from the address box in FF, I was able to put an assortment of candidate links into the address box, but not to ""Visit"" any of them.  The Tab stayed stubbornly ""New"".  It seemed to me that most things were as expected up to that point.  But a browser that won't navigate is a sad thing. </p><p>I'm doing OK with ""Edge"" + my bookmarks, but I am anxious to get back to FF.

When I click on an external hyperlink (say from an email), a new Firefox window opens to my home page even though there is already a Firefox window open.  There is only one tab in the new Firefox window (not two like previously reported) - the home page.  This does not happen when I switch to Safari.  In preferences, I have ""open links in tabs instead of new windows"" checked.  This just started a few months ago.  Also, in the example email, when i hover over the hyperlink, a little downarrow box appears to the right of the link.  When I click on the down arrow, a window opens with the proper link, but it's not a Firefox window.  At the top of this new window, there is a box that says ""open with Safari"".

I use a ultrawide monitor (3440*1440) and windows10 itself has an utterly crap window size and location issue(since v1809 upto 20H2) with most applications/programs. So to get around that I have been using Windowmanager (<a href=""http://www.desksoft.com/WindowManager.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.desksoft.com/WindowManager.htm</a>) and/or Ultramon (<a href=""https://www.realtimesoft.com/ultramon/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.realtimesoft.com/ultramon/</a>) to brute force Window pos/size etc. </p><p>Every application/program that I have created a profile for with the size/location info works perfectly and so did FF v88. But FF v89 is refusing point blank to be told where I want it. Even doing a refresh of FF by nuking the profile folder from (C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles) will not resolve the behavior.  </p><p>The only 'sorta' workaround from my side is to run the monitor in dual-screen mode (2x 1720*1440), and at this point FF v89 will only behave itself for the first launch of the browser. If I launch additional FF v89 windows, the same bloody off to the right and up behavior is back. </p><p>And secondly even setting the shortcut to always launch FF v89 as maximized does not work, FF v89 again refuses to behave and does wtf it wants to do. </p><p>So if resetting FF completely does not fix the issue, this suggests an issue with FF v89 or a comparability issue between it and Windows 10 20h2 </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",b1k3rdude

Either way, this is unusable for me. Is there a way I can increase the text size? If not, I'm going to have to find a way to reinstall the old version or switch to another browser.  </p><p>Sorry if the answer to this question is obvious with a bit of searching, but you know...
