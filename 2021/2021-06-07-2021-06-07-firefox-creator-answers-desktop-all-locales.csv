Default local folders to the top 2. Allow reordering of folders on Android Firefox 3. Allow minimising folders in the ""edit bookmark"" interface. (Or start with all folders minimised except the current path.) 4. Allow syncing in one direction only.

It seems that when I try to go to Netflix or Amazon Prime Video the browser crashes almost instantly, and usually shuts my whole computer off. It doesn't go to a blue screen, the computer just decides it's time to reboot. Now again, I'm using an older machine (and I can't afford a new one), but this was never a problem until this latest version of Firefox. </p><p>I am also not a fan of the aesthetics in this version and I'm wondering if I can revert back to an older version where the crashing was less frequent. Any help would be appreciated. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;escalate;bsod;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1418919;1418920;,do.not.email.me
