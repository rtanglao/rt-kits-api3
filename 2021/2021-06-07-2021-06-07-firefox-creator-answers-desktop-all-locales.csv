I use a ultrawide monitor (3440*1440) and windows10 itself has an utterly crap window size and location issue(since v1809 upto 20H2) with most applications/programs. So to get around that I have been using Windowmanager (<a href=""http://www.desksoft.com/WindowManager.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.desksoft.com/WindowManager.htm</a>) and/or Ultramon (<a href=""https://www.realtimesoft.com/ultramon/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.realtimesoft.com/ultramon/</a>) to brute force Window pos/size etc. </p><p>Every application/program that I have created a profile for with the size/location info works perfectly and so did FF v88. But FF v89 is refusing point blank to be told where I want it. Even doing a refresh of FF by nuking the profile folder from (C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles) will not resolve the behavior.  </p><p>The only 'sorta' workaround from my side is to run the monitor in dual-screen mode (2x 1720*1440), and at this point FF v89 will only behave itself for the first launch of the browser. If I launch additional FF v89 windows, the same bloody off to the right and up behavior is back. </p><p>And secondly even setting the shortcut to always launch FF v89 as maximized does not work, FF v89 again refuses to behave and does wtf it wants to do. </p><p>So if resetting FF completely does not fix the issue, this suggests an issue with FF v89 or a comparability issue between it and Windows 10 20h2 </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",b1k3rdude

Either way, this is unusable for me. Is there a way I can increase the text size? If not, I'm going to have to find a way to reinstall the old version or switch to another browser.  </p><p>Sorry if the answer to this question is obvious with a bit of searching, but you know...
