Trying to make it maximized simply re-positions the window with the same size. Clicking maximize again maximizes the FF window correctly. This happens on every startup of the browser, even though the last window size was set to maximized. </p><p>Please see this screen recording I made, demonstrating the problem: <a href=""https://imgur.com/LdrmUdN"" rel=""nofollow"">https://imgur.com/LdrmUdN</a>. </p><p>Any help with this problem would be appreciated. </p><p>Technical details: </p><p>Firefox version: 89.0 OS Edition: Windows 10 Home Single Language Version: 21H1 OS build: 19043.985 </p><p>Please note that I had upgraded to 21H1 yesterday. Before that I had Windows 10 20H2, where the problem initially started when I upgraded to FF v89.0 and persists till date, with Windows 10 21H1. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,1418987;,gourabsarkar.xs

I ran into some issues after an ubuntu update, where programs (even gnome-terminal) stopped loading all together after I boot into my system.  I resolved it by forcing modprobe.blacklist=nouveau </p><p>Now my system can boot, and all other programs work fine.  However, while my firefox opens up properly, it doesn't load any pages.  Not even the Preferences and about:config page.  If I remove all tabs, and open a new one, it would repeatly prompt me that Firefox needs to restart after update.  Although restarting firefox does absolutely nothing. </p><p>I've tried creating new profiles, rebooting my system, completely removing and reinstalling firefox, nothing works.  </p><p>I'm forced to install and use google chrome to ask for any suggestions, which, as you can see, works perfectly.

This is fine for web pages, documents, etc. because I can vary the text size as needed. Since the new update, I can't read the text on my bookmarks, menu, toolbars, tabs, etc. I don't know if they've made the text smaller or if it's a result of the amount of space added around everything, but I could swear the text is much smaller. Either way, this is unusable for me. Is there a way I can increase the text size? If not, I'm going to have to find a way to reinstall the old version or switch to another browser.  </p><p>Sorry if the answer to this question is obvious with a bit of searching, but you know... I can't see anything. It's very frustrating. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,1418966;,frontfashioned
