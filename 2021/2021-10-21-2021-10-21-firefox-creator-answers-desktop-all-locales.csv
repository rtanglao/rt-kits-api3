I set Firefox to restore the tabs when I close it and reopen it. Most of the time I have just one Firefox window open and this works fine. Occasionally, however, I need to open a second window usually with just one tab and if I forget and close the main Firefox window with the pinned tabs, etc before the single window one, Firefox reloads this single tab when I reopen it. Is there a way to avoid this behaviour? </p>",linux;desktop;tabs;firefox-930;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",entodoays

Unfortunately, we came late to realize that the Firefox ESR would be a much more suitable product, compared to the normal Firefox branch. </p><p>Now, some years ago we would simply mass uninstall the normal Firefox and mass install the (latest) ESR version and all would be well. Problem is that we have to keep existing profiles (including passwords/bookmarks etc), something that is not supported in the latest Firefox builds. </p><p>Can anyone offer some advice/""hacks"" to accomplish this? Note that whatever we'll do, we'll have to do it automatically, we lack the man-power to do this manually on a system by system basis... </p><p>Thanks in advance for any information provided. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",carmik
