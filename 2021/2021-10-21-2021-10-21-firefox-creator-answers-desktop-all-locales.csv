I go to <a href=""http://Audible.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Audible.com</a>, open my library, click download, and then a pop up shows the .aax file I'm going to download. The problem - In the past week, the pop up window now shows that I'm about to download a .mp4 file. That doesn't play nice with Apple Books or my iPhone. I've called Audible several times, but they haven't been able to help. If I use Safari, the .aax file is downloaded correctly. This is a Firefox issue. Any ideas here? </p><p>Thanks for your time and help! --Scott </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;firefox-930;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",seschreiber

When I search the internet history 4 and 5 months back I get the same results for month 4 as I get for month 5. I know the location and times I am looking for but they are not showing up in the history (thinking that I did this and don;t remember). Ay idea how I can determine if access was established by my computer or why I am seeing duplicate information on different months? </p>,windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-930;,firefox,other,en-US,1452587;,tld6008
