Now, every time I type anything in a search box, it jumps to the address bar, causing me to have to shift my line of sight to the top left of my screen rather than the center of the screen.  Not to mention the text on the address bar is several orders of magnitude smaller than the test on the web pages search bar.   So how to I shut this behavior down?  If I click in a search box I expect my text to appear in that search box, NOT in the address bar. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ClementsPE9703

I have never had to do that. I never logged out. My log in and password were not offered or suggested. Then I discovered other tabs that had logged me out. Then I discovered I passwords had disappeared. I do not know what happened. I didn't update anything. I have spent hours trying to fix this. I followed one route to create a new profile and now I have lost the 73 tabs open over 3 windows for my businesses. Damn! I am fuming! And with no phone support this is the end of working with Mozilla. Can someone please help me? I'd like to wind back to yesterday morning!! Profiles, everything! I managed to find my bookmarks, but I have lost time and lost business. Help! Please! </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",debilabi
