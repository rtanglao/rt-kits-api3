For platform specific releases, the version checker first checks to see if a particular letter (or number) exists, if yes and the version is different (or higher) it becomes a platform specific sub-version release. Example: for Windows specific releases, the version-checker looks to see if ‘w’ exists, if yes it is Windows platform specific. If not but the version is different or higher then it is a universal update. Same principle applied to each platform. This means mac &amp; linux users are not being nagged multiple times a day to update to a version that has no applicable changes to it for their platform. At least two of the previous three updates have been Windows specific updates, not applicable to other platforms. By the looks, some of these minor updates might only apply to 1.2% (or much less) of Windows users whom actually use that tool or function. This update system change is so simplistic and should only require one extra line of code in the update-checker. Of course, platform specific devs would need to remember to add the platform specific key to the version of the sub-version release and also the version file online. </p><p>I’ve been wanting to make this request for a while but the FireFox Feedback option has been disabled for a period of time.
