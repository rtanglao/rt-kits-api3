The video at the top of the following page is one of many examples at the Web site:  <a href=""https://www.meteomedia.com/ca/nouvelles/article/quebec-prochaine-victime-du-dome-de-chaleur"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.meteomedia.com/ca/nouvelles/article/quebec-prochaine-victime-du-dome-de-chaleur</a>.  I also got the same error at a wholly different Web site yesterday or the day before, so right- or left-clicked the mouse at the bottom of the frame for the player, or just above it but still over the player's frame, and was able to see that the video was also hosted at Brightcove. </p><p>I get two error messages and the first one, shown in its own frame says, ""No video has been loaded"" and ""Error Code:  PLAYER_ERR_NO_SRC"", both shown at the same time within the same window sort of frame.  I then click to close that inner frame and get NOTHINGÂ ; nothing being shown for any message and there's just a spinning wheel, permitting to see that nothing is being downloaded or loaded for the player to have something to play. </p><p>I have no problems with videos at YouTube and haven't tried at other video hosting Web sites, having formerly known of one but having forgotten what it is.  It's quite known and I just don't recall the domain name.  So, I'm unable to test trying with other hosting sites.  Well, I tried to find some using only ""videos"" for search and got a link for the following article, ""12 Video Sites That Are Better Than YouTube"", by Dan Price, 30 April 2021, <a href=""https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/top-12-sites-watch-videos-youtube"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/top-12-sites-watch-videos-youtube</a>.  #1 is vimeo and <a href=""http://vimeo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">vimeo.com</a> isn't at all loading correctly with Firefox 89 (89.0.1).  #2 is Metacafe, while #3 is DailyMotion, and the videos at both of these Web sites play, though the quality of the image isn't at all as good at YouTube, not with the 3 videos I tried anyway.  (Maybe it's just that the functionality of these ""better than YouTube"" Web sites is better, for YouTube maintainers have definitely damaged its functionality, but this isn't a problem for Mozilla to resolve.) </p><p>So, for now, the problem I'm having appears to only be with videos hosted at Brightcove.  I've been using <a href=""http://MeteoMedia.com"" rel=""nofollow"">MeteoMedia.com</a> for many years and it's only some months ago that their videos ceased to load and therefore play.  And I'm sure to recall having checked the videos at MM a number of times over years, clicking on the player in the same manner and seeing that Brightcove was being used, with the videos playing correctly every time, until earlier this year, 2021. </p><p>Mike/Michel Corbeil Quebec, Canada </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,1425577;1425578;1425580;1425581;,mikecorbeil

I have always used default settings for screen appearance and colors (Default Theme using system colors). When I upgraded to 89.0 on this machine the appearance of web pages changed. The menu bar color went from a deep blue to a light gray and I don't like it. Simply put, I like the contrast. tried to change it, but there was no preset theme available (that I could find) that would take me back to what I had. I tried to customize some colors but after several attempts, I just gave up and went back to 88.01. I have four Core I7 machines and one older quad core. Firefox is my default browser on all of them. Settings are the same on all of them. The problem with going back was all my settings on this machine were lost (going back by downloading and installing the older version was like a new install). I had to go back and redo my security settings and cookie controls including blocked and allowed sites.  </p><p>When 89.01 was released, I upgraded a machine that I do not use as much as the two in my home office.
