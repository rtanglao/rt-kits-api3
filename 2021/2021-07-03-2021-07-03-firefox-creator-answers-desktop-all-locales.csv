I completely trust Mozilla as I believe in what this organization stands for and the product works for me.  I don't trust any and all third party apps that request a slue of permissions including data which means my passwords and all that I'm typing. </p><p>If an adblocker can't manage to block adds without access to all my data there is something wrong. Without naming which one, yet is recommended by Mozilla, is scanned at virus total and given thumbs up by twenty antivirus software companies except one as it is flagged for cryptomining. </p><p>There has to be tighter controls on apps that request data access which includes logins and passwords.  This shouldn't be granted to any app other than a password manager or there is no point in hardening security protocols in the core program since the damage is already done internally. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,1425468;1425471;,zorgfromorg

I can not open PDFs, outer program links. Only a few PDF links are opened at specially crafted websites. Probably those are sites with on-site difined MIME or allowing the PDF contents being precashed. </p><p>In all the other cases where the file should be predownloaded with FF downloader, it fails to download. The same file is downloaded easily when choosing ""save as"" </p><p>I guess, the problem may be in ""downloader"" part only, since other online contents are displayed, i.e. stored in cache withoud problems. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Hale
