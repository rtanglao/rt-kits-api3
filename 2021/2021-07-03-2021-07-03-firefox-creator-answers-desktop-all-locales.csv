Scripts are basically the same, only some configuration changes from one script to another (what to scrape on the page, and where to save it). Scripts will not alter the page in any way, just read it then call some REST API with the data I do not want these scripts to be loaded on every web page, as they won't alter them, and depending on the page there is only one I'd like to run anyway. </p><p>So is there a way to launch these scripts directly from the browser (Firefox) ? From a bookmark or something ? Basically I want to click a button and have the script run like if I was running it from the js console. </p><p>Best I found for now is the ""@run-at context-menu"" directive of Tampermonkey. My script appears in a TamperMonkey context menu and is run on click. </p><p>However this menu is loaded on every page (@run-at context-menu ignores the @include directive and is applied everywhere), I'm not sure of the performance consequences, and it might be inconvenient if I end up with lots of scripts. </p><p>I guess I could also modify my scripts to be run on specific pages so that they add a floating button or something. But I'd rather not modify the pages, and it would be inconvenient on pages where I'd like to have several possible scripts. </p><p>I remember using a Greasemonkey script that added options on the context menu a long while ago. Would that be possible with Tampermonkey, implementing an equivalent of the @run-at context-menu myself that would only work on some pages ? </p><p>A more native way would be best, but I'm open to options. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ameenkhan82h
