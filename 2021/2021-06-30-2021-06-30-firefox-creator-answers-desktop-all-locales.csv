These videos  I am using <a href=""http://msn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">msn.com</a>, because that's where I sign in to my <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> (online) e-mail.   Yes, I am behind the times. </p><p>(I would have liked to use Thunderbird, but since it did not work straight out of the box, and there was no advice about things like ""proxies, IMAP, POP3, etc"" from anyone here at Firefox, I could not make it work, hence stuck with the e-mail system which is constantly renamed by MSFT from MSN, to Hotmail, to <a href=""http://live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">live.com</a>, to Outlook, to <a href=""http://Outlook.Live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.Live.com</a>. As if renaming something would make it better...)   </p><p>If I knew how, I'd be fine to activate ""MS Media Player"", or that ""VLC player"" within Firefox.  Reasonable people are ok with finding out which lid fits on which pot, and which screwdriver works with different types of screws.    </p><p>Why software people cannot appreciate the concept of ""for this task, you need this tool"", and make it simple and clear to do so, that will forever remain a mystery to me.   </p><p>So, does anyone here at Firefox have the basic pride of saying to themselves: ""There has got to be a way to do this!"" and then work the problem until it is solved?   For example, why can't I ""right-click"" on the misbehaving video clip, and get an option ""Play video via this or that player""?  It can't be that hard, you could even have it in a separate window, if that's required for one of myriads of software reasons no one can ever explain. </p>",desktop;other;firefox-890;firefox-8902;,firefox,other,en-US,"",voodooquantum
