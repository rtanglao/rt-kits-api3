I once again had to create another account (which appears to have been associated with all my previous Firefox accounts since it displays a list of questions I have asked in the past.) To create the new account I had to request a “verification code” four times as each time the Firefox application said the code was invalid or expired. It was always the same six digits. Finally I copied it from the e-mail and pasted it into the entry form rather than keying those six digits in directly. Then it was accepted. Anyway, on to the purpose of this inquiry: </p><p><br> Unless only a few words are involved, I use my word processor to create anything I want to post on-line, such as this inquiry. This allows me to write something that another person might be able to understand. I then do copy and paste to the on-line site. </p><p>Mostly this works without any problems. On a couple of sites, all the word processor formatting controls, which are not seen in the word processor, appear as part of the pasted entry, rendering it useless. In these cases I first paste into Windows Notepad, then copy from Notepad to the on-line application. </p><p>In one case neither method worked for an on-line query. The error message said that I had entered unacceptable special characters. An attempt to key directly into their screen also failed with exactly the same error message. I contacted their technical support via telephone and was told their site does not function with Firefox. </p><p>Just now I just gave up trying to use “live chat” at a U.S. government agency site. What I see on the monitor, in the on-line application, is the text I pasted there. The on-line application says I have entered some unacceptable special characters, none of which I have used. The symptoms are exactly like what I described in the preceding paragraph. </p><p>I did not pursue it further. I definitely did not want to try and re-key everything directly into the on-line application just to find out if it could work that way or if it is a “we don’t like Firefox” site. </p><p>Is it true that simple text entries entered via Firefox cannot be processed correctly while the same thing entered through Microsoft or Google browsers does work? </p><p>Is there any way to assure that special characters I do not type cannot become part of the text (as I thought was true of anything in Windows Notepad)? </p><p>Is there any work-around while still using Firefox? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;firefox-8902;,firefox,other,en-US,"",AndyH-FF

These videos  I am using <a href=""http://msn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">msn.com</a>, because that's where I sign in to my <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> (online) e-mail.

For example, why can't I ""right-click"" on the misbehaving video clip, and get an option ""Play video via this or that player""?  It can't be that hard, you could even have it in a separate window, if that's required for one of myriads of software reasons no one can ever explain. </p>",desktop;other;firefox-890;firefox-8902;,firefox,other,en-US,"",voodooquantum
