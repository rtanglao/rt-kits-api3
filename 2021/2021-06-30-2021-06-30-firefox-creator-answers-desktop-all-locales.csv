Years before I got accustomed to use the very useful function of ""properties"" of the tabs. Within its' windows I was able to annotate handy, personal informations, such as IDs, passwords and also some short summaries. Then, after recent updates - (my current version is 89.0.2 - 64 bits) - surprisingly this function is no more available! My question is : why was this funtion taken away ?  And also : how is that possible to annotate tabs henceforth ? Thanks for your attention. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",vikimi

[I had to install Chrome to use when I need to print].  Anyway, the print preview shows up as portrait, but the THUMBNAIL-sized image now prints ""sideways"" or in landscape mode. </p><p>The issue of printing thumbnail images [versus full-size] after an update appears to be a somewhat frequent problem in Firefox, [though the posts I have found are all older-- 2014, 2015, 2016...].  Anyway, the problem generally seems to have been ""the preference: printer_printer_name.print_paper_data -- being set to 256. Changing the value to 1 solved the paper size problem.""   </p><p>Following the ""Fix printing problems"" tips from Firefox to find the preferences, I: Clicked the menu button, clicked Help, then selected More Troubleshooting Information. The Troubleshooting Information page with the address about:support opened in a new tab.  </p><p>When I scrolled down to the Printing section, I found the equivalent ""print_paper_data"" section, except it is already set to the value 1... </p><p>Help!!!! </p><p>And yes, Firefox is the only browser with this issue.  Am seriously considering removing automatic updating in Firefox-- each update seems to create new problems.  And, may finally move to Chrome as it seems to have fewer issues.  Don't care for Chrome, but there have been many times when weird things happen following updates, and the only way I can properly access needed work software has sometimes been to use Chrome.... </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,1424791;1424792;,cchapman.nee.sundland
