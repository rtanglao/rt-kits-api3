I am a service provider and have a customer that started getting this in her Firefox browser. Started a few weeks ago. Hard to describe the attachment will show more.  There is a image box link. No image shows in any of them but clicked on it does go to the url. The url address is right after it. They are partially imposed over part of the description of the web site. Now my Firefox browser on my machine does not look like this. Is this a setting I need to disable to return it to normal and remove this little image box at the beginning? Or is there a problem with the browser? Thank you for your time and help. SEBassman </p>",desktop;other;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,"",SERocks

I never had it before, but I did a clean install of the latest version and now I have a layer of type on top of a layer of type (see attached screen shot). Now I already have slight double vision in my right eye, so this new phenomena isn't helpful, but it's not my eye,. both eyes see the two fonts in use overlaid.  </p><p><em>It probably is caused something I did wrong???</em> </p><p>I've looked around and I can't find it; it may be hiding in front of me, but I've looked through settings several times and nothing pops out as something that would result in this.  Any suggestions? </p><p>To me it looks like two different fonts and sizes. It does make it more difficult to surf. </p><p>Thanks in advance, Dean </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,other,en-US,"",dwpenn

I have cleared my cache, and even reinstalled Firefox (after deleting my user profile files and signing back in on a newly reinstalled copy).  The problem persists.  The problem does not happen when I boot in Troubleshoot Mode.  But I cannot figure out what's causing the problem to fix it in regular mode.
