I never had it before, but I did a clean install of the latest version and now I have a layer of type on top of a layer of type (see attached screen shot). Now I already have slight double vision in my right eye, so this new phenomena isn't helpful, but it's not my eye,. both eyes see the two fonts in use overlaid.  </p><p><em>It probably is caused something I did wrong???</em> </p><p>I've looked around and I can't find it; it may be hiding in front of me, but I've looked through settings several times and nothing pops out as something that would result in this.  Any suggestions? </p><p>To me it looks like two different fonts and sizes. It does make it more difficult to surf. </p><p>Thanks in advance, Dean </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-920;,firefox,other,en-US,"",dwpenn

I can still do so on other browsers, but not on Firefox.  I have cleared my cache, and even reinstalled Firefox (after deleting my user profile files and signing back in on a newly reinstalled copy).  The problem persists.  The problem does not happen when I boot in Troubleshoot Mode.  But I cannot figure out what's causing the problem to fix it in regular mode.
