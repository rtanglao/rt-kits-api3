The desktop is running a very outdated version of Firefox which means it is not compatable just to update it. The forum tried to help me with this a while back, but it was deemed not to be possible, and the best way would have been to do a fresh new install, but there was noway to save log-ins/passwords bookmarks.  My devices all have the Firefox sync and that is so far working well. My question is, if I dragged my PC's Firefox into the present by performing a fresh new install, would my synced items install ok....after invoking the Sync feature on the new install. Logic tells me this should be so, as it worked ok with the new iPad, but I know from experience that logic doesn't always come into play.
