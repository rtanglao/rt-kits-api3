I am a service provider and have a customer that started getting this in her Firefox browser. Started a few weeks ago. Hard to describe the attachment will show more.  There is a image box link. No image shows in any of them but clicked on it does go to the url. The url address is right after it. They are partially imposed over part of the description of the web site. Now my Firefox browser on my machine does not look like this. Is this a setting I need to disable to return it to normal and remove this little image box at the beginning? Or is there a problem with the browser? Thank you for your time and help. SEBassman </p>",desktop;other;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,1443479;1443482;1443483;1443484;,SERocks
