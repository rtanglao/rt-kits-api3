Firefox would crash upon opening when signed in.  It would stay active enough for me to disable the extensions &amp; themes. After doing that it still crashed. I tried going into Troubleshooting mode and it would still crash.  I went into Troubleshooting mode and did a refresh.  It was still crashing.  Finally I signed out of my mozilla sync account and the browser has stayed active long enough for me to type this report. </p><p>I've submitted all crash reports in about:crashes, and I'm not really sure what to do next. </p><p>Perhaps a local version of the Mozilla Sync profile has been corrupted? if so, is there a way to remove it and pull down the ""sync""ed version from Mozilla's servers?  What if the version on Mozilla's server's has been corrupted? should I back up the local profile (wherever it is) before removing? </p><p>I hope I've given enough information.  Please let me know if you need further, more specific information. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-920;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",aparduhn

One of the things that I love about Google Chrome is the ability to run single window apps. This is the only feature keeping me from moving to Firefox at this point. I'd like to request that this be added as a feature in Firefox. The command could be something like: </p><p>firefox --app=<a href=""https://mail.provider.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.provider.com</a> </p><p>This would spawn a single app window that does not have tabs to navigate to other apps. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",linux;desktop;websites;firefox-780;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",openmail

I am a service provider and have a customer that started getting this in her Firefox browser. Started a few weeks ago. Hard to describe the attachment will show more.  There is a image box link. No image shows in any of them but clicked on it does go to the url. The url address is right after it. They are partially imposed over part of the description of the web site. Now my Firefox browser on my machine does not look like this. Is this a setting I need to disable to return it to normal and remove this little image box at the beginning? Or is there a problem with the browser? Thank you for your time and help. SEBassman </p>",desktop;other;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,1443479;1443482;1443483;1443484;,SERocks
