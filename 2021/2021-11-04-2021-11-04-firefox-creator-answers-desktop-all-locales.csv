Ever since the last update, ALL of my PDF files now show up in file explorer as ""Firefox HTML"" documents. I have changed it so that they open as Acrobat PDF, but the file extentions all got changed from PDF to HTML. Even when I create/save them as .pdf, Firefox automatically changes them. I DO NOT LIKE THIS!!  It makes them impossible to tell apart from actual HTML files in the file list!!  I have not yet tried uploading the to Google Drive or attaching them to emails and sending that way. This is a MESS.  How can I restore it such that Firefox leaves my PDFs alone???? Whose brilliant idea was this to begin with and WHY??? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-930;,firefox,other,en-US,"",s_melton2004
