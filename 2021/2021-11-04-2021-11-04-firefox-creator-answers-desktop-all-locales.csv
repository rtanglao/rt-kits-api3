I saw it going slow so I searched up stuff. I went to ""<a href=""http://whatsmybrowser.org"" rel=""nofollow"">whatsmybrowser.org</a>"", saying Firefox 78. I saw that on an article there is 91 and 95. It is 11/3/21, and no update is showing up which a help article said ""On 11/2/21, users can update to Firefox-ESR version 91."" I couldn't update, so I am now asking for help. Its also going VERY SLOW which I can barely run scratch, google, and even the homepage. Please give me answers so I can fix the problem.
