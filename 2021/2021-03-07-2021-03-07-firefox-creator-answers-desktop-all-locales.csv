I have Windows 10 20H2 64-bit operating system. Firefox can't load some websites.  For example I can load <a href=""https://allegro.pl/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://allegro.pl/</a> but I have problem sometimes with this website: <a href=""https://allegro.pl/myaccount/newpayments_incoming.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://allegro.pl/myaccount/newpayments_incoming.php</a> </p><p>If you go there and use F5 key on keyboard (refresh website) sometimes this can't load. On other browser I don't have this issue. This very frustrated me because I can't work. On Windows 10 1909 on older machine (another computer) I don't have this issue with my firefox (this sam 86.0 version). So this is probably problem only with Windows 10 20H2. </p><p><br> Steps to reproduce: </p><p>1) Open new tab and go here: <a href=""https://allegro.pl/myaccount/newpayments_incoming.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://allegro.pl/myaccount/newpayments_incoming.php</a> 2) Log in to your account for Allegro website (without account you can't load website) 3) When website loads normally you must refresh this website (F5 key on keyboard) few times (you must be patient, sometimes this can take some time) 4)  When website can't load or it's load partly you can see that this stops loading when it try connect to <a href=""http://analytics.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">analytics.google.com</a> so I think that it is very strange behavior. </p><p>On other browsers on Windows 10 20H2 version this website works without issue. Only with Firefox I have a problem. On Windows 10 1909 version on another machine I can't notice this issue. Also on Ubuntu I don't have any problems with this website with firefox. </p><p>Can you fix it? I can't work on my computer with Windows 10 20H2 system. I musted to switch to another browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge). I contacted with owner of the website but this is not the first problem with Firefox on Windows 10 20H2 so you should fix it. I remember that I had some similar problems on another websites but I don't remember what was address for these websites. </p><p>Actual results: </p><p>Sometimes I can't load this website on Windows 10 20H2 64-bit: <a href=""https://allegro.pl/myaccount/newpayments_incoming.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://allegro.pl/myaccount/newpayments_incoming.php</a> </p><p>When website can't load or it's load in a part you can see in the bottom of the browser that this stops when it try connect to <a href=""http://analytics.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">analytics.google.com</a> so it is very strange behavior. </p><p>This can be not problem only with this website. </p><p>Expected results: </p><p>I should load this website always: <a href=""https://allegro.pl/myaccount/newpayments_incoming.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://allegro.pl/myaccount/newpayments_incoming.php</a> </p><p><br> </p><p>I hope that you can fix it. </p>",desktop;websites;escalate;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,websites,en-US,1397110;1397196;1397347;1397428;1397465;1397656;1397672;,peterek355

As soon as I did so, on both Fedora 31 and Windows 7, Firefox became extremely unstable - as though it was running out of resources extremely quickly. On Fedora, I cannot browse at all - immediately upon loading a page, the tab crashes, including internal pages. On Windows, I can get away with some browsing - although crashes are still common. </p><p>For now, I'm going to disable hardware acceleration. However, I'd like to further analyse this and see if I can't find a fix. </p><p>To date, I have tried the following: </p><p>- Updated to firefox v86 (This worsened the problem, and I downgraded to v74) </p><p>- Removed and reinstalled my GPU drivers (no change) </p><p>- Disabled paging on my Windows system, and moved hiberfil.sys to a drive with more space using symlinks (no change) </p><p>- Increased swap space on my Fedora system (made things worse. Don't fuck around with swap if you don't know what you're doing, please) </p><p>- Moved profiles out of the appdata dir and created a new, blank profile (no change) </p><p>- Completed a full round of Memtest+x86 with no issues </p><p>Below are a set of six crash logs.

So good, that it's the reason why still use Firefox. I would never use Chrome, and I know for sure that all those who use it have zero idea just how much, and in what malicious ways, Google has built in settings that theoretically allow to keep your browsing r-e-l-a-t-i-v-e-l-y private (just so that Google can always claim ""users CAN keep their browsing details = personal details private""). But the default in Chrome is always sniffin'. And more sniffin'. And more sniffin'. Think: That's Google's ENTIRE business purpose. And particularly for all products they make ""free"". Just think of gmail. LOL </p><p>So, now everyone believes my enthusiasm for Firefox and its extension Firefox Multi-Account Containers, right? </p><p>That allows me to post a suggestion for further improvement. And I DDG'ed much, where to give extension feedback, but sadly every feedback avenue is closed. You know. So, better here than nowhere: </p><p>IMPROVEMENT SUGGESTION FOR Firefox Multi-Account Containers </p> <h6 id=""w_"">======================================</h6> <p>Current behavior: It auto-recognizes in which container to open a URL by looking at the domain part, only. </p><p>Current behavior also: It ""forgets"" the container entirely, when you reopen firefox with prior tabs, and you had consciously opened a particular page in a different container than the associated one. </p><p><br> Desired modification: A checkmark to toggle per container, if we really want container recognition by domain part only, or by a little more than that. See explanation below. </p><p>Desired behavior also: Firefox should reopen the browser with prior tabs LIKE THEY WERE, ie if a tab purposefully was in a different container before closing firefox, then obviously upon reopening firefox after bootup it should still be in that different container, and not be now totally UNassociated, aka in no container, like it currently is. - This point I find obvious, it requires no explanation. </p><p>The first modification would allow instances like these: - I have multiple, legit, email accounts, and open them in Roundcube, part of Cpanel of my webhosts. - Work email addresses open in ""Work"" container, Private email addresses in ""Private"" container, and so forth. - ALL Roundcube tabs (or whatever you might use) login at <a href=""https://domain.com:2096/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://domain.com:2096/</a> but obviously with different usernames and pw's. - But currently Firefox cannot differentiate that, because it only looks at the domain part, <a href=""http://domain.com"" rel=""nofollow"">domain.com</a> </p><p>How about a checkmark allowing users to select one way or the other for a container? - unchecked: like now - checked: Firefox will differentiate the entire domain up to the first / aka, it will be able to differentiate subdomains, :2096 's (ports?), and similar stuff, because that's all BEFORE the first / </p><p>Could this suggestion please be made viral :) such that the extension developer(s) become aware of it? </p> <dl><dd>) </dd></dl>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-860;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",MyDavid
