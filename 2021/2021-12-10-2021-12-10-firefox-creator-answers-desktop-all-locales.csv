The app and the project are interconnected. App has an in-page navigation(in same URL) with an anchor tag that allows you to launch a new component in the same tab. It worked and was compatible with all commands prior to the release of the new version of Firefox 95. The click function is not working after the rollout (its not responding in any way). When you use Ctrl + click, a new tab opens with the same URL as the anchor tag with navigated component(and working with target=_blank too). Is this happning beacuse of new security release of RLBox. If this is the case, what other options do I have for resolving the problem? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",c2-mrinal

I get a message that each is temporarily unavailable - repeatedly. I have no add-ons to Firefox; I cleared the cache.  I can access all three accounts using Edge and Bing, bringing up Gmail Accounts and then specifying accounts from within that website.  I can't remember when the latest Firefox update happened but it wasn't long ago.  I have never had trouble accessing my gmail accounts before now. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1465270;1465271;,sbedols

Dell had to replace the motherboard and although I had my documents backed up on OneDrive, I'm thinking maybe my bookmarks are long gone? Is there any way to restore them at all?
