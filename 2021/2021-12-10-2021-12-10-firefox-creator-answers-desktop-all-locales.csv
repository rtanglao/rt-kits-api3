Voglio precisare che uso Firefox da molti anni, anzi da sempre, e ho fatto centinaia di accessi a tale sito senza problemi. A questo punto ho provato l'eliminazione di tutti i dati, (Cookie, Cronologia, ecc. ecc.), ho provato a disinstallare e reinstallare il tutto ma niente. Vista la neccessità di accedere al sito ho provato ad operare con Chrome, ebbene nessun problema nella navigazione interna al sito e nessun lag. Preciso, inoltre, che ho provato più volte in sequenza prima con Firefox e poi con Chrome, (per escludere eventuali rallentamenti dovuti ai server della banca), ma niente da fare, Firefox un disastro, Chrome tutto ok. Con altri siti che ho navigato non ho riscontrato problemi rilevanti, o almeno di quel tipo. Mi sembra evidente che qualcosa deve essere successo con gli ultimi aggiornamenti.

My frist thought was it is JS script that calculate the height and sets it however, there are no direct in-line height changes at all. </p><p>Here is the test css: </p><p>toolbox#navigator-toolbox &gt; toolbar#nav-bar { 	position: absolute!important; 	height: 0!important; 	min-height: 0!important; } </p><p>toolbox#navigator-toolbox &gt; toolbar#nav-bar:focus-within, toolbox#navigator-toolbox &gt; toolbar#nav-bar:hover, toolbox#navigator-toolbox &gt; toolbar#nav-bar:focus { 	position: absolute!important; 	height: inherit!important; 	min-height: inherit!important; } </p><p>Using CTRL+L shotrcut combination you can force the nav-bar inputbox to be `focused` which sets custom style that reveals it. Since it is positioned absolutely it should not contribute to layout yet when it appears, the render viewport shifts and `toolbox#navigator-toolbox` height automatically increases. </p>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,1465464;,kein-of
