Tutto diventa estremamente lento, una cosa mai vista prima tanto che è meglio non rischiare di fare alcuna cosa onde evitare di combinare pasticci senza rendersene conto. Voglio precisare che uso Firefox da molti anni, anzi da sempre, e ho fatto centinaia di accessi a tale sito senza problemi. A questo punto ho provato l'eliminazione di tutti i dati, (Cookie, Cronologia, ecc. ecc.), ho provato a disinstallare e reinstallare il tutto ma niente. Vista la neccessità di accedere al sito ho provato ad operare con Chrome, ebbene nessun problema nella navigazione interna al sito e nessun lag. Preciso, inoltre, che ho provato più volte in sequenza prima con Firefox e poi con Chrome, (per escludere eventuali rallentamenti dovuti ai server della banca), ma niente da fare, Firefox un disastro, Chrome tutto ok. Con altri siti che ho navigato non ho riscontrato problemi rilevanti, o almeno di quel tipo. Mi sembra evidente che qualcosa deve essere successo con gli ultimi aggiornamenti. Mi dispiacerebbe molto dover lasciare questo browser dopo una vita passata insieme. Grazie </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,websites,it,1465391;,serguest20
