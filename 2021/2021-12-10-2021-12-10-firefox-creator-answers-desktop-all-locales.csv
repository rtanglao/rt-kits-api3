I get a message that each is temporarily unavailable - repeatedly. I have no add-ons to Firefox; I cleared the cache.  I can access all three accounts using Edge and Bing, bringing up Gmail Accounts and then specifying accounts from within that website.  I can't remember when the latest Firefox update happened but it wasn't long ago.  I have never had trouble accessing my gmail accounts before now. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",sbedols

I recently had the motherboard on my Dell laptop replaced and I'm afraid I've lost all of my bookmarks. I was not able to backup anything before everything went black and I don't think I was signed in at all to Firefox. Dell had to replace the motherboard and although I had my documents backed up on OneDrive, I'm thinking maybe my bookmarks are long gone? Is there any way to restore them at all? Please say yes, please say yes!!! LOL! Thank you! </p><p>Melissa </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",melissaproctor08

Background is White. </p><p>That doesn't solve the problem. </p><p>Also in Colors, I've tried all three options listed in ""Override the colors specified in the page"". None of them fix it. </p><p>All of this is on Windows 10, 64 bit, OS build 19043.1348. </p><p>FWIW, this problem doesn't happen if I use FF on an IOS device. </p><p>It also doesn't happen with any other browsers I test, like Chrome, Edge, or Brave. </p><p>How can I eliminate dark mode? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mitch11
