My frist thought was it is JS script that calculate the height and sets it however, there are no direct in-line height changes at all. </p><p>Here is the test css: </p><p>toolbox#navigator-toolbox &gt; toolbar#nav-bar { 	position: absolute!important; 	height: 0!important; 	min-height: 0!important; } </p><p>toolbox#navigator-toolbox &gt; toolbar#nav-bar:focus-within, toolbox#navigator-toolbox &gt; toolbar#nav-bar:hover, toolbox#navigator-toolbox &gt; toolbar#nav-bar:focus { 	position: absolute!important; 	height: inherit!important; 	min-height: inherit!important; } </p><p>Using CTRL+L shotrcut combination you can force the nav-bar inputbox to be `focused` which sets custom style that reveals it.
