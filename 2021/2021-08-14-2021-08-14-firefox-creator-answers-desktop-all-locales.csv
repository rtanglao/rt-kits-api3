Now, when I go to Firefox preferences, I can see all the usual options, but the little checks in the checkboxes are essentially invisible.  I think the preferences are changing when I click on them, because the sub-options become black/active or greyed-out/inactive, but the checks themselves are invisible.  So I cannot tell whether things are checked or unchecked!  (See pics 1 and 2.  Pic 1 is before clicking on the first checkbox, and Pic 2 is after clicking on it, and the sub-option is now active.) </p><p>If I open a different checkbox-page, like my Firefox profile settings, the checkboxes look like they are styled the same, but there they DO work.  (See pic 3.) </p><p>(I was trying to mess around with the preferences because also, after this latest update, virtually all pages seem to be loading verrrrrry slowly, or often not loading at all.  But it's sort of random, because then suddenly the same page will load very quickly.  But... I cannot even begin to address this secondary problem because I can't see what the preferences are set to!) </p><p>Any help would be much appreciated! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-910;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1434873;,mkmkmk

I've used FF for so many years that I've lost track of how other browsers perform.

I'll just say things were needlessly broken and true user control was limited.  One cannot even go back from this sad upgrade as profiles are locked to the newer version and blocked from use with the last working version. </p><p>I'm well past old enough to know that this is how open-source functioned in its early years when consistency from version to version was lost in the flow of [too many] ideas.  I also have seen the opposite - authoritarian ways of MS and backed away from them beyond OS.
