As you can see on the images, I made a screenshot using Firefox at first. Then I visited the same webpage with safari and made another screenshot. With any other browser the webpage looks like how It's supposed to look. But with Firefox (or Firefox Nightly) It doesn't. I can't figure out what the problem is and I tried different settings or dissabling the add-ons, but nothing seems to help.

Now, when I go to Firefox preferences, I can see all the usual options, but the little checks in the checkboxes are essentially invisible.

So I cannot tell whether things are checked or unchecked!  (See pics 1 and 2.  Pic 1 is before clicking on the first checkbox, and Pic 2 is after clicking on it, and the sub-option is now active.) </p><p>If I open a different checkbox-page, like my Firefox profile settings, the checkboxes look like they are styled the same, but there they DO work.
