I was using version 90 on both computers before. My iMac using system 10.14.2 has no problem with version 91 but my MacBook pro using 10.13.6 is having a major problem. All the pages look totally different than what they used to - like it’s missing color, clear format and it looks blankish. I will post two photos here - the first one is what my email page used to look like and the second one shows what it looks like now. Any and all pages I go to now using Firefox 91 shows the same. Even the weather page lacks color and no more videos in the middle of the page. It is bleak and blank looking. It’s awful.  </p><p>What can I do to get back how my firefox used to look before downloading version 91 onto my MacBook pro?  </p><p>Thank you, Martha </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,1434836;1434837;,mpoinar1

With the 91 update, things look the same on my iMac Mojave but my Macbook Pro using High Sierra looks totally different and ""blank.""  </p><p>In this first photo, this is what it used to look like and in the second photo, this is what it looks like now on my Macbook Pro. All the websites I go to are now blank looking as if they are missing parts. The weather channel is the same. It is very blank and bleak. How can I get back to the way it looked before the update?

Anyways to remove the mute/playing messages from the tabs?,<p>Used to have a workaround that kept the previous looks of firefox but sadly the most recent update decided that i should not have good things. This is one out of 2 things that annoy me and it is the biggest issues so is there any way to remove it? </p><p>It shows when stream/videos are playing in the tab as far as i know and if you mute the tab. </p><p>Cheers </p>,desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,customize,en-US,1434829;,Makta
