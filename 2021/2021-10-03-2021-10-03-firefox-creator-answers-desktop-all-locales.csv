(Firefox 2.0.1 (64-bit) </p><p>Issue: say from Alfred or my 3rd party mail client, or any other application, native or otherwise, clicking a web link launches my default browser (FF), HOWEVER I am hit with the seemingly unsolvable double window bug.   </p><p>One window opens my home page, along with a second window headed to the link target. I've looked at about:config neww settings, all default. My preferences are set to force open new windows in tabs. Just to be clear, this behavior ONLY occurs when Firefox is not already running.   </p><p>Any insight?  </p><p>Not the end of the world but certainly not ideal nor graceful.
