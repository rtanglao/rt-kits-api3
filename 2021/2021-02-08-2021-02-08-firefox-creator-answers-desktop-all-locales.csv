During a restart, I often get the error message ""we must close the old Firefox"". It happened even after a complete restart of the computer. How do you close it completely the first time? 2) I have used Dark Reader which has a good reputation and is useful. However, it slowed Firefox down considerably until it crashed. I deleted it, but some of the pages it had blacked out ... remain so when I reload them.

I introduced firefox on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS on WSL 2 as usual, and starting from the command line produced the following error messages: </pre> <ol><li><ol><li><ol><li>!!! [Parent][RunMessage] Error: Channel error: cannot send/recv </li></ol> </li></ol> </li></ol> <pre>  The browser starts with a window from WSL 2 command line, but all tabs repeat crashes and cannot use any more.   My full error messages are attached as a text file in this post. </pre> <pre>  Ordinarily, this glitch can be solved by using a hack that shows ""about:config"" and proceed with changing settings of two values of entry ""browser.tabs.remote.autostart"" and ""browser.tabs.remote.autostart"" to false.  Actually my other firefox instace on WSL could solve this problem, but this time, I cannot solve this. Firefox keeps crashing after altering these two settings. </pre> <pre>  I tried to make some other workarounds, such as manipulating  SELinux parater mozilla_plugin_can_network_connect to ""-1"", but I found SELinux was disabled in my WSL 2 at all.  </pre> <pre> I guess something on IPC function is missing or broken, due to for example lack of appropriate packages, but I cannot specify the solution. </pre> <pre> Here is my enviroment in trouble: </pre> <ul><li> Firefox version: 85.0 (latest on Ubuntu) </li><li> OS version: 20.04 LTS (with all latest patches applied) </li><li> System: WSL 2 (on Windows 10 Pro 20H2 64 bit) </li><li> X Application: VcXsrv 1.20.9.0 (maybe the latest) </li></ul> <pre>  Other GUI applications run flawlessly as far as I confirm. </pre> <pre>  Any comments and suggestions appreciated. </pre>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-850;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",terakinizers

With Firefox's built-in protection it's more static ... still have a feeling that's where the problem is but will need to spend a little more time to draw any conclusions on my end. Maybe the built-in dev tools will shed some additional light? </p><p>Incidentally, the Chrome browser has no problem. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-850;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",firefox1233
