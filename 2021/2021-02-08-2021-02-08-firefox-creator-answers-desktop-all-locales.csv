If I change my password, I may lose my bookmarks, etc. I exported the bookmarks to html and also backed them up (json). If I change my password, will I be able to restore the bookmarks using one of those backups? I backed up ""all bookmarks.""

I have a (presumably) broken install of Firefox that never loads and I plan to totally uninstall Firefox (I have the beta version and I plan to get the normal version, unless you guys have a better solution to try), but first I just need to salvage my carefully curated bookmarks from this install before I nuke it (uninstall, do a clean-up, and reinstall a totally different version). Since normally once has to open the browser and enter settings (or bookmarks perhaps, I forget the exact process off the top of my head and clearly can't go look) to export bookmarks, I'm at a loss of how to accomplish this task. I've included a screenshot of what Firefox does when I open it. No amount of waiting does any good, this is all it does, and this is all it has done for over a year, despite numerous updates. Clearly the install is corrupted and I need to start fresh, but I need those bookmarks if at all possible. Is it possible? I've just switched to Chrome for the past year hoping it would eventually work itself out with an update, but that was clearly wishful thinking. I actually hate Chrome and would really like to get back to using Firefox, but I've let this linger for a year because I really do not want to lose those bookmarks and doing nothing and having a case of Schrodinger's bookmarks is somewhat better than having bookmarks that are gone forever. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1390648;1390650;,Phaewryn1
