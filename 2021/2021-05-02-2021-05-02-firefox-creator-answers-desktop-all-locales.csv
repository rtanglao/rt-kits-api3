I have my settings set to CUSTOM and block all cookies. I then have managed my exceptions. I did a refresh resently, all that was lost. The best I can do currently is to have wordpad  open and manually type each line out in my exceptions and then if needed in the future, I could copy and paste. There might be a better way that I do not know. I do know by default, the 'Managed Exceptions' under 'Cookies and Site Data' does not save if 'Refreshed'.  Please address a better process and not my choice on blocking all cookies, thank you. </p>",windows-7;desktop;tips;firefox-880;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",PH8978
