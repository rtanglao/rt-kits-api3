On iOS / iPadOS you have the appropriate icon, why not transfer it directly to macOS Big Sur at this point (thus unifying the interface itself)? </p><p>Nothing to say about the rest, you are fabulous and the best (I just suggest a hint of transparency in the panel bar). </p><p>With regard </p>",mac-os;desktop;tips;firefox-880;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",Kikko90
