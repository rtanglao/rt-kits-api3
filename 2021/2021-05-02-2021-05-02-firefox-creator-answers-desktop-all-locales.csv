The password is saved and available in the browser settings. BUT. If I try to enter it and log in from another device, the mail service says the password is wrong. I can't understand how it is possible. The browser should use one of the saved passwords for the authorization, right? Why doesn't it work outside this very browser?  </p><p>MAYBE one day I changed the password in the mail service, logged in, BUT didn't refresh it in the browser settings? May the browser use some cookies, service files or something like that for authorization despite unactual password saved? If yes, then how is it possible to extract the true password out of those files? </p><p>I turned to the mail service support, but they can't help me, because I didn't enter my real name, phone number or something during registration that could help to check my identity. So the only opportunity to save my mail is to use the browser files somehow. I'm going to reinstall Windows and I will loose access to my mail forever in this case that would be very very bad..
