Few hours later - Firefox notifies me a newer version is released and i need to update my browser. </p><p>Not too long after, Firefox is downgraded to 87 by itself and I repeat the same process over and over again. </p><p>I tried: </p> <ul><li> Full uninstall / clean re-install </li><li> Deleting all profiles and all Mozilla folders and reinstalling </li><li> Some fix that's supposed to allow me to use my ver.88 profile on ver.87 </li></ul> <p>Something is making Firefox downgrade to 87 by itself - This happens while I am browsing/using Firefox and causes all connections to drop and the browser to Crash soon after. </p><p>Any thoughts? </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",anthonychrabieh
