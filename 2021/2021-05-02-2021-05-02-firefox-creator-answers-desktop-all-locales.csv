I use a free, web-based animation software called Wick Editor, and occasionally I need to insert special characters into my text, to do this, I use the Windows+. shortcut to pull up the emoticon/spec char list. Whenever i click a symbol to enter it, all textboxes in the browser just stop accepting input. Key presses are still picked up, as I can interact with pages. The search bar and any textbox in general just don't respond, though this is fixed with a browser restart. I've tried using characters such as the TM symbol and accent letters, yet all of them freeze text boxes. </p><p>Thanks! -Jumbleton </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jsic1027

Llevo tiempo con un problema que no soy capaz de resolver y es que en cualquier pestaña abierta, si pulso cualquier tecla en el telado, me aparece automaticamente una pestaña en la parte inferior de la pantalla y debo esperar un par de segundos hasta que desaparezca para poder escribir, pero vuelve a salir otra vez y así indefinidamente. Decir que por ejemplo en foros cuando escribo no me aparece y puedo escribir perfectamente. A la derecha del recuadro que aparece en esa pestaña en la parte izquierda y fuera de este aparece en la primera pulsación: ""12 de 320"" aciertos, lo pongo entre comillas porque esos números varian cada vez y en cada pestaña y cuando pulso mas de 1 tecla el recuadro de texto se vuelve rojo. Pensaba que era un virus, pero he compraobado el HD y parece correcto. Lo curioso es que desinstalé Firefox y al volverlo a instalar y antes de iniciar mi usuario no salía, pero al loguearme, me volvió a aparecer este castigo.

I don't have that problem with videos, just with livestreams and my PC is not bad, my CPU, RAM or GPU are not even close to their limit as far as I can tell. Still, it doesn't work in Firefox but it does in Microsoft Edge. I definitely prefer Firefox over Edge but right now I have to use Edge to watch streams in HD+. I already came across a solution from 2019 where it said I need to install an addon, which would fix the problem but limits the quality to 1080p (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/de/questions/1245735"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/de/questions/1245735</a>). However I thought maybe two years later there is a solution that allows me to watch streams in 2K and I mean Edge makes it possible too so I figured I'd just ask. </p><p>Thanks for your time Noah </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,websites,en-US,1410277;,staubigerkaktus

I can't understand how it is possible. The browser should use one of the saved passwords for the authorization, right? Why doesn't it work outside this very browser?  </p><p>MAYBE one day I changed the password in the mail service, logged in, BUT didn't refresh it in the browser settings? May the browser use some cookies, service files or something like that for authorization despite unactual password saved? If yes, then how is it possible to extract the true password out of those files? </p><p>I turned to the mail service support, but they can't help me, because I didn't enter my real name, phone number or something during registration that could help to check my identity.
