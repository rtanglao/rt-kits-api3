Which guy modified the original design for the new version of Firefox bookmarks? Is there something wrong with that man's brain? Is the spacing of the new bookmark item too large to read?

In the past both processes have worked with no problems. Windows 8.1, latest FireFox. </p><p>First: Bookmarks Backup  Bookmarks tab Show all bookmarks Library opens Import and Backup Backup Bookmarks backup filename window opens pick destination folder - Desktop File name box: bookmarks-2021-06-10.json  Save </p><p>Only there isn't a file saved on my Desktop. And it's not my computer messing up. I took a snapshot of the Library Bookmarks backup filename window and saved it to the desktop and it worked fine. I thought maybe if I used File Explorer it could find the file bookmarks-2021-06-10.json. It did, but it's still not on the Desktop where I could save it to an external hard drive for a Backup. See attached files. </p><p>Second: Bookmarks delete files/folders. I can move files and folders around, just deleting or removing them is a problem. </p><p>Method A. Bookmarks tab right click on link or folder I want to delete click Remove Bookmark nothing happens  </p><p>or Method B.  Bookmarks tab Show all Bookmarks Library window opens right click on file/folder want to delete Drop down menu, click Remove Bookmark </p><p>or Method C. Bookmarks tab Show all Bookmarks Library window opens choose file to delete Organize drop down menu, click Delete </p><p>This is where it gets confusing. For methods B and C sometimes it will delete, sometimes not. Thinking about it, mostly not. I don<em>t know why the difference, I don't think I did anything different to delete one but not the other. </em> </p><p>When I open the Bookmarks tab again, I can't tell if the list is the same or not. I don't think it's changed. </p><p>I worked really hard on this and then I messed up and lost everything I'd done. So, I started all over, but I don't know if this is as accurate as the first. I hope so. </p><p>Please, I'm an old lady simple answers in plain English are always appreciated. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-81;firefox-890;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1420379;,BernadineAD

I cannot get any videos to play in Mozilla anymore. Youtube doesn't work, Tumblr videos don't work, Twitch videos don't work, even the Tenor gifs on Discord won't show.  </p><p>Yes, I have cleared my entire history of cache and cookies for all of these websites, and it does not fix the problem.  </p><p>Nothing will play. I hate this. Please, Mozilla, fix this so I can go back to using the browser I actually prefer.  </p><p>If anyone else is experiencing this, or has found a solution, please let me know. </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;firefox-890;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",jamaecla

I want to migrate all of the Firefox data from the old one to the new one.  I have copied the Profile from C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles to a thumb drive.  I believe this to be all that I need to move to the new machine.  The problem is that I don't know where to put it on the new machine. </p><p>I understand that Firefox must be closed when I modify the new machine.  I also discovered that there is a Profile.ini file that has a pointer to the filename that Firefox will use when it is opened.  Do I have to modify this file as well? </p><p>Perhaps I am on the wrong track and need to be redirected.  If so, please point me to an article or wiki that will put me on the right one. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,1420367;1420371;,rabbithutch1

That's extremely irritating because I do not like Amazon and do not wish to search there.  I've done an hour of research, and everyone has ideas to which my Firefox browser is impervious.  I don't understand why a nonprofit is rerouting me to Amazon and I'm now looking for an alternative browser. </p><p>I've read that this has something to do with my ""top 8 sites' -- but that hasn't helped solve the problem.  other people tell me to type in about: config and that doesn't help.  Others say to remopve Amazon from your search engine list: I have done so  and it doesn't not fix the problem. </p><p>Is there any easy way to get rid of this rerouting behavior for my navigation bar searches?  I've read answers to this question on this forum, and none of them have helped so far. </p><p>I don't know why Firefox decided to emulate malware behavior in their browser.  If they're going to set up such an extremely irritating feature, they could at least set up a super-obvious way to disengage it -- like ""CLICK HERE TO STOP BEING REROUTED TO COMMERCIAL SITES."" Instead, I have to search and search -- and even things that ""work"" only work for certain browser iterations. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,"",b98765
