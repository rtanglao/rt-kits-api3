Plus I'm not sure if it's going to sync to ""last updated"" which is actually the other (destination) laptop with FF v52.  </p><p>In my profile I see bookmarks clearly, but no history. They are both in places.sqlite? Should I just copy this? What else would be copied? </p><p>By the way, in bookmarkbackups folder, I see the last jsonlz4 file is from June 9 12:10 am, not June 10 12:10 am as it should have been perhaps.

And it's not my computer messing up. I took a snapshot of the Library Bookmarks backup filename window and saved it to the desktop and it worked fine. I thought maybe if I used File Explorer it could find the file bookmarks-2021-06-10.json. It did, but it's still not on the Desktop where I could save it to an external hard drive for a Backup. See attached files. </p><p>Second: Bookmarks delete files/folders. I can move files and folders around, just deleting or removing them is a problem. </p><p>Method A. Bookmarks tab right click on link or folder I want to delete click Remove Bookmark nothing happens  </p><p>or Method B.  Bookmarks tab Show all Bookmarks Library window opens right click on file/folder want to delete Drop down menu, click Remove Bookmark </p><p>or Method C. Bookmarks tab Show all Bookmarks Library window opens choose file to delete Organize drop down menu, click Delete </p><p>This is where it gets confusing. For methods B and C sometimes it will delete, sometimes not. Thinking about it, mostly not. I don<em>t know why the difference, I don't think I did anything different to delete one but not the other. </em> </p><p>When I open the Bookmarks tab again, I can't tell if the list is the same or not. I don't think it's changed. </p><p>I worked really hard on this and then I messed up and lost everything I'd done. So, I started all over, but I don't know if this is as accurate as the first. I hope so. </p><p>Please, I'm an old lady simple answers in plain English are always appreciated. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-81;firefox-890;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1420379;,BernadineAD

Others say to remopve Amazon from your search engine list: I have done so  and it doesn't not fix the problem. </p><p>Is there any easy way to get rid of this rerouting behavior for my navigation bar searches?  I've read answers to this question on this forum, and none of them have helped so far. </p><p>I don't know why Firefox decided to emulate malware behavior in their browser.  If they're going to set up such an extremely irritating feature, they could at least set up a super-obvious way to disengage it -- like ""CLICK HERE TO STOP BEING REROUTED TO COMMERCIAL SITES.""
