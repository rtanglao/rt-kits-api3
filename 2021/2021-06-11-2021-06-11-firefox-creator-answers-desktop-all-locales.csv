That's extremely irritating because I do not like Amazon and do not wish to search there.  I've done an hour of research, and everyone has ideas to which my Firefox browser is impervious.  I don't understand why a nonprofit is rerouting me to Amazon and I'm now looking for an alternative browser. </p><p>I've read that this has something to do with my ""top 8 sites' -- but that hasn't helped solve the problem.  other people tell me to type in about: config and that doesn't help.  Others say to remopve Amazon from your search engine list: I have done so  and it doesn't not fix the problem. </p><p>Is there any easy way to get rid of this rerouting behavior for my navigation bar searches?  I've read answers to this question on this forum, and none of them have helped so far. </p><p>I don't know why Firefox decided to emulate malware behavior in their browser.  If they're going to set up such an extremely irritating feature, they could at least set up a super-obvious way to disengage it -- like ""CLICK HERE TO STOP BEING REROUTED TO COMMERCIAL SITES."" Instead, I have to search and search -- and even things that ""work"" only work for certain browser iterations. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,other,en-US,"",b98765

Now I have to scroll quite a bit to see all the options. See attached picture. Anyone know how to fix this? This is very annoying... </p>,desktop;customize;escalate;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,customize,en-US,1420358;1420362;,bridgetsuing
