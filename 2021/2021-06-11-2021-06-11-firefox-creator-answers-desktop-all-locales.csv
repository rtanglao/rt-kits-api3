I know the search bar and URL are combined no matter what at this point, but the issue is that if I type any letter; it suggests a website that I have never visited, bookmarked, searched, etc. </p><p>Please see the screen shot I have attached. In this example, I typed the letter ""y"", although it can be done with any other letter, and an unwarranted site will pre-populate. I am assuming this is Mozilla is promoting/sponsoring certain websites when you start typing any letter, which I don't want a part of. </p><p>It can't be DuckDuckGo causing this (the search engine of this user's choice), because changing the Firefox settings from URL to Search bar only doesn't make this issue stop. Not sure what I can do to prevent unsolicited sites from showing up when I am typing into the URL field. </p><p>To replicate, you can start typing any letter into the URL/Search bar field and the first result directly underneath is a ""random"" website suggestion. </p><p>This is why I assume it is coming from Mozilla (not DuckDuckGo), because before the recent updates, there was never this issue. It is great that you guys want to promote your favorite sites, but from the user's end: it is forced upon us; which is not supposed to be Firefox-like. </p><p>I don't read the blogs and articles about Mozilla's vision, so perhaps this is a new feature and it works as expected; however, there should be an opt-out so that users can just search for a website name without a favored suggestion appearing directly below. </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-890;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",bestusernameever
