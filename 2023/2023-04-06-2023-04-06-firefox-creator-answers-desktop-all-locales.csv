The only change I remembered doing was installing the add-on ""Dark Reader"" the previous night. Then on April 5, 2023 when I tried to sign on to KP by clicking the ""Sign In"" hyperlink on the home page, the sign in prompt or web script/page never loads; it just gets stuck with the ""Loading"" text and spinning wheel in the middle of the screen ""<a href=""https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/consumer-sign-on"" rel=""nofollow"">https://healthy.kaiserpermanente.org/consumer-sign-on</a>"". </p><p>I found a similar issue on Mozilla Support and followed many of the troubleshooting guides and solutions, but to no avail. Here are the things I did per this link ""<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1199184"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1199184</a>"" and other guides: </p><pre>   -Updated video card    -Fire Fox Safe mode    -Disabled, removed add-on extensions, disabled hardware acceleration, disabled java script, default themes    -Restored Fire Fox    -Disabled VPN </pre> <p>I accessed the same healthcare website on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge on the same PC, and it successfully loaded the ""Sign In"" screen. I also logged into two additional laptops and installed Fire Fox brand new got the same negative results. </p><p>I was able to successfully get to the ""sign in"" page using IOS (iphone) Fire Fox app.  So, at this point I figured it might just be a Windows Fire Fox problem for this specific website. </p><p>Please see if you can also replicate this issue, or offer any other solution ideas. I've attached two pictures; one is the stuck on loading, and the other is the sign in page that should have loaded.
