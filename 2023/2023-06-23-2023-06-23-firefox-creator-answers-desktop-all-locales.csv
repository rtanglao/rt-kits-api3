I recently switched OS from Windows to Debian, and at the same time I also switched browsers from Google Chrome to Firefox. Everything works great except for video playback. </p><p>When playing most videos, the audio will continue but the video will freeze when I skip backwards, both in regular and fullscreen mode. Skipping forward does not seem to cause an issue. This occurs on every video I’ve tested, except for WEBM videos and YouTube which both play flawlessly.  </p><p>From a quick Google search, it seems that YouTube uses a different format called VP9 which my browser seems to handle perfectly. When I try to play videos from my local Jellyfin server in H264 or H265 formats, the issue occurs. The same thing happens to internet videos such as in the Reddit video player. </p><p>I have tried to play the same videos in Chromium and never have this issue, with or without hardware acceleration enabled. Every single video I’ve tried plays perfectly in Chromium, and I have zero issues playing video files in media players such as VLC. </p><p>I am using Debian 12 with Firefox 114.0.2 installed from Flatpak. My desktop environment is KDE Plasma 5.27.5 and I am using Wayland, with Wayland mode enabled (by adding “<em>MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1</em>” as an environment variable). I also tried using Firefox before I enabled Wayland mode, so that Firefox was in “Xwayland mode” but I had the same issue before. I have also tried to use XFCE desktop environment with Firefox in X11 mode but, again, same issue. </p><p>My GPU is Nvidia GEForce GTX 1660 and I am using the latest available version of Nvidia’s proprietary drivers (525.105.17) which have been working very well for gaming and hosting a Jellyfin server. </p><p>The option to enable hardware acceleration was not present in my regular Firefox settings menu but I followed a guide and changed some settings in about:config, thinking that this was going to fix my playback issue. The following settings have been changed: </p><p>media.hardware-video-decoding.force-enabled &gt; true gfx.webrender.all &gt; true media.ffmpeg.vaapi.enabled &gt; true </p><p>The playback issue is present with or without these settings changed, however. In the graphics section in the about:support page I can see that “Compositing:” shows “WebRender”, which I believe means that hardware acceleration is enabled and working. </p><p>I am happy to provide more information if needed. I have spent many hours searching for a solution, but since I’m quite new to both Linux and Firefox I’m not entirely sure what to even search for.  </p><p>Thank you for reading. </p><p><br> TL;DR: Issue: Skipping backwards in video causes video to freeze while audio continues.

I was wrong, I've been facing this error for all the 10 different codes: <strong>Backup authentication code not found</strong> </p><p>I only have one Firefox account with 2FA, so I'm 100% confident this is the right account. I checked the email associated with the locked out Firefox account and I can see the email mentioning that I activated 2FA on 10 October 2021, and there are no emails beyond that regarding my 2FA. </p><p>Again, this is not a mistake on my end - the codes simply do not work. I've tried in different browsers. I have tried to get in contact with anyone for two weeks now, and I urgently need to upload an update to my app. </p><p>Can someone point me in the right direction? I've reached out by Twitter as well - but no reply. </p><p>Help really appreciated, Tomas </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;,firefox,other,en-US,"",tompatomp

There was a website that I visited very frequently over the last 1-2 years, that I do not need to visit pretty much ever again, it's at the very top of the suggestions every time I click the address bar even though I haven't visitted the website in months. There are other websites in there that I don't want, even if I do still visit them, I don't necessarily want or need them to be suggested. The only way I have found is to go into my history, search the domain name, and delete all traces of the website from my all-time history. This worked for the first website I mentioned, but I don't want to have to delete my history for each website I don't want in my suggestions. Long-term history can be extremely useful. Plus it's just a super janky way of doing something very basic that should be as simple as ""Right click &gt; Delete suggestion"", especially as that already exists for <em>search</em> suggestions. Is there an obscure or hidden way of doing this that I may be missing? </p><p>When I found the shift+del method and the ""..."" method I spent a good 10 minutes not understanding why it wasn't working, thinking my FF was outdated as apparently these were added in version 113, but I am on 114 so that didn't make sense. It was only after a while that I discovered that search suggestions are apparently handled separately from the default suggestions shown when you simply click on the address bar. This doesn't seem all that streamlined, so I guess as a bonus feature suggestion: make it so that the same method applies to both types of suggestions? I assume feature suggestions don't go here so I might make an actual suggestion later... </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,other,en-US,1586835;,deorgegowns
