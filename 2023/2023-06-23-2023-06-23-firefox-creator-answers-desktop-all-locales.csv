It's there a way to turn that off? Because I couldn't find it. </p><p>And to be clear, it doesn't close my sessions when I ""close"" the Firefox tab, it's when I exit the application as a whole.  </p><p>And yes, when there IS an issue and Firefox closes itself, Firefox does open my old tabs again, which is great, but the logging out thing? not so much, since I use authentication apps too. </p><p>Sorry for the English!

I recently switched OS from Windows to Debian, and at the same time I also switched browsers from Google Chrome to Firefox. Everything works great except for video playback. </p><p>When playing most videos, the audio will continue but the video will freeze when I skip backwards, both in regular and fullscreen mode. Skipping forward does not seem to cause an issue. This occurs on every video I’ve tested, except for WEBM videos and YouTube which both play flawlessly.  </p><p>From a quick Google search, it seems that YouTube uses a different format called VP9 which my browser seems to handle perfectly. When I try to play videos from my local Jellyfin server in H264 or H265 formats, the issue occurs. The same thing happens to internet videos such as in the Reddit video player. </p><p>I have tried to play the same videos in Chromium and never have this issue, with or without hardware acceleration enabled. Every single video I’ve tried plays perfectly in Chromium, and I have zero issues playing video files in media players such as VLC. </p><p>I am using Debian 12 with Firefox 114.0.2 installed from Flatpak. My desktop environment is KDE Plasma 5.27.5 and I am using Wayland, with Wayland mode enabled (by adding “<em>MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=1</em>” as an environment variable). I also tried using Firefox before I enabled Wayland mode, so that Firefox was in “Xwayland mode” but I had the same issue before. I have also tried to use XFCE desktop environment with Firefox in X11 mode but, again, same issue. </p><p>My GPU is Nvidia GEForce GTX 1660 and I am using the latest available version of Nvidia’s proprietary drivers (525.105.17) which have been working very well for gaming and hosting a Jellyfin server. </p><p>The option to enable hardware acceleration was not present in my regular Firefox settings menu but I followed a guide and changed some settings in about:config, thinking that this was going to fix my playback issue. The following settings have been changed: </p><p>media.hardware-video-decoding.force-enabled &gt; true gfx.webrender.all &gt; true media.ffmpeg.vaapi.enabled &gt; true </p><p>The playback issue is present with or without these settings changed, however. In the graphics section in the about:support page I can see that “Compositing:” shows “WebRender”, which I believe means that hardware acceleration is enabled and working. </p><p>I am happy to provide more information if needed. I have spent many hours searching for a solution, but since I’m quite new to both Linux and Firefox I’m not entirely sure what to even search for.  </p><p>Thank you for reading. </p><p><br> TL;DR: Issue: Skipping backwards in video causes video to freeze while audio continues.

Strangely it's back ""close"" to normal except I was using Passbrow which the icon shows on toolbar but greyed out &amp; I can't get it to turn back on. I have the ""Old FF Data"" folder but following the steps it doesn't show where profile is stored for me to be able to copy the old data TO. IF I can restore the old profile hopefully that would get it back working ALL as it was...but HOW?? </p>",windows-7;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1586810;1586818;,piikea
