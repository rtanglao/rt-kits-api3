There was a website that I visited very frequently over the last 1-2 years, that I do not need to visit pretty much ever again, it's at the very top of the suggestions every time I click the address bar even though I haven't visitted the website in months. There are other websites in there that I don't want, even if I do still visit them, I don't necessarily want or need them to be suggested. The only way I have found is to go into my history, search the domain name, and delete all traces of the website from my all-time history. This worked for the first website I mentioned, but I don't want to have to delete my history for each website I don't want in my suggestions. Long-term history can be extremely useful. Plus it's just a super janky way of doing something very basic that should be as simple as ""Right click &gt; Delete suggestion"", especially as that already exists for <em>search</em> suggestions. Is there an obscure or hidden way of doing this that I may be missing? </p><p>When I found the shift+del method and the ""..."" method I spent a good 10 minutes not understanding why it wasn't working, thinking my FF was outdated as apparently these were added in version 113, but I am on 114 so that didn't make sense. It was only after a while that I discovered that search suggestions are apparently handled separately from the default suggestions shown when you simply click on the address bar. This doesn't seem all that streamlined, so I guess as a bonus feature suggestion: make it so that the same method applies to both types of suggestions? I assume feature suggestions don't go here so I might make an actual suggestion later... </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",deorgegowns

When I download a file, or print a page to a PDF, the dialog box to save it comes up fine...but when I hit ENTER to actually save the file, it highlights the text (name of the file) and doesn't save. I have to manually reach for my mouse and click the ""Save"" button on the dialog box (which works fine). Is there any way to fix this? BTW...I'm running Windows 11 (the most updated version) and my machine is a Lenovo Legion 5. My Firefox browser is also up-to-date.

Strangely it's back ""close"" to normal except I was using Passbrow which the icon shows on toolbar but greyed out &amp; I can't get it to turn back on. I have the ""Old FF Data"" folder but following the steps it doesn't show where profile is stored for me to be able to copy the old data TO.
