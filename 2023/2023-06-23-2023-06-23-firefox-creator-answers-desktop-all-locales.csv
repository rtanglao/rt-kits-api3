Az előző frissítékor pedig a messenger üzeneteket nem tudta kezelni, az néhány nap múlva érkező frissítéssel megoldódott. De meglehetősen bosszantó, hogy az utóbbi időben egyre több probléma adódik a frissítések után. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,fix-problems,hu,"",l.kovacs.andrea

I've been using FF and Yahoo for years and have never had a problem until this AM. I saw some of the posts about users having the same issue a few years ago. I cleared the cache which did help for a while. I'm not having this problem with Edge or Chrome. Any suggestions?

I was wrong, I've been facing this error for all the 10 different codes: <strong>Backup authentication code not found</strong> </p><p>I only have one Firefox account with 2FA, so I'm 100% confident this is the right account. I checked the email associated with the locked out Firefox account and I can see the email mentioning that I activated 2FA on 10 October 2021, and there are no emails beyond that regarding my 2FA. </p><p>Again, this is not a mistake on my end - the codes simply do not work. I've tried in different browsers. I have tried to get in contact with anyone for two weeks now, and I urgently need to upload an update to my app. </p><p>Can someone point me in the right direction? I've reached out by Twitter as well - but no reply. </p><p>Help really appreciated, Tomas </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;,firefox,other,en-US,"",tompatomp

There was a website that I visited very frequently over the last 1-2 years, that I do not need to visit pretty much ever again, it's at the very top of the suggestions every time I click the address bar even though I haven't visitted the website in months. There are other websites in there that I don't want, even if I do still visit them, I don't necessarily want or need them to be suggested. The only way I have found is to go into my history, search the domain name, and delete all traces of the website from my all-time history. This worked for the first website I mentioned, but I don't want to have to delete my history for each website I don't want in my suggestions. Long-term history can be extremely useful. Plus it's just a super janky way of doing something very basic that should be as simple as ""Right click &gt; Delete suggestion"", especially as that already exists for <em>search</em> suggestions. Is there an obscure or hidden way of doing this that I may be missing? </p><p>When I found the shift+del method and the ""..."" method I spent a good 10 minutes not understanding why it wasn't working, thinking my FF was outdated as apparently these were added in version 113, but I am on 114 so that didn't make sense. It was only after a while that I discovered that search suggestions are apparently handled separately from the default suggestions shown when you simply click on the address bar. This doesn't seem all that streamlined, so I guess as a bonus feature suggestion: make it so that the same method applies to both types of suggestions? I assume feature suggestions don't go here so I might make an actual suggestion later... </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,other,en-US,1586835;,deorgegowns
