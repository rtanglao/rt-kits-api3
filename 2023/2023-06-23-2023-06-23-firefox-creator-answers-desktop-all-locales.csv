In recent years I have experienced non-obvious problems where the browser either will not obey a command, or produces an unreasonable response which is not easy to spot. Latest example: I am trying to fill in a contact form, and when I try and submit, the form displays ""Enter a number"".  This is normal for a contact form if you have missed something, but in this case, there is no field for a 'number'. I try re entering various things. I try their chatbot. I am just about to phone when I think 'try another browser.'  I try another browser. It works straight away. This happens too often now, about once every couple of months. Occasionally rebooting helps, but usually it doesn't. OS is Windows 10 on a desktop.  I do tend to keep a lot of tabs open, but I always have.  I don't actually want to change my browser. Any advice appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",GreenGreat

There was a website that I visited very frequently over the last 1-2 years, that I do not need to visit pretty much ever again, it's at the very top of the suggestions every time I click the address bar even though I haven't visitted the website in months. There are other websites in there that I don't want, even if I do still visit them, I don't necessarily want or need them to be suggested. The only way I have found is to go into my history, search the domain name, and delete all traces of the website from my all-time history. This worked for the first website I mentioned, but I don't want to have to delete my history for each website I don't want in my suggestions. Long-term history can be extremely useful. Plus it's just a super janky way of doing something very basic that should be as simple as ""Right click &gt; Delete suggestion"", especially as that already exists for <em>search</em> suggestions. Is there an obscure or hidden way of doing this that I may be missing? </p><p>When I found the shift+del method and the ""..."" method I spent a good 10 minutes not understanding why it wasn't working, thinking my FF was outdated as apparently these were added in version 113, but I am on 114 so that didn't make sense. It was only after a while that I discovered that search suggestions are apparently handled separately from the default suggestions shown when you simply click on the address bar. This doesn't seem all that streamlined, so I guess as a bonus feature suggestion: make it so that the same method applies to both types of suggestions? I assume feature suggestions don't go here so I might make an actual suggestion later... </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,other,en-US,1586835;,deorgegowns
