Holding down Shift+Delete doesn't do anything anymore unless I'm lucky and it'll delete one or two of the urls I choose but most of the time nothing happens at all!  I never liked having to hold 2 buttons when pressing one worked just fine in the past but I dealt with it and I shouldn't have to open my whole history each time when doing it from a normal window should work.  I don't like deleting my whole history and much rather pick and choose which ones to get rid of like let's plays with lots of parts. </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",hylian_dragon_warrior
