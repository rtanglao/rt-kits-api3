None of these have stopped Firefox restarting itself: </p><p>On the Settings page: Select “Check for updates but let you choose to install them” Disable “Use a background service to install updates” </p><p>Since the above didn’t stop the Firefox restarts, I tried: Select “Automatically install updates (recommended)” 	with “When Firefox is not running” </p><p>In 'about:config'&nbsp;: Set 'app.update.auto', to FALSE.
