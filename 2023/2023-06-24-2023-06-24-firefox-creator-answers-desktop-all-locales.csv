It doesn't try to open the launcher, a pop up just appears saying ""You're moments away from the fun!"" or whatever and prompts me to download the launcher even though I already have it. I've tried resetting my cookies and configuring my preferences but nothing's helped. I don't know if this is because of a recent update or because of something I'm doing. Roblox works just fine when I open the launcher by itself or on different browsers. Is there anything I can do to fix this? </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",stxrryboo

Whereas,  traditional 'restore previous session' option opened most recently opened tab and site, and disregarded  all other open tabs and browsers.  Whereas, tabs and browsers I wish to open are still on Desktop, although Mozilla will not re-open them as they were (ie. will not re-assemble same order), instead Mozilla tried  generating all tabs on one browser and then froze/crashed tyring to re-open all previously open tabs  on one broser. </p><p>If you can, please assist with a step-by-step instructional - which instructs me on how to re-open all previous tabs which pre-date most recent preceding session (ie. disregard most recent preceding session) and re-open all other tabs which pre-dated most recent preceding session: as respective Desktop PC related-work was un-finished, and so that I might be able to continue at respective Desktop PC related-work.   </p><p>Thank you.

Holding down Shift+Delete doesn't do anything anymore unless I'm lucky and it'll delete one or two of the urls I choose but most of the time nothing happens at all!  I never liked having to hold 2 buttons when pressing one worked just fine in the past but I dealt with it and I shouldn't have to open my whole history each time when doing it from a normal window should work.  I don't like deleting my whole history and much rather pick and choose which ones to get rid of like let's plays with lots of parts. </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",hylian_dragon_warrior
