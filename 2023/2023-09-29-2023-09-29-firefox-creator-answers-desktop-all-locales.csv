On a sigle host (Windows 10, FF v. 118.01 but the issue was present also on previous versions) after every automatic FF update history, cache, cookies and accesses are cleared, which force me to login in again everywhere; also some extensions are affected (Bitwarden). This behaviour is manifesting only on a single device of mine, on every other after FF update accesses etc. are kept. I tried to look around in settings but I didn't find anything related. Have somebody experienced the same problem? Is there any settings (maybe properties under about:config) that can change this behaviour? </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,other,en-US,"",covert.ops.sec31
