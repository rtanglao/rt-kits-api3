So I copy something from the web, then use shift+insert in my terminal because I'm used to that now, and I paste the wrong thing in. And I highlight something in my terminal, switch to Firefox and use shift+insert to paste it, and it pastes the last thing I ctrl+c'd. </p><p>If shift+insert did nothing in Firefox then I'd get used to it, but the switching back and forth is something I stub my toe on every day.
