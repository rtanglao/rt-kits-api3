So I copy something from the web, then use shift+insert in my terminal because I'm used to that now, and I paste the wrong thing in. And I highlight something in my terminal, switch to Firefox and use shift+insert to paste it, and it pastes the last thing I ctrl+c'd. </p><p>If shift+insert did nothing in Firefox then I'd get used to it, but the switching back and forth is something I stub my toe on every day. Does nobody else feel this pain? Please fix it! </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,other,en-US,1606808;,garethdavidson

When I open the same PDF in Firefox, however, the screen reader is evidently unable to recognise the presence of alt text; therefore it remains silent when it reaches an image - it's as if there's no alt text to be read. </p><p>Can you please clarify: is there a way for me to configure Firefox (either in the settings or in about:config) so that alt text in PDFs will be recognised by screen readers? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,customize,en-US,1606806;,david.zilko

Every time I turn my computer on and open my browser and try to log into youtube, I have to log in again. I can save my password for the site but it behaves every time as if it's my first time logging in. This hasn't happened in other browsers so im unsure if it's possibly google account settings. That's why it was my first assumption it was with firefox. so far other logins work fine for me.
