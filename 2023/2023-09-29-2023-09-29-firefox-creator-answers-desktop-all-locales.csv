I have numerous tasks which require the use of my web browser and have allocated a different virtual desktop for each.  This means that my browser session typically has several dozen tabs open in numerous windows at one time.  Under normal circumstances, this works just fine (and is a testament to the engineering that has gone into this browser). </p><p>My issue is that Firefox renders my machine virtually unusable for a few minutes each time I restart my desktop session due to focus stealing.  When I open the browser, several dozen windows pop up (as expected) and relocate to their correct virtual desktops (as expected); however, as the windows begin to load, the most recently active Firefox window steals focus repeatedly.  If I am, for instance, in the process of typing my password into my desktop e-mail client, a Firefox window may steal focus from the password dialog.  In practice, this focus steal happens once every few seconds for several minutes. </p><p>I would prefer that Firefox would not steal focus while restoring a session.

On a sigle host (Windows 10, FF v. 118.01 but the issue was present also on previous versions) after every automatic FF update history, cache, cookies and accesses are cleared, which force me to login in again everywhere; also some extensions are affected (Bitwarden). This behaviour is manifesting only on a single device of mine, on every other after FF update accesses etc. are kept. I tried to look around in settings but I didn't find anything related. Have somebody experienced the same problem?
