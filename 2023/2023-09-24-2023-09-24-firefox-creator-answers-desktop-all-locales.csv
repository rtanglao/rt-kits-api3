I have a hard time finding monitors which meet my accessibility needs, so a square/squarer monitor or a 2nd monitor would be expensive. </p><p>I have tried setting it up in vertical mode, to make it easier to read pdfs and to write. And ideally, to make it easier to avoid sidebars and/or move them away above the main content where they're less likely to trigger as many @##$% migraines. </p><p>I've noticed that most websites are designed for the horizontal layout. Elements disappear off the right edge, sometims with a horizontal scrollbar to reach them, sometimes without. Is there a trick to get miost or all websites to fit? </p><p>I use about:config fixes, add-ons, and user css to try to increase font sizes, switch colors, block animation, and reduce frame rates to completely block ""smooth"" animation. I can't do without these, so I don't think I could adapt the mobile version to my needs. </p><p>I've noticed *many* other problems in other apps, but if I can get all these websites working in Firefox, I can probably sort out the other problems elsewhere. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1014;website-breakages;firefox-1152;firefox-11521;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",MarjaE
