Youtube works fine, but other websites do not.  I have tried every step you can imagine.  I've disabled hardware acceleration, I've made sure autoplay is on, I've disabled add ons, I've refreshed firefox, I've uninstalled and reinstalled, I've updated firefox, I've cleared cache.  I'm all out of things to try. </p><p>I need some help on what to do. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1110;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",addeutsch51

When I return to the tab it will begin loading only then, like the tab was suspended in time until it was active on one of my monitors again. This also happens when my session dies in the 5 or so minutes time to live. The logout doesn't actually render/reload the page until I switch back to it's tab. </p><p>I can surmise this is some type of either security measure or bandwidth saving tactic, but I'd like to know if there are ways to fool whatever scripts it's using to check if the user has the tab active or not, and make such tabs always load successfully even when not active or in focus. </p><p>Any known settings flags or addons to assist here? Even weird ones like loading the page to the sidebar or something? </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1110;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1573877;,insevin7
