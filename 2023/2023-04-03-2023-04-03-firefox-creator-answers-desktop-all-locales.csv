I got the security warning shown here. I had many conversations with my ISP's tech, who couldn't figure out what was going on. At the same time I was finding that one or two other websites were not working properly. I finally tracked down the cause to the DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials extension. When this was disabled, all the problems went away. Everything seemed fine until yesterday, when we had a brief power outage that caused my PC to restart while FF was in use. After this, when I started Firefox, I found that once again I was getting the security warning when I tried to open the webmail page (though none of problems I previously experienced with the other websites). The DDG extension is still disabled. I have of course tried deleting the cache with no effect, and this time I have even gone so far as to refresh FF, and finally uninstalled it and reinstalled it - TWICE. Nothing helps! I now suspect that this is being caused by something that remains in the registry, even after uninstalling and reinstalling. However, as I am not experienced with making changes to the registry and wouldn't know how to start, I need help with this. Could somebody please advise me as to what I should do? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,other,en-US,"",gibarrow

However trying to track this down in Firefox' own Task Manager typically doesn't work because when I open it it will quickly represent the huge resource usage (for example 7GB RAM) at the top but then it will instantly normalize. So opening the Firefox Task Manager actually seems to trigger an instant stop on the resource frenzy. </p><p>My assumption is that the problems are either caused by Firefox Multi-Account Containers or by Keeper Password Manager or by the combination of those two.  However I'd need some help on how to track the exact culprit down.

When I return to the tab it will begin loading only then, like the tab was suspended in time until it was active on one of my monitors again. This also happens when my session dies in the 5 or so minutes time to live. The logout doesn't actually render/reload the page until I switch back to it's tab. </p><p>I can surmise this is some type of either security measure or bandwidth saving tactic, but I'd like to know if there are ways to fool whatever scripts it's using to check if the user has the tab active or not, and make such tabs always load successfully even when not active or in focus. </p><p>Any known settings flags or addons to assist here?
