This is no longer the behavior as of a couple updates ago, without me changing my settings.  </p><p>What happens now is the recovery never shows up, so all I have is the all-or-nothing option where you recover the whole session at once from history. No option there to pick what to recover.  How do I get the old behavior back? I relied on this to prune sessions when I ended up with too many tabs. </p><p>Latest firefox 117.0.1 (64-bit)  on windows 10 </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",rifter
