How does someone get ACCOUNT HELP?  I'll pay for the blasted help if just to get my emails out of FIREFOX? Such BAD customer service -- oh yeah, we aren't CUSTOMERS cause Firefox is FREE.  Right now that is EXACTLY WHAT FIREFOX and MOZILLA are worth -- NOTHING, NADA, ZERO, TRASH!  And now it will cost me $$$$$ to get my computer completely reset to eliminate ALL TRACES OF FIREFOX!!! </p><p>GET ME OUT OF THIS CRAZY SCREWED UP MESS&gt;!!

I cannot access it because the account has the WRONG EMAIL address mixed up with the WRONG PASSWORDS.   The account MESS is preventing me from using SYNC creating my emails USELESS!!!   There must be someone, somewhere, who can tell me how to get specific help with MY FIREFOX ACCOUNT.   It is messed up so badly I am going have to throw this computer out and start all over -- but then I have to use either some bogus email address that I DO NOT WANT TO USE.  My accounts were set up decades ago -- very soon after FIREFOX was offered.  BUT JUST BECAUSE WE ARE OLD, ACCOUNTS ARE OLD, WHY does Firefox IGNORE problems with BASIC ACCOUNT PROBLEMS! I HATE THIS I HATE THIS I HATE THIS I HATE THIS!  FIREFOX SUCKS!!!!!!!  no such thing as support.  When I attempted to ask ""How to contact Firefox ACCOUNT HELP"", the stupid answer was older than my car, my house, but I am older than dirt so it was NOT that old.   STUPID STUPID STUPID.  I will get rid of ALL GOOGLE, MOZILLA, AND NORTON cause you all have NO RESPECT for your users -- not customers cause we are NOT CONSIDERED SUCH -- FIREFOX IS FREE. Hahaha    Dr T. H. REESE, Denver CO  15 yrs as a COMPUTER SYSTEMS CONSULTANT and I must make amends to all MY CLIENTS to whom I recommended FIREFOX!      YOU ARE SO BAD!&nbsp;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,other,en-US,"",familycat2

I thought I was selecting an update, but I got a Second version of Firefox. After backing up bookmarks, I deleted all of them and put another ""new"" version 64 bit. The website/search bar used to be on the menu Bar which I keep open all the time. These were at the top of the window. I also had a search bar at top, all the way to the right as facing it. NOW I can't seem to get the website input off the Bookmark toolbar and up to the top. I was able to get the separate search input box? What am I overlooking and I am think there is something easy I am missing. Pictures or a description of steps is helpful; I can't find a solution. MOZILLA didn't restrict placing this website box on the top menu bar, did they? </p><p>Thanks. Picture of browser is attached.  </p><p>matthew </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,customize,en-US,1573196;,MSKHawaii
