However, once I return to the U.S. the autofill menu has disappeared from the Privacy &amp; Security Tab, so I am unable to turn autofill back on. In the past I have had to uninstall/reinstall Firefox to make credit card autofill work -- until I leave the country again. Surely I am not the only user that has had this problem and having to uninstall/reinstall is a pain that users shouldn't have. Isn't there a better way to turn this function on and off? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",tmccaffery

I use Firefox for surfing the web. I used to go to a website and when I clicked the username/login box, I was able to see the several users I used and could choose one of those. See the picture attached. Now, I can't see the several users and I have to write the user I want to use. I think I did something in the Firefox configuration, but I can't remember. I have tried to erase all the cookies, accept all the cookies again from the website, but nothing. I have gone to Privacy and Security but I haven't seen anything relating that website like an exception or something. And I think it's something relating to cookies but I can't fix this.
