I am running the same 3 tab on the same websites as I have been doing for the past 6 months, but since the latest Firefox update, this has become impossible. What happened to Firefox? I have had no other significant updates but the Firefox update. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",kaare.andersen

However, in the old panel, we can do what ever we want, like modify the cookies of the new request. I wonder why you just disabled those fields? Are there any settings I can set to make those fields editable? It's a really bad design for developers who definitely will need to edit those protected headers. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,other,en-US,1573213;,scruelt

I cannot access it because the account has the WRONG EMAIL address mixed up with the WRONG PASSWORDS.   The account MESS is preventing me from using SYNC creating my emails USELESS!!!   There must be someone, somewhere, who can tell me how to get specific help with MY FIREFOX ACCOUNT.   It is messed up so badly I am going have to throw this computer out and start all over -- but then I have to use either some bogus email address that I DO NOT WANT TO USE.  My accounts were set up decades ago -- very soon after FIREFOX was offered.  BUT JUST BECAUSE WE ARE OLD, ACCOUNTS ARE OLD, WHY does Firefox IGNORE problems with BASIC ACCOUNT PROBLEMS! I HATE THIS I HATE THIS I HATE THIS I HATE THIS!  FIREFOX SUCKS!!!!!!!  no such thing as support.  When I attempted to ask ""How to contact Firefox ACCOUNT HELP"", the stupid answer was older than my car, my house, but I am older than dirt so it was NOT that old.   STUPID STUPID STUPID.  I will get rid of ALL GOOGLE, MOZILLA, AND NORTON cause you all have NO RESPECT for your users -- not customers cause we are NOT CONSIDERED SUCH -- FIREFOX IS FREE. Hahaha    Dr T. H.

I thought I was selecting an update, but I got a Second version of Firefox. After backing up bookmarks, I deleted all of them and put another ""new"" version 64 bit. The website/search bar used to be on the menu Bar which I keep open all the time. These were at the top of the window. I also had a search bar at top, all the way to the right as facing it. NOW I can't seem to get the website input off the Bookmark toolbar and up to the top. I was able to get the separate search input box? What am I overlooking and I am think there is something easy I am missing. Pictures or a description of steps is helpful; I can't find a solution. MOZILLA didn't restrict placing this website box on the top menu bar, did they? </p><p>Thanks. Picture of browser is attached.  </p><p>matthew </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,customize,en-US,1573196;1573205;1573208;,MSKHawaii
