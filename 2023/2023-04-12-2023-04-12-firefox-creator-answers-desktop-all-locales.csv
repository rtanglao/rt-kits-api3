I downgraded to the previous version and now I've lost all of my passwords and bookmarks even though I'm logged into my account. My main priority is to recover my passwords and bookmarks.

Initially I had no issue with transferring my bookmarks, as I just logged in to Firefox. However, the damn thing wipes everything whenever you log off or turn it off, and it decided to restart on its own when I left it alone for five minutes. So I was trying to recover my tabs, even though I knew it was unlikely to work, and one of the options for History said I could restore something with eleven items (I assumed it meant tabs, that sounded about right) and it warned me it would overwrite the bookmarks. I assumed that it meant the bookmarks I had at the time, which were the same bookmarks I've always had, so I said yes. But I guess it meant the default ones because the others hadn't loaded yet or something??? Because a bunch of random default tabs popped back up (not even eleven of them???) and the bookmarks are now solidly on just the default ""Getting Started"" and so on. I checked, it's the right account, it says my bookmarks are synced, there are no other files to restore from, and I don't get my actual laptop back for another week or two, so I can't check or restore from there. Are my bookmarks gone forever, or is there a chance I could recover them.... but only in a few weeks when I get my original laptop back (assuming THEY didn't wipe it again)? Or did it overwrite them for my profile in general, meaning it's synced and all my bookmarks are gone forever? Is there a way to restore them now, from the loaner laptop? I am in constant agony. </p><p>EDIT: Weirdly, I can still see my original bookmarks on my phone, which is promising--but I can't export a backup file from there, apparently, unless I want to import every single one one by one by sharing each one individually, which, no thank you. And I'm not sure if it's synced and am too scared to try. What's that one meme with Michael from the Good Place? ""Birth is a curse and existence is a prison""? That's about how I'm feeling right now. It's 3 am. </p><p>EDIT 2: Fiddled around with it. Somehow fixed it. No fucking idea how. Sorry this was a pointless waste of cyber space. Wait, no, nevermind. I got OLD bookmarks back???? Like a few years old?????? What???????? I give up. This is better than nothing. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",tmbabe13
