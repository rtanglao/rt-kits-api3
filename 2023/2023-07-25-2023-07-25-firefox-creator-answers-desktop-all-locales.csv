Discussions on essential topics such as browser features, add-ons, troubleshooting, and best practices have become infrequent, leaving users with unanswered queries and unresolved issues. </p><p>The issue of declining user engagement appears to be multifaceted. Firstly, the slow response times and intermittent technical glitches on the community website have created a less than optimal user experience. As a result, visitors may feel discouraged from actively participating in discussions or seeking help from fellow community members. </p><p>Secondly, with the rise of social media platforms and other digital forums, users are increasingly dispersing their interactions across various channels, which has led to a fragmentation of the Firefox community's online presence. As such, users might be unaware of the wealth of knowledge and assistance available within the official community platform. </p><p>Furthermore, the absence of regular updates and fresh content on the community website may contribute to the decline in user engagement. Users seek dynamic and relevant discussions, tutorials, and insights, which can keep them invested and entice them to contribute actively. </p><p>To address these challenges and revitalize the Firefox community, a comprehensive strategy is needed. It should involve optimizing the website's performance to ensure swift and reliable access, reevaluating the user interface for improved navigation and engagement, and actively promoting the community platform's unique benefits. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1592756;,aboutnl

I've installed Windows 11 (finally) and since installation Firefox will not work, meaning no matter what I type or search for it does nothing, goes nowhere, shows no results. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox, but it just won't work. I am at wit's end and don't want to use Google Chrome. I am a Firefox devotee. Please help? Thank you, Kerry </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;,firefox,other,en-US,1592653;1592654;,kerryking13

That being said my question / concern is: How do parents DISABLE ""InPrivate Browsing"". Seems awfully disturbing to me that there is no parental control that allows parents to remove that option to protect our children and I will not stop asking questions, emailing and calling if I can find a phone number, until I find resolution to know I can safely allow my children to use the internet without them being able to be sneaky and hide things that could potentially be a danger to their safety.... Obviously I am not the only parent concerned with this matter by the other questions Ive seen on this topic so all I can say is ""do better Firefox"", parents shouldn't have to struggle and not get responses on how to keep our children safe while using your browser </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1150;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1592655;1592656;,auselman
