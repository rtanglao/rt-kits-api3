I've installed Windows 11 (finally) and since installation Firefox will not work, meaning no matter what I type or search for it does nothing, goes nowhere, shows no results. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox, but it just won't work. I am at wit's end and don't want to use Google Chrome. I am a Firefox devotee. Please help? Thank you, Kerry </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;,firefox,other,en-US,1592653;1592654;,kerryking13

That being said my question / concern is: How do parents DISABLE ""InPrivate Browsing"". Seems awfully disturbing to me that there is no parental control that allows parents to remove that option to protect our children and I will not stop asking questions, emailing and calling if I can find a phone number, until I find resolution to know I can safely allow my children to use the internet without them being able to be sneaky and hide things that could potentially be a danger to their safety.... Obviously I am not the only parent concerned with this matter by the other questions Ive seen on this topic so all I can say is ""do better Firefox"", parents shouldn't have to struggle and not get responses on how to keep our children safe while using your browser </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1150;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",auselman
