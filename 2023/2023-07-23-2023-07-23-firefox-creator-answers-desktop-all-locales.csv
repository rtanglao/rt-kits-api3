A couple years ago I downloaded Optifine, because I just wanted to experience Minecraft in ultra hyper 4k whatever. I didn't quite understand how to open it to install it or move it into a file or however that's done. I still don't quite understand. In my confusion, I decided it would be a good idea to change the default way the file opened to into Firefox. Now when I double-click to open it, it opens a new firefox window and asks where I want to save the file. My question: how can I change the file back to what it used to be? Apparently it's supposed to be a .jar, but I'm not seeing it anywhere on the file. Alternatively, if reversing the file type isn't an option, does anyone know how I might be able to install it? Please I'm begging T-T </p><p>This is what the most current file name is: OptiFine_1.20.1_HD_U_I5 </p><p>Sidenote I just checked apparently it IS STILL a .jar file, but I don't have a clue what to do with it aaaaaaaaaaaaa </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,other,en-US,1592271;,jabidleman

I'm using Firefox 114.02 on an iMac running Monterey 12.6.7. I was able to get in to Firefox's Location settings and now have the website listed with ""Allow"" noted.  This was not enough, and for some time I didn't understand why.  Then I discovered the Mac's System Preferences' Security and Privacy section, where Location Services are one category under Privacy.  Selecting Location Services brings up a list of apps that are allowed to provide location information.  For some reason, other browsers are on the list and can be turned on or off, but Firefox is not on the list of apps that can be selected as permitted.  Am I missing something here?  I can't find any way to add apps to the list so that they can actually be selected.  Any advice? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",MrWenger2

However, when I click on one of the messages, all I get is the header of the message, and not the body.  I cant read nor send messages. </p><p>It was working earlier today, but then started having problems.  I rebooted the computer and restarted Firefox after the reboot, but the problem persists. </p><p>I can use FF on my smart phone (Galaxy J3), but I don't have access to all my files on the cell phone. </p><p>It works better on Chrome, but often runs out of memory, as FF has better memory management than Chrome. </p><p>The Task manager says that FF is running in Efficiency Mode.  Since I do most of my work on Firefox, that means that Windows is holding me down. </p><p>I let it rest for a while while I had dinner and watched some TV.  Now, Outlook Mail is working properly on FF, and I don't know what happened to make it operate normally. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Josh-Levin
