However, when I click on one of the messages, all I get is the header of the message, and not the body.  I cant read nor send messages. </p><p>It was working earlier today, but then started having problems.  I rebooted the computer and restarted Firefox after the reboot, but the problem persists. </p><p>I can use FF on my smart phone (Galaxy J3), but I don't have access to all my files on the cell phone. </p><p>It works better on Chrome, but often runs out of memory, as FF has better memory management than Chrome. </p><p>The Task manager says that FF is running in Efficiency Mode.  Since I do most of my work on Firefox, that means that Windows is holding me down. </p><p>I let it rest for a while while I had dinner and watched some TV.  Now, Outlook Mail is working properly on FF, and I don't know what happened to make it operate normally. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Josh-Levin
