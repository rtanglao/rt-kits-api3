I can open it and read the list, I can even open it in Firefox and click on any link in there and it opens in Firefox, but they simply will NOT import. </p><p>If I understand the process correctly, go to bookmarks &gt; manage bookmarks &gt; Import and Backup, ""Import bookmarks from html...""   If I click on this, it opens the file manager, and I navigate to my backup drive and click on the ""bookmarks_3_24_23.html"" file, then click on ""open.""  This *should* start the import process, and then they should show up in my bookmarks, no?   What it does is exactly nothing at all.  The window freezes for a moment (unresponsive to any clicks), then does respond to clicks, but there are no imported bookmarks anywhere.   </p><p>If I enable the bookmarks toolbar, the first button is ""Import bookmarks,"" and if I click on that, it just tells me ""No programs that contain bookmarks, history, .... can be found."" </p><p>I tried dragging and dropping the file into a new tab, and it added ""bookmarks_3_24_23..."" to the bookmarks toolbar.  I can click on it and the list opens in the tab, and I can scroll down and find and open links... but that's obtuse and awkward.  I'd much rather have Firefox import the bookmarks and display them normally. </p><p>What am I missing here?  I've done this before without any issues, doing exactly the same things, but this time it's a no-go.  I'm starting to wonder if I've just got a buggy install of Linux ( Linux Mint 20.1 Ulyssa with the Cinnamon 4.8.6 desktop.) </p><p>Just went to get the current version of Firefox, and noticed that it's saying: ""Updates disabled by your system administrator.""  Think this would apply to importing bookmarks as well??  Anyway, the version is ""Firefox for Linux Mint mint-001 - 1.0"" up at the top of the ""about"" window, and below that is ""111.0 (64-bit)."" </p><p>Any ideas are very much appreciated! </p>",linux;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-1110;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",kharrisma

I have my FF set up for the address bar to be ""just that"" and a separate search window in the tool bar.  After trying all kinds of things that did ""not"" work, I changed my choice of search engine to ""ebay"" and when I typed ebay in the search window the sight came up with me all signed on (because I leave myself signed on) and everything seems to be working as normal.  But, I don't want ""ebay"" for my search engine and I don't want to have to sign on to ebay that way.  What has happened to cause this and how can it be fixed? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,other,en-US,"",donP22
