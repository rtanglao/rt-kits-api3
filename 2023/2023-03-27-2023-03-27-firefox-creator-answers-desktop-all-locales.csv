The window freezes for a moment (unresponsive to any clicks), then does respond to clicks, but there are no imported bookmarks anywhere.   </p><p>If I enable the bookmarks toolbar, the first button is ""Import bookmarks,"" and if I click on that, it just tells me ""No programs that contain bookmarks, history, .... can be found."" </p><p>I tried dragging and dropping the file into a new tab, and it added ""bookmarks_3_24_23..."" to the bookmarks toolbar.

After trying all kinds of things that did ""not"" work, I changed my choice of search engine to ""ebay"" and when I typed ebay in the search window the sight came up with me all signed on (because I leave myself signed on) and everything seems to be working as normal.  But, I don't want ""ebay"" for my search engine and I don't want to have to sign on to ebay that way.
