I know how that to rearrange the extensions pinned to the toolbar: one has to go to ""Customized Toolbar"" and drag and drop. But I can't find information on how to re-arrange these other extensions.

So, I figured that they were having internet issues and just kept trying.  Well, it's still not working so I'm trying to find out why.  I have my FF set up for the address bar to be ""just that"" and a separate search window in the tool bar.  After trying all kinds of things that did ""not"" work, I changed my choice of search engine to ""ebay"" and when I typed ebay in the search window the sight came up with me all signed on (because I leave myself signed on) and everything seems to be working as normal.  But, I don't want ""ebay"" for my search engine and I don't want to have to sign on to ebay that way.  What has happened to cause this and how can it be fixed? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,other,en-US,"",donP22
