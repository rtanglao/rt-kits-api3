I even purchased something in Youtube without needing any password verification. </p><p>But the passwords/usernames are not appearing in the firefox list of saved logins.  It just isn't there.

I can't mark the mail as important, or close an email I've opened by x-ing out of it. I can only open an email and can get back to my email folder by clicking on the folder. Pretty much unusable. In safe mode it has the same problem. I tested my Yahoo mail using Chrome and it works the way it's supposed to, but I much prefer Firefox.

After trying all kinds of things that did ""not"" work, I changed my choice of search engine to ""ebay"" and when I typed ebay in the search window the sight came up with me all signed on (because I leave myself signed on) and everything seems to be working as normal.  But, I don't want ""ebay"" for my search engine and I don't want to have to sign on to ebay that way.
