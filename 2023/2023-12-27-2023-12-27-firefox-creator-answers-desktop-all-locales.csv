The layout and images on the page look as they should. </p><p><strong>There is nothing wrong with the page, as it is rendered perfectly in Chrome.</strong> </p><p>In addition, this page doesn't display at all on the phone.  When I click on the link it asks me to download it and then asks me which app I want to open it with - instead of simply rendering the page. </p><p>I have seen some old threads on this topic, it looks like this issue haven't been resolved for few years. </p><p>My question is not just about  fixing it in my browser but at the root cause.  This page is the RSS feed of my podcast which many people want to access and many use Firefox as their browser.  Unless I tell everyone to use Chrome instead. </p><p>Can someone help? thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1210;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",etcetera777

I had a lot saved that I had been using the night prior to this on a different computer. I still have all of my bookmarks and addons saved, I’m just missing 95% of my saved logins? I have Firefox on 3 devices and it’s the same for all of them. What happened here and how can I restore them? I only have 2 profiles, mine and the default and I know there’s probably a backup of this saved in the profiles but I’m not sure how to restore it. </p>",desktop;sync;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",jeny.chavez.66
