I had a lot saved that I had been using the night prior to this on a different computer. I still have all of my bookmarks and addons saved, I’m just missing 95% of my saved logins? I have Firefox on 3 devices and it’s the same for all of them. What happened here and how can I restore them? I only have 2 profiles, mine and the default and I know there’s probably a backup of this saved in the profiles but I’m not sure how to restore it. </p>",desktop;sync;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",jeny.chavez.66
