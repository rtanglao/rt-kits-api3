I tried troubleshooting mode and then resorted to refresh which only made it worse.  It got to the point where the browser wouldn't even open the <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a> page correctly. </p><p>I finally turned my internet security service off and the browser began to work better, but getting my tab page to open sometimes comes up with a ""we cannot find the site"" and a ""try again""  button which never works. </p><p>I tried using Safari to go to the same web sites with no problems.   </p><p>My wife uses Firefox on her I pad and her tablet and says firefox browser is giving her problems. </p><p>I have Firefox 116.02  (the browser also seemed to have problems updating and I was getting Firefox failed to update messages.  </p><p>Has Firefox done something to make the browser unstable on Apple OS systems? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1160;firefox-11602;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1597259;,mcpalmer
