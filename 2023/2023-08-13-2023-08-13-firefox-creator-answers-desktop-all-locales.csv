On Windows closing a private window clears everything, especially it logged me out from all websited I logged in in this private session. </p><p>Not on Mac I am still logged in in private windows after I close and reopen a new one. Also the zoom level ist kept. </p><p>Is this a bug or intended behavior having a private window that keeps all my logins in new sessions? And why is it different on Windows and Mac? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1150;firefox-11503;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",netthier

If I close that process in the task manager nothing happens to my current firefox process and i can use firefox normally. </p><p>But everytime this separate process starts my system fans ramp up and CPU temps peaks to 70 degrees celsius. and i have to end that process to make it run normally. Thats a quite annoying process to do every time. </p><p>I am able to recreate this separate process by: </p> <ol><li>1. Plug my system for charging  </li><li>2. I was working offline and connect to internet </li></ol> <p>both the times the separate process automatically starts and uses very high amount of CPU. I even left my system for 2 hours to keep that process running and complete whatever it was doing. but nothing happend. It continued to run for 2 hours also. </p><p>Please find a solution for this. I have already tried solutions provided in the forum: </p> <ul><li> Restarting firefox </li><li> Refreshing Firefox </li><li> Enabling hardware accleration </li><li> Clearing some user profile data </li><li> Completely uninstalling firefox and deleting the residual files then reinstalling etc. </li></ul> <p>but nothing worked. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1160;firefox-11602;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jain1998kunal

This problem is occurring on browsers like Firefox, Brave, and Opera, but interestingly, videos are working fine on Chrome. I have tried various solutions over the past 2 years, including removing extensions, using private mode, installing web media extensions and codec packs, but nothing has resolved the problem. I am using Windows 10. I would appreciate any insights into why Chrome is able to play videos while other browsers are not, and I'm specifically looking for solutions beyond the usual suggestions like removing extensions or using private mode. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1160;firefox-11602;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",siddeshwar.vasam

Most recently this happened on the New Statesman website, I doubt they haven't optimized their site for Firefox. Previously I encountered this on Gerogetown University's Management System platform, which according to IT should be fine with Firefox. I removed all the extensions, cleared the cache and cookies, tried troubleshooting mode, even reinstalled Firefox to no avail. I accept all cookies. Settings are default. The issue is specific to Firefox, Edge works fine. Please help, I don't want to migrate back to Edge. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1160;firefox-11602;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",scheiring.gabor

So, at first I thought my issue was Firefox Nightly. It wouldn't update saying my OS was out of date...(Windows 11) Ok, I updated manually for awhile. still wont update on its own, I try going to the normal stable firefox browser, same freaking issue on TWO computers! Firefox wont update saying my OS is out of date. One computer has Windows 10, one Windows 11. I have seriously had it with this browser. Instead of wasting my time being spun by the support on this site why don't I just go find myself a browser that doesn't get confused by my OS.. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",omgUFOS1

For example, DuckDuckGo has <strong>two</strong> pre-defined keywords: </p><p>@duckduckgo, @ddg </p><p>Where multiple keywords are present, they are comma-separated. Then, in then search bar, users can type @duckduckgo or @ddg and, either way, Firefox will use DuckDuckGo to perform the search. However, if I add multiple custom keywords, such as: </p><p>@duck, @searchduck </p><p>the keyword list now displays: </p><p>@duck, @searchduck, @duckduckgo, @ddg </p><p>but for some reason Firefox interprets the whole ""@duck, @searchduck"" string as one keyword, rather than ""@duck"" and ""@searchduck"" separately. It seems this is broken, so for now I'll just use a single custom keyword, but it would be nice if I could use multiples.
