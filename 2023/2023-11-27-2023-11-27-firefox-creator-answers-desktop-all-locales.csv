It seems that the website's pages are not rendering correctly, resulting in distorted images, misplaced text, and overall compromised user experience. I have tested the website on other browsers, and it functions flawlessly. This leads me to believe that there might be a compatibility issue specific to Mozilla Firefox. </p><p>I have cleared my cache, disabled extensions, and ensured that my browser is up to date, but the problem persists. Has anyone else experienced a similar issue or can offer guidance on how to troubleshoot and resolve this compatibility hiccup with Mozilla Firefox? Your assistance would be greatly appreciated.

Nothing listed here in support or found elsewhere through a web search has made a difference. Also, if I leave Firefox open for an extended period of time so that the browser stays where I put it, and keeps the same size, it will crash. As a test, I had Windows resize the browser to the full monitor, closed it, and when I reopened Firefox it filled the monitor. A second time closed and reopened a few minutes later resets back to default location and size. Everything else (bookmarks, extensions, etc.) remains the same. Nothing has been added or removed since the fresh install. </p><p>This is the latest version, 23H2, of Windows 11 Pro, which, btw, was the version I was running before the fresh install of Windows 11 Pro. </p><p>How can this be corrected? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1200;,firefox,other,en-US,"",cmcole101

Settings -&gt; Home -&gt; Firefox Home Content simply does not contain a section that says ""Sponsored shortcuts"" and therefore this solution is not accessable. I am on Version 120 as suggested.
