I do not want these ads. I have looked up the answer: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/sponsor-privacy?as=u&amp;utm_source=inproduct"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/sponsor-privacy?as=u&amp;utm_source=inproduct</a> I can manually delete a sponsored shortcut once, but this does not stop them from coming onto future New Tabs. My problem is, the long-term answer simply does not work. Settings -&gt; Home -&gt; Firefox Home Content simply does not contain a section that says ""Sponsored shortcuts"" and therefore this solution is not accessable. I am on Version 120 as suggested. What is going wrong? How do I prevent these ads from appearing on the New Tab page? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1200;,firefox,customize,en-US,1620479;1620488;,stephenwaffles
