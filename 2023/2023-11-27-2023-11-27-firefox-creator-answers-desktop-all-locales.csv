I work with a lot of downloaded PDFs and I frequently need to break those down into separate documents, which I do by printing to PDF in-browser using custom page ranges. For example, I'll print pages 1-2 to Document1, pages 3-6 to Document 2, and pages 8-10 to Document 3. </p><p>Having the current page number at the top of the sidebar isn't very helpful, I want to be able to see the page number for each individual page all the time so I can tell at a glance, for example, that page 7 is blank and can be skipped, or page 6 ends a report so I know which pages get printed together. </p><p>Is there a way to set this up? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1200;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",jshapter

Websites like <a href=""https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com</a> or <a href=""https://ukutabs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ukutabs.com</a> offer the option to autoscroll, so that you can play your instrument without having to pause your playing and scroll further yourself. This feature hasn't been working for me ever since I got my new device and since it's various sites, I suppose the problem must be in the browser itself, I just can't figure it out.  In the case of Ultimate Guitar, when I click autoscroll, it does move slightly, once, but then stops again, and you'd miss the movement if you're not paying close attention. I can switch between various speeds on this site as well, but it doesn't do anything. In case of Ukutabs, there's not even any kind of response from the site when I click the option.  I tried turning on and off Firefox settings concerning autoscrolling and smooth scrolling, but nothing solved my problem.  </p><p>Thank you for your time and energy, everyone! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1200;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",czmeff

Nothing listed here in support or found elsewhere through a web search has made a difference.
