Now, it seems like the frequency info is lost every time I restart FF.

In the case of Ultimate Guitar, when I click autoscroll, it does move slightly, once, but then stops again, and you'd miss the movement if you're not paying close attention.

My problem is, the long-term answer simply does not work. Settings -&gt; Home -&gt; Firefox Home Content simply does not contain a section that says ""Sponsored shortcuts"" and therefore this solution is not accessable. I am on Version 120 as suggested. What is going wrong? How do I prevent these ads from appearing on the New Tab page? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1200;,firefox,customize,en-US,1620479;1620488;,stephenwaffles
