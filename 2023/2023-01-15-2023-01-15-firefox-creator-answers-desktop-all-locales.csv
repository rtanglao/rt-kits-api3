In the virtual machine, where the site loads, the header specifies HTTP 3. </p><p>So on my PC, in FF, I changed network.http.version to 3.

I keep receiving pop-up windows with unwanted videos, e.g. on my paid subscription to a local news website. See the attached screen capture, where I right-clicked on the pop-up window. You will see that a ""digiteka"" player keeps appearing and I never sollicited these videos. I hate this. It's not even pub, it's news, but when I'm reading an article I don't want to be bothered with other news that I'm not interested in. Plus, I don't want any unauthorised software like this digiteka player running on my computer without my permission. It's not a firefox module, it's probably silently downloaded over my connection with my news provider with no notice.  I could go as far as blocking autoplay so the video will not start playing automatically, but I would like to completely block the apperance of such windows and any download of something executable on my computer. What could I do in addition? I there any way, other than stopping my subscription to this site? </p><p>Many thanks for your help.
