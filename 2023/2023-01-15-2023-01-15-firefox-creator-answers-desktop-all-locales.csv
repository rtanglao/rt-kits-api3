The old install is still on the old windows hard drive, is there a way for me to move them onto the new install? I'd prefer to not have to rebuild the whole list from scratch! </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",januskrug

Out of nowhere it has started relentlessly purging my browser history to the point where nothing lasts more than a week now before getting deleted, and it is only getting worse. Prior to this Firefox would save data from over a year and simply just remove the oldest data in order to make room for the newest whenever necessary. That is no longer the case now. </p><p>I'm fairly certain that I haven't done anything to cause Firefox to do this, but I can't be sure. Looked in the settings and can't see anything that would cause this. </p><p>So my questions are: 1.) Can the history deleted be recovered? and 2.) Is it possible to get Firefox to stop purging my history on it's own so frequently?  </p><p>Any and all help is appreciated. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,other,en-US,"",georgekalimeris02
