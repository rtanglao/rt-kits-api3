Azt kitöröltem, hogy meg tudjam adni másodlagosnak, utána pedig fő címnek. Sajnos csak akkor engedi felvenni, ha beírom azt a kódot, amit a már nem létező e-mail címre kiküldtek. Mi a teendőm?

I'm trying to surf to a website and I think I'm running into problems with HTTP versions. </p><p>The site is <a href=""http://taliadinapoli.com"" rel=""nofollow"">taliadinapoli.com</a>. They sell pizza. When I try to get there from my computer (Windows 10, FF 108.0.2 64 bit) I get an HTTP 511 error. In fact, all the computers in my house - my wife's Mac and our tablets - get the error.  </p><p>So I assumed it had something to do with my ISP. </p><p>But then I opened a virtual machine (Windows 7, FF 108.0.2 32 bit) and went to the site and it loaded fine. So it's not my ISP; it's something else. </p><p>I opened the developer tools and looked at the headers for the initial requests. The only difference I saw was that on my PC, where I get the 511 error, the header specifies HTTP 1.1. In the virtual machine, where the site loads, the header specifies HTTP 3. </p><p>So on my PC, in FF, I changed network.http.version to 3. That didn't help: the GET is still using 1.1 and getting a 511 error. </p><p>Then I looked at FF on my VM and saw that its network.http.version was also set to 1.1. And yet it's using HTTP 3 to access the site! </p><p>What's going on? How do I get FF to use HTTP 3? </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1559691;,firefox1603

I am using mainly firefix and thunderbird on linux (Ubuntu) on all my computers, that of my children and of any friend I can convert to open-source computing. </p><p>I have done all possible documented actions to configure firefox for blocking pop-ups, including standard (permissions in privacy &amp; security settings) and advanced (filter on autoplay parameters in about:config) options available. I keep receiving pop-up windows with unwanted videos, e.g. on my paid subscription to a local news website. See the attached screen capture, where I right-clicked on the pop-up window. You will see that a ""digiteka"" player keeps appearing and I never sollicited these videos. I hate this. It's not even pub, it's news, but when I'm reading an article I don't want to be bothered with other news that I'm not interested in. Plus, I don't want any unauthorised software like this digiteka player running on my computer without my permission. It's not a firefox module, it's probably silently downloaded over my connection with my news provider with no notice.  I could go as far as blocking autoplay so the video will not start playing automatically, but I would like to completely block the apperance of such windows and any download of something executable on my computer. What could I do in addition? I there any way, other than stopping my subscription to this site? </p><p>Many thanks for your help. Patrice. </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1559693;,PB64

It also happened out of nowhere since I was using my computer the night before but when I tried opening Firefox the next day it wouldnt load any site, crashed if I tried too much or got really weird and even if it did load after a long time of trial and error it only lasted for a bit and didnt load fully either. I'm on version 108.0.2 as of the last time checking. Everything else seems to be updated as well especially since other browsers work perfectly fine. I also cant really click on much since as I said if I try too much it crashes or doesnt work as intended. I'll provide some pictures which might help the cash report just in case. </p><p>I'd also rather not try reinstalling everything since I have a lot of rather important tabs open and I dont wanna risk losing any of them since im not sure how well the Firefox sync. works in this case. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1080;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1559695;,JustLeon

I used to be able get to the downloads folder directly by clicking on the down arrow in my extension tool bar which showed all recent downloads (even after rebooting) and then access to the download folder was right next to any of the recent downloads. Worked great that way. It used to be a quick way to get to the downloads folder and now I have to download a file before I can use that method, but then it disappears again if I close Firefox. How do I get that back permanently. I don't want that list to disappear each time I exit and restart Firefox. I already tried ""privacy.clearOnShutdown.downloads"" and that has no effect.
