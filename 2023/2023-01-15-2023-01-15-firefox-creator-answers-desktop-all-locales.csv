I don't like the separate library window...it's not convenient and it's more work to use than it's worth. I used to be able get to the downloads folder directly by clicking on the down arrow in my extension tool bar which showed all recent downloads (even after rebooting) and then access to the download folder was right next to any of the recent downloads. Worked great that way. It used to be a quick way to get to the downloads folder and now I have to download a file before I can use that method, but then it disappears again if I close Firefox. How do I get that back permanently. I don't want that list to disappear each time I exit and restart Firefox. I already tried ""privacy.clearOnShutdown.downloads"" and that has no effect. What would be the correct setting in about:configÂ ? Steve </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ssybesma

Out of nowhere it has started relentlessly purging my browser history to the point where nothing lasts more than a week now before getting deleted, and it is only getting worse. Prior to this Firefox would save data from over a year and simply just remove the oldest data in order to make room for the newest whenever necessary. That is no longer the case now. </p><p>I'm fairly certain that I haven't done anything to cause Firefox to do this, but I can't be sure. Looked in the settings and can't see anything that would cause this. </p><p>So my questions are: 1.) Can the history deleted be recovered? and 2.) Is it possible to get Firefox to stop purging my history on it's own so frequently?  </p><p>Any and all help is appreciated. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,other,en-US,1559646;1559660;,georgekalimeris02
