Just after it I noticed that all add-ons I used for a long time do not work anymore. </p><p>When I go to Menu &gt; Add-ons and themes, I see all add-ons enabled. However, all of them do not work, and they even do not display their icons on the Firefox toolbar as they did before. </p><p>A couple of examples of add-ons that do not work: - Enhancer for YouTube  - ImTranslator: Translator, Dictionary, TTS </p><p>I run Firefox via Firejail sandbox (like I did for years without any problems). All add-ons and settings came to my new system via Firefox sync. I tried to run Firefox directly (without Firejail) and nothing changed, add-ons still do not work. Also, I logged out of my Firefox sync account and reinstalled add-ons on Firefox running directly (without Firejail) and it did not help. </p><p>Appreciate your help - how can I enable add-ons in Firefox? </p>",linux;desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,1587127;,ndp124
