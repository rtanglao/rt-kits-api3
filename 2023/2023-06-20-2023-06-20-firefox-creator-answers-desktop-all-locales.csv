When I finally got into the browser, it was totally vanilla. All the old information, bookmarks, toolbar information, were missing. I am using Windows11 Home. If I go to Firefox on my phone, all seems to be the same as it always has been. What happened to my toolbars, etc? </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,other,en-US,1586393;,klawuhn

Whereas they display in other browsers, they do not display in Firefox. I asked this question years ago, and to date, no one has provided an answer.  </p><p>Not only do the headers not display the cursive font: savoye let and allura, what they show are enlarged and bold letters that completely destroy the design. Surely, there is a reason for this. </p><p>Here is one of the sites (the other is still in design mode): <a href=""https://summitlighthousephoenix.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://summitlighthousephoenix.org</a> </p>",desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",lindadarlene1

(I’ve spent about five hours over the past several days and $2,500 on a new laptop trying to recover from the damage. Thanks Microsoft.) Turning to Firefox, in trying to put everything on my computer back together again, I didn’t remember my Firefox password, so I had to reset it. When I logged in again, everything was gone: all my favorites and years of bookmarks. Again: everything was gone. The tech support crew that helped me recover from the Microsoft update—well, as much as they could—said this might have had something to do w/ it; that I might have lost the connection w/ Firefox. I don’t know. All I know is that I’ve had years of bookmarks, going back to 2010. And I couldn’t have lost them all in one night just by resetting the password.  </p><p>Might anyone have any advice on whether I might be able to recover a previous version? Thank you in advance for your help. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,other,en-US,"",tjo787

I can't find any way to do that and can't find any good information about it.  One site said I needed an ad-on, but I shouldn't need that for something so simple that used to work fine on my old computer with Firefox.  I can't find any settings for this at all. </p><p>Please help me fix this. </p><p>Thank you, </p><p>Myrah </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1586391;,myrahjunkmail
