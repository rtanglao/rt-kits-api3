After turning on Firefox, the ping starts to ""jump"" and the internet disappears temporarily. This is happening on two different computers with wifi access. This problem does not occur until Firefox is launched. I tried to use other browsers, even many hours and everything was ok. Edge, Chrome etc. Telephones, TVs in this network do not have these problems. As soon as I open firefox the problem occurs. I've tried almost everything: Standard Firefox procedures: remove the problem, reinstall the program, etc. In turn: changing network cards, disconnecting other devices from the network, changing wifi settings, restarting the modem, contacting the ISP and I did many other things that I can't even do anymore remember... I'm attaching a screenshot of what it looks like. If no one helps me, I will have to change the browser, which I would very much like to avoid. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",tommyserafin

This normally would clear the list of recently bookmarked sites. However since upgrading to version 114.0.1, this does not occur as it used to, meaning it's taking up memory, as the recently bookmarked sites from the previous session remain even when I shut down the browser for the night when shutting down my laptop. I have also noticed that the browser will still ask me if I want to restore a previous session even after hitting clear history and shutting down the browser. These were never issues in versions prior to 114 so far as I can tell. Can anyone explain what's happening here and how these can be fixed? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1140;,firefox,other,en-US,1586407;1586414;1586421;1586424;,Marc7

(I’ve spent about five hours over the past several days and $2,500 on a new laptop trying to recover from the damage. Thanks Microsoft.) Turning to Firefox, in trying to put everything on my computer back together again, I didn’t remember my Firefox password, so I had to reset it. When I logged in again, everything was gone: all my favorites and years of bookmarks. Again: everything was gone. The tech support crew that helped me recover from the Microsoft update—well, as much as they could—said this might have had something to do w/ it; that I might have lost the connection w/ Firefox. I don’t know. All I know is that I’ve had years of bookmarks, going back to 2010. And I couldn’t have lost them all in one night just by resetting the password.  </p><p>Might anyone have any advice on whether I might be able to recover a previous version?
