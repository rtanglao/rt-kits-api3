(I’ve spent about five hours over the past several days and $2,500 on a new laptop trying to recover from the damage. Thanks Microsoft.) Turning to Firefox, in trying to put everything on my computer back together again, I didn’t remember my Firefox password, so I had to reset it. When I logged in again, everything was gone: all my favorites and years of bookmarks. Again: everything was gone. The tech support crew that helped me recover from the Microsoft update—well, as much as they could—said this might have had something to do w/ it; that I might have lost the connection w/ Firefox. I don’t know. All I know is that I’ve had years of bookmarks, going back to 2010. And I couldn’t have lost them all in one night just by resetting the password.  </p><p>Might anyone have any advice on whether I might be able to recover a previous version? Thank you in advance for your help. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,other,en-US,1586417;,tjo787

I can't find any way to do that and can't find any good information about it.
