This time I notably irritated because of browsing my regularly checked websites have so much delay now compared to before I upgrade to W11. </p><p>Here's the list of thing I tried to fix this issue. </p><pre>   Clearing caches </pre> <pre>   Disabling add ons </pre> <pre>   Disable enhanced protection </pre> <pre>   Refresh Firefox program </pre> <pre>   Updating my chipset driver  </pre> <pre>   updating my gfx driver </pre> <pre>   Reseting my network. </pre> <p>Nothing I tried above worked. </p><p>Again the issue is not internet speed.

This update is horrible and I have now lost a full day at work trying to FIX this clusterf**k of a browser mess that you have made for me!  For the life of me I do not understand why you took away the ability for the user to make Firefox more user-friendly.  Before, I could choose to customize if I wanted to, or not to customize.  Now I have no choice and am stuck with the way YOU want it.  Well, I don't like the way you want it!  I liked it the way I had it customized!  I am so stinking furious with you right now!
