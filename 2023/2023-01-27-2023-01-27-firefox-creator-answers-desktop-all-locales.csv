So far so good, didn't experience any issue. One complain I have is the gigantic cut, copy, open..etc Tab at the top of the new file explorer. But, again, nothing out of the ordinary. </p><p>But when I opened Firefox for the first time after upgrading I noticed a painful delay before actually loading the new pages. At first I thought it was only because I just recently updated the OS, so I leave for few hours and keep working my docs. After going back to browse I still have the same issue. This time I notably irritated because of browsing my regularly checked websites have so much delay now compared to before I upgrade to W11. </p><p>Here's the list of thing I tried to fix this issue. </p><pre>   Clearing caches </pre> <pre>   Disabling add ons </pre> <pre>   Disable enhanced protection </pre> <pre>   Refresh Firefox program </pre> <pre>   Updating my chipset driver  </pre> <pre>   updating my gfx driver </pre> <pre>   Reseting my network. </pre> <p>Nothing I tried above worked. </p><p>Again the issue is not internet speed. When I downloaded the AMD drivers, it was 14MBps, quite fast. </p><p>Then I open the ""task manager"" and tick the ""always on top"" option. I noticed that Firefox is still idling even after I clicked links in my homepage. Firefox only uses 2% of CPU usage. It stays that way for 4-11 seconds (depending on the websites I tested) before eventually ramps up the CPU usage to the percentage I expected to opens a new website. </p><p>Anyone knows the answer? Please I'm getting desperate here. I don't want to daily drive chromium forks and would like to keep using Firefox. </p><p>Asus vivobook laptop, Ryzen 5 3500u, 16gb 2666mhz ram </p>",desktop;beta;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1100;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",romanist05

I have the ""Old Firefox Data"" file, but have no idea how to get ALL that info back into 108.  I am so very upset and frustrated right now!  So much wasted time.  I cannot believe Mozilla did this to us with no warning!!!!!!!!  I have seen some articles on how to get the info back, but I don't really understand them.  I am relatively computer-savvy, but I definitely do not understand how all this works.  Some ""Firefox for Dummies"" at this point would be greatly appreciated.

Every single thing that I liked about Firefox is now GONE.  Options are GONE.  Customizing the toolbar - GONE.  Adding toolbars - GONE!!!  It lost my open tabs.  It won't show the LastPass icon in the toolbar like it used to, so I have to hunt for it now.  All my toolbar settings - GONE! </p><p>Mozilla - you really should WARN people BEFORE they update that the update is a major overhaul. Why would you just make yourself another Chrome?  If I wanted to use Chrome, I would (and I probably will now), but I prefer Firefox - at least I DID prefer Firefox before this update.  I do not understand why you completely RUINED Firefox!  This update is horrible and I have now lost a full day at work trying to FIX this clusterf**k of a browser mess that you have made for me!  For the life of me I do not understand why you took away the ability for the user to make Firefox more user-friendly.  Before, I could choose to customize if I wanted to, or not to customize.  Now I have no choice and am stuck with the way YOU want it.  Well, I don't like the way you want it!  I liked it the way I had it customized!  I am so stinking furious with you right now!  I will be reverting to the prior version and will then search for a new browser.  I am really sick of companies taking away things that make their products better.  Congratulations, Firefox - you are now Chrome's Clone. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1090;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",ElegalEyes
