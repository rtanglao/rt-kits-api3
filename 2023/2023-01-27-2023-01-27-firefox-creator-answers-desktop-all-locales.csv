I can install it no problem, but don't understand how to get all my settings back that 109 removed.","<p>Firefox 109 is horrible and I am trying to revert to 108.  I have the ""Old Firefox Data"" file, but have no idea how to get ALL that info back into 108.  I am so very upset and frustrated right now!  So much wasted time.  I cannot believe Mozilla did this to us with no warning!!!!!!!!  I have seen some articles on how to get the info back, but I don't really understand them.  I am relatively computer-savvy, but I definitely do not understand how all this works.  Some ""Firefox for Dummies"" at this point would be greatly appreciated.  I am on a PC using Windows 10 professional 64-bit with automatic updates so it's current. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1562045;1562074;1562077;1562082;1562085;,ElegalEyes

Every single thing that I liked about Firefox is now GONE.  Options are GONE.  Customizing the toolbar - GONE.  Adding toolbars - GONE!!!  It lost my open tabs.  It won't show the LastPass icon in the toolbar like it used to, so I have to hunt for it now.  All my toolbar settings - GONE! </p><p>Mozilla - you really should WARN people BEFORE they update that the update is a major overhaul. Why would you just make yourself another Chrome?  If I wanted to use Chrome, I would (and I probably will now), but I prefer Firefox - at least I DID prefer Firefox before this update.  I do not understand why you completely RUINED Firefox!  This update is horrible and I have now lost a full day at work trying to FIX this clusterf**k of a browser mess that you have made for me!  For the life of me I do not understand why you took away the ability for the user to make Firefox more user-friendly.  Before, I could choose to customize if I wanted to, or not to customize.  Now I have no choice and am stuck with the way YOU want it.  Well, I don't like the way you want it!  I liked it the way I had it customized!  I am so stinking furious with you right now!  I will be reverting to the prior version and will then search for a new browser.  I am really sick of companies taking away things that make their products better.  Congratulations, Firefox - you are now Chrome's Clone. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1090;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",ElegalEyes
