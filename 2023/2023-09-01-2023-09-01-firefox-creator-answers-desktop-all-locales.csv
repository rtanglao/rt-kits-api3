I already have the admin console for (2) open in Firefox.  When I activate the application from (1), it sends a command to open up another tab with the exact same URL in Firefox.  Its really more of a nuisance than anything, but I would like to make Firefox just defer to the existing tab since the URLs are the same.  Not sure if this is possible, but it would be great if it was. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",jborchardt1
