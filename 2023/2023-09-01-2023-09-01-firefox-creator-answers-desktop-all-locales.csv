With one scroll they do double the amount of lines then previously. I thought I was seeing things, so I reinstalled Firefox v116.0 to make sure and confirmed it was scrolling less with the previous version. I found a setting ""mousewheel.system_scroll_override.enabled"" set to 'true' by default. Switching to 'false' fixes the scroll amount, but when I was back on v116.0 I checked that setting there and it was also set to 'true' by default, yet no double scrolling. So I have no idea what could cause this issue. Maybe something was 'fixed' with this setting and now it's applied correctly? Or should nothing change with scroll amount when updating from 116 to 117? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1170;,firefox,other,en-US,"",guniu
