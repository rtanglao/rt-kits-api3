I've got PagePlus 9 which lets you design .PDFs with fillable fields in, the idea BEING I could send out a form which anyone could fill in in their browser without having to understand word-processing. Looked great in PagePlus 9, loaded it into Firefox and it sucked royally - fields and data all over the show.  Back to the drawing board. Nearly 5 hours and countless revisions later, it still sucked royally in Firefox.   </p><p>Then I tried it in Chrome, Edge, Hola and CCBrowser and it worked like an absolute dream.  Displayed perfectly. Let you enter data perfectly. Put it back into Firefox and it immediately sucked blue whales through thin straws again.  So it's GOT to be a hewge bug with Firefox and .PDFs.  Anyone know what it is and how to handle it? </p><p>In retrospect, I, too, find it Pretty Darned Funny that I didn't think of testing it in another browser before spending 5 hours on the thing!  But if it's a Firefox and PDF bug, why's nobody spotted it in Developerland? That's the bit I don't get really.  (If they HAD, surely they'd've just opened up the inner workings of another browser, learned what they were doing wrong and used what they'd learned?)   </p><p>Can reload it and take screenshots if requested. </p><p>Yours puzzledly </p><p>Chris. </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",ulrichburke

I have tried: </p><p>-Resetting all of the cookies, history, etc for that individual website. -Removing the URLs from the links in question from my browser history. -Downloading this extension: <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remove-visited-link/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remove-visited-link/</a> and using it -Going into settings and changing the visited link color. </p><p>Nothing has worked so far. One thing about the website in question is it has its own unique color for visited links---I am wondering if that is causing this? Additionally, this persists whether or not I am signed in to this website. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,other,en-US,1583064;1583068;,chalejohnson
