I have tried: </p><p>-Resetting all of the cookies, history, etc for that individual website. -Removing the URLs from the links in question from my browser history. -Downloading this extension: <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remove-visited-link/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remove-visited-link/</a> and using it -Going into settings and changing the visited link color. </p><p>Nothing has worked so far. One thing about the website in question is it has its own unique color for visited links---I am wondering if that is causing this? Additionally, this persists whether or not I am signed in to this website. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,other,en-US,"",chalejohnson
