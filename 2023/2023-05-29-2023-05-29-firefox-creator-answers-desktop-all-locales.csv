My home page is a blank page. From the home page I select the YouTube bookmark. I intend to right click on a video and select Open Link in New Window, but sometimes my touchpad doesn't see it as a right click and opens the video. When the video is done if I click on the back button, the browser takes me to the home page (blank) instead of the first YouTube page. If I then click on the forward button, YouTube loads a new page of videos to watch. There is no way to get back to the original first YouTube page which is annoying if there was something else I wanted to watch. I've had this happen with other sites as well. I originally thought this was a Firefox issue but now am wondering if my touchpad is interpreting the click on the back button as two clicks and causing it to go back two pages.
