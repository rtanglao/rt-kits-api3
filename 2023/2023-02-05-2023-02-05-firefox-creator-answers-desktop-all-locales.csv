I can tap any input field and the touch keyboard for Windows 10 pops up and immediately closes. This does not happen if the window is <em><strong>not </strong></em>maximised. The keyboard comes up and works fine but covers the lower half of the window which usually means I can't see what I'm typing. I don't get this problem with Chrome which resizes its windows even if they're maximised to accommodate the onscreen touch keyboard, which is frustrating because I don't want Chrome to guzzle my RAM.
