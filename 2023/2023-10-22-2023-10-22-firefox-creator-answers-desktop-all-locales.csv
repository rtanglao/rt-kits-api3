Each time I get to the part where it wants me to enter a code from my authenticator Mozilla won't accept it, so I elect to have a code emailed to my GMAIL account, of which that email never is delivered (yes, I've added accounts@firefox.com to my Google Gmail address book.). Eventually my account is locked and I wait till the next day to repeat this process all over again. Why is it this complicated? Unlike Google Chrome, which just works. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-11;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",jimspielman

I have never installed such a thing and have no idea how to fix what they are demanding I must fix in order to continue with YouTube in the FireFox browser. In the mean time I have to use some other unfamiliar browser just for YouTube. It appears that some kind of incompatibility has evolved in the recent two or three weeks between Firefox and YouTube. </p>,desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1612830;,timjurek

Eu escaneei o QR Code em dois aplicativos de autenticação em duas etapas (Google e Microsoft) para ativar a proteção extra. Porém, mesmo após instalar a autenticação do Firefox nos programas e digitando corretamente as chaves geradas, sempre o Mozilla Firefox diz que a chave é incorreta. Já repeti os procedimentos diversas vezes apagando e escaneando novamente, mas o erro persiste. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,privacy-and-security,pt-BR,"",auripacheco
