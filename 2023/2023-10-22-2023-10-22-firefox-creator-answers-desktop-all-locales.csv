I just noticed that saving a bookmark to an Amazon page shows the full address in the title of the bookmark now, instead of the description of the page.  I checked and this does not happen on other sites, like YouTube, where the video title is still given correctly. This make it very hard to find the bookmarked Amazon items. Thank you for your help. Love Firefox! PS:  I'm a Firefox ""Power User"" when it comes to Bookmarks.  I have over 8000 bookmarks and regularly back them up.  I have some other suggestions regarding Bookmarks in Firefox if you are interested. Regard, K </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",mail.jimw

Eventually my account is locked and I wait till the next day to repeat this process all over again. Why is it this complicated?

I have never installed such a thing and have no idea how to fix what they are demanding I must fix in order to continue with YouTube in the FireFox browser. In the mean time I have to use some other unfamiliar browser just for YouTube. It appears that some kind of incompatibility has evolved in the recent two or three weeks between Firefox and YouTube. </p>,desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1612830;,timjurek
