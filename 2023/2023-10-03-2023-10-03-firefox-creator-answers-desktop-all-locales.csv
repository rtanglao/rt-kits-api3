Here is the Firefox version shown to me: 78.15.0esr (64-bit) I work with an iMac of the following version: iMac (21.5 inch, from 2010) - OS X El Capitan version 10.11.6 (15G22010);  - Processor: 3.06GHz Intel Core i3;  - Memory: 4GB 1333MHz DDR3;  - Graphics card: ATI Radeon HD 4670 256MB Maybe my computer is too old for the latest version, but why does Firefox Info show me that the browser is up to date and there are no updates? Thank you very much for a tip Uwe </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;mac-os-x-1011;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1607942;1608014;,uwe.boelts

The audio continues, but the video stops until it is back in the foreground, at which point the video continues where it ought to.  I have tried disabling the unload tabs in the config menu as well as disable the foreground pausing or whatever its called, as recommended by previous posts.  I used to not have this issue at all, so I'm not sure what changed.  Please help!  Thank you. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1607990;1607997;,23sarnett
