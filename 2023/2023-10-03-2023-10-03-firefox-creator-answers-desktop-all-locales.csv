I've attached a slightly different screenshot to the one I posted on the reddit post, but it makes no difference if you see one or the other, or both! </p><p>In summary, I've added a css code to my userChrome.css thingy to move the tabs below the search bar. I was also wondering what the best way to transfer my userChrome.css file + about:config settings over to a new version of Firefox. Due to not being admin of my laptop (I'm running it out of the .dmg file— besides, I always like to keep an older version of Firefox as a fallback), I have to install a whole new version of Firefox onto my laptop to update. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ctan24

The audio continues, but the video stops until it is back in the foreground, at which point the video continues where it ought to.  I have tried disabling the unload tabs in the config menu as well as disable the foreground pausing or whatever its called, as recommended by previous posts.  I used to not have this issue at all, so I'm not sure what changed.  Please help!  Thank you. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",23sarnett
