I notices a strange behavior of Firefox in my notification area of MacBook Air M1 running on macOS Sonoma 14.0. Many times when I am using firefox or minimizing it, it is showing ""Firefox is capturing your screen"" that can also be seen in  attached image. I am not using any type of screen recording or screenshot too in any way neither having any plugin or 3rd party integration in browser nor any proxies. Sometime it also using the Mic and giving symbol of Mic use for few seconds. What's happening&nbsp;? Can you please look into it. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1607913;,nitesh.like123

I've attached a slightly different screenshot to the one I posted on the reddit post, but it makes no difference if you see one or the other, or both! </p><p>In summary, I've added a css code to my userChrome.css thingy to move the tabs below the search bar. I was also wondering what the best way to transfer my userChrome.css file + about:config settings over to a new version of Firefox. Due to not being admin of my laptop (I'm running it out of the .dmg file— besides, I always like to keep an older version of Firefox as a fallback), I have to install a whole new version of Firefox onto my laptop to update. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,customize,en-US,1607898;1607899;1607900;,ctan24

The audio continues, but the video stops until it is back in the foreground, at which point the video continues where it ought to.  I have tried disabling the unload tabs in the config menu as well as disable the foreground pausing or whatever its called, as recommended by previous posts.  I used to not have this issue at all, so I'm not sure what changed.  Please help!  Thank you. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",23sarnett
