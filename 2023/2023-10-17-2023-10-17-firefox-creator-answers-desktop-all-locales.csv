Tried signing into my account which I haven't done in a long time (account opened in 2018). The password that is saved in Firefox passwords (same one is listed in my personal and seperate password file) doesn't work so I signed in using google. Now I want to change my password to one that actually works, but can't because I don't know my password. Can't sync, can't set a recovery key and certainly don't want to reset my password and lose all of my other passwords (the ones I forgot to add to my seperate password file). How in the world does firefox forget it's own password? Thanks, M. Britz </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",guemeskid

When I go to duck duck go in firefox, there is randomly huge communication lag time between pressing enter and a result populating (usually more than 30seconds-2min where normally it is instant) and a good majority of the image thumbnail results do not display. It didn't used to do this and I think something screwed something up on my computer.
