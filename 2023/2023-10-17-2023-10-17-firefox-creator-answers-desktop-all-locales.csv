I cannot find a copy of my bookmarksmenu or bookmark bar (I am translating from Dutch) in Windows.old. I did have Firefox synchronized with my Android phone, so all of those bookmarks are still in Firefox Android (on my phone). I would like to get them all back, but the phone clearly says that the synchronisation feature is NOT for backing up or restoring this kind of stuff. On the phone the Settings and clicking on my email address says, that the last synchronisation took place 1 minute ago, but indeed, the bookmarks are not back on my computer's Firefox. I hate to initiate a synchronisation from my computer (don't even know how) and then have the synchronisation overwrite the favorites and bookmarks on my phone. None of the help files or articles give any indiction whether you can dictate the direction of the synchronisation or whether that is even a thing. So basically, I seem to have no backup of my favorites or bookmark, other than what's in Firefox for Android. How can I restore them from there. I read I can import them in the desktop version, but I don't find any info on how to export them from Android.
