When I go to duck duck go in firefox, there is randomly huge communication lag time between pressing enter and a result populating (usually more than 30seconds-2min where normally it is instant) and a good majority of the image thumbnail results do not display. It didn't used to do this and I think something screwed something up on my computer. What can cause this? </p><p>Things I have tried: Resetting Firefox Deleting and Reinstalling Firefox Deleting all cache/cookies/Mozilla files in %appdata, program files, and other locations and reinstalling. </p><p>I prefer to use DDG over Google. Can someone help? Why is it doing this? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",snelss0

Is there a way to either have part of a website excluded from ""always open in container"" or to remove a specific tab from a container if it's ""always open in container""? I want the majority of it to be inside of the container, but there are some occasions where I want it outside of one. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1180;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",Zanteri

I have followed every support thread I have found so far - checked that the problem is Firefox and not the websites in question, checked that the time via Firefox's console is wrong, checked that resistFingerprint is false, trashed cookies and preferences, booted in Troubleshoot Mode, altered system settings. Nothing has worked. The time has been accurate until a few weeks ago when daylight savings time started. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",tenshirei
