So i re-install Firefox which i have been using for years with the same account. Re-installed, I synced my account with email and password, And there was nothing to sync, I lost everything and i'm wondering why? Anyone got an answer before i delete this crap forever? </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11301;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",jakmehoff

In this case, the fullsreen mod should not be cancelled. For example, look at the attached picture, which is taken when I'm inputing something in the fullscreen mode. In this case, when I press ""Esc"", the expected behaviour is to close the input method popup without closing the fullscreen mode. The bug has existed for long. I'm using the latest Firefox version for Windows 11. </p>",desktop;beta;customize;windows-11;firefox-1140;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",SolidBlock

I have located the profile folder and the error message I get when I try to open firefox is: ""Your Firefox profile cannot be loaded.

I went through Library to Application Support to find the profile...now what do I do to get firefox to work? Do I need to move the folder? Where to? Should I just delete the firefox folder in App Support, then import my Chrome profile to Firefox after I download it again? Will that even work? </p><p>Thank you for reading! </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",ryan.b.willis86
