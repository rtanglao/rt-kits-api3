In this case, the fullsreen mod should not be cancelled. For example, look at the attached picture, which is taken when I'm inputing something in the fullscreen mode. In this case, when I press ""Esc"", the expected behaviour is to close the input method popup without closing the fullscreen mode. The bug has existed for long.
