My FireFox is set to block anything that moves, and supported by Ad Blockers and Ublock too. Is there a way in which I can configure FF to allow me into the Bank site without having to change my ""secure"" settings every time? I am no computer genius - so please make it simple for me. </p><p>Thanks everyone. </p><p>Ian </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1596185;,ian_sd57llg

When I type out a letter key, it shows it in a different key alphabet? For example, if I type “a” on the keyboard is will show a complete different random key like “5” or “d”. I am very comfortable and love using your browser. And would want to continue doing so without changing to another. </p><p><br> -	A practical example is the following attached screenshot.  I have typed the word “qwerty”  on your browser but instead I get displayed on your browser “dfghjk”. -	Very important to know is that I am running “ZoneAlarm Extreme Security NextGen” Anti-keylogger. That is configured to block programs that secretly record keystrokes (see attached document). Why is it only Firefox that is affected by this? -	I have also contacted Zonealarm and they instructed me to contact you about this seeing that this issue only happens with your browser and not with any other program. I can type in Word or outlook or any other App without issues. ( -	Like you can see from my other attached screenshots, it is not only your browser (firefox) that I have installed and working with as my default browser that is the only one having issues. The other browsers (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Brave) are all working perfectly without this issue/problem. But only your browser that I made as the default browser that is the only one having this problem. -	A good example, I typed this whole message using outlook without an issue/problem of this sort (see attached document).  </p><p>Can you please look into this and provide me with answers on how to resolve this. </p>",desktop;other;needsinfo;windows-11;firefox-1160;firefox-11601;,firefox,other,en-US,1596174;,o.simeon

I cleared the cache first - no success, then I cleared all data and then found I couldn't watch any video - Error F7701-1003.  I then uninstalled Firefox and downloaded from Mozilla and installed it - no success. I uninstalled it again and rebooted before attempting the installation again.  Firefox message loaded on first launch asking if I wanted a fresh experience - I did and clicked the button at the end of the message (at top). </p><p>Now I can watch a video on Firefox again but I still have the subtitles sync error.  All that clearing of data, and the removal and re-installation did not help. The subtitle text is way ahead of the audio.
