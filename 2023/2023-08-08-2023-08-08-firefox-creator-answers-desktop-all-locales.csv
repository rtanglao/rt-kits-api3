I cleared the cache first - no success, then I cleared all data and then found I couldn't watch any video - Error F7701-1003.  I then uninstalled Firefox and downloaded from Mozilla and installed it - no success. I uninstalled it again and rebooted before attempting the installation again.  Firefox message loaded on first launch asking if I wanted a fresh experience - I did and clicked the button at the end of the message (at top). </p><p>Now I can watch a video on Firefox again but I still have the subtitles sync error.  All that clearing of data, and the removal and re-installation did not help. The subtitle text is way ahead of the audio.  Can you assist? </p><p>System details Edition	Windows 11 Pro Version	22H2 Installed on	‎12/‎10/‎2022 OS build	22621.1992 Serial number	PF34SMXB Experience	Windows Feature Experience Pack 1000.22644.1000.0 </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1160;firefox-11602;,firefox,other,en-US,1596087;,janene.l.pierce
