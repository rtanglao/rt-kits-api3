Recently I upgraded my antivirus to bitdefender total security with firewall module. I set it to ask me about permission to connect with internet for every process on windows. I was very surprised to see that <strong>default-browser-agent.exe tried to connect to internet</strong>. I checked my privacy and telemetry settings again, but they are all disabled. I checked internet and found this mozilla article: <a href=""https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/data/default-browser-ping.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/toolkit/components/telemetry/data/default-browser-ping.html</a> You can read there that ""opting out of telemetry does disable it; the pref value is copied to the registry so that the default browser agent can read it without needing to work with profiles"". I <strong>opted out from all possible telemetry, both visible in settings and hidden in about:config</strong>(based on lists of telemtry-related options from web). </p><p>Is there any way to actually disable this ping? It tries to connect with internet every 24h.  I guess I can simply remove it from windows task scheduler but I want mozilla to respect my privacy settings and disable it solely using browser built-in settings! </p><p>Old article on web stated that this can be easily disabled by disabling setting responsible for sending technical data ( <a href=""https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/firefox-now-tells-mozilla-what-your-default-browser-is-every-day/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/firefox-now-tells-mozilla-what-your-default-browser-is-every-day/</a> ) but I have it disabled and it is clearly ignored!!! </p><p>P.S.
