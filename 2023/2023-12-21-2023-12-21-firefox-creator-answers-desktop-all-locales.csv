After recently following the upgrade path from FF v52 to the most recent FF version, I find that logins in logins.json did not carry over with the upgrade. Out of 555 logins, only 44 appear. (I suspect these may have been imported from Chrome, since FF also imported my Chrome bookmarks without acknowledgment.) I see that the old logins are still in logins.json, and logins.json appears to be valid JSON when opening with FF. </p><p>I tried ensuring that logins.json, key3.db, and key4.db had matching timestamps, but that didn't correct the problem. I tried replacing key3.db and logins.json with copies from a backup of the v52 profile (it has no key4.db--is key3.db no longer used?), but then zero logins appeared (why I think the ones that do appear may originate with Chrome). I tried exporting logins to CSV, but it only captured those 44. I can see the logins are in logins.json, but the passwords are hashed/obscured. </p><p>I have profile backups, but I don't find a way to import the logins. (If I had to make a wild guess, I'd say the upgrade might have ignored my key3.db that paired with my logins.json, and created a new key4.db full of Chrome logins instead.) </p><p>How might I recover my logins from either the in-use logins.json or from my profile backup? </p><p>Thank you! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1210;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",FamousMoroccanServals
