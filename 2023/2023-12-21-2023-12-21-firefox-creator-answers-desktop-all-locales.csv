Specifically google used all this ""modern web"" nonsense to become the monopolistic browser in place of internet explorer and to use that ""power"" explicitly to bend the future web to their will. </p><p>This is so upsetting, there are not words to describe it. And the fact that the ""answer"" is that folks who spent years and thousands of lines of code for Flash, now ""simply need to completely re code everything from scratch in a new language"" is offensive beyond recognition. </p><p>Please consider removing this ""standard"" response language or at least acknowledge the awful burden that was placed on folks by the decision to join the rest to remove the most popular web technology that helped build the internet, because google must serve everyone ads. It is just gross. </p><p>Honestly, we thought Firefox would defy the witch hunt and keep flash working to differentiate and look after the poor developers who suffered from this terrible, terrible action. </p><p>p.s. on the day Flash was officially killed off, chrome had more active ""severe"" security vulnerabilities than Flash. Thus, chrome is objectively less secure than Flash. I wonder how much google spent on paying news companies to post stuff about how ""insecure"" flash is and the stupid ""modern web.""

After recently following the upgrade path from FF v52 to the most recent FF version, I find that logins in logins.json did not carry over with the upgrade. Out of 555 logins, only 44 appear. (I suspect these may have been imported from Chrome, since FF also imported my Chrome bookmarks without acknowledgment.) I see that the old logins are still in logins.json, and logins.json appears to be valid JSON when opening with FF. </p><p>I tried ensuring that logins.json, key3.db, and key4.db had matching timestamps, but that didn't correct the problem. I tried replacing key3.db and logins.json with copies from a backup of the v52 profile (it has no key4.db--is key3.db no longer used?), but then zero logins appeared (why I think the ones that do appear may originate with Chrome). I tried exporting logins to CSV, but it only captured those 44. I can see the logins are in logins.json, but the passwords are hashed/obscured. </p><p>I have profile backups, but I don't find a way to import the logins. (If I had to make a wild guess, I'd say the upgrade might have ignored my key3.db that paired with my logins.json, and created a new key4.db full of Chrome logins instead.) </p><p>How might I recover my logins from either the in-use logins.json or from my profile backup? </p><p>Thank you! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1210;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",FamousMoroccanServals
