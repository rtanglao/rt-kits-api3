Both the div and video have a border-radius styled in css. This renders as expected on most browsers, but seems to have a potential issue on Firefox on Widows 10 where the video does not have the border-radius and shows up with square edges. Any thoughts on this? If you try other browsers or Firefox on anything besides Windows 10, it is round like expected. </p><p><a href=""https://www.flipindustries.tk/games/hopandbop/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.flipindustries.tk/games/hopandbop/</a> </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1200;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",sorzubulte

I wasn't really sure what to do at this point, so I tried to just reset all the modified settings to attempt to get back to the first download settings. However, I was unable to do this and now Firefox can't load any pages, even when I've deleted the browser and redownloaded it. How can I get a completely fresh download, or even can I? I'm not tech savvy and extremely frustrated at this point. </p>",desktop;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1625616;,rachaelpoulin1997

Error messages indicate that my browser is unsupported and I need the newest version of Firefox, but my browser is completely up-to-date. Pausing my adblocker on these sites does nothing to correct the issue, nor does restarting the browser or my computer. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1014;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1625618;,ekdhale

I would like to hide it. However, I have tried just about every answer I could find on Mozilla, Google, Reddit, and any other websites that offered solutions. Nothing has worked since the last update. This includes the ""type in about:config, toggle to true, open profile folder, create userChrome.css file, copy and paste xyz code, save, and restart Firefox"" route. </p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated! </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-11;firefox-1210;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",abaulkwill
