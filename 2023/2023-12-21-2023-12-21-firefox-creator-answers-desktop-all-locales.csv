Error messages indicate that my browser is unsupported and I need the newest version of Firefox, but my browser is completely up-to-date.

I would like to hide it. However, I have tried just about every answer I could find on Mozilla, Google, Reddit, and any other websites that offered solutions. Nothing has worked since the last update. This includes the ""type in about:config, toggle to true, open profile folder, create userChrome.css file, copy and paste xyz code, save, and restart Firefox"" route. </p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated! </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-11;firefox-1210;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",abaulkwill
