Recommends I change my password.  if I change it, will it eliminate ALL of my saved passwords for other sites?  That would be a huge problem since I have so many, and a lot are for medical offices. How would I change my password? Please be very patient with me - and send very detailed instructions since I am not technology savvy. Thank you in advance for your reply. </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",SandraJo

It IS available in Chrome. When I go into Firefox troubleshoot mode, I can reach the site. So, supposedly, that's pointing to a problem with an extension, theme, or hardware acceleration. So I disable ALL extensions, use the default theme (which I've always used), and turned off hardware acceleration. After all that, I STILL can't access the website. So troubleshoot mode is doing something else. What might that be? You can try the website yourself - <a href=""http://fiso.spiritastro.net/test.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fiso.spiritastro.net/test.html</a>. That test site doesn't work, nor do others in that subdomain. Any assistance with this would be much appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",danflester

No error message,"<p>I switched to Firefox a couple of months ago because I don't like the privacy policies of Chrome. It was working fine until last week, but now, it doesn't let me go to <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> or type searches. It just goes in an endless search loop and gives up without any error message. Nothing has changed from what I've seen/done since before it started. I have tried all the fixes mentioned by people trying to troubleshoot loading issues with Firefox. Cleared all history, caches and so forth. I tried to start it in Safe Mode. I tried various about:config tricks. Nothing has worked.  Sometimes randomly it works for a hot minute but ultimately stops. However, otherwise it works great with website url that I type directly into the bar or any bookmarked sites or links I click on. It's just <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> or word based searches. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",addy2
