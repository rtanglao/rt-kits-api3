I have been trying multiple things since yesterday, but nothing seems to fix the issue, like logging out and logging back in, trying to manually sync etc.  This seems like a bug to me.  </p><p>I wanted to start using Firefix passwords on my Android device as well, but this issue is making it difficult for me.

I suppose there may have been a way to get everything back, but I didn't have access to that info at the time.  I transferred my bookmarks from my other browsers to Firefox, but they just show up in a folder.  Is there any way to transfer all of it so that everything shows on one list, without moving each one line by line? </p>",windows-7;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",abba1066

It IS available in Chrome. When I go into Firefox troubleshoot mode, I can reach the site. So, supposedly, that's pointing to a problem with an extension, theme, or hardware acceleration. So I disable ALL extensions, use the default theme (which I've always used), and turned off hardware acceleration. After all that, I STILL can't access the website. So troubleshoot mode is doing something else. What might that be? You can try the website yourself - <a href=""http://fiso.spiritastro.net/test.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fiso.spiritastro.net/test.html</a>. That test site doesn't work, nor do others in that subdomain. Any assistance with this would be much appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",danflester

No error message,"<p>I switched to Firefox a couple of months ago because I don't like the privacy policies of Chrome. It was working fine until last week, but now, it doesn't let me go to <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> or type searches. It just goes in an endless search loop and gives up without any error message. Nothing has changed from what I've seen/done since before it started. I have tried all the fixes mentioned by people trying to troubleshoot loading issues with Firefox. Cleared all history, caches and so forth. I tried to start it in Safe Mode. I tried various about:config tricks. Nothing has worked.  Sometimes randomly it works for a hot minute but ultimately stops. However, otherwise it works great with website url that I type directly into the bar or any bookmarked sites or links I click on. It's just <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> or word based searches. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",addy2
