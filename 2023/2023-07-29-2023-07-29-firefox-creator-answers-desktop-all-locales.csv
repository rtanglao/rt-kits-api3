This occurs with a pre-registered security key (Yubikey 5C NFC on most recent firmware) that has a PIN already configured. This key works on all other browsers and devices without trouble. Firefox is unresponsive to Yubikey interaction after the notice ""Touch your security key to continue with &lt;company&gt;.okta.com"" and will eventually time out if I do not cancel.  </p><p>On the other hand, I can register a new security key on Okta through Firefox on this device. When I go through the registration workflow, Firefox is responsive to all interactions, allowing me to enter my PIN and complete registration. </p><p>I have been able to replicate this issue on other computers and with a different user / security key. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1150;firefox-11503;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",clinton.campbell
