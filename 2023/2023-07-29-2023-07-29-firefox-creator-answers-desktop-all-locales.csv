I've always suspected it is due to a sample rate mismatch between FF and my MOTU UltraLite Hybrid MK3, which is always set at 48kHz. I've tried myriad settings to remedy the issue to no avail. Here is an example - scroll down to the Demos: section and play one of the streams. </p><p>Today, I tried opening the same web page in Edge and all of the streams I tried played PERFECTLY without the clicking and popping. I click back over to FF and play the streams and there is the clicking and popping. This leads me to believe that this is a FF problem, and not with the audio interface or Windows 10 Sound. Sometimes, rarely, I experience the same issue with YouTube videos, but it is always with audio streams. </p><p>Does anyone know why this occurs and if there is a way to fix it. It is so frustrating that I'm seriously considering giving up on FF after 20+ years. This has been happening as long as I can remember, and I kept hoping it would get resolved at some point, or I'd find a fix or hidden setting, but that doesn't look likely. Maybe somebody can help? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1150;,firefox,other,en-US,"",907shane
