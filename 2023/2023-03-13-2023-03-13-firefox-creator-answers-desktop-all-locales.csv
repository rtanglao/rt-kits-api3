(Text entry boxes, such as the browser URL-bar, the e-mail To/Subject/Content textboxes, online forms, etc.). Now in the latest versions of Mozilla Firefox 110.0.1 and Thunderbird 102.8.0 the caret stops blinking after just a few seconds. This is very confusing and frustrating for my grandmother and she already called me several times because Firefox and Thunderbird 'stopped working'. I explained to her that this is a new feature but she does not understand and keeps forgetting it after a few days. She is used to the cared blinking continuously, it has been blinking for the past decades whenever she wanted to type something in the computer and it only stopped blinking when the computer program froze or crashed. </p><p>I am sure that my grandma is not the only person having issues with the caret not flashing, I for one also would like to have a caret that blinks forever, so when I look away from the screen and look back I do not have to search the text to find where I left my caret. </p><p>Please make it so that the default caret appearance and behavior is the same as in all other programs (i.e. blinking forever), as it used to be in the past, just like what everyone is used to. I argue that the majority of users is used to and also expects a blinking caret when they are writing an e-mail or search online and you are confusing a whole lot of people with this minor change, people who do not know how to report bugs or seek help themselves. It's a sign of poor user-friendliness if grandmas need to call their grandchildren or children for help just to write e-mails which they used to be able to do on their own for many years in the past. </p><p>I hereby suggest adding an accessibility option for people who wish to disable the blinking cursor and to change the default behavior back to 'caret flashing forever'. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",JetPackJan

On some site, when I open a side screen (e.g. select a particular flight on expedia) the scroll bar on the screen that shows up isn't accessible.  That means I can't get to the bottom of that screen to continue making a selection.  There are two scroll bars on the right side.  One controls that page in back and works fine.  I think the other (which is much fainter and thinner) is supposed to control the side screen, abut can't be accessed.  Is this some sort of a setting issue that I can adjust? </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,other,en-US,"",bcrabbe33

I want to keep it on, but ever since I installed it, every time Firefox is opened it stays up for anywhere between 20 seconds to 2 minutes, before force closing. No errors are given. For clarity, I am not the parent and do not have parental access, but I have worked with the person who does have access and they receive no reports of any problems. I am also on Windows 10. Qustodio has been a great service, but after reaching out to their team they haven't been able to find a solution either. Other browsers such as Brave also force close within the same time window. I haven't tried any others besides Microsoft Edge, which is the only browser that works. God would I hate to use that.  Services such as Steam and Discord have had no issues.  I've extensively searched to make sure I had no add-ons, external services/anti spywares, or settings that might cause this - including setting about:config&gt;root&gt;security preferences to true - and have refreshed/reinstalled countless times, yet still the browser crashes. I can and am currently using Firefox just fine on my iPhone, so it does not appear to be a network error. Would anyone be able to help? Having 0 error reports makes this much more difficult to troubleshoot. After doing some searching, it seems no one else has reported this being an issue. Thank you. The search engine I use on both iPhone and laptop is Google. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1570301;,ethandf03
