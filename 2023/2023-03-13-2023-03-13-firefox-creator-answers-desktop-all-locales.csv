I want to keep it on, but ever since I installed it, every time Firefox is opened it stays up for anywhere between 20 seconds to 2 minutes, before force closing. No errors are given. For clarity, I am not the parent and do not have parental access, but I have worked with the person who does have access and they receive no reports of any problems. I am also on Windows 10. Qustodio has been a great service, but after reaching out to their team they haven't been able to find a solution either. Other browsers such as Brave also force close within the same time window. I haven't tried any others besides Microsoft Edge, which is the only browser that works. God would I hate to use that.  Services such as Steam and Discord have had no issues.  I've extensively searched to make sure I had no add-ons, external services/anti spywares, or settings that might cause this - including setting about:config&gt;root&gt;security preferences to true - and have refreshed/reinstalled countless times, yet still the browser crashes. I can and am currently using Firefox just fine on my iPhone, so it does not appear to be a network error. Would anyone be able to help? Having 0 error reports makes this much more difficult to troubleshoot. After doing some searching, it seems no one else has reported this being an issue. Thank you. The search engine I use on both iPhone and laptop is Google. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1570301;,ethandf03
