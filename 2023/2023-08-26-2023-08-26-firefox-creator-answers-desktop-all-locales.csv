However, the accepted solution was not the answer for my situation, since the ownership of the <em>~/.local/share/</em> directory was correct on my system. </p><p>In my case the slow start-up resulted from the <em>xdg-desktop-portal-gtk</em> service failing to start because of <strong>DISPLAY</strong> setting issue.
