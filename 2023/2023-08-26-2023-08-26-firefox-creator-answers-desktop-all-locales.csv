However, the accepted solution was not the answer for my situation, since the ownership of the <em>~/.local/share/</em> directory was correct on my system. </p><p>In my case the slow start-up resulted from the <em>xdg-desktop-portal-gtk</em> service failing to start because of <strong>DISPLAY</strong> setting issue. This was a difficult issue to debug, since the console wasn't showing timeout errors resulting from Firefox not being able to communicate with the <em>xdg-desktop-portal-gtk</em> service. </p><p>My fix was is elegant, but works: </p> <ol><li> Edit <em>/usr/lib/systemd/user/xdg-desktop-portal-gtk.service</em> and add the line <em>Environment=""DISPLAY=:1.0""</em> under the ""[Service]"" line. </li><li> sudo systemctl daemon-reload </li><li> systemctl --user restart xdg-desktop-portal-gtk </li><li> To get the service to start correctly every time I start a VNC server, I also added this line (systemctl --user restart xdg-desktop-portal-gtk) to my <em>~/.vnc/xstartup</em> file </li></ol> <p>While I think this solution will continue to work, because my DISPLAY is always&nbsp;:1.0 when I use Firefox, I would rather have the <em>xdg-desktop-portal-gtk</em> service figure out the correct DISPLAY setting.
