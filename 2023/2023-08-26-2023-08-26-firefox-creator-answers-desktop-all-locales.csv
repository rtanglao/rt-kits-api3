I tried to adjust it back to 125%, but it still resets. I went and changed the zoom max/min to 100% min and 150% max and now it stays at 100% every time.

I don't like what I've been reading about the latest update, my machines are old and I'm not ready to upgrade so I don't want an even more overloaded/uses up more CPU, etc., version of Firefox.   I don't have complex needs in a browser, so some of the ""upgrades"" haven't been useful for me or have made using FF more difficult. </p><pre>  I found a list of what I guess are older versions but no information was provided on how to choose a version of say v. 110, to make sure it's the right one for my laptop and/desktop (or the one that will work w/the fewest problems) that it's in English, etc.      My impression is that FF is mostly worked on by people who have a variety of needs &amp; interests so increasing sophistication is what they want and that's fine, I'd like to keep using FF w/my current machines, w/as simple a version ,ie., useful for an unsophisticated user.    Is that possible?    If so, I'd like to upgrade to 110 64 bit or perhaps 111 64 bit unless either or both had huge security holes, etc and many users found they weren't very functional.   I do have security software. </pre>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1090;firefox-10901;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",azure7

I was using Firefox to do work online on Thursday (8/24). I shut my laptop down as usual at the end of the day. No issues. The next day on Friday (8/25), I turned on my laptop to do some work...no problems starting my laptop. So...that is when I discovered that my entire history is gone, bookmarks, tabs, and passwords. I have been searching through the help section and have tried to locate files to restore bookmarks and history; however, those files only have my history as of Friday (8/25) and nothing prior. So, I'm at a total loss for how to recover anything but I feel none of this is recoverable at all. I had a tabs up that were important and LOTS of important bookmarks which are probably gone. I couldn't even begin to remember all the bookmarks I had. Don't even get me going with my passwords because I will now probably have to go through the (time consuming) process of resetting my passwords on LOTS of sites. I have never encountered a situation like this where EVERYTHING was wiped. I did see that some sort of update happened on Monday (8/21) but I didn't have any problems until starting my laptop on Friday (8/25). I probably put my laptop into sleep mode M-T-W, and then when I completely shut my computer off Thursday night, everything was wiped on Friday when I turned it on because it probably updated from the update on Monday. Any thoughts? I hold out no hope to get any of this information back. Thanks! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,other,en-US,1599977;1599997;,lindaoncapecod

However, the accepted solution was not the answer for my situation, since the ownership of the <em>~/.local/share/</em> directory was correct on my system. </p><p>In my case the slow start-up resulted from the <em>xdg-desktop-portal-gtk</em> service failing to start because of <strong>DISPLAY</strong> setting issue. This was a difficult issue to debug, since the console wasn't showing timeout errors resulting from Firefox not being able to communicate with the <em>xdg-desktop-portal-gtk</em> service. </p><p>My fix was is elegant, but works: </p> <ol><li> Edit <em>/usr/lib/systemd/user/xdg-desktop-portal-gtk.service</em> and add the line <em>Environment=""DISPLAY=:1.0""</em> under the ""[Service]"" line. </li><li> sudo systemctl daemon-reload </li><li> systemctl --user restart xdg-desktop-portal-gtk </li><li> To get the service to start correctly every time I start a VNC server, I also added this line (systemctl --user restart xdg-desktop-portal-gtk) to my <em>~/.vnc/xstartup</em> file </li></ol> <p>While I think this solution will continue to work, because my DISPLAY is always&nbsp;:1.0 when I use Firefox, I would rather have the <em>xdg-desktop-portal-gtk</em> service figure out the correct DISPLAY setting. Are there any suggestions on how to do that? Or, is there a way to configure Firefox to not rely on this service? </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;ubuntu-2204;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",kgs068wer
