I can view the file in Gmail by clicking on the body of the Gmail attachment icon but the download button within the Gmail file viewer (top right) doesn't work either. So far as I can tell, this behaviour is confined to Gmail alone (i.e.: <a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox</a>) ... I am able to get the file download dialog for PDF document download links at other websites and successfully retrieve PDF files. What have the developers changed now?  Whatever it was, quit it. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Frankenstien

I want to start using Nightly, but dislike the continual moving of passwords &amp; bookmarks, so I just want to use Firefox Sync for this.  </p><p>(1) Is Sync a good option for me here? I would use FDE &amp; Nightly on the same laptop. </p><p>(2) If my plan is ok, what is the best way to start with a new Nightly profile (which I would then Sync)? I tried deleting my old Nightly profile, uninstalling Nightly, and then downloading &amp; uninstalling Nightly again, but every time I do this (including a reboot after uninstalling), I get a profile cannot be loaded error message every time I try to start Nightly. I don't want to use an old profile with Nightly, because I do not want to sync old data at all.  </p><p>Suggestions? </p>",desktop;beta;download-and-install_1;windows-11;firefox-1120;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1573620;1573622;,prr

I got it working again but now Firefox doesn't have my logins for some reason. The Profile folder showed logins.json, logins.json.corrupt, and logins-backup.json. I changed logins.json to logins-old.json and changed logins.json.corrupt to logins.json like I saw in many solutions but that does not work. It just becomes logins.json.corrupt again. I tried the same with Logins-backup.json but still just changed to corrupt. I refreshed firefox but still the same. I made a new profile and copied the file and tried to get it to work there but still changes back to corrupt every time. I'm Windows 8.1 so there is no Previous Versions tab in properties so I can't go back to a previous version of the file. Is there ajny way to fix this and get my passwords back? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-81;firefox-1110;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1573594;,bredwh

I haven't changed these settings at all recently, so I'm not sure what's causing it. For some reason, this is a non-issue when I'm logged out of my account as the subtitles automatically work when I'm not signed in. So I know it isn't an issue of there being no subtitles option for the videos I'm watching.  </p><p>Is there some way to fix this? </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1110;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1573606;,hayrunn.b

No ability to read email and the whole presentation was drastically different and unusable. I can open AOL just fine on my IPhone through the AOL app or by just checking mail.   I called tech support at AOL and they directed me to use a different browser. I switched to Google Chrome and could see the normal AOL in both the classic and new format.  I hope that you figure out what the interface problem is as I prefer Firefox's privacy and other policies. But I can't use it on my laptop unless you solve the problem. Just sayin'.
