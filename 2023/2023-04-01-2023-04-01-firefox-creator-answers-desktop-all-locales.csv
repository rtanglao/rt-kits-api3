I haven't changed these settings at all recently, so I'm not sure what's causing it. For some reason, this is a non-issue when I'm logged out of my account as the subtitles automatically work when I'm not signed in. So I know it isn't an issue of there being no subtitles option for the videos I'm watching.  </p><p>Is there some way to fix this? </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1110;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",hayrunn.b

No ability to read email and the whole presentation was drastically different and unusable. I can open AOL just fine on my IPhone through the AOL app or by just checking mail.   I called tech support at AOL and they directed me to use a different browser. I switched to Google Chrome and could see the normal AOL in both the classic and new format.  I hope that you figure out what the interface problem is as I prefer Firefox's privacy and other policies. But I can't use it on my laptop unless you solve the problem. Just sayin'.

For years if you click mutliple files a new button pops up that says share and allows you to  send all that has been checked, as of today I can say that no longer happens. I tried in Edge and it still works fine.
