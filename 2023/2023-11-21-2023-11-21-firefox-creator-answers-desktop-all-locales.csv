Setting DNS to <em>Increased Protection</em> fixed it. It's partly just curiosity but also concern that I'm asking if there is an issue that should be addressed. </p><p>The basic scenario: could not access one particular domain only in FF on one computer. No problems with FF on other devices and no problem with other browsers on the computer in question. Configuring DNS settings to Increased Protection is the only thing that allowed me to access that site (which happens to be the org I work for). So the setting is only necessary on this device and only for that domain.  </p><p>What's the explanation or solution for ensuring I don't have other DNS issues, or something else, that will be a problem later? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",lifespan
