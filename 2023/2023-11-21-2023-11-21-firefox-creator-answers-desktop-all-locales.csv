Since updating to the last version (119.0.1), Firefox started keeping my open tabs between sessions. This is a behavior I don't want, and the only solution that I found told me to enable ""clear history on close"", however that is also not ideal, because I don't want to clear my history. The ""Open previous windows and tabs"" setting is off and my homepage is set to Firefox Default. I don't know where else to look for such a setting, except in the about:config, but even there I'm not sure which one is causing the issue. Any assistance would be appreciated. </p><p>Windows 10 Pro 21H2, Firefox 119.0.1 </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1619149;,honigkuchen

Only FF Linux? Only the particular (default) settings of my Linux Mint 20.3 Cinnamon installation, and display?

Setting DNS to <em>Increased Protection</em> fixed it. It's partly just curiosity but also concern that I'm asking if there is an issue that should be addressed. </p><p>The basic scenario: could not access one particular domain only in FF on one computer. No problems with FF on other devices and no problem with other browsers on the computer in question. Configuring DNS settings to Increased Protection is the only thing that allowed me to access that site (which happens to be the org I work for). So the setting is only necessary on this device and only for that domain.  </p><p>What's the explanation or solution for ensuring I don't have other DNS issues, or something else, that will be a problem later? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1619144;,lifespan
