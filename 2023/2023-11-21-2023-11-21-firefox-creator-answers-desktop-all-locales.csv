When I use a different browser I don't have this problem.","<p>With increasing frequency, when I open Yahoo in Firefox, there are no photos on the site and I can't access my email.  In order to fix this, I have to shut off my computer and do a clean reboot. Then it works for a while, but then, all of a sudden I have the problem again.   When I use a different browser (Chrome, Edge), I never have this problem.  I thought it was Ghostery that was interfering, because Ghostery does screen out a lot of stuff, so I turned Ghostery off.  It made no difference.  What solution do you have to offer for this problem?  I really don't want to switch to Chrome or Edge, because Firefox's general user interface is so far superior, but the issue I have described is a serious one.  (There are two or three other websites that also don't work with Firefox when it comes to user doing data input on the site, but I'll be sending a separate inquiry on that). </p><p>Thank you, Alan Rosenbaum </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,other,en-US,"",alanbala

This means I can type something like `kagi foobar` to search Kagi for `foobar`. However the awesome bar has a ""feature"" where if you type a question mark (?) anywhere it instead uses the default search engine. This means that `kagi How do I cook a turkey?` searches my default search engine for ""kagi How do I cook a turkey?"" rather than searching Kagi (based on the `kagi` keyword). Is there a way to disable this behaviour? </p><p>I have searched about:config and ""Search Shortcuts"" in preferences doesn't have a `?`. I never use `?` as a shortcut to search (I just type the keyword for the engine I want) so completely removing it would be perfect. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,customize,en-US,1619210;1619212;,kevincox

Regularly when I open a long email from organisations I subscribe to the email opens near it's end, it does does not open scrolled to the start of the email. This happens randomly with various websites, it is not associated with any specific website. I reported this to Microsoft Support. At their suggestion I tried using MS Outlook in Google Chrome. I have not experienced this problem in Google Chrome. For the last 3-4 days I have used Outlook in both Firefox and Google Chrome. On each day I have experienced emails opening near their end when first viewed in Firefox but not in Chrome. I have not had even one experience of this problem in Chrome so my conclusion is the problem must be an issue with Firefox's interaction with MS Outlook. I want to use Firefox but this problem is becoming very annoying and at the moment my go-to browser for email is Chrome. I spend several hours a day on-line and normally use Firefox for my internet browsing. I have not had any problems with any website other than this scrolling problem with Outlook.  I'm not sure exactly when this problem started but have been aware of it for probably 2-3 weeks. This is a random problem, I don't have any screenshots to share with you.

Of course, one profile directory (of a few existing) is a default one. 2) is there any setting in Firefox configuration/FF ADMX Policy/anywhere else, which can help to leave only a default Firefox profile and remove old unused profiles automatically? I know, that it's possible to do that manually by running firefox.exe -p , removing unused profiles and leaving only a default one, but that is not an option.
