Each user has Firefox profiles generated in C:\Users\[USER_NAME]\AppData\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles , but only one profile is a default profile for each individual user. I have two main questions, related to the profiles: 1) in which circumstances a new profile is generated? I see, some users have 3 profile directories, some 5 profile directories. Of course, one profile directory (of a few existing) is a default one. 2) is there any setting in Firefox configuration/FF ADMX Policy/anywhere else, which can help to leave only a default Firefox profile and remove old unused profiles automatically? I know, that it's possible to do that manually by running firefox.exe -p , removing unused profiles and leaving only a default one, but that is not an option. Solution should be automated. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",baubas100

I termini, le parole e le frasi sono storpiate o modificate (v. le schermate allegate di Alice, in un confronto tra quello che leggo su Firefox e quello che leggo su EDGE). Sul sito di Virgilio ci sono sia le storpiature delle frasi e dei titoli delle cartelle di posta, che la mancanza delle icone di funzionalità (esempio: per uscire dal sito oppure i menù a tendina delle cartelle della posta non si aprono).

Is it unsafe?,"<p>Hi everyone, </p><p>I'm new to Firefox, I have been looking for the answer for a while but did not seem to find it. </p><p>Firefox is set by default to open PDF files, and I just noticed when right clicking the icon, it shows the recent list of documents that were opened before. My question would be whether it means that the PDF is somewhat saved within Firefox (as well as on the computer), and from a security perspective, could potentially visiting an unsafe website or cookies stored be able to access and compromise the documents previously viewed that are in the browser's 'recent' list? The same question would be for uBlock Origin which is running as an adblocker, is there a safety concern with that when opening PDFs through FF? </p><p>Many thanks in advance! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Partibgf

No problems with FF on other devices and no problem with other browsers on the computer in question.
