When you sign in to Sync, you are pulling settings from Firefox servers. </p><p>Both of these steps are referred to interchangeably as ""syncing"" and there is next to no documentation of what causes each to occur nor what they actually do. </p><p>Why is this dangerous you might ask? Well, let's say I buy a new computer, I want to set it up the same way I use all my devices, so I sign in to sync to synchronize my settings, makes perfect sense. Nothing tells me anything is happening when I sign in, so I click the sync button because I want to synchronize my settings with my other devices. Big mistake. I've just overwritten the server-side sync profile with a default Firefox profile. You know how you fix that? You sign in and press the sync button to overwrite the sync profile again. But you know what happens when you sign in? You become synced with the now blank sync profile and lose all the settings that you want to be pushing to the sync profile. This just happened to me. Thankfully I was only choosing to sync add-ons and options AT THE TIME and I have backups that are about 6 months old and I rarely change settings, but some things like my homepage URLs are something that I do change fairly often, and I'm sure some additional sites were whitelisted since by default I just reject all cookies. I also thankfully use policies.json to block updates so I didn't immediately get assaulted by that too. </p><p>SO! I HIGHLY suggest that when merely signing in to Sync, the default should be for syncing to be off to start off with, so that you can choose what to ""sync"" BEFORE it occurs. However, because of the language, the question arises, what am I choosing to sync for? Am I choosing what to PULL from servers? Or am I choosing what gets PUSHED to the servers? When syncing is turned on, does that mean I an pulling the settings that I have chosen? Or am I am pulling ALL settings while only pushing what I have chosen IF I click the Sync button? Or do I push EVERYTHING? </p><p>It's incredibly unclear how the Sync feature works and both of the ""main"" articles on it are completely useless for understanding it because the term ""sync"" is used interchangeably for pushing or pulling settings. </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-choose-what-information-sync-firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-choose-what-information-sync-firefox</a> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/sync-custom-preferences"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/sync-custom-preferences</a> </p><p>What are the correct steps to rectify this horrid situation? Sign-in, set-up sync, choose ""Options"" and ""Add-Ons"" again, THEN copy over the backup settings, THEN Sync them to the ""cloud""? If I have 2 different devices setup with sync, and 1 chooses to sync options and the other chooses to sync bookmarks, then I click sync on BOTH devices repeatedly, what occurs? </p>",desktop;sync;windows-81;firefox-7815;firefox-78150;,firefox,sync,en-US,1619233;,neijyry

But then I encounteted problems with horizontal scrolling with this mouse. Looks like Firefox recognized horizontal scrolling button of tilt wheel as left and right so it end up making the experience terrible when I want to scroll page with the tilt wheel. For example, when scrolling horizontally using tilt wheel among tabs in video sites like Youtube, the video will go backward or forward too. Similar thing also happens when texting, making horizontal scrolling in some forums became slow. I've tried a lot of ways, including disabling the 4th and 5th button of mouse in about:config, but none of those solutions works.

In order to fix this, I have to shut off my computer and do a clean reboot. Then it works for a while, but then, all of a sudden I have the problem again.   When I use a different browser (Chrome, Edge), I never have this problem.  I thought it was Ghostery that was interfering, because Ghostery does screen out a lot of stuff, so I turned Ghostery off.  It made no difference.  What solution do you have to offer for this problem?  I really don't want to switch to Chrome or Edge, because Firefox's general user interface is so far superior, but the issue I have described is a serious one.

Regularly when I open a long email from organisations I subscribe to the email opens near it's end, it does does not open scrolled to the start of the email. This happens randomly with various websites, it is not associated with any specific website. I reported this to Microsoft Support. At their suggestion I tried using MS Outlook in Google Chrome. I have not experienced this problem in Google Chrome. For the last 3-4 days I have used Outlook in both Firefox and Google Chrome. On each day I have experienced emails opening near their end when first viewed in Firefox but not in Chrome. I have not had even one experience of this problem in Chrome so my conclusion is the problem must be an issue with Firefox's interaction with MS Outlook. I want to use Firefox but this problem is becoming very annoying and at the moment my go-to browser for email is Chrome. I spend several hours a day on-line and normally use Firefox for my internet browsing. I have not had any problems with any website other than this scrolling problem with Outlook.  I'm not sure exactly when this problem started but have been aware of it for probably 2-3 weeks. This is a random problem, I don't have any screenshots to share with you.

Setting DNS to <em>Increased Protection</em> fixed it. It's partly just curiosity but also concern that I'm asking if there is an issue that should be addressed. </p><p>The basic scenario: could not access one particular domain only in FF on one computer. No problems with FF on other devices and no problem with other browsers on the computer in question. Configuring DNS settings to Increased Protection is the only thing that allowed me to access that site (which happens to be the org I work for). So the setting is only necessary on this device and only for that domain.  </p><p>What's the explanation or solution for ensuring I don't have other DNS issues, or something else, that will be a problem later? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1619144;1619203;,lifespan
