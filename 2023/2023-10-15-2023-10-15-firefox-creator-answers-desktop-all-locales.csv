I get the following error message; Access Denied You don't have permission to access ""<a href=""http://signon.navyfederal.org/siteminderagent/forms/mfa.fcc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://signon.navyfederal.org/siteminderagent/forms/mfa.fcc</a>"" on this server. </p><p>Reference #18.82b3417.1697332724.50b30aec  </p><p>I have had to turn off the ad blockers in the past and delete all the history including sign ins to get it to work again. This update I again went through all of that and also tried turning off every extension, turning off firefox tracking blocker and even reset the network setting to no proxy. Nothing works. Will I have to go back to using the google spyware browser just so I can do my banking? Or can this problem finally be fixed?  If firefox worked with NFCU forten years prior without any difficulty I don't know why it cant be fixed. </p>",linux;desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",mrsmelser

When I start playlist and switch to a different tab (or minimize browser) first video will play normally and it will autoplay the next one. But after finishing playing 2d video (3d in some cases) video will just stop at the end of playbar and not autoplay the next one in playlist. Playlist for example: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giUY_pEKTzY&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nKmglmCCbx14WeFyH8e7YGYcL5skYwnp0&amp;index=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giUY_pEKTzY&amp;list=OLAK5uy_nKmglmCCbx14WeFyH8e7YGYcL5skYwnp0&amp;index=1</a> </p><p>It's rather easy to replicate, I can record desktop video if needed. </p><p>Expected behavior: I can start YouTube playlist playing and switch to a different tab or minimize browser and playlist will only stop after playing last video in said playlist (unless ""Loop playlist"" option is enabled). </p><p>What I've tried to do so far: 1) <strong>Googling:</strong> I only was able to find old thread and the culprit was extension: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/952608"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/952608</a> 2) <strong>Disabling Extensions and confirming issue in Troubleshoot Mode: </strong> Did not help 3) <strong>Clear cache &amp; cookies for YouTube:</strong> Did not help 4) <strong>""Allow Audio and Video"" autoplay for YouTube:</strong> Did not help 5) <strong>Confirming issue in another browser:</strong> Works as intended in Opera 6) <strong>Checking about:config:</strong> I'm not that savvy with Firefox config to understand what may cause an issue. Tried to change media.block-autoplay-until-in-foreground to False. Did not help, rolled it back to True. </p><p>What I have noticed: 1) Firefox recent update:  118.0.2 <strong>October 10, 2023</strong>: Correlates when I started experiencing this issue. 2) YouTube playlists plays next video continuously just fine if I don't minimize browser or switch to a different tab. 3) There is a Firefox extension that does exactly what I don't want in my experience: <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/no-playlist-autoplay-for-yt/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/no-playlist-autoplay-for-yt/</a> I installed it just to check. And yes, it does what expected and it is similar to what I'm experiencing. Although it stops playlist after finishing first video, my issues go into the affect after playing first video. (Deleted it after testing) </p><p>Before posting I've tried a few different things and here where things gets extremely weird: 1) It works just fine in Firefox if I log out from my YouTube account: (Incognito/Main tab) Do not work if I'm logged in, even in Incognito. However... 2) It works just fine in Opera if I'm logged in my YouTube account. 3) It works just fine if I open playlist in mini-player. (Current workaround) </p><p>After all that weirdness I attempted to Clear cache &amp; cookies for YouTube and it did not help once again. </p><p>P.S. Yes, I use YouTube as a music player.&nbsp;:) </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",ArgulKit
