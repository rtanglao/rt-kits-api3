You will then see a result that can be changed from True to False. 4. Set to False to disable the Encrypted Client Hello feature I change it to False to disable it, but when I close the browser again it activates True. That is, the changes are not saved. Please, how could I disable the Encrypted Client Hello function in the browser? Since following the previous steps the changes made when closing the browser are not saved.
