I am signed in to the same sync account on all of them.  I would like to be able to see the history from other devices, or preferably, a chronological list of sites that I have visited in a single list. </p><p>I'm currently using Firefox on my home PC and when I click on the ""Firefox Account"" button, I can see a list of tabs that are open on the various devices.  But when I go into History/ManageHistory, I mostly see the history of just this PC.  I see some items from other devices, but a very small percentage. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",sanjosanjo

It's just a broad, pale blue area above the page content, barely distinguished from the white background of the content itself.  I can't see the address bar, either.  Why don't applications use borders any more?  It's really, really annoying.  At least the + sign to create a new tab has made a re-appearance, along with the X's on the tabs to close them  (I couldn't find them when I started up Windows this morning, started searching frantically for a setting to display them as it seemed like there was no tab bar at all, and eventually they reappeared and I have no idea how). </p><p>I really hope there is something to be done short of editing a .css file somewhere, but if that's what has to be done, please tell me where to find the file and ideally, what elements in it I need to modify. </p><p>BTW, thank you for putting outlines on the text entry fields for this web form.  An awful lot of web site developers don't seem to think they are necessary. </p><p>Rebeccah </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",rprastein

Similarly, in a tab displaying a downloaded PDF, clicking on the folder icon that should save a copy of the file does nothing. No error indication that I can find, but the Save dialogue does not appear. The same operations work as expected in Chrome, so it doesn't appear to be a general problem with my system. </p><p>I really don't want to switch to Chrome as my primary browser, but not being able to save PDFs is a show stopper for me. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1180;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1611790;,dgtangman
