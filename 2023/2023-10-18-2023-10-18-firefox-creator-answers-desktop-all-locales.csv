I found that it takes a lot of time to load the PMC web page, and even worse to access an aricle in it, always more than 10 seconds (for example,  <a href=""https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1234567/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1234567/</a>). These pages access smoothly in other browsers on my computer (MacBook Pro with M1, macOS Sonoma 14.0).  I've tried the troubleshoot mode, and clearing all the cookies and cache, but it just doesn't work.  </p><p>Hoping to get some useful feedback on this! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",linyunlydia

SEE ATTACHED SCREEN SHOT: </p><p>When I go to backup my Firefox profile I ""seem"" to have three folders. When I go to Troubleshooting Information-&gt;Application Basics-&gt;select / click Profile Folder it takes me to three folders and I am the one that's highlighted-selected folder is the one I am currently using. Now, there are two other folders above the highlighted one, which I 'might' guess are either older profiles  OR (!) I might have more than one Firefox on my computer.  When I went to take a peak at the other two folders, I eyeballed the dates/times and they are current, not old / dated. I left them alone and just backed up the one that was highlighted assuming its the current version I am using up to the minute. </p><p>Any idea what the other two folders are? I assume they are Profile Folders? How can I tell if they are indeed Profile Folders, and if the case is I have more than one version of Firefox I am running for instance, how can I tell which is which. Would one clue be in the order in which they appear with the one highlighted (third one) be the latest/most currently used? </p><p>Thanks Steven </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1180;,firefox,other,en-US,"",sbernsonca

I am signed in to the same sync account on all of them.  I would like to be able to see the history from other devices, or preferably, a chronological list of sites that I have visited in a single list. </p><p>I'm currently using Firefox on my home PC and when I click on the ""Firefox Account"" button, I can see a list of tabs that are open on the various devices.  But when I go into History/ManageHistory, I mostly see the history of just this PC.  I see some items from other devices, but a very small percentage. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",sanjosanjo

It's just a broad, pale blue area above the page content, barely distinguished from the white background of the content itself.  I can't see the address bar, either.  Why don't applications use borders any more?  It's really, really annoying.  At least the + sign to create a new tab has made a re-appearance, along with the X's on the tabs to close them  (I couldn't find them when I started up Windows this morning, started searching frantically for a setting to display them as it seemed like there was no tab bar at all, and eventually they reappeared and I have no idea how). </p><p>I really hope there is something to be done short of editing a .css file somewhere, but if that's what has to be done, please tell me where to find the file and ideally, what elements in it I need to modify. </p><p>BTW, thank you for putting outlines on the text entry fields for this web form.  An awful lot of web site developers don't seem to think they are necessary. </p><p>Rebeccah </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",rprastein

Similarly, in a tab displaying a downloaded PDF, clicking on the folder icon that should save a copy of the file does nothing. No error indication that I can find, but the Save dialogue does not appear. The same operations work as expected in Chrome, so it doesn't appear to be a general problem with my system. </p><p>I really don't want to switch to Chrome as my primary browser, but not being able to save PDFs is a show stopper for me. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1180;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1611790;,dgtangman
