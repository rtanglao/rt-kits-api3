When I go to Troubleshooting Information-&gt;Application Basics-&gt;select / click Profile Folder it takes me to three folders and I am the one that's highlighted-selected folder is the one I am currently using. Now, there are two other folders above the highlighted one, which I 'might' guess are either older profiles  OR (!) I might have more than one Firefox on my computer.  When I went to take a peak at the other two folders, I eyeballed the dates/times and they are current, not old / dated. I left them alone and just backed up the one that was highlighted assuming its the current version I am using up to the minute. </p><p>Any idea what the other two folders are? I assume they are Profile Folders? How can I tell if they are indeed Profile Folders, and if the case is I have more than one version of Firefox I am running for instance, how can I tell which is which. Would one clue be in the order in which they appear with the one highlighted (third one) be the latest/most currently used? </p><p>Thanks Steven </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1180;,firefox,other,en-US,1611845;,sbernsonca
