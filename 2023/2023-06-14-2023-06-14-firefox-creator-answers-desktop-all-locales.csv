I get this error message stating ""Failed to check for updates."" </p><p>Chrome was giving me much of the same issue, I've allowed GoogleUpdate on my firewall rules, restarted the PC and tried again. Still got the same error message. I have no other antivirus software installed on this device other than the Windows Defender default app. Firefox hasn't told what I should be allowing past my firewall so I haven't tried anything similar for Firefox. </p><p>I also tried uninstalling Firefox, but when I tried to reinstall, I couldn't finish that process because clicking on Download Now led me to this error message stating ""Hmm. We’re having trouble finding that site. </p><p>We can’t connect to the server at <a href=""http://download.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">download.mozilla.org</a>."" </p><p>I assumed this was maybe a DNS issue.

I've tried everything in another browser, and they function flawlessly, so it's not my Watchguard firewall nor Windows settings.  I have the same issue sporadically clicking on email links in Outlook, so it's not only on links clicked IN Firefox (browser-based email).  I've completely disabled all the Enhanced Tracking Protection, but still, nothing.  I booted up another notebook, and it's exhibiting the exact same behavior (and that notebook doesn't have Norton on it to be an issue, (though I already have it completely disabled on the computer in question). </p><p>The tracking redirects that are causing me the post trouble are ""<a href=""http://trk.klclick1.com/ls/click?upn="" rel=""nofollow"">http://trk.klclick1.com/ls/click?upn=</a>..."" and ""<a href=""https://t.e2ma.net/click/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://t.e2ma.net/click/</a>..."" </p><p>As I mentioned, these are in emails from sources I get regularly.  One is a website that sells their own products, and the latter is for a content-oriented site.  The one that gave me problems from Outlook was news content, and (curiously enough), clicking on the image yielded the blocked site page, but clicking on the news heading beneath it got me through to the article in question, so I just figured it was an HTML email coding issue. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,other,en-US,1585462;,saigolives

Negli ultimi tempi, soprattutto casualmente, inizia a saturare la RAM: di 16GB di RAM, arriva a occuparne 11, diventando anche rallentatissimo, inutilizzabile; e un paio di volte è perfino crashato facendo riavviare anche dwm.exe. </p><p>Ho notato che ci sono pagine che possono farlo comportare in questo modo, come la Modalità Globo di Google Maps o Telegram Web, ma il comportamento comunque rimane casuale e inaspettato, non solo con queste pagine ma anche con pagine casualissime come un video su YouTube o anche questa pagina. </p><p>Il PC l'ho controllato con Sophos, Avast e Malwarebytes ed è pulito. Ho provato a ridurre il consumo di RAM attraverso about:memory come a controllare se ci fosse qualche estensione a causare questo comportamento attraverso il Task Manager di Firefox, ma non riesco a capirne il motivo, dato che mi segnala un consumo di RAM da parte di tutto il programma, e non di un singolo estensione/processo/pagina; al più so che a causare questo comportamento è qualche pagina ma comunque non trovo il motivo dato che poi riaprendo la stessa pagina il problema non si pone più. Dato che ho molte finestre aperte (ma non caricate), ho pensato potesse essere il Tree Style Tab, ma non ho prove a suffragio di questa tesi. </p><p>Qualcuno sa dirmi come posso risolvere questo problema? E' abbastanza fastidioso dover chiudere una pagina che mi serve per questo comportamento o anche solo privarmi di dover usare un sito per questo. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1140;,firefox,fix-problems,it,1585453;1585456;,jaikillingumsm
