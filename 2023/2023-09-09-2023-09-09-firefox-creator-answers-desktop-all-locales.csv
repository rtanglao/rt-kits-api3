Those would not only provide a better security standard, but also better failover options. </p><p>I'm sorry if this is not the right place, but I've not found a dedicated forum for Firefox Accounts issues specifically - please direct me there if there's one. </p><p>Best regards, Artur Ciesielski </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;needsinfo;windows-11;firefox-1170;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1602627;1602629;,artur.ciesielski

I've checked my Mac's preferences, and Firefox has notifications enabled there, as usual. Gmail works fine on Chrome--notifications are working. I've tried reinstalling Firefox--no change. I've tried running Firefox in troubleshooting mode--no joy. Other sites aren't even asking for permission to send notifications. Like Gmail, they appear to believe notifications are disabled in the browser. </p><p>I've searched the web for solutions, but I can't find one that tells me where the enable/disable switch is.
