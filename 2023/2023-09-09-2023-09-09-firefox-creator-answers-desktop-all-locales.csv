That said, I guess I could go through MONTHS of history, but it would take forever to find them again.  I happened to have two windows open, one with all my tabs, while the new window only had three tabs open.  I needed to restart my Win 10 computer for a late security update, and yes, I did/do have my settings set to retain all open tabs.  Well, when I went to shut down Firefox ver. 117.0 64bit, I closed the window with all my Important tabs down first.  And lastly, the window with only the 4 tabs. </p><p>There was NO WARNING, NO POP-UP, NOTHING, that I was about to lose over 50 tabs!!!!  Some having been opened for months (no, I don't shut my computer off unless I have to).  So, the next time I opened Firefox, all I saw was 4 tabs. </p><p>THIS ISSUE needs to be addressed IMMEDIATELY.  People NEED to know about this bug until fixed or a TWO LEVEL WARNING GIVING OUT VIA POP-UP, that they will lose ALL OF THE TABS if they shut down the wrong window first. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1170;,firefox,other,en-US,1602544;,krklek
