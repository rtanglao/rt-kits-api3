However, I would loose all of my bookmark favorites.

What is causing this and how can it be fixed?","<p>I just downloaded the most recent update.  After restarting because the browser locked up (as it usually always does eventually) now when I right click to save a picture (save as) firefox opens an invisible (file explorer?) window.  At first I didn't realize it was invisible.  I could see a flash of the outline of the window but as quickly as that happens it seems to vaporize/minimize and become inaccessible apparently.  However because of my inquisitive mind I just realized that isn't exactly so.  Because I've seen this happen before with your little ""clear recent history"" options window.  So how I realized it was possible to close this 100% transparent invisible window was by hovering my mouse cursor around the outline of where I saw it was where it flash/minimized.  By doing so I could find the edges where my mouse cursor changes from a regular pointer arrow to a two sided window expander arrow used to widen or shorted the sides and tops of windows.  By locating this I was able to find the top right corner and click on the location of the invisible red ""X"" button which actually closes the invisible window.  This may sound a little crazy but I repeated the same thing twice now since when I came back to the same page to try and save the same picture after restarting firefox a second time, the same thing happened again.  By the way when this happens the browser window locks and I cannot access the file menu or choose to cancel/exit firefox even with the red arrow at the upper corner of the windows.  Also the file menus of any other firefox windows I have open also become locked.  Previoously when this was happening to me I determined that the only way to fix the issue was to kill firefox from windows Task Manager.  But at that time (a few months ago) the same issue was occurring.  I can't remember if restarting my computer fixed it but that's my obviousl next tstep in case it's an issue with widows itself.  I cannot recall how I this issue was remedied the last time it happened.  I'm thinking I may have had to uninstall/reinstall firefox or go basically install the newest version on top of the current version (which is supposed to be updated by the way!)  Anyways as you're reading this is not the first time this has happened to me in Firefox.  It's happened previously at least once or twice within the past 6 months probably after a firefox update I'm seeming to recall.  Why do things get screwed up after updates and changes get made that affect my accessibility?  This cannot be just happened randomly.  Upon researching the topic there was very little I could find and no soulutions in the firefox help forum.  I came across something in my searching that this may be an issue with windows file explorer so I tried restarting windows explorer but that did not help either.  I have tried restarting firefox once since the update and that did not fix this issue either.  I have not tried restarting my computer but I will be doing that next.  It's possible I guess that may fix it.  It seems that the last time this happened to firefox it eventually was corrected or somehow fixed itself but I don't remember how.  Just prior to the restart after this most recent update my firefox actually locked up as a web page was loading and I was trying to access the menu to clear recent history by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Delete since the file menu was locking.  This window never actually opened (or perhaps was also made invisible) prior to getting it to close.  With that one it can only happen by canceling or clearing.  When this happened all the other firefox windows I had opened turned 100% blank white until the locked one cleared.  In the meantime I had disconnected my internet to try and get the one page that wasn't loading to stop.  But I also forgot to mention that just prior to this happening, not only right click menus but the firefox menu bar menus were opening black; some with a few icons or words but with others completely blacked out like blank, but black blank.  I do use dark mode.  This is also not the first time I've ever seen that happen (blank menus) in Firefox.  In fact it has happened to my firefox several times over the past year around times that the browser became overloaded or after a recent update.  In addition I have major issues with firefox maxing out my memory basically every time I use it one the RAM gets full.  Why can't firefox self regulate its memory usage so as not to chronically lock up my entire computer on a regular basis?  Why do I have to use add-on extensions designed to perform this feat when it should just be built into basic firefox functionality.  Firefox should not allow itself to ""hang"".  If tasks cannot be completed within 30 seconds they need to stop.  If memory gets beyond a certain point, web pages need to unload automatically and their memory dumped.  It's no big deal.  Lastly my bookmark menu is a mess and not easily accessible.  I don't like having a both a regular bookmarks list and an ""other bookmarks"" list.  A number of years ago I think bookmarks were automatically saved into the regular bookmarks menu and I don't know that ever really used the other bookmarks section if it was even there at the time.  But then at some point the auto-bookmarking bookmarks helper started automatically setting new bookmarks to go into this ""other bookmarks"" folder.  This went on for sometime so I just started using ""other bookmarks"" until again after some recent update within the past year the bookmark settings were changed back by some developers at Firefox to go back to the regular bookmarks menu.  But since I got so used to using the other bookmarks menu and don't really know how to consolidate and organize these all into one section I just feel really upset about it.  I don't want to have two bookmarks folders unless I designate a separate one myself.  I need a power-users bookmark manager and a bookmarks menu with as many user customizable options/settings as possible.  The current bookmarks menu looks like it was designed for children.  I want to be able to change the view.  I want to be able to get rid of duplicates.  I want to be able to re-categorize bookmarks from different folders into new folders by subject matter and cross-link bookmarks from different folders by subject matter or by site visited, etc.  I think the current bookmarks system is not user friendly.  Anybody ever heard of the Humane Interface by Jef Raskin?  How about root tabs inside bookmarks folders for people who save all tabs from windows into bookmark folders?  There has to be a better way. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1090;firefox-10901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",NMichael79
