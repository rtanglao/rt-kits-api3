When I was done I looked at my downloads folder and saw only half of them there. I checked the download history in firefox, and couldn't see some files. They were not queued or in progress. They weren't in the download list at all. </p><p>I reproduced this. I downloaded an image again. Right click, save as, click save. Then that image doesn't appear in the download history. </p><p>I tried some variations. Hitting enter instead of clicking save. Opening the image in a new tab and using ctrl-s. </p><p>Still, no image in the download history or on disk. </p><p>I quit firefox and re-openned. Still the file didn't appear on disk or in the download history. </p><p>Then I kept trying, and I got a second issue, which I think is related. </p><p>Often when I save an image, instead of one window popping up asking me where to save it, I get a second window popping up ontop of that, then a third, then a fourth. All ontop of each other. All asking the same thing. They take the focus, so it's not possible to interact with the main firefox window to continue browsing. </p><p>Sometimes if I hit enter literally 50 times then it will save the same image repeatedly, and eventually I can go back to browsing. </p><p>Sometimes there's more than 50 popup windows (my hunch is more than 100). My only solution then is to quit firefox forcefully. Which is annoying if I have state in other tabs that I don't want to lose. </p><p>This has happened many times over many weeks. It only happens on some file saves. I can't figure out why it happens on some, not others. (Right click &gt; save, and also ctrl-s, they both do the same thing.) </p><p>This form won't let me attach a screen recording. Only screenshots. That's annoying because you can't really see the behavior from the screenshot. But I'll try. See the dark black border outside the download dialogue? That's normally a very faint transparent shadow. But because there's so many duplicate windows all exactly ontop of each other, those multiple transparent shadows have become opaque. </p><p>What you can't see from a static screenshot is that I could see each window appear ontop of the other. If I try to select the filename text and edit it, very quickly another window appears ontop with the default filename again. I can see the Firefox icon in the Gnome bar on the left shaking every time a new window pops up. </p><p>(Hmm, it looks like I can't *upload* screenshots either. I click browse, select a file, and then it doesn't get uploaded.) </p><p>I'm on Ubuntu 22.10 with Wayland. </p><p>I don't know if this issue is a bug in Firefox, or in Gnome. I've only seen this behavior with Firefox in Gnome. Not Firefox on another DE/OS. And not any other application in Gnome. This behavior has been intermittent since I bought this laptop and installed Ubuntu about a month ago. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1130;firefox-11301;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",grassyBanana

Whenever I add a new bookmark, Firefox has started remembering the last folder I saved a bookmark into. That's not really a helpful feature but, worse still, it doesn't actually save the bookmark into that folder but saves it into Bookmarks Menu instead. I then have to add the bookmark again and choose the folder I want to save it into, as on the second attempt it defaults to Bookmarks Menu as the location. Sometimes the new bookmark remains in the Bookmarks Menu after the second save regardless of what other folder I select. I haven't checked to see if the bookmarks are being duplicated in that scenario. </p><p>I've been assuming that this was a bug and have been expecting it to be fixed, but there have been several new releases of Firefox since I started having the problem and it still remains. Moreover, I can't find anything online to suggest that other people are having the same issue, which makes me think it's something to do with my system. </p><p>I'd be grateful for any assistance you can provide please. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1140;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",Moonridge2023

Basically, when using the theme ""Pixel-Punk"" while playing a video, ram usage by the GPU slowly increases. It increases until it reaches 8GB, where Firefox will soft crash, displaying a white screen. Firefox will be reloaded, with the animated banner portion in Firefox usually disabled or flickering on and off. The GPU item in the process manager also disappears and ram usage no longer increases.  The slow nature of the problem makes it hard to diagnose but I'm fairly certain it's due to this theme. The problem doesn't appear with it off, or even on, until I start watching a YouTube video, where ram usage will slowly increase. If I disable the theme ram usage stops increasing but doesn't decrease to it's previous state. I've also tried refreshing Firefox but that didn't help. Also, I don't have an option for hardware acceleration so I can't troubleshoot that option. I've asked the Firefox subreddit and I was guided to the profiler, but that's a little over my head. Is there a way to fix this? I quite like this theme, and I haven't seen any complaints in the reviews.

The browsers I have tested are Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox. </p><p>I also have tried multiple windows recovery points, none of which mattered (and I know for a fact the issue didn't occur at the time of one point I tried, yet it did even after that recovery). Also scanned my computer for threats and nothing was found. I'm not sure if this is within the scope of help to receive here, but I can't find anything about this and since it is rather bizarre, I don't reckon it's a well know issue. Any help is very appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1584391;1584400;1584407;,feaw2007
