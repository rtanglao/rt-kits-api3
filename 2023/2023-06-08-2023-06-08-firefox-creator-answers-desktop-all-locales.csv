1415329,2023-06-07 17:13:33 -0700,2023-06-07 17:49:58 -0700,Any browser crashes when right-clicking on save-as window,"<p>I just built a new computer and installed windows 11. Reluctantly coming freshly from windows 7, I have tried and done many things and tweaks to suit my needs more, so I am aware one of those things might be the issue, but I have no idea which, if any. My issue applies to any browser I have tried, not just Firefox. It started randomly and I cannot remember what I did last or exactly when it started happening, a few hours ago is the best I can say. Whenever I right-click while in the save-as window, that window closes and often the window last used minimizes. The browser itself does not crash; however, Firefox is unique in that it does crash but also the only one to notify me and allow me to give out a report, which I did. Also to note; this issue does not happen in every folder on my computer, and even that seems random, not limited to a certain drive either, or permissions and such. The browsers I have tested are Chrome, Edge, Brave, and Firefox. </p><p>I also have tried multiple windows recovery points, none of which mattered (and I know for a fact the issue didn't occur at the time of one point I tried, yet it did even after that recovery). Also scanned my computer for threats and nothing was found. I'm not sure if this is within the scope of help to receive here, but I can't find anything about this and since it is rather bizarre, I don't reckon it's a well know issue. Any help is very appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1584391;,feaw2007
