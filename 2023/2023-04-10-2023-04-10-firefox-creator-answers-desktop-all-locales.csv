I want to add websites of my own choosing to the Firefox Home page.  I can't find any option to do so.  </p><p>Where: In settings, in the HOME section, I have Homepage and new windows as well as New Tabs set to Firefox Home. This is exactly what I want. Firefox Home is the start page I see when I open up Firefox and before I go to any websites. This page contains boxes with images inside them that when clicked will take you to a website. (This is also where I have Pocket articles pinned as well.) What: The instructions that multiple posts refer to are INCORRECT. So  please keep in mind that I have a hamburger menu to the right of my address bar and NOT three dots. In that menu there is NO pin to HOME.  In fact, I can't find anything anywhere under any of the settings that says pin to home, nor does the gear in the upper right hand corner give me any options to add new websites to the group of ones already there.  I have been through multiple posts about this issue and the answers have been all over the place and NONE of them have ever addressed this correctly. I DO NOT want to edit ones already there, I want to add my own.  </p><p>Question: How can I pin my own website to the firefox home page? </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,other,en-US,1574835;,Myth024
