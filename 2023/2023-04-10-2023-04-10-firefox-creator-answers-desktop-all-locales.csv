I have adblocker ultimate, but for <a href=""http://go3.lt"" rel=""nofollow"">go3.lt</a> it is disabled.  So I go to go3 page and select what to watch: sometimes it loads normally, but now more often it doesn't load (I see this rotating loading circle). So if I try to open other tab and then go back to this tab - the content becomes different collor (white background, when before it was black). Also if in this tab I am trying to press ALT - the menu doesn't open. Bookmark buttons, home/back/refresh buttons also are inactive. So I need to close this tab (tab buttons (x, +) are working) and try to open go3 again.  In task manager the firefox performance looks normal.  ~1 month ago I didn't have this issue.  I have tried MS edge - it works well (as much as I have tried).  Also I have tried to run firefox in troubleshooting mode - it worked well (as much as I have tried).  </p><p>BR Mindaugas </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mindaugasv851

The image is black if it does show an image, and when it doesn't nothing happens.  On my phone, when i download the images they are black as well, and do not show anything.  </p><p>The only thing that I can think of that would be causing this is some filter that detects ""explicit"" imagery, as it has only ever seemed to be a problem when there was not safe for work content that i was copying, for instance: i was trying to copy and paste an image of a gun from firefox to differing applications, and it never worked. I was able to easily copy and paste an image of the globe however.  </p><p>If it is filtering explicit imagery, how do I turn this off? If something else is causing the problem, please help me fix it! </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1574841;,ianjohnson1432

I have encountered the issue on disney+ and skillshare but not netflix or youtube, leading me to think that it might be to do with the DRM that those sites use? The issue does not occur in troubleshooting mode but does in private browsing. I have tried disabling all of my add-ons and clearing my cache (though the ""clear recent history"" menu), but neither has solved the problem. It is unclear to me what steps more I can take other than resetting my browser entirely, which I'm reluctant to do as an add-on that I use has a somewhat lengthy setup process which I would prefer not to have to repeat. </p><p>Any help would be appreciated!! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mixtyplix

I want to add websites of my own choosing to the Firefox Home page.  I can't find any option to do so.  </p><p>Where: In settings, in the HOME section, I have Homepage and new windows as well as New Tabs set to Firefox Home. This is exactly what I want. Firefox Home is the start page I see when I open up Firefox and before I go to any websites. This page contains boxes with images inside them that when clicked will take you to a website. (This is also where I have Pocket articles pinned as well.) What: The instructions that multiple posts refer to are INCORRECT. So  please keep in mind that I have a hamburger menu to the right of my address bar and NOT three dots. In that menu there is NO pin to HOME.  In fact, I can't find anything anywhere under any of the settings that says pin to home, nor does the gear in the upper right hand corner give me any options to add new websites to the group of ones already there.  I have been through multiple posts about this issue and the answers have been all over the place and NONE of them have ever addressed this correctly. I DO NOT want to edit ones already there, I want to add my own.  </p><p>Question: How can I pin my own website to the firefox home page? </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,other,en-US,1574835;,Myth024
