Recently (within the last two days) I have not been able to sign into <a href=""http://Outlook.Live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.Live.com</a> on my Acer Laptop running Win10. I get a ""something went wrong"" message. Also, I can not open <a href=""http://MSN.com"" rel=""nofollow"">MSN.com</a>. The MSN splash screen sits there with the progress bar dancing back and forth but nothing happens. I tried opening Firefox in troubleshooting mode but the same thing happens. I am able to successfully open both of these pages using MS Edge on the same device. I can open the Bing page (another MS site) in Firefox and it functions as usual.  I also have Firefox on a Compac Presario Laptop running Win10. The same thing happens there. That laptop also has Chrome installed and both <a href=""http://Outlook.Live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.Live.com</a> and <a href=""http://MSN.com"" rel=""nofollow"">MSN.com</a> work properly on that laptop with the Chrome browser. That same Compac Presario can be booted to Linux Mint. In that mode I have a copy of Firefox for Linux. When I use that, both <a href=""http://Outook.Live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outook.Live.com</a> and <a href=""http://MSN.com"" rel=""nofollow"">MSN.com</a> work properly. Has there been a recent change to Firefox which might cause this behavior? What else can I do to troubleshoot this problem?

A consent form popped up but overlaid the article. I could not scroll to the bottom to accept my options or dismiss the form as there wasn't an X in sight. The article scrolled in the background but the Consent form did not move. After playing around for a while I decided to enter Full Screen from the View menu/F11. That worked and I was able to scroll to the bottom and dismiss the consent form. I then checked the box beside the minimise symbol on the top right of the screen and for the first time since using Windows 11 on my new PC I noticed there was 4 choices of screen layouts. Is this a Firefox or Windows innovation and where is Maximise? </p><p>Does that mean I have to use F11/Full Screen to actually be in a full sized screen when scrolling. </p>,desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",phildiamo

I use Firefox for surfing the web. I used to go to a website and when I clicked the username/login box, I was able to see the several users I used and could choose one of those. See the picture attached. Now, I can't see the several users and I have to write the user I want to use. I think I did something in the Firefox configuration, but I can't remember. I have tried to erase all the cookies, accept all the cookies again from the website, but nothing. I have gone to Privacy and Security but I haven't seen anything relating that website like an exception or something. And I think it's something relating to cookies but I can't fix this.

This includes the preview of pdf pages on the left hand side when opening a pdf with firefox (not the actual pages itsself just the preview), as well as some of the icons from specific extensions, certain items on maps (for example on google maps) and the list goes on. Im running Firefox on Windows 11 and have never had this problem before. I have the following up to date Version 111.0.1 (64-bit). I recently, at a similar time to this problem appearing changed Browser privacy from standard to strict, but have since changed this back due to the following message under 'strict': ""This setting may cause some web sites to not display content or work correctly. If a site seems broken, you may want to turn off tracking protection for that site to load all content."" Changing this back however has not fixed the problem. I have attached some images and would appreciate if someone has any ideas what I could do to fix this... </p><p>Many Thanks </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1574868;,benedictvonschubert

I have adblocker ultimate, but for <a href=""http://go3.lt"" rel=""nofollow"">go3.lt</a> it is disabled.  So I go to go3 page and select what to watch: sometimes it loads normally, but now more often it doesn't load (I see this rotating loading circle). So if I try to open other tab and then go back to this tab - the content becomes different collor (white background, when before it was black). Also if in this tab I am trying to press ALT - the menu doesn't open. Bookmark buttons, home/back/refresh buttons also are inactive. So I need to close this tab (tab buttons (x, +) are working) and try to open go3 again.  In task manager the firefox performance looks normal.  ~1 month ago I didn't have this issue.  I have tried MS edge - it works well (as much as I have tried).  Also I have tried to run firefox in troubleshooting mode - it worked well (as much as I have tried).  </p><p>BR Mindaugas </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mindaugasv851

I have encountered the issue on disney+ and skillshare but not netflix or youtube, leading me to think that it might be to do with the DRM that those sites use? The issue does not occur in troubleshooting mode but does in private browsing. I have tried disabling all of my add-ons and clearing my cache (though the ""clear recent history"" menu), but neither has solved the problem. It is unclear to me what steps more I can take other than resetting my browser entirely, which I'm reluctant to do as an add-on that I use has a somewhat lengthy setup process which I would prefer not to have to repeat. </p><p>Any help would be appreciated!! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1574846;,mixtyplix

Firefox Home is the start page I see when I open up Firefox and before I go to any websites. This page contains boxes with images inside them that when clicked will take you to a website. (This is also where I have Pocket articles pinned as well.) What: The instructions that multiple posts refer to are INCORRECT. So  please keep in mind that I have a hamburger menu to the right of my address bar and NOT three dots. In that menu there is NO pin to HOME.  In fact, I can't find anything anywhere under any of the settings that says pin to home, nor does the gear in the upper right hand corner give me any options to add new websites to the group of ones already there.  I have been through multiple posts about this issue and the answers have been all over the place and NONE of them have ever addressed this correctly. I DO NOT want to edit ones already there, I want to add my own.  </p><p>Question: How can I pin my own website to the firefox home page? </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,other,en-US,1574835;,Myth024
