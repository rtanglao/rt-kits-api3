One was a panoramic photo, the other two were regular pics. When I shared the album as a public post, the pano photo got converted to a static picture, cropped to show only the center section. </p><p>Next I tried uploading the pano photo by itself to FB. It was displayed as  an ultrawide (vertically short), static photo, and would not perform as I remembered pano photos doing in the past. Later, I tried again in FFx on iPhone, clicked on the photo to display it and again to enlarge it and this time the pano worked but with very poor resolution. </p><p>In desktop Ffx the phooto in the same post displays only as an ultrawide static photo. </p><p>Am I expecting too much, or is something wrong in Firefox?
