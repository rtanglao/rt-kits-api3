Non-live videos on youtube are playing, even the same videos watched as VODs after the stream ends, but the livestreams are providing ""Your browser can't play this video"" errors.   </p><p>Simultaneously, I'm noticing that some videos on Reddit (such as embedded tiktok videos) are stuck with a circling ring and won't play.  At least some of the same videos will play on Tiktok (when I can find them).   </p><p>ALSO, when I try to watch videos on my Nebula subscription, I'm getting a ""This video could not be loaded: 4"" error code.  ANY video on Nebula.  </p><p>What the heck gives?! </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,other,en-US,"",hobbitguy1420

Zadni mesec ali dva Firefox ne naloži nekaterih spletnih strani, skupna točka je, da je za vstop potrebna prijava kot npr. NLB spletna banka ali portali, kjer se je za vstop potrebno prijaviti z uporabniškim imenom. Brskalnik Firefox uporabljam že desetletja, še nikoli ni bilo težav, sedaj se težave z uporabo stopnjujejo. Najprej vstop v spletno banko NLB, sedaj še drugi portali ....., vendar pa ne vsi. <a href=""http://Bolha.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Bolha.com</a> npr. deluje ... </p><p>Brisanje piškotkov in zgodovine ne pomaga .... Naložen imam sicer AdGuard, sem ga tudi izklopil, pa se portali vseeno ne naložijo. Obvestila o napaki ni nobenega v ikoni ključavnice je videti vse vredu, na ekranu pa je zgolj napis ""Prosim počakajte, da se aplikacija naloži ...."", a pri tem tudi ostane, aplikacija se ne naloži ....... V Operi dela recimo vse normalno, vendar pa kot privzeti brskalnik že zelo dolgo uporabljam Firefox in bi tudi v nadaljevanju ..... </p><p>Kako bi se dalo napako odpraviti? </p><p>Hvala za odgovor in lep pozdrav Brane K. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,website-breakages,sl,"",brane.posta

One was a panoramic photo, the other two were regular pics. When I shared the album as a public post, the pano photo got converted to a static picture, cropped to show only the center section. </p><p>Next I tried uploading the pano photo by itself to FB. It was displayed as  an ultrawide (vertically short), static photo, and would not perform as I remembered pano photos doing in the past. Later, I tried again in FFx on iPhone, clicked on the photo to display it and again to enlarge it and this time the pano worked but with very poor resolution. </p><p>In desktop Ffx the phooto in the same post displays only as an ultrawide static photo. </p><p>Am I expecting too much, or is something wrong in Firefox?
