One was a panoramic photo, the other two were regular pics. When I shared the album as a public post, the pano photo got converted to a static picture, cropped to show only the center section. </p><p>Next I tried uploading the pano photo by itself to FB. It was displayed as  an ultrawide (vertically short), static photo, and would not perform as I remembered pano photos doing in the past. Later, I tried again in FFx on iPhone, clicked on the photo to display it and again to enlarge it and this time the pano worked but with very poor resolution. </p><p>In desktop Ffx the phooto in the same post displays only as an ultrawide static photo. </p><p>Am I expecting too much, or is something wrong in Firefox? Thanks. </p><p>MacBook Pro OS Sonoma v 14.1; FFx v 119.0.1. </p>",desktop;other;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,other,en-US,1618020;,hmkabaker

Looks every time if I close and reopen the browser, browser is using HTTP/3 as expected. If I refresh the page multiple times then I do see switch to HTTP/1.1. </p><p>-Load-balancer configuration, there are two virtual-host </p><pre>1. HTTPS with TCP listening on port 443 2. QUIC with UDP listening on port 443 </pre> <p>As per my understanding when access website, for an example ""<a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">example.com</a>"" firefox sends its first HTTP/1.1 request and in the response load-balancer is inserting Atl-Svc ""h3=:443"", ma=86400 however for subsequent requests firefox is not switching to HTTP/3  </p> <ul><li>From uploaded images you can see the different, working scenario and non working scenario(both cases load-balancer insert Alt-Svc). </li><li>I am using firefox 121.0a1 </li><li>All HTTP/3 and QUIC related configuration are enabled in firefox  </li><li>Using self-signed certificate  </li><li>Domain Name is not registered.

Simply click and wiggle the coordinate space a bit and CPU will quickly reach 100% usage. </p><p>Tech stats: Firefox x64 (newest version), high CPU usage occurred with and without active extensions, my CPU is a i7 8-core 4GHz </p><p>This does *not* happen if a different browser is used (e.g. I tested with Chromium), or Desmos is used with the regular cartesian grid option. Ram usage and GPU usage are negligible either way.  </p><p>Related: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1446863"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1446863</a> they claim ""low fps"" but I'm guessing that's a symptom of high CPU usage. </p><p>Thank You in advance!
