After switching to Firefox from Chrome recently, I have noticed some persistent issues to do with audio from devices external to my laptop. I have a USB external microphone, a USB sound card that powers external speakers, and wired headphones that I use through the laptop's headphone jack. In macOS my default audio input is the external mic, and default output is the wired headphones. </p><p>The first issue that I noticed when using Firefox in meetings was that people reported an echoing effect on my audio. Audio from everyone else sounded fine to me. Changing my microphone source in Meet or in macOS did not seem to help, nor did disabling echo canceling in Meet. What did help was disconnecting the USB microphone completely. The impression that I got was that Meet was taking audio from both the USB mic and laptop mic at the same time, even though only the USB mic was selected. This has happened every time I used Meet. </p><p>The second issue that I noticed just happened for the first time today. (Note: I now have my USB mic unplugged until I can resolve the mic issue.) In macOS I had my wired headphones set as the audio output device. I joined a meeting, and I was hearing the meeting audio in my headphones and the external speakers (USB sound card) at the same time.  </p><p>I've used Meet with Chrome for the last few years and never had this type of issue. </p><p>Something I have noticed that may be relevant is, when I open Meet in Chrome and go to the Meet settings, it shows my USB sound card and wired headphones as audio input/output options that I can select, in addition to the built-in laptop speakers. But when I open Meet in Firefox, the settings only show the USB sound card and laptop speakers for output - they don't show my wired headphones. FWIW, media.setsink.enabled is set to ""true"" already - I saw this mentioned as a solution in a similar question from 2022.  </p><p>Is there anything I can check, or debugging data I can capture when this issue happens, which would help figure out the root cause? </p>",desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",owen16

The temporary solution to this is to reset my computer as sign offs, locks or returning to sleep do not clear the issue.  I've tested on different browsers/sites and can confirm that this is exclusive to firefox.
