I finally decided to switch to Firefox&nbsp;:) So far it's great, yet there are a few things that are different from Chrome (that I've used for more than 10 years). Some of the things I found already, but there are others that are obscure, and I would appreciate your help in finding them! </p><p>1. When typing something in the search bar and clicking the middle mouse button to open it in a new tab, it auto switches to that tab. I found settings for auto-switching from bookmarks and a few other places, but this one still eludes me. </p><p>2. Reopen closed tab. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it does not open the last tab that I've closed (only some random one?). I have no idea how it should work, but on Chrome it just opens the last closed tab. Is it possible to change this behavior to work the same way? </p><p>3. I have multiple monitors (probably like most people nowadays). When I want to move a tab to another monitor, so it makes a new window it's super weird. Sometimes when I move it over another programs window it just doesn't work, sometimes if I move too quickly it also doesn't work.

Until recently we used a TURN-Server to tunnel the UDP connections thrugh the firewall. </p><p>Due to performance issues we wanted to try and let the clients connect directly to the udp ports 16000 - 32000 </p><p>In Chrome this works as expected. </p><p>In Firefox however when we set ""media.peerconnection.turn.disable"" to ""true"" FF does not find any WebRTC candidates. We checked the logs and it says there: </p><p>""relay only option is set without any TURN server configured"" ""relay/proxy only option results in ICE TCP being disabled"" </p><p>But thats NOT true!  The option ""media.peerconnection.ice.relay_only"" is definetly set to ""false"" </p><p>Tested on FF 115.5.0 ESR and 120.0.1 </p><p>Does anyone have an idea whats happening here?  Why doesnt FF even try to make a direct connection? </p><p>UPDATE: I just ran a test on our dev system. If we configure BBB so that it does not offer any TURN-servers, FF uses a direct connection. Sadly that is not possible, since we need the TURN server for external connections. When there are TURN-Candidates but TURN is disabled via FF config no connection is established at all. This definetly semms like a bug in FF, since the browser should still be able to simply try and connect directly. </p><p><br> Thank you for you support </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,other,en-US,"",florian.seifer

After switching to Firefox from Chrome recently, I have noticed some persistent issues to do with audio from devices external to my laptop. I have a USB external microphone, a USB sound card that powers external speakers, and wired headphones that I use through the laptop's headphone jack. In macOS my default audio input is the external mic, and default output is the wired headphones. </p><p>The first issue that I noticed when using Firefox in meetings was that people reported an echoing effect on my audio. Audio from everyone else sounded fine to me. Changing my microphone source in Meet or in macOS did not seem to help, nor did disabling echo canceling in Meet. What did help was disconnecting the USB microphone completely. The impression that I got was that Meet was taking audio from both the USB mic and laptop mic at the same time, even though only the USB mic was selected. This has happened every time I used Meet. </p><p>The second issue that I noticed just happened for the first time today. (Note: I now have my USB mic unplugged until I can resolve the mic issue.) In macOS I had my wired headphones set as the audio output device. I joined a meeting, and I was hearing the meeting audio in my headphones and the external speakers (USB sound card) at the same time.  </p><p>I've used Meet with Chrome for the last few years and never had this type of issue. </p><p>Something I have noticed that may be relevant is, when I open Meet in Chrome and go to the Meet settings, it shows my USB sound card and wired headphones as audio input/output options that I can select, in addition to the built-in laptop speakers. But when I open Meet in Firefox, the settings only show the USB sound card and laptop speakers for output - they don't show my wired headphones. FWIW, media.setsink.enabled is set to ""true"" already - I saw this mentioned as a solution in a similar question from 2022.  </p><p>Is there anything I can check, or debugging data I can capture when this issue happens, which would help figure out the root cause? </p>",desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",owen16
