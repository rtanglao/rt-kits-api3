I have made sure that nothing was preventing it from playing to  the best of my knowledge, including checking my settings and troubleshooting mode, but to no effect. If I open the offending tabs in another browser the audio does play.  </p><p>It first started with a single streamer's Twitch page (and no other stream), and has since spread to Twitter and starting today, Tumblr. I am getting audio without issue from other tabs such as youtube, but I fear this is only going to get worse, not better. </p><p>I rather not switch browsers but I'm worried I'll soon have no choice.

This happens exactly 30 seconds after clicking on the attachment, whether or not I go on to open or save the attachment. It does not happen if I merely 'preview' the image. I don't know if all attachment types behave the same, but it applies at least to jpg and pdf files. The tab can be reinstated via History/Recently closed tabs. </p><p>Firefox does not crash, and there are no crash reports.

However in the past year or so it is getting increasingly difficult to cling to using it as I'm finding that more and more websites don't like it.  I cannot use it with my bank <a href=""https://www.simplii.com/en/home.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.simplii.com/en/home.html</a>. (when I go to sign in I end up in an ever ending loop where it just takes me back to the sign in page. I can't use it with some shopping carts.  On this site (as it is one I remember) <a href=""https://amaranthstoneware.ca/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://amaranthstoneware.ca/</a>, If I put one thing in the shopping cart, it is fine, but if I put a second thing in, it doesn't remember the first.   And now I was trying to watch a video from the National Film Board <a href=""https://www.nfb.ca/film/affairs-of-the-art/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nfb.ca/film/affairs-of-the-art/</a> and the video buffers constantly and I miss words as it catches up.

All of this issues don't exist with Chrome (the site I did try it on). My version of FIrefox is up to date.  I use Duck Duck Go and LastPass but I turned them off to test and it didn't fix the issue.  I really want to continue to use Firefox, but it is getting hard with so many issues with it.  I hope you can help. Thank you for your help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",marys477
