Pero tengo un problema, no se por que de memoria firefox me está consumiendo con solo estar escribiendo esto 200MB, luego cundo busco algo o estoy viendo videos asciende a 500Mb, sinceramente no se por que sucede(no se si es normal que me suceda con firefox) pero pensé que era windows 11 y volví al windows 10 y sigue igual. El problema de esto es que por la cantidad que me consume la batería del portátil se me va volando. En cambio uso google chrome y utiliza muchísimo menos memoria que firefox. Existe alguna solución para que firefox consuma menos RAM? Saludos </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1090;firefox-10901;,firefox,fix-problems,es,"",pablojuegos452
