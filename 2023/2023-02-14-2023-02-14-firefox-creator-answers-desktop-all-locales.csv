In this browser, I opened a tab and a popup occurred that advised me to download an addon for safe browsing.  After backing out I tried again to get to Etsy when more popups occurred, with audio, freezing the system to where I had to use the power button.  A woman's voice said that I was going to a malicious site, and in the lower right corner gave the Apple telephone number.  Underneath the popups the Apple site shown, which may have been counterfeit.  I emailed Etsy from my Windows 10 about this.  Is there any validity to this; or is somebody making a strong sales pitch to get me to download something under the guise of security?

For the past several upgrades, many such issues have occurred with great frequency.  </p><p>This time, my layouts were gone, my toolbar icons were gone - not even in the ""Customize"" option. This is ridiculous and it is getting quite tiring.

I mean, it's Burger King, and all I NEED NOW is nutritional info for what I just ate and there is no way on that results page to temporarily turn off the problem.  Cloudflare?  CloutFailure is more like it.  They have taken my choice to choose! </p><p>This so frustrating, such a simple thing, why isn't there something to temp turn off? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1012;firefox-1090;firefox-10901;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1565516;,cglenn

(Followed the guide at <a href=""/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-and-diagnose-firefox-problems"" rel=""nofollow"">this support article</a>) However, none of these fixed my Problems.  Interestingly, the Troubleshoot-Mode seems to fix the problem. </p><p>Is there anything else I can try?  </p><p>Cheers, Zihark </p><p>Note that the shared troubleshooting information is from an un-corrupted instance that uses my dedicated GPU instead of the iGPU. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1090;firefox-10901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Zihark

Pero tengo un problema, no se por que de memoria firefox me está consumiendo con solo estar escribiendo esto 200MB, luego cundo busco algo o estoy viendo videos asciende a 500Mb, sinceramente no se por que sucede(no se si es normal que me suceda con firefox) pero pensé que era windows 11 y volví al windows 10 y sigue igual. El problema de esto es que por la cantidad que me consume la batería del portátil se me va volando. En cambio uso google chrome y utiliza muchísimo menos memoria que firefox. Existe alguna solución para que firefox consuma menos RAM? Saludos </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1090;firefox-10901;,firefox,fix-problems,es,"",pablojuegos452
