Just these 2 sites. All the other bookmarks and quick links on my home page work fine. If I clear my data and cookies and re-start FF it sometimes connects, sometimes doesn't, and sometimes opens FB in what looks like a safe mode screen (https?). Vexing me as to what the issue is. Updated FF, Windows, re-installed FF, refreshed it, and finally came here looking for a way to restore the default settings for FF. Since FB and YT are Alphabet companies, have they done something that's messing with FF? </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1100;,firefox,other,en-US,"",danabike2000

Our 2009 MacBook Pro is physically perfect, but it has OS 10.11.6. Apple's server said ""no"" to OS 11 or maybe even 10.12; I cannot recall which. (The 2015-16 Mac is fine with OS 12.6.3 and FF 110). Apple long ago quit supporting the older Safari. The older Mac's Firefox works well but seems stuck on FF 78.15esr. In FF Preferences it says ""Firefox is up to date."" Bravo, _if_ enduringly true. But I sense, among the hi-tek jabber, that even security support for 78.15 is ending soon or already has (esr is also up to about #110). Someone said ""You're stuck if you cannot upgrade OS to 10.12 or higher."" We have no interest in new features but need email and ordinary browsing. I can afford the cost of new hardware and app-banditry, but not the stress of shopping, migrating, and struggling through the learning curve much less a security breach.
