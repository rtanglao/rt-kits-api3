I would like to pin a few tabs that persist even if I use the URL bar to navigate away from it.   </p><p>Let's say I have gmail as a pinned tab.  Currently if I'm in gmail and I type in a different URL then gmail is no longer available, I'd like firefox to know that I want to keep gmail open and it would open the URL in a different tab.
