When I think this number of open tabs is getting absurdly large I do some housekeeping and close tabs individually that I do not currently need.  Those I might want later I bookmark and then close. When I shutdown my computer I close Firefox first When I close Firefox I get the message ""closing 5xx tabs"".  If there is an option I confirm. When I start my computer again, and then start Firefox, all of the previously open tabs are restored, which is awesome. Less awesome is that all the ""housekeeping"" individually closed tabs (which were not open when I shut down Firefox) are also restored. How do I prevent these individually closed tabs reopening while still having the tabs which were open at shutdown restored? </p><p>Thanks so much. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",contractcrew
