In recent weeks (not always) when I click the message I jump to Firefox and multiple repeats of the URL of the chosen message start rapidly streaming across the toolbar (right name?) below the menu bar on the Firefox window.  I don't know how to tackle the problem. It takes stopping the browser with Task Manager to stop the behavior. Is it a Firefox issue, or a Windows 11 issue, or an Outlook issue? I don't expect an immediate answer, I just want to get an idea for how to get help on this issue. The Outlook email image seems entirely normal. Can you help point me in the right direction?
