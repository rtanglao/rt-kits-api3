And CAPS were coming out in my text even though the CAPS lock was not engaged.  And when I did engage it, smaller lower case characters came out.  </p><p>Then the browser revered to its original state, all by itself, as if I just downloaded it.   And then a FF window appeared saying something about troubleshooting an issue with the browser and refreshing.   I refreshed.   Didn't do any good, the browser was still in its ""original state""  (I don't remember, but I think it changed to its original state<em> before I did the refresh.)   I uninstalled FF and reinstalled.   </em> </p><p>Luckily, I had written out all my settings, add ons, had a screen shot of how I had the browser set up, and even changes I made to about:config settings.   Took a while, but I got it back to what it was, for the most part.  The only issue is that my zoom percentage (I use an add on) was usually around 140 for most web sites.  Now it's about 130, so 10 less.  And the Windows Display sliding setting (Ease of Access - Display) is around 140.  That's one setting I didn't write down, but thought it was around 160. </p><p>I have no idea what happened.    </p><p>One question - on the far right, on the task bar that has the internet address field, there's an icon for Extensions (looks like a puzzle piece).  Is there a way to remove it?

(Windows 10, 64 bit Desktop PC) </p><p>I work with media apps which DO require a lot of memory, such as Adobe Audition, and last night Audition first slowed down and then crashed while I was rushing to finish an urgent project. </p><p>I thought what the heck is going on - opened Task Manager - <strong>and lo and behold Firefox had several windows running taking up 85% of memory which I needed for my app!! </strong> <strong> </strong> I had only 5 -6 tabs opened in the browser - this is insane!  every new update you release is more memory hungry - and I do NOT have ANY extensions and my computer is quite powerful designed for media work. </p><p>I found online advice to click on Minimise Memory button in about:memory - which I did. </p><p><strong>But this should not be an OPTION which you have to guess how to disable!  This  has to be included in the Firefox SETTINGS!</strong> </p><p>So now, until you REDUCE this memory hunger I have to close the browser while working on my apps, or use another browser altogether. </p><p>Are there Firefox developers on this forum to reply? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1120;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1576463;,etcetera777

Is that something to be concerned about (e.g. Virus etc.) I haven't changed any firefox/windows settings, am using windows 10, firefox version 112.0.1. I have admin privileges.
