(Windows 10, 64 bit Desktop PC) </p><p>I work with media apps which DO require a lot of memory, such as Adobe Audition, and last night Audition first slowed down and then crashed while I was rushing to finish an urgent project. </p><p>I thought what the heck is going on - opened Task Manager - <strong>and lo and behold Firefox had several windows running taking up 85% of memory which I needed for my app!! </strong> <strong> </strong> I had only 5 -6 tabs opened in the browser - this is insane!  every new update you release is more memory hungry - and I do NOT have ANY extensions and my computer is quite powerful designed for media work. </p><p>I found online advice to click on Minimise Memory button in about:memory - which I did. </p><p><strong>But this should not be an OPTION which you have to guess how to disable!  This  has to be included in the Firefox SETTINGS!</strong> </p><p>So now, until you REDUCE this memory hunger I have to close the browser while working on my apps, or use another browser altogether. </p><p>Are there Firefox developers on this forum to reply? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1120;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1576463;,etcetera777

Is that something to be concerned about (e.g. Virus etc.) I haven't changed any firefox/windows settings, am using windows 10, firefox version 112.0.1. I have admin privileges. Thank you. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",byejessieli
