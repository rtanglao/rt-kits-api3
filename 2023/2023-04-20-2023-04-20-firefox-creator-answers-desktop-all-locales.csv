Every time I try to log on to my nsi (National Savings) account with Firefox I find that I usually have to put my log-in details twice, even after it seems to go through the authorisation of device process.  Also I have to repeatedly accept cookies if I do manage to get into my account.  It is so bad I generally turn to Chrome for logging on to my nsi account as this is always straightforward.   I complained to nsi but they assure me the problem lies with my browser.   Is there something in Firefox settings I need to adjust to get around this nsi log in problem? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",grtate

So the new installation gets a collection of relatively random shortcuts for websites I visit, plus a few of the default ones (with the search option/magnifying glass feature integrated) for sites I don't really visit, then this is synced on all other computers. I have to go manually on one of the others and redo the pinned shortcuts, then this syncs everywhere. </p><p>I've had the issue for years. I work from multiple computers so the sync feature is invaluable but also extremely annoying that I have to redo a couple of dozens pinned shortcuts every time I install and sync a new Firefox. The rest of the sync works fine (bookmarks, etc.). </p><p>Am I doing something wrong or is Firefox unable to properly sync pinned shortcuts? I imagine I can migrate the profiles over all the time but the benefit of the sync feature is that it's seamless so I'd rather use that if possible. </p><p>Thank you! </p>",desktop;beta;sync;windows-10;firefox-1130;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",v_a
