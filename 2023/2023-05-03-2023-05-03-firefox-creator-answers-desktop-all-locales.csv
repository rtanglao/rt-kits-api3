Once on the page, I select the ""Blue Star"" and then try to remove the bookmark for that page to no avail. The bookmark remains even after shutting down and restarting Firefox (sync is off). Moreover, there are some bookmarks for which the ""Remove Bookmark"" option is not available after selecting the Blue Star. </p><p>I know that I can delete unwanted bookmarks using the Bookmark Manager but that method is time consuming when it comes to unknown, orphaned bookmarks that one stumbles upon from time to time. The aforementioned technique for removing these orphaned bookmarks is quicker assuming it worked.  </p><p>Perhaps the Blue Star could remain filled in once a page is saved and subsequently returned too. Should one wish to remove the bookmark one need only return to the page and deselect the filled in Blue Star thus returning it to its outlined form while also removing the bookmark from ones menu.   </p><p>Thoughts? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",michael.edwards
