I noticed slow downs on all internet connections, and after trial and error discovered that if I make any kind of search on Google, my wifi connection to my router would begin to disconnect and reconnect every 5 seconds. I've verified this by having command prompt keep a continuous ping to my router (ping 192.168.1.1 -t). The problem still happens in troubleshoot mode, and with all extensions and add-ons disabled. It doesn't happen from other search engine websites (bing), and it doesn't happen in other google services (gmail, google maps, youtube) or is caused by the Google homepage. I also don't have this issue when doing a Google search on other browsers. The only way I've found to fix it is to close Firefox, let the cache clear, and reopen the browser with any Google search tabs closed. I've only noticed this issue recently, and as Firefox has been my main browser for the last decade, and Google my primary search engine, I'd be extremely appreciative if I could get some help finding and fixing the cause of this.  </p><p>The attached image is the ping timeouts cause by making a search on Google. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1090;firefox-10901;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",spyspiv

When installed through the Mint Software Manager, Firefox comes with the DisableAppUpdates policy enabled, which is meant to disable automatic updates. This suits me just fine, as I prefer to update Firefox manually as new versions are released rather than have them pushed on me. However, I've found that Firefox <em>does</em> update automatically. In fact, because of the policy, I am unable to <em>prevent</em> it from updating automatically. As you can see in the included screenshots, I am running the most recent version of Firefox (released today), despite updates being ostensibly disabled. I cannot find a way to disable the policy or prevent the automatic updates. </p><p>Why is this happening, and how can I stop it? </p>",desktop;other;firefox-1090;firefox-10901;,firefox,other,en-US,1563168;,sketchguess6218
