I found the solution to that problem created by the Firefox devs themselves (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1370409#answer-1488645"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1370409#answer-1488645</a>) and was going to leave it alone. It was just yet another obscure about:config setting to FIX a regression introduced by Firefox devs, no biggie, ALL firefox users are used to doing that by now since devs keep implementing solutions that look for problems instead of the other way around, but then someone said that you guys might get rid of the ability to disable this in the future. PLEASE DON'T. This ""new way"" of doing things is filling up MY HOME folder on Linux, not even my download folder. Instead of getting rid of this setting why don't you MAKE IT EXPLICIT in the downloads section. It's the least you can do since you created a problem that solves nothing. Most users who can't remember to download a pdf they were looking at won't remember how to look for it in the downloads folder either. You will just clutter people's download folder with JUNK for no reason and eat at their storage. I'll say it once and I'll say it again: the biggest advocates for Firefox's rival browsers are Firefox devs themselves smh. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1070;,firefox,other,en-US,"",BuffedShampoo

I've verified this by having command prompt keep a continuous ping to my router (ping 192.168.1.1 -t). The problem still happens in troubleshoot mode, and with all extensions and add-ons disabled. It doesn't happen from other search engine websites (bing), and it doesn't happen in other google services (gmail, google maps, youtube) or is caused by the Google homepage. I also don't have this issue when doing a Google search on other browsers. The only way I've found to fix it is to close Firefox, let the cache clear, and reopen the browser with any Google search tabs closed. I've only noticed this issue recently, and as Firefox has been my main browser for the last decade, and Google my primary search engine, I'd be extremely appreciative if I could get some help finding and fixing the cause of this.  </p><p>The attached image is the ping timeouts cause by making a search on Google. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1090;firefox-10901;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",spyspiv
