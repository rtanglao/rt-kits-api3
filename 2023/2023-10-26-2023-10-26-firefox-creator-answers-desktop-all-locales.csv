It worked up until today. </p><p>1. When testing the connection (test links were available on the above site), the listboxes for camera, microphone, and speaker, usually display all the devices attached to my Mac. </p><p>2. Today, the listbox for speakers were BLANK. Before invoking Firefox, I had set the system defaults in System Preferences-&gt;sound to the defaults I wanted. </p><p>3. The microphone and camera worked as expected. </p><p>4. I was unable to select the speaker (listbox was blank) and we ended up using cell phones on either end for the audio). </p><p>5. Repeating the test on Safari, everything (including the speaker selection) worked as expected. </p><p>6. Back on Firefox, when I went to Preferences-&gt;Permissions-&gt;microphone  AND Preferences-&gt;Permissions-&gt;Camera: The saved devices appeared (for zoom and simplepractice.) BUT in: Preferences-&gt;Permissions-&gt;Speaker, zoom appeared, but <a href=""http://simplepractice.com"" rel=""nofollow"">simplepractice.com</a> did not. </p><p>7. In desperation, I edited permissions.sqlite (with DB Browser for SqlLite.app) and added the missing speaker permission for <a href=""http://simplepractice.com"" rel=""nofollow"">simplepractice.com</a>. (The actual site for the conference is on <a href=""http://video.simplepractice.com"" rel=""nofollow"">video.simplepractice.com</a>) </p><p>Hopefully, when I have my conference next Wednesday, this hack will work.) The item I added to permissions.sqlite now appears in the speaker permissions window. </p><p>9. NOTE: I tried all the usual GUI interface tools before resorting to editing permissions.squlite. </p><p>8. Any idea why Firefox failed/is failing to add items to speaker permissions? </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1190;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jeffb4

It is me, or a global bug (or new feature).

This appears to happen with Helvetica font and maybe some others. The problem seems to go away when firefox is launched in safe mode, and does not occur in other browsers. After a little digging I found when I turn hardware acceleration off the problem seems to fix itself. I'd rather not operate firefox with this option off, and I have a relatively new mac so this shouldn't be an issue. Is there a better way to solve this problem? Attached are pictures of the issue when hardware acceleration is on. As you can see, there are weird characters that display on the right. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1190;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",bradenbouwman
