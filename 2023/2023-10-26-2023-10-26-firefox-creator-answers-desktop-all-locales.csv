But now when i fly my pointer on ""recently closed tab"", instead of only having the 15 last closed tab of my current firefox windows, i have also the 15 of each opened firefox windows. means if i have 2 page it show 30 tabs, etc. the first 15 being the tab of the current windows (ex: FF windows 1) and the 15 next for the other opened one (FF windows 2), when i check ""recently closed tab"" on the other windows it is reversed (the 15 first tab are the windows 2 closed ones, and the 15 next from the windows 1). It is me, or a global bug (or new feature). If the second, how to return to the former option (means having only the tab closed from the current windows showing) </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-11;firefox-1190;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",thor94

This appears to happen with Helvetica font and maybe some others. The problem seems to go away when firefox is launched in safe mode, and does not occur in other browsers. After a little digging I found when I turn hardware acceleration off the problem seems to fix itself. I'd rather not operate firefox with this option off, and I have a relatively new mac so this shouldn't be an issue. Is there a better way to solve this problem? Attached are pictures of the issue when hardware acceleration is on. As you can see, there are weird characters that display on the right. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1190;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",bradenbouwman
