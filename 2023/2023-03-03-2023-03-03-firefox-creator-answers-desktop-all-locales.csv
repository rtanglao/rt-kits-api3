I signed in as usual, but I got a 400 error message, saying the server can't process the request because it's malformed. I have no idea what's going on here. I'm using version 110.0.1 of Firefox. Just updated earlier yesterday and up till fifteen minutes ago, everything was working fine. What happened?!  </p><p>I'm including a screenshot of what I'm seeing.

Eu formatei meu computador e vendi pois comprei um novo. Ao instalar o firefox no meu novo macbook, fiz login com minha conta do firefox, porem nao tem nada das minhas informacoes e dados do meu perfil do computador antigo.  Ou seja, sumiu todo o historico, marcadores e palavras passe. </p><p>Como fa√ßo para recupera-los? </p><p>Ja fiz esse procedimento ano passado quando formatei o computador, porem desta vez nao aparece nada. </p><p>Na foto tem apenas as 2 credenciais que fiz login agora no computador novo. </p><p>Obrigada. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,other,pt-BR,"",franiahoffmann

One scroll of the mouse wheel moves the tabs like 80% of the way across the tab-bar. This is problematic when the browser window is sharing half the screen and a scroll moves all visible tabs away. This means I have to then click the buttons to move the tabs one-at-a-time and if I click too fast it scrolls an entire pages worth which is also unwanted. </p><p>TLDR: I want a setting like `mousewheel.default.delta_multiplier_y` that only works in the tab-bar. </p>,linux;desktop;tabs;firefox-1100;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",siph

The new tab closed in this manner will not show up in the history of closed tabs either (likely because this list is only updated after a tab fully loads a page before being closed, which obviously never happens).  I have not added any new addons since long before this problem started, but I did try disabling any tab related addons to no effect. </p>",desktop;tabs;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1090;firefox-10901;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",700_Tnega_Terces
