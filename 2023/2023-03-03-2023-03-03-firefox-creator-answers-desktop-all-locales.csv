One scroll of the mouse wheel moves the tabs like 80% of the way across the tab-bar. This is problematic when the browser window is sharing half the screen and a scroll moves all visible tabs away. This means I have to then click the buttons to move the tabs one-at-a-time and if I click too fast it scrolls an entire pages worth which is also unwanted. </p><p>TLDR: I want a setting like `mousewheel.default.delta_multiplier_y` that only works in the tab-bar. </p>,linux;desktop;tabs;firefox-1100;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",siph

The new tab closed in this manner will not show up in the history of closed tabs either (likely because this list is only updated after a tab fully loads a page before being closed, which obviously never happens).
