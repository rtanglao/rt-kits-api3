I find that if I drag the right edge of the window in a small amount, the title bar drops down a few pixels so I can see a few pixels of the title bar and its controls. So adjusting the right edge seems to cause a recalculation of the top edge. It suggests that on launch, there is a miscalculation. It would be nice to fix this  - a minor irritation as I now have a workaround.  Note - if I *drag* the title bar to the top of the window, the furthest 'north' I can go is this same position with a few pixels of the title bar showing - If I go further, the title bar ( not the whole window)  jumps back to have this same part showing. regards Gareth HP Envy  Win 11   NVidia   HDR screen 3840x2160 (the recommended setting) with text set 200% </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,other,en-US,"",west.dale.gw

I purchased the domain <a href=""http://heartofstoneclothing.com"" rel=""nofollow"">heartofstoneclothing.com</a> using my Samsung A21s and my credit card.  </p><p>I was visiting a friend at the time who offered the use of his computer to me as a kind gesture. I have been residing on the friends property since January and have been using that device up until recently. With my provident fund I purchased a laptop and have been using it since to recover most of my work. </p><p>My work got intercepted the day ICANN's 60 day holding period was over, since it wasn't my computer I had no say over it. In South Africa we have a problem with consistent power outages known as load shedding, long story short; I woke up from an extended nap to watch my work get taken and redirected.  </p><p>I have had major 4 major confrontations with my friend, Gary, whether or not he was snooping through my files. Ive been lied to in my face 4 times, been sworn at, had pots and pans thrown at me for falsely accusing him. I let it go due to alternate accommodation difficulties. At the risk of losing my work completely I have allowed friend to run around the part my browser he gained access to. I might have unknowingly given it up, or at least part of it since it was not my computer. </p><p>In these altercations I have been chased away, but i could not leave my work on that computer. Not having access to an external hard drive and no time I mass dumped everything anywhere i could find space; My OneDrive, GoogleDrive, Dropbox. At the time i had just came across MDN after working on Firefox for the first time and exploring its glories.  </p><p>I have bookmarks that don't belong to me in my bookmarks toolbar, there is personal information that is not mine getting sent to me and I have had to manage this person and his websites while sacrificing my own. I'm not entirely sure how to separate our work without, because the bookmarks i delete reappear every time and I no longer wish to use the old device. </p><p>I herewith kindly ask that i could receive some assistance with the issue, this situation has messed my brain up for months and I finally have an understanding of what i need to do, but I am quite new to working with software and can't afford to let it go askew. </p>",windows-7;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",santowskikr

When I pause the video, tab (Cmd + Tab on MacOS) into Unreal Engine, do some things, then tab back and resume the video, it will play for one frame and then stop and buffer, but the audio will continue playing. The only way to get the video to resume is to skip forward/backward in the video (either with the arrow keys or the progress bar). I've also tried Troubleshooting/Safe mode and the issue still persits. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;website-breakages;firefox-1150;firefox-11501;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",beatzoid
