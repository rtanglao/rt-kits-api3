I find that if I drag the right edge of the window in a small amount, the title bar drops down a few pixels so I can see a few pixels of the title bar and its controls. So adjusting the right edge seems to cause a recalculation of the top edge. It suggests that on launch, there is a miscalculation. It would be nice to fix this  - a minor irritation as I now have a workaround.  Note - if I *drag* the title bar to the top of the window, the furthest 'north' I can go is this same position with a few pixels of the title bar showing - If I go further, the title bar ( not the whole window)  jumps back to have this same part showing. regards Gareth HP Envy  Win 11   NVidia   HDR screen 3840x2160 (the recommended setting) with text set 200% </p>",desktop;other;needsinfo;windows-11;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,other,en-US,1590688;1590777;,west.dale.gw
