When I pause the video, tab (Cmd + Tab on MacOS) into Unreal Engine, do some things, then tab back and resume the video, it will play for one frame and then stop and buffer, but the audio will continue playing. The only way to get the video to resume is to skip forward/backward in the video (either with the arrow keys or the progress bar). I've also tried Troubleshooting/Safe mode and the issue still persits. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;website-breakages;firefox-1150;firefox-11501;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",beatzoid

However, with an other WIN10 drive I still can access the data. I need to save all the Firefox bookmarks before I will format the Drive and install a fresh WIN10. All the searches just tell how to backup when Firefox is open or Win is running: Press WIN Key... etc. None of them is applicable.   I have I have bookmarks saved as bookmarks as well as I have a lot on the upper bar. I need them all. </p><p>Please teach me how I can back them up and restore on a fresh Firefox.
