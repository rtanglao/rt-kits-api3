The login web page has options to login using Google, Facebook, or Apple, but in a normal Firefox window, the buttons for using these logins never appear - I just get a whirling circle where the buttons should appear, and the page never completes loading. If I open the GCN login web page in a private FF window, the buttons appear and I can login without any problem. If I use Firefox Settings to clear all cookies and cached web data, then close and restart Firefox, I still can't login from a normal FF window. </p><p>I tried the Edge browser (OS is Windows 11) and login there works without problem </p><p>Any suggestions on a fix to get it working on Firefox?
