I've tried all the ""OPEN WITH"" options but can not get to the basic photo editor. Need some help here...

Knowing that I have been able to recover in-progress Reddit comments after a crash from the sessionstore-backups so long as I was on the page at the time of the crash, I know that at least one site saves all in-progress comments to that, and I highly suspect that is where in-progress Wikipedia edits are kept, I (wanting as much data as possible for as good of a recovery chance as possible) immediately copied all my Profile files, totalling more than 1.6 GB, to a non-volatile folder. </p><p>As I had done before, I took the most recent sessionstore-backups file (dated to the exact minute of the crash), forced it through the <a href=""https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/scrounger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Session History Scrounger</a> to decompress it, and then mass-replaced the document's \ns with proper newlines in Notepad++, which used to make the file more readable. </p><p>This time, it didn't. They must have changed the json newline formatting used between at least late April and now. And more importantly, when I searched through the file for keywords I used in the comment, I couldn't find it. Simply, it appears that in-progress YouTube comments aren't stored in that file. </p><p><strong>So, where are they stored?</strong> Are they in any vaguely human-readable file (or file that can with some ease be converted into something vaguely human-readable)? Can I somehow revive a ""zombie session"" using just archived Profile folder data to copy it out of? Or should I just give up and rewrite the comment from scratch? </p><p>NOTE 1: This is adapted from a previous post made with an associated account on <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/16p05ex/is_it_possible_to_with_any_ease_recover_an/"" rel=""nofollow"">Reddit</a>. As I fear using Firefox until I get this problem resolved due to the possible loss in ability to recover other data if I do so, I figure that giving the problem more attention here would be beneficial in resolving it more quickly.  </p><p>NOTE 2: Also, to clarify, I don't need to restore the session and have the comment re-appear; I'd be fine with locating it in a text editor or similar program so I could copy it back into the submission box once the session is restored. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",peterhartlage2000

I could not connect to the Internet with Firefox (Default Browser for Windows 10). I could connect to the Internet with Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.  After several hours of troubleshooting, I discovered that I had to: (1) click the Firefox menu button, (2) click Help, (3) select More Troubleshooting Information, (4) click Refresh Firefox ..., and (5) then click Refresh Firefox in the confirmation window that opens. After that Firefox closes to refresh itself. Then I can use Firefox to connect. </p><p>Please explain why must I go through this process now, in order to get Internet connection?
