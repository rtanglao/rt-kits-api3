The issue appeared a couple of years ago. I found it using <em><strong>LaunchBar</strong></em>, but I can reproduce it from a <em><strong>terminal</strong></em> (at least LaunchBar is not to blame). </p><p>1) If Firefox is active (I mean, has been launched) and I type the following in a terminal window <em>open '<a href=""http://www.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org</a>'</em> then Firefox opens a new tab with <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a> (same with any other site). </p><p>2) However, if Firefox is not active (for instance, it has just been quit) and I type the same command in terminal, then Firefox launches, reopens previous tabs, but opens no new tab, thus failing to open <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a> (which is what I want). </p><p>I tried refreshing (could not try safe mode because the activation of Firefox should be triggered by the terminal command). I also tried uninstalling + fresh copy of Firefox, but as soon as the sync with my mozilla account occurs the problem comes back. I even tried to delete my Mozilla account and recreating a new one, that did not solve the issue. </p><p>Note that when I try (2), I sometimes very briefly (1/10 sec) see a new Firefox window open with the right site (<a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a>) and this window disappears. </p><p>The setting for browser.startup.page is 3 and no plugins at all (fresh install, account wiped). </p><p>Any help is welcome... </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1605636;,antoine.gautier

Knowing that I have been able to recover in-progress Reddit comments after a crash from the sessionstore-backups so long as I was on the page at the time of the crash, I know that at least one site saves all in-progress comments to that, and I highly suspect that is where in-progress Wikipedia edits are kept, I (wanting as much data as possible for as good of a recovery chance as possible) immediately copied all my Profile files, totalling more than 1.6 GB, to a non-volatile folder. </p><p>As I had done before, I took the most recent sessionstore-backups file (dated to the exact minute of the crash), forced it through the <a href=""https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/scrounger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Session History Scrounger</a> to decompress it, and then mass-replaced the document's \ns with proper newlines in Notepad++, which used to make the file more readable. </p><p>This time, it didn't. They must have changed the json newline formatting used between at least late April and now. And more importantly, when I searched through the file for keywords I used in the comment, I couldn't find it. Simply, it appears that in-progress YouTube comments aren't stored in that file. </p><p><strong>So, where are they stored?</strong> Are they in any vaguely human-readable file (or file that can with some ease be converted into something vaguely human-readable)? Can I somehow revive a ""zombie session"" using just archived Profile folder data to copy it out of? Or should I just give up and rewrite the comment from scratch? </p><p>NOTE 1: This is adapted from a previous post made with an associated account on <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/16p05ex/is_it_possible_to_with_any_ease_recover_an/"" rel=""nofollow"">Reddit</a>. As I fear using Firefox until I get this problem resolved due to the possible loss in ability to recover other data if I do so, I figure that giving the problem more attention here would be beneficial in resolving it more quickly.  </p><p>NOTE 2: Also, to clarify, I don't need to restore the session and have the comment re-appear; I'd be fine with locating it in a text editor or similar program so I could copy it back into the submission box once the session is restored. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",peterhartlage2000
