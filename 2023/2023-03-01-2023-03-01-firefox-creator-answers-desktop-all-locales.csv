I only noticed after trying to expand/shrink my window and seeing it take at least 2 seconds minimum to actualize. Also, and i have tested this multiple times, this affects my Windows Explorer process and causes a marked increase in CPU &amp; Power usage (minimum of 20% cpu increase, Power Usage at 'Very High'). I did an entire battery of error checking with windows own default tools, chkdsk, dism, sfc, nothing found. Virus checking found nothing. Then i did a chkdsk /r /f scan and that seemingly mitigated the problem but didnt do away with it, it still happens, i even disabled all my extensions, and made another firefox profile (firefox.exe -p) and tried to see if it was something in my default that i tweaked wrong, nope, the high resource usage still affecting firefox and windows explorer </p><p>i don't know if what im experiencing is something to report to the bugzilla website, if the solution is something easier, or not, but.....what the heck is going on, and how can i get this taken care of.

Please allow us the choice.  There are many people with many legitimate reasons for wanting and needing to turn this off and have it stay turned off.  Those of us using various retro versions of Firefox also need this option.  No further explanations needed!   </p><p>Lets start with putting the choice to Never Update back in the options. </p><p>Worse yet, this program re-writes registry keys and options settings when the computer and/or program is restarted, so that the update options are changed back to the default auto install.  This is causing problems on internal networks to the point of making the browser unusable.   </p><p>What about time lost in having to turn this off each time the computer is restarted.  For instance, if you are using a laptop in a limited data situation.  You have turned this off previously.  You shut the machine down for the night.  In the morning you need to connect and do work and turn the machine on while you walk away for a minute because it's set to do mail and make connections to work network automatically.  When you return, its stuck because auto updates are running.  The internal work network connection times out and that system is locked up.  So now you have to call IT.  Morning lost. </p><p>As private users, not being able to turn this off permanently is making us stop using Firefox altogether.    We want sovereignty over OUR computers.  We paid for them and feel we can throw them out the window if we want!  (I've done this many times.)  Remember the customer being ""right""! </p><p>Repeat after me. WE OWN OUR COMPUTERS!
