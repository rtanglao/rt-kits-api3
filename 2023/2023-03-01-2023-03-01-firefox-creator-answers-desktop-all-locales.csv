Personally often I can't even prove that the problem with specific file exists, because when I download the example file, I'm not notified about uncommon download, but screenshots from my clients are real. </p><p>Of course I've read any document I found describing how the Google Safe Browsing mechanism works and I do understand that it is developed to protect the users, but my question about EV certificate is still wondering me. </p><p>Microsoft advisor described that EV signing may help for Edge users: <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/886010/avoiding-microsoft-edge-isnt-commonly-downloaded-w"" rel=""nofollow"">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/886010/avoiding-microsoft-edge-isnt-commonly-downloaded-w</a>.

Please allow us the choice.  There are many people with many legitimate reasons for wanting and needing to turn this off and have it stay turned off.  Those of us using various retro versions of Firefox also need this option.  No further explanations needed!   </p><p>Lets start with putting the choice to Never Update back in the options. </p><p>Worse yet, this program re-writes registry keys and options settings when the computer and/or program is restarted, so that the update options are changed back to the default auto install.  This is causing problems on internal networks to the point of making the browser unusable.   </p><p>What about time lost in having to turn this off each time the computer is restarted.  For instance, if you are using a laptop in a limited data situation.  You have turned this off previously.  You shut the machine down for the night.  In the morning you need to connect and do work and turn the machine on while you walk away for a minute because it's set to do mail and make connections to work network automatically.  When you return, its stuck because auto updates are running.  The internal work network connection times out and that system is locked up.  So now you have to call IT.  Morning lost. </p><p>As private users, not being able to turn this off permanently is making us stop using Firefox altogether.    We want sovereignty over OUR computers.  We paid for them and feel we can throw them out the window if we want!  (I've done this many times.)  Remember the customer being ""right""! </p><p>Repeat after me. WE OWN OUR COMPUTERS!  We are the final word on them! You need to understand that.   </p><p>How about just a succinct answer on how to do this.
