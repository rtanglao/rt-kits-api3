I believe I am missing shadow boxes on white elements. A good example of this is within google docs. I cannot see the beginning or ending of a page. I also cannot see the vertical edges of the pages as well. Also, if a website has a white input box the box has no definition so I have no idea where it is unless I enable dark mode. I have refreshed Firefox while also deleting all json pref files. I added a screenshot within google docs and as you can see there are no edges. The middle of the photo is the end/beginning of a new page. The page number is also located in the bottom right of the page.  </p><p>James </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,other,en-US,"",rphil3442

When trying to sign up Firefox said the email was bounced and to check the address. We know the address is right because we received the email code. My guess is that Firefox mistakes the auto reply email with a bounce back. As I said this is a commercial account so they have an auto reply setup (“Thanks for reaching out, we will get back to you etc”).  Now I’m waiting for 15’ before I can try to sign in again because it locked me out.  I understand the feature is supposed to be helpful but if you can’t reliably detect real bounce backs it should be disabled. If I can’t use this address to create the account because of this my options are: - Tell this person to create a new email - Ask them to disable the auto reply in their current email  - Don’t use Sync at all  </p><p>None of these options is desirable or practical. </p>",desktop;sync;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",diegus831
