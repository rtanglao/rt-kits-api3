Windows Audio Endpoint Builder activity go sky high too.  Can not even play spotify songs at all when it gets like this, the audio loads, but no sound can be herd.  It started just random as I was watching youtube.  </p><p>But if I play sound in any other web browser or outside of Firefox on VLC or something , the sound is just fine.  I removed any added tools, restarted, no it did not work.  </p><p>Then today, is suddenly went back to normal.... for half the day then it went bad again.  Then I was listening on a playlist on Spotify and it went silent so I though the playlist stopped , but no.
