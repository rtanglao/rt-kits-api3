It seems like firefox automatically removes the path from the URL which is quite annoying. I want it to suggest what is ACTUALLY in my search history, not some shortened version of it. Is there any way to stop firefox from doing that? Any help would be greatly appreciated! </p><p>Below is a picture of what is suggests when I type ""mail"" in the address bar.  Also below is a picture of my history showing that the url it suggests is not even in my history. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,other,en-US,"",vurden

This is a problem on news, blog, and most pages with a lot of text. Before headlines can be fully read, the page reloads and you're back at the top. This has been a problem since Netscape went away. There was a red stop button that froze the page. The page didn't reload until manually reloaded. The only solution I've found is to unplug Starlink, read the page and replug, refresh. Using FF since Netscape died. I have used Chrome and others, but this is a common annoyance. I suppose this constant reloading on some sites is a way to increase page view stats. </p><p>Windows 7, FF 108.0.2. I normally update FF when new updates appear. </p><p>I do have a new PC with windows 11, but it's such a mess, I'll probably have to load Linux to make it usable. </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help. </p><p>John </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1080;,firefox,other,en-US,1558799;1558800;1558801;1558803;1558806;1558807;1558809;,johndapper
