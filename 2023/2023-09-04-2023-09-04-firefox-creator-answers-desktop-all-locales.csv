I gather this has been a problem before.  An archived post on the same subject (2021) informs that the problem is fixed in Version 91.xx.  Well. I'm afraid it's back again in Version 117 (and perhaps earlier). </p><p>pts </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1170;,firefox,other,en-US,"",pts3

I can barely do internet surfing - browsers are crashing constantly! In case of Chrome I just see this (see ChromeCrash1 and ChromeCrash2 screenshots). In case of Mozilla the browser closes with an error. It happens on almost every site including Google maps or Linked in. Safari still works well (so far haha). </p><p>Firefox version: 117.0 (64 bit) Crash reports: I sent a lot of them, this is the link to the one of them: <a href=""https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/6c86a946-2f8e-4efd-accd-279d10230904"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/6c86a946-2f8e-4efd-accd-279d10230904</a> </p><p>What I have tried and what didn't help: 1. Clear cache, cookies and all data 2. Reinstall browser 3. Use incognito mode (helps, but not all the time) 4. Reinstall MacOS and install browsers again. 5. Reset NVRAM </p><p>My colleagues are using the same browser and macOS version and don't have these issues. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",astryd.mad

Dříve měly dlaždice zkratek vzhled faviconu nebo ""nějakého loga"" stránky, na kterou odkazovaly. Dnes se mi v dlaždicích většinou zobrazují jen počáteční písmena odkazu. Jen výjimečně je tam nějaký související vzhled a to ne po celé ploše dlaždice ale pouze jako mrňavá ikonka uprostřed. Když chci v dlaždici nastavit vlastní obrázek, zadám adresu, v náhledu se mi zobrazí náhled stránky (většinou jde o nějaký výřez, ne favicon), ovšem po uložení zůstane dlaždice prázdná. </p><p>Tuším, že někde do verze Firefoxu 7x měly dlaždice po celé ploše favicon stránky na kterou odkazovaly. Bylo to perfektně přehledné. </p><p>Nevíte, jak se k tomuto stylu vrátit? Downgrade Firefoxu za mě není řešení. </p><p>Díky za všechny reakce. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,tabs,cs,1601678;,jiri.sramek

Now, there's a new update, and I don't want to install it unless there's a guarantee that it won't do unwanted changes, or at least give me the option to revert to my existing version if the new version doesn't work for me.

I found the issue was still unresolved so I looked into it more carefully.   When I startup and shutdown Firefox, there are 6 processes, which I read was normal.  However, it adds 5 more processes each time I startup and shutdown the browser.  I do not want to leave the browser up all day and I let my computer sleep rather than shutdown each night.  I reboot after updates etc.  The processes disappear on restart/reboot.  WIN 11 Pro 64 bit. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1170;,firefox,other,en-US,1601633;1601680;,jmlutz01
