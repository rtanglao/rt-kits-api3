I found the issue was still unresolved so I looked into it more carefully.   When I startup and shutdown Firefox, there are 6 processes, which I read was normal.  However, it adds 5 more processes each time I startup and shutdown the browser.  I do not want to leave the browser up all day and I let my computer sleep rather than shutdown each night.  I reboot after updates etc.  The processes disappear on restart/reboot.  WIN 11 Pro 64 bit. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1170;,firefox,other,en-US,1601633;,jmlutz01
