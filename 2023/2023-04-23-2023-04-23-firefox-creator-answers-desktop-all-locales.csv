I've made the text of the tabs and toolbar large enough for my taste, yet that same setting make the text for everything else in the browser way too big. I'd rather not download a third-party extension as the solution as that implies third-party data gathering.

However, I have recently hit a bit of a snag as follows - In a website that has PDF's as links that can be viewed - ie click on a link saying ""View"" the document - when I click on it nothing happens. I can right click and open the link in new tab, when I do this the same page opens again, with the same hyperlink - same thing happens when I click on that, ad infinitum. Other browsers (DDG) immediately save the PDF - so the links work on those browsers. Interestingly, some other links on the same website to PDF documents do work in FF. I have noticed that the ""openable"" links end on .pdf but the links I can't open (as docs) don't. I've tried disabling all add-ons, ensuring FF is up-to-date - version 112.0.1, changing all security settings to their lowest setting, tried changing what to do when FF opens a PDF, but nothing makes a difference. I think the issue is related to opening links and have toggled all the ""links"" settings but again, no difference. Can you help please? Thanks very much and kind regards, Andy. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1120;firefox-11201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",pipandandyiow
