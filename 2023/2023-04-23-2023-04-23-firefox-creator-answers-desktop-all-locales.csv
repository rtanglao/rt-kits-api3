The delete option is grayed out.,"<p>Several years I logged into an extended family member's computer, accidentally sync from another browser and now this folder has been following me around. The thing is it's full of some really gross things. Mostly extreme right opinion pieces and just so much porn. I really want this folder to go away, but when I right click it the delete option is grayed out. I've tried deleting them one by one, but everything I close the window and reopen it again, all of the links are back. How do I purge this from my mozilla account? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1120;firefox-11201;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",roxierobinson

Firefox said NO. Is there a way to have two passwords using the same email address? I did try to log in when I signed up for the second course and it did not recognize my email address. The sign in process for the first site is slightly different and goes through the instructor's site, and then through <a href=""http://teachable.com"" rel=""nofollow"">teachable.com</a>. My password for the first class is stored on Firefox under teachable...and I've emailed myself the password to the second class until I can resolve this. I thought there would be a comment field or something to differentiate the two courses. Please help. Many thanks! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1120;firefox-11201;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",smclewis
