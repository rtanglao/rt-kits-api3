Firefox said NO. Is there a way to have two passwords using the same email address? I did try to log in when I signed up for the second course and it did not recognize my email address. The sign in process for the first site is slightly different and goes through the instructor's site, and then through <a href=""http://teachable.com"" rel=""nofollow"">teachable.com</a>. My password for the first class is stored on Firefox under teachable...and I've emailed myself the password to the second class until I can resolve this. I thought there would be a comment field or something to differentiate the two courses. Please help. Many thanks! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1120;firefox-11201;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",smclewis
