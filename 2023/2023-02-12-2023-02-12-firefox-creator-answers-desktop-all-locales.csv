I couldn't move my mouse or open task manager or do anything. I had ~12 tabs open to my online homework and Discord and TextMaker (a free Word alternative) running as well. I hard shut off my PC by holding down the power button. Upon startup, FF won't open. I click the shortcut and my computer has the little loading circle next to the mouse for a second, but then it disappears and nothing happens. If I try to open a PDF in FF or click a link to open in FF, the same thing happens; a loading circle next to my mouse cursor and nothing. I refreshed FF to no avail. I reinstalled FF, and nothing. I restarted my PC, and still no dice. FF doesn't appear in my task manager when I click it.  </p><p>I tried running the firefox.exe -P command in the run menu and the start menu to manage my profiles and the same thing happens, I get a loading circle by my mouse and nothing happens.  </p><p>I really like FF and use it for my schoolwork. Can anyone help me troubleshoot? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",emilyolsen94
