Our goal is to render headlessly small screenshots, about 200x100px, using HTML specially designed to be rendered with such dimensions, so wee need to use Responsive Design Mode. Creating screenshots from the command line with the options “--window-size 200,100 --screenshot“ works fine, screenshots look rendered in Responsive Mode. But Selenium Webdriver initializes the browser first, and then loads the page. Command line switch “--window-size 200,100“ without “--screenshot“ does not work. Setting window size using webdriver API seems to be affecting the whole window with caption and toolbar in normal mode, so rendering result looks wrong. Is there some command line switch or profile setting to start firefox in Responsive Design Mode? </p><p>We are using the following versions: </p> <ul><li> selenium web driver 4.8.1 </li><li> gecko driver 0.32 </li><li> mozilla firefox 94.0 for linux </li></ul>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",s.kalenikhin

There are only bookmarks in the bookmark menu; but I practically did not use the menu, everything was fresh and most necessary on my panel.

The “recovery” procedure takes about 40 minutes, during which time Firefox does not respond, the processor (all 4 cores) is almost completely occupied by it, and the entire system slows down terribly (an attempt to type in a text editor leads to the appearance of letters in the document with a whistle of 5 ... 10 seconds after how the corresponding keys on the keyboard were pressed). The problem is exactly the same on both work and home computers. In normal programs, a rollback to the previous version, where everything was fine, would help, but you are warned that a new empty profile will be created, and thus it is completely incomprehensible how all my bookmarks can be restored.

Then, recently, I open firefox and my bookmarks are linked wrong. Like, I have Netflix bookmarked, it says Netflix, it has been netflix for as long as I have used Firefox, but if I click on it, it takes me to an article I read weeks ago at this point -one I did <em>not</em> bookmark or even view repeatedly. In some of my folders all of the bookmarks are missing, like they aren't dead, they're just gone. </p><p><strong>But</strong> if I go to my ipad firefox and access my desktop bookmarks from that sync -which I literally just re-synced today- I have all my bookmarks. All of them exist, the links are fine, they're there. But I have tried refreshing Firefox, uninstalling and reinstalling it, restarting my computer, logging out of my account, removing all my extensions, everything I can think of and! Nothing!  </p><p>Also, if I try to restore my bookmarks from an older file, it does nothing. Or it will say it can't access them.  </p><p>I don't know what's going on. I know if I wanted to I could go through and re-bookmark them all because I do have access to all of them on my ipad, but I mostly want to know if there is a way to fix it on my desktop or even figure out what happened. I can't remember anything happening around the time with my browser.
