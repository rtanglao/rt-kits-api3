How to restore/fix?,"<p>Have a 2019 Mac with latest Firefox software installed.  Can no longer use the scroll wheel on the mouse to adjust fonts to variable sizes on web pages and closed-captioning on YouTube.  Instead, the entire image (page/video) either enlarges or shrinks.  Sometimes there is no adjustment at all when I use the scroll wheel.   </p><p>This feature still works correctly on my 2011 Mac/Firefox (i.e., CMD+scroll wheel adjusts the font size).   </p><p>Do you know how to restore the settings on the 2019 Mac so it will once again allow variable font size adjustment on web pages and closed captioning/subtitles? </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1100;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",wenosch

Before the update, the tabs on top scrolled smoothly and one at a time, now it has become worse. A slight upward movement of the scroll moves 7 tabs to the left/right and rather sharply. I didn't find the settings, the manuals, too, the safe mode also didn't help. Everything works correctly in another browser. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",lagger-feed1000

Then, recently, I open firefox and my bookmarks are linked wrong. Like, I have Netflix bookmarked, it says Netflix, it has been netflix for as long as I have used Firefox, but if I click on it, it takes me to an article I read weeks ago at this point -one I did <em>not</em> bookmark or even view repeatedly. In some of my folders all of the bookmarks are missing, like they aren't dead, they're just gone. </p><p><strong>But</strong> if I go to my ipad firefox and access my desktop bookmarks from that sync -which I literally just re-synced today- I have all my bookmarks. All of them exist, the links are fine, they're there. But I have tried refreshing Firefox, uninstalling and reinstalling it, restarting my computer, logging out of my account, removing all my extensions, everything I can think of and! Nothing!  </p><p>Also, if I try to restore my bookmarks from an older file, it does nothing. Or it will say it can't access them.  </p><p>I don't know what's going on. I know if I wanted to I could go through and re-bookmark them all because I do have access to all of them on my ipad, but I mostly want to know if there is a way to fix it on my desktop or even figure out what happened. I can't remember anything happening around the time with my browser. Any help is much appreciated! </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-8;firefox-1100;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",annika.m.van
