Previously, when I opened the folder from the toolbar, it would default to the last position observed, e.g. if I selected a bookmark from the middle, it'd open back up to the middle.  </p><p>It's stopped doing that lately, and instead always opens to the top of the folder. I realize this sounds minor, but it's catastrophic for my use case. Anyone got any tips on how to make it revert to the previous behavior? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",halykan

Unfortunately, these appear to be two distinct bookmark sections on firefox.  See the attached photo: the horizontal bookmarks toolbar displays different bookmarks than the drop down bookmarks menu.  Is there any way to make the two mirror each other without duplicating bookmarks? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1110;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",mkakiti14

I noticed today it has gone through an update and the first difference I noticed is the ""Back to tab"" button has moved from bottom center to top left. As I said, the PIP of Firefox has a great design and features, but is missing one feature that would make it perfect. Can you please add a RED PROGRESS BAR at the bottom of the PIP box. For example, there is an ""Enhancer for YouTube"" addon PIP (not a regular PIP, but other type of PIP that pops up when scrolling down to comments section) which has that and it's very useful (please see attachment). And if that feature is added, the ideal and logical design would be to show the ""red progress bar"" while hovering over the PIP box, not an always-showing feature, just like a YouTube video red progress bar works. </p><p>Thank you, Arthur </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,customize,en-US,1571311;1571312;1571340;,ustaarthur
