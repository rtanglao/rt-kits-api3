I tend to keep a lot of windows open and navigate among them using the ""Window"" pulldown menu at the top between ""Tools"" and ""Help"". It used to be that the latest window more or less stayed at the bottom and the others stayed in order so they were easy to find quickly. A recent upgrade made it so the windows are now alphabetized and constantly shuffling. Since they are alphabetized by the name in the page title, this often offers no clue as to what it is--like it might be alphabetized under like cart or home page or main or something general like that. Also, if you have different tabs in a window, that window might jump from the top to the middle if a different tab is last looked at. Bottom line: it is very difficult and non-intuitive to find a page when you have a lot of windows open--but it used to be easy. Is there a way to order the wondows the way you want them or go back to the chronological order of before? Seems like there must be a setting somewhere. Thanks so much for any help. </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",greggms17

When I wanted to log in to Yahoo Japan account using Firefox Browser after few failed attempts it prevented as unauthorized access. Later I also contacted Yahoo support and was told to wait and try. I waited a day and today again faced the same problems. As I had no options left I used Google Browser and without any problem I succeeded. Please share your thoughts regarding this matter.
