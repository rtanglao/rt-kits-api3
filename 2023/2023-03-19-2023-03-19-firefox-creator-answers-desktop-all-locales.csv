If I have a website I visit on a daily basis like Discord and Twitch, and want to get rid of it from my New Tab page by clicking on the ""Delete from History"" button, I expect it to disappear within a single click although it doesn't happen in that way. Instead, I need to repeat the process by many tens of times just for it to be gone, and it frustrates me. Looking for alternatives that I don't fundamentally understand, mainly found in the settings, also don't do any good. </p><p>So what's the issue? My best solution is just to keep on what I was doing until it's gone. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1571276;,BreadBread061
