When opening the customization screen for the toolbar, I can't seem to drag certain toolbar elements into it? The buttons on the customize screen itself work correctly, and some of the elements present on the toolbar will change between visible and overflow just fine, but others I am completely blocked from moving. Please assist, as this is seriously impacting workflow. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",aubrey.reader

I noticed today it has gone through an update and the first difference I noticed is the ""Back to tab"" button has moved from bottom center to top left. As I said, the PIP of Firefox has a great design and features, but is missing one feature that would make it perfect. Can you please add a RED PROGRESS BAR at the bottom of the PIP box. For example, there is an ""Enhancer for YouTube"" addon PIP (not a regular PIP, but other type of PIP that pops up when scrolling down to comments section) which has that and it's very useful (please see attachment). And if that feature is added, the ideal and logical design would be to show the ""red progress bar"" while hovering over the PIP box, not an always-showing feature, just like a YouTube video red progress bar works. </p><p>Thank you, Arthur </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,customize,en-US,1571311;1571312;,ustaarthur
