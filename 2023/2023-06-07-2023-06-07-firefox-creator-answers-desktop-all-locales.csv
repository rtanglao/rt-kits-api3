Seems to occur when firefox has been running for some time with lots of tabs open. As others have said, it displays a little ""NO"" icon (circle with a line through it) when trying to drag the URL from the lock or favicon section of the address bar, to the desktop. Other times it works fine. </p><p>I searched a bit, but perhaps someone has another idea on how to fix this permanently, or how to recover from it without restarting the computer. Firefox version is 110.0.1. </p><p>PS. I would re think the idea of archiving posts. Because its nice to be able to reply to old posts, even if they are ""solved"". The original poster may have found a solution and never posted about it, for instance. </p>",desktop;other;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,other,en-US,"",firefox2341
