In our company we have Mozilla Firefox ESR onboarded and in use. One of our security report showed that Firefox version we use across company is vulnerable - because not all machines have the latest version installed. So I was a bit surprised because I know that auto-update is enabled for this application. I've checked it on my machine and I've got the latest version once I open Firefox and check via ""About"" button, right after that I've got the latest update installed. Together with my colleague we checked it on her machine whether it's really needed to check the version manually and then update is installed or is installed in the background and seems that my colleague got an update without manually checking the version, she just left the app open and after some time we checked the version and it was already updated. </p><p>My question is - is it enough to have Firefox open and it installed the latest version in the background without any action needed from user? Or user has to manually check the version and afterwards the update will be installed? </p><p>Another question I have, is the application vulnerable even if the app is not open? </p><p>Thank you in advance &amp; BR </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-102110;firefox-10211;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",pavol.hrabcak.extern

I didn't think that they should be there as I have selected ""always use Private Browsing"" and my history is not being saved, or so I thought. These are active links. Clearing history, inc data and cookies doesn't remove these links. Nor does CCleaner or Bitdefender remove these. I want all history and cookies deleted when I exit the Browser. Apart from removing them individually by right-click, what do I do.  It seems that Edge does the same on my partners laptop </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1140;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",seecam42

What happened was that my computer was being strangely slow, so I opened task manager to close some stuff with one of them being firefox. I had about 6 windows open, 2 of them having a lot of tabs, the other 4 only having a few. Reopened firefox, click restore previous session and only 3 windows reopen. I've never had this before and am scrambling to try to fix it as the tabs/windows that did not reopen are the ones that were actually important. I've tried to use the scrounger thing that jscher2000 has suggested and haven't been able to find anything (I don't know much about code tho so could probably be missing something). I don't know what to do and am panicking a little as like I said, those windows that did not reopen were important. I'm trying to figure out if firefox saves older versions of the session restore .jsonlz4 files (besides the .baklz4) but they seem to just be overridden/deleted. Is there anything I can do or am I just screwed? Also recently closed windows and tabs options are empty when looking at the history tab, which has also never happened. New update today so could it be that that has caused this problem? Finally, I've looked at the Import and Backup -&gt; Restore option, which has worked for me once when something similar happened, and between Saturday morning and now (Tuesday), there is nothing, which is odd as I close out all my tabs every night and this morning everything was restored perfectly. Yesterday is when I opened a lot of the important tabs for the one window, so could there be some kind of glitch occuring there? Any help would be appreciated Thanks </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1140;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",Xeimos

Certain pdfs display correctly but other pdfs displayed with Firefox (either locally or online) are displayed badly: spaces are replaced with a lower half block character, fonts not sharp. I installed Firefox from the openSUSE repos (not from flathub) and opened the same pdf and it displayed correctly. I downloaded the pdf and opened it using Okular and no problems. I also opened the “troublesome” pdfs on Firefox in Windows and it displays correctly. I conclude that the flatpak version of Firefox is causing some pdfs to display incorrectly but I don’t know why. </p><p>I installed flatseal to tweak the flatpak Firefox’s settings but nothing seemed to fix the pdf display issue. Please see screenshot below of how Firefox (from openSUSE repos, on the left hand side) and Firefox (from flathub, on the right hand side) display the same pdf from the internet.
