Certain pdfs display correctly but other pdfs displayed with Firefox (either locally or online) are displayed badly: spaces are replaced with a lower half block character, fonts not sharp. I installed Firefox from the openSUSE repos (not from flathub) and opened the same pdf and it displayed correctly. I downloaded the pdf and opened it using Okular and no problems. I also opened the “troublesome” pdfs on Firefox in Windows and it displays correctly. I conclude that the flatpak version of Firefox is causing some pdfs to display incorrectly but I don’t know why. </p><p>I installed flatseal to tweak the flatpak Firefox’s settings but nothing seemed to fix the pdf display issue. Please see screenshot below of how Firefox (from openSUSE repos, on the left hand side) and Firefox (from flathub, on the right hand side) display the same pdf from the internet. The online pdf in the screenshot and used as an example of the issue can be found at: </p><p><a href=""https://www.jrf.org.uk/sites/default/files/jrf/files-research/international_cities_rotterdam.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jrf.org.uk/sites/default/files/jrf/files-research/international_cities_rotterdam.pdf</a> </p><p>Not sure why some pdfs display correctly in Firefox from flathub and others display incorrectly. I’d prefer to use flatpak’s sandboxed Firefox if possible. Is there anyone else with the same problem or someone who who found a solution to this issue? </p><p>Thanks </p><p>Dad4Linux </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1140;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Dad4Linux

Seems to occur when firefox has been running for some time with lots of tabs open. As others have said, it displays a little ""NO"" icon (circle with a line through it) when trying to drag the URL from the lock or favicon section of the address bar, to the desktop. Other times it works fine. </p><p>I searched a bit, but perhaps someone has another idea on how to fix this permanently, or how to recover from it without restarting the computer. Firefox version is 110.0.1. </p><p>PS. I would re think the idea of archiving posts. Because its nice to be able to reply to old posts, even if they are ""solved"". The original poster may have found a solution and never posted about it, for instance. </p>",desktop;other;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,other,en-US,"",firefox2341
