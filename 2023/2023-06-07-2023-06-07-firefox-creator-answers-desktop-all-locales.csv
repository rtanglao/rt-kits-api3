I could turn off the discarded property, but then it loads the page again and adds an entry to my browsing history which I don't want, it doesn't when the property is on. If I turn it off entirely then all the tabs would load, and too many at once would lag my computer. </p><p>Sometimes though, Firefox just doesn't load favicons and I want to load them manually.

Together with my colleague we checked it on her machine whether it's really needed to check the version manually and then update is installed or is installed in the background and seems that my colleague got an update without manually checking the version, she just left the app open and after some time we checked the version and it was already updated. </p><p>My question is - is it enough to have Firefox open and it installed the latest version in the background without any action needed from user?

What happened was that my computer was being strangely slow, so I opened task manager to close some stuff with one of them being firefox. I had about 6 windows open, 2 of them having a lot of tabs, the other 4 only having a few. Reopened firefox, click restore previous session and only 3 windows reopen.

I don't know what to do and am panicking a little as like I said, those windows that did not reopen were important. I'm trying to figure out if firefox saves older versions of the session restore .jsonlz4 files (besides the .baklz4) but they seem to just be overridden/deleted. Is there anything I can do or am I just screwed? Also recently closed windows and tabs options are empty when looking at the history tab, which has also never happened. New update today so could it be that that has caused this problem? Finally, I've looked at the Import and Backup -&gt; Restore option, which has worked for me once when something similar happened, and between Saturday morning and now (Tuesday), there is nothing, which is odd as I close out all my tabs every night and this morning everything was restored perfectly. Yesterday is when I opened a lot of the important tabs for the one window, so could there be some kind of glitch occuring there?

Seems to occur when firefox has been running for some time with lots of tabs open. As others have said, it displays a little ""NO"" icon (circle with a line through it) when trying to drag the URL from the lock or favicon section of the address bar, to the desktop. Other times it works fine. </p><p>I searched a bit, but perhaps someone has another idea on how to fix this permanently, or how to recover from it without restarting the computer. Firefox version is 110.0.1. </p><p>PS. I would re think the idea of archiving posts. Because its nice to be able to reply to old posts, even if they are ""solved"". The original poster may have found a solution and never posted about it, for instance. </p>",desktop;other;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,other,en-US,"",firefox2341
