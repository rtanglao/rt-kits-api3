Reference #18.9112817.1672718634.1c121ce2  If I switch to  Microsoft Edge I have no problem. I get this same error code if I use  Windows 10 or Windows 11 with Firefox 108.0.2 64bit. I'm puzzled. For emails I am using Thunderbird. I had formatted my C drive and installed Thunderbird but the problem continued. Please advise how I can prevent this error. Right now the only thing that works is before I answer PCH emails is to change the  default browser to Microsoft Edge and when I am done change it back to Firefox. Thanks in advance for any help you can give me. My email address is doncatlin@hotmail.com </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,other,en-US,"",doncatlin
