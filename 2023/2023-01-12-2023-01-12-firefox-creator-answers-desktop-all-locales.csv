If I search something, Google would normally display a short summary and a little piece of information at the top of the page, but instead the first ~10 results are all ads, one of the top ones always being <a href=""http://yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">yahoo.com</a>.   Same goes for searching for translations ""[Any word] + language"" normally results in the translation tool being displayed at the top, but again just ads.   </p><p>I have scanned my PC for viruses (with the Windows Defender and Bitdefender) but at least they didn't find anything.   When I deactivate all my extensions (Which is only Adblocker, ironically), nothing changes.   When I browse in Safe Mode, the ads do not appear.   I have already cleared my Cache etc. but that didn't do too much.   No I installed a Scriptblocker and with that, Google is back to normal again.  But of course, even if that workaround works, I'd also like to know what is causing this. (I also checked with Chrome for example, the problem is Firefox specific) </p><p>Any ideas what I could try next or what the problem might be? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,other,en-US,1559099;,pandaderzwote

Intel GMA 3000 supports AVC1 (H264) decoding and it's very efficient. I have to say that Chrome fully supports this GPU and Video decoding in it's latest version (I have confirmed it using Intel_gpu_top utility).  </p><p>Can someone here tell me if the aforementioned GPU can work together with Firefox Hardware acceleration implementation in order to support accelerated video decoding ? </p><p>If you need any information of my system please let me know.  </p><p>Thanks in advance for your time. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1559102;1559106;,kallianiotis.nikolas
