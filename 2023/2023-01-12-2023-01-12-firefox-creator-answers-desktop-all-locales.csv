It is ""<a href=""http://realestate.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">realestate.com.au</a>"".   To date, this is the only website displaying these quirks, however there could easily be more which I have not yet tripped over. The home page will open, but trying to open anything under it (account, login, search etc.) results in a plain white page with no data. I can operate the site normally on Chrome or Safari so it is clearly something in Firefox settings. I have tried to install a back version (107) to check that the latest uplift didn't introduce any undesirable attributes. I cannot see any settings which may be causing this so any hints or suggestions from the community would be greatly appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",stephensmall1410
