That it's just your standard dev tools any user would have, and that a company could configure in deployment to work phones. I exceeded my IT tech talk comfort-level about 32 words ago, and now I'm faking it.  I'll try to project confidence. </p><p>I don't believe I've ever used InTune on any personal device, but I have on work phones in the past.  I mention InTune only because the last time I did use it to load company apps onto a personal phone was in 2016, and it would feel pretty creepy if this had managed to migrate across several years and several organizations to land on my new phone. And, to be clear, I really didn't get uncomfortable until I saw the apps under Flagfox, with an IP tracker, etc. I have a couple exes who have psycho exes; the kind who manipulate their child into putting a keylogger on their ex-wife's machines. </p><p>Screenshots in order of rising alarm and intensity of goosebumps. </p><p>Thanks- Dave. </p><p>LoL... As soon as I hit Share Data, I see those apps bringing up my data to help you troubleshoot, thereby answering my question, but I'll post it anyway. Hopefully, someone gets a laugh out of it. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",davidwbrown66

A couple examples are Slack and <a href=""http://NEUP.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">NEUP.gov</a>. If I try to go to <a href=""http://NEUP.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">NEUP.gov</a> it never loads. If i try to log into the University of Michigan enterprise Slack, via SSO, it says 400 Bad Request. </p><p>Both of these work fine if I do them on Chrome. I also talked to Slack, and they suggested it is not on their end. I don't want to switch to Chrome, but if I can't access the sites I need to on Firefox what else can I do? Any ideas on why this is happening would be appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1200;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ajburak
