Yes, ""windows"". </p><p>I have about three dozen windows open (yes, there are a lot of tabs in them), and not just at home. And it’s hard to quickly find your bearings when you need to switch to another task (workspace). It would be nice to at least change the color of the windows, depending on the type of work. But in the <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/windows"" rel=""nofollow"">API</a> API I don’t see the ability to define a window property where you can specify a group identifier, which can be used to restore the color after re-opening FireFox. </p><p>If FireFox had a built-in or its own reliable extension for organizing thematic work, a deferred workspace (without losing the contents of windows). Arc browser - they realized that what browsers have been denying for a decade is already overdue, and they will be able to take over the market. </p><p>I tried several extensions for saving, restoring and organizing workspaces, and came to a clear conclusion: only the built-in FireFox solution for restoring windows after a crash/opening is the only truly reliable solution. There is no trust in extensions that are not supervised by a good team of developers and testers; there is a guarantee that data will be lost in the near future. </p><p>It is possible that in recent years some expansions have been completed. I'd be glad to know about it if you point it out. But here a question arises on a separate topic: improving the mechanism for rating and testing extensions, <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/recommended-extensions-program"" rel=""nofollow"">recommended extensions program</a>. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",mnior

Firefox crashes silently, open it again and no tabs are restored. Open firefox again and look in recently closed windows and the one with my tabs is not there, only little utility windows that are popped up when I log in at the coffee shop, so my recently closed windows are overwritten with windows with no tabs.  </p><p>So I go to my profile sessionstore-backups folder and copy it to the desktop.  I have 6 files, previous.jsonlz4, recovery.baklz4, and recovery.jsonlz4 at around 8 megs in size. I copied each to the folder one level up and renamed them sessionstore.jsonlz4, and each time restarted firefox. All that opens is a blank tabbed firefox window.   </p><p>There was never an existing sessionstore.jsonlz4 file anywhere I could find, even with firefox closed, this file never appears anywhere I could find it. Searching files with Windows was also unsuccessful.   </p><p>I feel like I have captured the files with my tabs, based on the date modified, several were from before the crash. Why can't I find a working tutorial on how to restore my tabs? Nothing I've found on the support site works though I follow the directions exactly.  </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-8;firefox-1150;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",bikenrightnow

I'm using firefox on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS).
