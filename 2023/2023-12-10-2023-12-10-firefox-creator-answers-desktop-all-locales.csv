I'm using firefox on Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS). I found that on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, it comes installed as a snap even if I install it with `apt install firefox`, and I really needed a non-snap implementation so that I could integrate my password manager. (I'm using 1Password. To integrate the 1Password browser extension with the 1Password desktop application, I can't have firefox sandboxed by snap.) Therefore, I installed firefox as a deb package using the instructions given on <a href=""https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/04/how-to-install-firefox-deb-apt-ubuntu-22-04:"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2022/04/how-to-install-firefox-deb-apt-ubuntu-22-04:</a> </p><p>``` </p> <ol><li> remove the Firefox Snap: </li></ol> <p>sudo snap remove firefox </p> <ol><li> add the Mozilla Team PPA to your list of software sources: </li></ol> <p>sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/ppa </p> <ol><li> tell apt to prefer the PPA/deb/apt version of Firefox: </li></ol> <p>echo ' Package: * Pin: release o=LP-PPA-mozillateam Pin-Priority: 1001 ' | sudo tee /etc/apt/preferences.d/mozilla-firefox </p> <ol><li> tell apt to install future upgrades automatically </li></ol> <p>echo 'Unattended-Upgrade::Allowed-Origins:: ""LP-PPA-mozillateam:${distro_codename}"";' | sudo tee /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/51unattended-upgrades-firefox </p> <ol><li> install the Firefox deb using apt: </li></ol> <p>sudo apt install firefox ``` </p><p>Is there a better course of action? Having this password-manager integration is essential to me. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;ubuntu-2204;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",quinesquines+firefox

That it's just your standard dev tools any user would have, and that a company could configure in deployment to work phones. I exceeded my IT tech talk comfort-level about 32 words ago, and now I'm faking it.  I'll try to project confidence. </p><p>I don't believe I've ever used InTune on any personal device, but I have on work phones in the past.  I mention InTune only because the last time I did use it to load company apps onto a personal phone was in 2016, and it would feel pretty creepy if this had managed to migrate across several years and several organizations to land on my new phone. And, to be clear, I really didn't get uncomfortable until I saw the apps under Flagfox, with an IP tracker, etc. I have a couple exes who have psycho exes; the kind who manipulate their child into putting a keylogger on their ex-wife's machines. </p><p>Screenshots in order of rising alarm and intensity of goosebumps. </p><p>Thanks- Dave. </p><p>LoL... As soon as I hit Share Data, I see those apps bringing up my data to help you troubleshoot, thereby answering my question, but I'll post it anyway. Hopefully, someone gets a laugh out of it. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",davidwbrown66
