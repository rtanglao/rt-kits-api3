I access my Proton Mail account from Firefox, but for a couple of weeks now I can't log into Proton Mail from Firefox. The browser won't even load the Proton Mail login page; it just spins and a message ""Waiting for <a href=""http://mail.proton.me"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.proton.me</a>"" is visible in the lower corner of my Firefox screen.  </p><p>Fortunately I can still access Proton Mail on my iPhone, but I need it on my Windows laptop too.  </p><p>Please advise! </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1170;,firefox,other,en-US,1602365;,knauth
