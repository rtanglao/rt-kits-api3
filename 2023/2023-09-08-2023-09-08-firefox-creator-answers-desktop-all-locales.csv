If so, I'll stick with Firefox, as I have otherwise been very happy with the browser for a long time.  I've googled this and there appear to be some over-my-head explanations of how to get rid of this with HTML code, as best as I can tell...I am asking for a user-friendly/plain English solution for someone who is not a programmer (e.g., I have no idea what ""css"" means).
