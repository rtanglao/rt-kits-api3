I tried to access my school Outlook account on Firefox however I keep getting a 403 Forbidden error when it redirects me to Duo Security. Going back one page displays the error code ""Authentication access denied"" (also on Duo Security). I have tried: - Restarting my PC, both through windows and through a hard reset - Clearing my cache and cookies - using Troubleshooting mode - Allowing Firefox through my Windows firewall - disabling my firewall - changing networks This problem only appears in Firefox, as I am able to log in on Edge. </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1170;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",emrykkw

I access my Proton Mail account from Firefox, but for a couple of weeks now I can't log into Proton Mail from Firefox. The browser won't even load the Proton Mail login page; it just spins and a message ""Waiting for <a href=""http://mail.proton.me"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.proton.me</a>"" is visible in the lower corner of my Firefox screen.  </p><p>Fortunately I can still access Proton Mail on my iPhone, but I need it on my Windows laptop too.  </p><p>Please advise! </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1170;,firefox,other,en-US,"",knauth
