Videos won't play. sometimes one restart of firefox will fix it. sometimes multiple restarts are required before it'll work. The loading bar at the bottom of the video (on the seek bar) indicates the video is loading but it won't play. There have been times where I have disabled every single add-on and it would not work. Add-ons do not seem to be the cause. I have tried it in a private browser window with no joy. I have refreshed firefox, I have uninstalled and reinstalled it. I have tried disabling my antivirus. I have tested videos on websites in other browsers with no issue. The issue seems to be with the video player itself. overlays seem unaffected, I can use the seek bar and it shows the captions. I have tested different websites including Youtube, Vimeo and Steam. I tried many tens of times to get it working today to no avail. finally when I closed nearly all my tabs, the video worked (but I had also opened TOR and run avideo in that), I am not sure if this is the cause. If the cause is having multiple tabs open, this is an issue for me. I have a learning disability and likely ADHD and I have a set of tabs as my homepages so I don't forget things.

(i have searched whole of the browser s current <em>profile directory</em> and even <em>about:config</em> -[since i am not any web browser programmer maybe i have missed it but nothing, no way to open any addon in a new window interactively unless it hasnt been built by this way] how will a user use it with more then 4 profiles? it doesnt scroll till to the manage containers button!) what should we do Thanks </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-10213;firefox-102130;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",freezejet
