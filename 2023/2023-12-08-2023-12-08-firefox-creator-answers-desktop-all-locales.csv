Sometimes, not always, it takes two or sometimes even three clicks to go to a link, especially bookmarks for some reason.  That and at times I have to click on the address bar and hit enter even if I clicked a link to go to a new site.  Mostly this happens with bookmarks and history items, but not always.  I have disabled hardware acceleration and my few add-ons, I even put Firefox into safe mode to try to diagnose the issue further.  Unfortunately I'm still lost and the issue presists.  Any thoughts? </p><p>I'm using macOS Sonoma 14.1.2 and Firefox was just installed yesterday 120.0.1.

When Firefox is launched and is the only application open in the taskbar, there is no label present next to the icon like other programs have when launched. There is the little line underneath the icon though indicating it is launched but that is it. As soon as I open another application though, the label will also appear for Firefox. This is only a minor annoyance but is definitely as bug at least for me and should be pretty easy to fix. I will attach screenshots of the behavior. In the first screenshot, you can see that Firefox is open but has no Text label like it is supposed to. The second screenshot is as soon as I open a second application. </p><p>I am on Windows 11 Home 23H2  Build 22631.2792  Windows Feature Experience Pack 1000.22681.1000.0 Firefox Version: 120.0.1 </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",chris545
