I cannot sign into the website or download the app, and most of all the translation function is not available. I have checked uBlock but it doesn't seem to be related to the problem. No problem with any other websites, it's just DeepL. I have not changed any of my privacy or cookie settings, so I don't understand why all of sudden it's no longer working. I can use it in Chrome but I would prefer to restore its functions in Firefox, which is my main browser. Thanks in advance for any suggestions. Have a good day. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1200;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1622883;1622896;,lyonie_2

After putting in my email and hitting next the website slows and firefox slow crashes. I have to force firefox to close. I have tried leaving a message to Playstation Twitter support. I've noticed their sign in page has change a few times recently so I wonder if it's an issue they caused. Either way it would be appreciated if it was looked into. Always feels like a lot of websites only care about chromium. By the way it works fine on edge or chrome. It also does not work with private browsing, so I don't think it's my extensions or cookies. I have also tried multiple computers. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1200;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1622857;1622858;1622875;,bansheeblitz
