I'm using Macbook Pro 14 inches with M1 Max chip. Lately when I work, I have to open quite many urls at the same time, and my mac went crazy hot because of firefox's insane cpu usage. I tried what's suggested to turn off the acceleration mode, but still, nothing changes.  </p><p>Is there still anything I can do to resolve it? or I just switch to other browser? </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,other,en-US,"",aaronyuzhiheng

After putting in my email and hitting next the website slows and firefox slow crashes. I have to force firefox to close. I have tried leaving a message to Playstation Twitter support. I've noticed their sign in page has change a few times recently so I wonder if it's an issue they caused. Either way it would be appreciated if it was looked into. Always feels like a lot of websites only care about chromium. By the way it works fine on edge or chrome. It also does not work with private browsing, so I don't think it's my extensions or cookies. I have also tried multiple computers. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1200;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1622857;1622858;,bansheeblitz
