Seems that whenever I go to the Merriam-Webster (dot) com site, after a few seconds, my disk activity light goes solid, and the FF CPU usage spike to 10-25%.  One time, to regain control of my system (because everything seemed hung) I actually had to resort to the physical power-down switch.  Obviously I immediately ran a virus scan upon coming back up (scan showed all okay).  Now, if I stay away from Merriam-Webster, FF behaves normally.  But it's a damned dictionary site.  I occasionally will need to use it or stumble into it.  I've used MW in the past without problems.  Does anyone know what's going on? </p>",windows-7;desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1150;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",jmegsc
