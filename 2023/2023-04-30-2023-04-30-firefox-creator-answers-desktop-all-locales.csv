I've tried going into about:config and changing settings.  Doesn't help.  Also under ""Settings \ Permissions \ Autoplay"" shows default for all websites as ""Block Audio and Video"" and under Websites ""About:Welcome"" shows as ""Allow audio and video.""  I've changed the About:Welcome to block audio and video.  I've also tried clicking the Remove All Websites button to delete the exception.  Neither works.  I save changes, exit Firefox, and restart.  Same settings as before, and autoplay still starts. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",matt3916

I still have sound in other sites.  CAM4 works perfectly on Chrome for me so it is not a CAm4 issue? What can I do?  The video / picture works fine.  The sound has worked for years until yesterday? </p>,desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,other,en-US,"",YOFJAB
