Sempre que coloco um vídeo para rodar ele carrega infinitamente e aparece uma mensagem de erro, reparei que na parte superior aparece uma mensagem do próprio firefox que diz ""Firefox está instalando componentes necessários para a reprodução de áudio ou vídeo, tente novamente mais tarde.""

Which was fine and wonderful. Sadly, following recent version updates new tabs opened from links now tend to 'wonder' off to the far end of whatever other links may have also been opened previously from that site.  The problem with this new behaviour is that such tabs quickly become lost amongst the various branches of the tree as other links are opened in 'child' tabs of links that have gone before. In short, this new behaviour results in a complete confusing mess, especially as the newly opened tabs may end up so far off to the right that it's difficult to find the way back to the page they were opened from!  Please could you at least provide an option so the user can set new links to open right next to the current tab, as they used to do, rather than some no doubt logical but nonetheless baffling and impractical location some 6, 21 or even more tabs away from the current tab.

Unfortunately I'm having big trouble authenticating myself to the service right now. </p><p>I have 2 testing accounts with the following configuration&nbsp;: </p> <ol><li> I've setup 2FA authentication. </li><li> I did not set a secondary email. </li><li> I did not set an account recovery key. </li></ol> <p>Here are some of the tests I'm doing&nbsp;: </p> <ol><li> I start by doing several login/logout to check if 2FA is working as expected. </li><li> Then I add a secondary email then make it primary then remove the previous primary email. </li><li> Then again login/logout several times to check if 2FA is working as expected. </li></ol> <p>At some point I'm unable to login after some iterations of step 3) above. </p> <ol><li> At first I get an error saying my 2FA code is incorrect. But it allows me to login successfully using one of my 2FA backup. </li><li> Then again I logout/login several times to check if 2FA is working as it should be. </li><li> Then at some point I get the same error again saying my 2FA code is incorrect. Trying several unused 2FA backup fails with error saying they're also incorrect. </li><li> Then it finally says that I've tried too many time and suggests I should retry 15mins later. </li><li> When I try to login after some time it then ask me for an authorization code sent to my email. But then it says every authorization code I try is also incorrect. </li><li> I managed to disable 2FA from on one of the account I was still logged in Firefox. But when trying to login on another Firefox profile then I get the same error saying I tried too many times. </li></ol> <p>Just for clarification - Please note that I may have use one or two 2FA codes instead of authorization keys when it asked me so. But I did not mistyped any 2FA or auth code I've tried. </p><p>And after several hours of giving up on it - the problem suddenly vanished and I could login/logout fine. As a precaution I add a recovery key and decided to disable 2FA because I can be sure it will work as is should. </p><p>Maybe I get locked but I dont know what really happened. I believe I did not a lot of login abuse though. I just feel like it's a big issue for my case because I could not rely on the 2FA backup and authorization keys. The error didn't help either because it likely says I've been locked. Whereas having one or two mistyped codes or using ""several correct 2FA backup and auth keys"" which were wrongly considered incorrect - should not be treated as a login abuse or brute force. </p><p>From now on I will likely disable 2FA if using this service. I understand these tests are not things you do on everyday use but I can't imagine how bad it would feel if I have sync sensitive data such as passwords and have to wait hours to unlock access to my account (even if not to access those data). </p>",linux;desktop;sync;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",webheatsandwich

The standard article on the Firefox Support website is `How to pin and unpin Firefox from the taskbar on Windows 10 and Windows 11', but it seems to be out of date.  It says to right-click on the icon and click on `Unpin from taskbar', but there is no such item in the right-click menu any more. </p><p>I know that it became difficult to unpin the Firefox icon about a year ago.  I got a new PC recently and installed Firefox, but I could not remove the icon.  Then realised that I should have done this during installation, by using 'Custom installation' and unticking the 'Icon on taskbar' option.  I searched the web for clues and found none, so I uninstalled and reinstalled, which was a nuisance. </p><p>Some months later, I have just installed the new version 110.0.1, but I forgot to use 'Custom install', with the result that the icon is back on the taskbar.  Again I have searched the web, and again no success.  I tried reinstalling V110.0.1 on top, using 'custom install' this time --- I could switch off the 'Icon on taskbar', but the icon is still there. </p><p>I don't want to uninstall-reinstall this time because I have now configured Firefox as I want it, so that would waste a lot of time --- and I will probably forget again sometime in the future.  </p><p>I am sure that Firefox has not done this deliberately, because they are always so much on the user's side. </p><p>QUESTION:  How do I unpin the Firefox icon from the taskbar without uninstalling?  I have an idea that there is a registry hack that will achieve this. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1571778;1571788;,bill292

(I hadn't deleted *that* many bookmarks between those two times, plus I had continued adding more, so I have no idea why the October file was so much smaller. Also, incidentally, I have no idea why there were no backups listed from the last one in July to the first one in October. I'm always actively adding and deleting bookmarks.) However, I made a ton of edits and additions to my bookmarks from July to October that I'd like to at least be able to access. I know I probably can't merge them with my current ones, but I'd at least like to be able to add them to what I have. I assume that if I could import these, they would appear in a separate folder, right? Thanks! </p>",desktop;tips;windows-11;firefox-1110;,firefox,tips,en-US,1571759;1571765;,alexbaez333
