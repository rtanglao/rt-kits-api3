Which was fine and wonderful. Sadly, following recent version updates new tabs opened from links now tend to 'wonder' off to the far end of whatever other links may have also been opened previously from that site.  The problem with this new behaviour is that such tabs quickly become lost amongst the various branches of the tree as other links are opened in 'child' tabs of links that have gone before. In short, this new behaviour results in a complete confusing mess, especially as the newly opened tabs may end up so far off to the right that it's difficult to find the way back to the page they were opened from!  Please could you at least provide an option so the user can set new links to open right next to the current tab, as they used to do, rather than some no doubt logical but nonetheless baffling and impractical location some 6, 21 or even more tabs away from the current tab.

But I did not mistyped any 2FA or auth code I've tried. </p><p>And after several hours of giving up on it - the problem suddenly vanished and I could login/logout fine. As a precaution I add a recovery key and decided to disable 2FA because I can be sure it will work as is should. </p><p>Maybe I get locked but I dont know what really happened. I believe I did not a lot of login abuse though. I just feel like it's a big issue for my case because I could not rely on the 2FA backup and authorization keys. The error didn't help either because it likely says I've been locked. Whereas having one or two mistyped codes or using ""several correct 2FA backup and auth keys"" which were wrongly considered incorrect - should not be treated as a login abuse or brute force. </p><p>From now on I will likely disable 2FA if using this service.

It says to right-click on the icon and click on `Unpin from taskbar', but there is no such item in the right-click menu any more. </p><p>I know that it became difficult to unpin the Firefox icon about a year ago.  I got a new PC recently and installed Firefox, but I could not remove the icon.  Then realised that I should have done this during installation, by using 'Custom installation' and unticking the 'Icon on taskbar' option.  I searched the web for clues and found none, so I uninstalled and reinstalled, which was a nuisance. </p><p>Some months later, I have just installed the new version 110.0.1, but I forgot to use 'Custom install', with the result that the icon is back on the taskbar.  Again I have searched the web, and again no success.  I tried reinstalling V110.0.1 on top, using 'custom install' this time --- I could switch off the 'Icon on taskbar', but the icon is still there. </p><p>I don't want to uninstall-reinstall this time because I have now configured Firefox as I want it, so that would waste a lot of time --- and I will probably forget again sometime in the future.  </p><p>I am sure that Firefox has not done this deliberately, because they are always so much on the user's side. </p><p>QUESTION:  How do I unpin the Firefox icon from the taskbar without uninstalling?
