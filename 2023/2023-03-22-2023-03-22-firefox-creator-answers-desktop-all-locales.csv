The standard article on the Firefox Support website is `How to pin and unpin Firefox from the taskbar on Windows 10 and Windows 11', but it seems to be out of date.  It says to right-click on the icon and click on `Unpin from taskbar', but there is no such item in the right-click menu any more. </p><p>I know that it became difficult to unpin the Firefox icon about a year ago.  I got a new PC recently and installed Firefox, but I could not remove the icon.  Then realised that I should have done this during installation, by using 'Custom installation' and unticking the 'Icon on taskbar' option.  I searched the web for clues and found none, so I uninstalled and reinstalled, which was a nuisance. </p><p>Some months later, I have just installed the new version 110.0.1, but I forgot to use 'Custom install', with the result that the icon is back on the taskbar.  Again I have searched the web, and again no success.  I tried reinstalling V110.0.1 on top, using 'custom install' this time --- I could switch off the 'Icon on taskbar', but the icon is still there. </p><p>I don't want to uninstall-reinstall this time because I have now configured Firefox as I want it, so that would waste a lot of time --- and I will probably forget again sometime in the future.  </p><p>I am sure that Firefox has not done this deliberately, because they are always so much on the user's side. </p><p>QUESTION:  How do I unpin the Firefox icon from the taskbar without uninstalling?  I have an idea that there is a registry hack that will achieve this. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",bill292

My boyfriend accidentally deleted all my Firefox bookmarks last fall (hundreds), then restored the last backup from July, which he said for some reason was a lot larger than the most recent backup he saw, from October. (I hadn't deleted *that* many bookmarks between those two times, plus I had continued adding more, so I have no idea why the October file was so much smaller. Also, incidentally, I have no idea why there were no backups listed from the last one in July to the first one in October. I'm always actively adding and deleting bookmarks.) However, I made a ton of edits and additions to my bookmarks from July to October that I'd like to at least be able to access. I know I probably can't merge them with my current ones, but I'd at least like to be able to add them to what I have. I assume that if I could import these, they would appear in a separate folder, right? Thanks! </p>",desktop;tips;windows-11;firefox-1110;,firefox,tips,en-US,1571759;1571765;,alexbaez333
