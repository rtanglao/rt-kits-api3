But it allows me to login successfully using one of my 2FA backup. </li><li> Then again I logout/login several times to check if 2FA is working as it should be. </li><li> Then at some point I get the same error again saying my 2FA code is incorrect. Trying several unused 2FA backup fails with error saying they're also incorrect. </li><li> Then it finally says that I've tried too many time and suggests I should retry 15mins later. </li><li> When I try to login after some time it then ask me for an authorization code sent to my email. But then it says every authorization code I try is also incorrect. </li><li> I managed to disable 2FA from on one of the account I was still logged in Firefox. But when trying to login on another Firefox profile then I get the same error saying I tried too many times. </li></ol> <p>Just for clarification - Please note that I may have use one or two 2FA codes instead of authorization keys when it asked me so. But I did not mistyped any 2FA or auth code I've tried. </p><p>And after several hours of giving up on it - the problem suddenly vanished and I could login/logout fine. As a precaution I add a recovery key and decided to disable 2FA because I can be sure it will work as is should. </p><p>Maybe I get locked but I dont know what really happened. I believe I did not a lot of login abuse though. I just feel like it's a big issue for my case because I could not rely on the 2FA backup and authorization keys. The error didn't help either because it likely says I've been locked. Whereas having one or two mistyped codes or using ""several correct 2FA backup and auth keys"" which were wrongly considered incorrect - should not be treated as a login abuse or brute force. </p><p>From now on I will likely disable 2FA if using this service. I understand these tests are not things you do on everyday use but I can't imagine how bad it would feel if I have sync sensitive data such as passwords and have to wait hours to unlock access to my account (even if not to access those data). </p>",linux;desktop;sync;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",webheatsandwich

The standard article on the Firefox Support website is `How to pin and unpin Firefox from the taskbar on Windows 10 and Windows 11', but it seems to be out of date.  It says to right-click on the icon and click on `Unpin from taskbar', but there is no such item in the right-click menu any more. </p><p>I know that it became difficult to unpin the Firefox icon about a year ago.  I got a new PC recently and installed Firefox, but I could not remove the icon.  Then realised that I should have done this during installation, by using 'Custom installation' and unticking the 'Icon on taskbar' option.  I searched the web for clues and found none, so I uninstalled and reinstalled, which was a nuisance. </p><p>Some months later, I have just installed the new version 110.0.1, but I forgot to use 'Custom install', with the result that the icon is back on the taskbar.  Again I have searched the web, and again no success.  I tried reinstalling V110.0.1 on top, using 'custom install' this time --- I could switch off the 'Icon on taskbar', but the icon is still there. </p><p>I don't want to uninstall-reinstall this time because I have now configured Firefox as I want it, so that would waste a lot of time --- and I will probably forget again sometime in the future.  </p><p>I am sure that Firefox has not done this deliberately, because they are always so much on the user's side. </p><p>QUESTION:  How do I unpin the Firefox icon from the taskbar without uninstalling?
