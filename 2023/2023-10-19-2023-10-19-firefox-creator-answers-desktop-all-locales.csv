At this time I was in the School Library well the update was completed so I open up Firefox usually when i open firefox after a shutdown or some other reason. I can go to Open Application Menu&gt;History&gt;RestorePreviousSession but before I clicked on Restore Previous Session I realize that I need to go to class, so I closed my computer. once in class I open my computer up and I try to restore my previous session but by the time that I tried to restore it my session was deleted and my question is if anyone at FIREFOX can help restore that deleted session because I was working on my research project which is due this week, and in that particular session I had tabs open that I need so i can finish my project. Please reach out as soon as possible. This happen on Tuesday. Thank You </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,other,en-US,"",sotini0504
