This process works fine on both Chrome and Safari but I'd prefer to use Firefox.  So far, I've installed and loaded the Keychain-PKCS11 library and restarted the browser.  When I start the browser--before trying to go to any page--I get this error: </p><p>""Please authenticate to the token “[TOKEN NAME REDACTED]”. How to do so depends on the token (for example, using a fingerprint reader or entering a code with a keypad)."" </p><p>When I go to the log-in page and select the ""login with CAC"" option, Firefox returns a certificate-not-found error. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1612002;,AlFajores

But when I'm in a voice call the ping is always 0 ms (see the attached picture). When I talk I can see the green indicator around my profile below. But the person I'm talking to can not hear anything. It is the same with voice channels.

At this time I was in the School Library well the update was completed so I open up Firefox usually when i open firefox after a shutdown or some other reason. I can go to Open Application Menu&gt;History&gt;RestorePreviousSession but before I clicked on Restore Previous Session I realize that I need to go to class, so I closed my computer. once in class I open my computer up and I try to restore my previous session but by the time that I tried to restore it my session was deleted and my question is if anyone at FIREFOX can help restore that deleted session because I was working on my research project which is due this week, and in that particular session I had tabs open that I need so i can finish my project. Please reach out as soon as possible. This happen on Tuesday. Thank You </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,other,en-US,1612008;,sotini0504
