WhatsApp Web can't load any stickers - not that I send, receive or any in my drawer. </p><p>I can't understand why it's specifically WhatsApp and specifically the stickers, but I tried to fix it: - I logged off and on to WhatsApp Web, didn't help. - I disabled then removed all extensions, didn't help. - I've removed all profile data, didn't help. - I reinstalled Firefox after wiping the AppData folder, didn't help. </p><p>This problem has persisted over updates and doesn't happen in Chrome - stickers download there just fine. It also doesn't happen on any other computer I use with Firefox. </p><p>I tried to investigate the cause of the problem. First off, the sticker HTTP request on the network tab fails with the weird error status NS_ERROR_INTERCEPTION_FAILED or NS_BINDING_ABORTED (both appear). The console says the following: </p><p>Failed to load ‘<a href=""https://mmg.whatsapp.net/v/t62.15575-24/31187942_602693368536193_4171257086940206138_n.enc?ccb=11-4&amp;oh=01_AdSo-95lTiTT9NthZMidBB00c8tI8PlEuBlxvoIsC9rkuA&amp;oe=6558CC66&amp;_nc_sid=000000&amp;hash=PDQ3jJY4Svmj3ZJIIkyTzdyKEeyiyBLg64CuZRuaEIM%3D&amp;mode=auto&amp;mms-type=sticker&amp;__wa-mms=’"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mmg.whatsapp.net/v/t62.15575-24/31187942_602693368536193_4171257086940206138_n.enc?ccb=11-4&amp;oh=01_AdSo-95lTiTT9NthZMidBB00c8tI8PlEuBlxvoIsC9rkuA&amp;oe=6558CC66&amp;_nc_sid=000000&amp;hash=PDQ3jJY4Svmj3ZJIIkyTzdyKEeyiyBLg64CuZRuaEIM%3D&amp;mode=auto&amp;mms-type=sticker&amp;__wa-mms=’</a>.

I ran Wireshark to sniff the request, and what I found was that Firefox sends an OPTIONS request (even though it doesn't log it in the Network tab), the OPTIONS request is answered with a 200 OK, and then this error occurs. </p><p>This convinces me that this is an internal problem with Firefox or with some other program on my computer that interferes specifically with Firefox.

The email was sent to my old Gmail address even though I've changed both the primary and secondary email address in my Mozilla account settings a long time ago. </p><p>Email notifications about sign-ins and/or changes that are made to the Mozilla account are sent to the correct email addresses that I've configured in the account. So the issue is with general announcement emails regarding Mozilla accounts. </p><p>I have <strong>not</strong> received the email about the Mozilla account renaming to the email addresses that are configured in the account. Somewhere down the line I will delete the Gmail account, but that will also mean that I won't get these kind of announcements and thereby risk missing important information regarding the account. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,other,en-US,"",subsonic-upstage-escapism
