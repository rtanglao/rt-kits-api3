I have had no issues with it except for a rather annoying bug I have had with scrolling. Whenever I open Firefox for the first time after powering on my laptop, scrolling with my touchpad will sometimes become choppy, no longer continuing to move after I lift my fingers like it normally does. I am pretty certain it is only Firefox that is doing this, as when I open the Windows start menu, inertial scrolling still works. Is this a bug that other users have had before? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1090;firefox-10901;,firefox,other,en-US,"",hrusso014

So I signed in to take a look. One of the breaches was a site for which I never actually had an account. <strong>Evite</strong> But for which it is possible I may have received communications from, like an evite to something at a <em>different</em>  email address. I am curious as to how there could have been a breach of my email password for which I received the  alert ... since I never had an account for Evite, and never directly interacted with evite  at the ""breached"" email address  </p><p>sort of a mystery </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1090;firefox-10901;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jmhbpc

Specifically, i could most things and when I would attempt to open a homework assignment, Id get an error.  According to my professor, it was a Firefox issue, and he was right, when I went to Google, which I hate, it worked just fine.  Then slowly, there were more problems opening up my school website or my bitwarden extension would have issues.  So today, I finally uninstalled, and reinstalled.  Which, unfortunately, I have had to do with Firefox twice before.  Frustrating, but I hate Google enough that I chalked it up.  Then, after this most current reinstall, it completely screwed things up with my bitwarden extension and bitwarden themselves, because for some reason, Firefox is sending weird info that freaks websites out.  Outside of the extensions, it often cant open sites, or sites tell me something is happening.  I have Norton and have scanned my device repeatedly, and gone so far as to contact them and my computer is clean.  What...is going on.  I STILL haven't sorted out the Bitwarden fiasco and have had to contact their support, but honestly, the problem CAME from the firefox browser.  I dont know how to fix this </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1090;firefox-10901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jarden714
