Which, unfortunately, I have had to do with Firefox twice before.  Frustrating, but I hate Google enough that I chalked it up.  Then, after this most current reinstall, it completely screwed things up with my bitwarden extension and bitwarden themselves, because for some reason, Firefox is sending weird info that freaks websites out.  Outside of the extensions, it often cant open sites, or sites tell me something is happening.  I have Norton and have scanned my device repeatedly, and gone so far as to contact them and my computer is clean.  What...is going on.
