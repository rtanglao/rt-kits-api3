I have been working fine with Firefox but suddenly an error occurs (it has happened to me 2 times in the last 2 months) in which the program closes and all the data of my profiles stored on the pc DISAPPEARS or is deleted (including cache), when I want to open them again: </p><p>firefox.exe -P </p><p>Then I have to give myself the task of synchronizing profile 1, <strong>but profile 2</strong> I have to be importing from my previous Google account or importing a backup Bookmark. </p><p>The option to copy and paste the data from Firefox to replace it in the path (supposedly brings with it the data of everything): </p><pre>C:\ProgramData\Mozilla-1de4eec8-1241-4177-a864-e594e8d1fb38\updates\308046B0AF4A39CB </pre> <p>with Firefox turned off it has not worked for me. Since when opening I see 2 profiles called Default ""X"" and Default ""Z"" without data.  </p><p>This is a headache that if it happens to me, it happens to millions who have 2 or more profiles. </p><p>Why can't I sync a second profile? Why do you insist that there can only be one sync per device? Is there a solution for this? </p><p><strong>Note:</strong> I have read all the tutorials out there and the situation remains the same. Synchronization with 2 or more profiles is never described. </p><p>Thank you very much to whoever asked this question! </p>",windows-7;desktop;sync;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",Estepario

A falha abrange tanto a página onde o conteúdo é exibido quanto a janela. Isso resulta em instabilidades de exibição que afetam vários aspectos da página, como palavras visualmente distorcidas e corrompidas graficamente, além de oscilações e outras falhas de exibição da página que tornam impossível usar a janela de exibição.  </p><p>Algo curioso de destacar neste caso é que o problema fica localizado apenas na janela de exibição onde usei o recurso de sobreposição de imagem. Se eu abrir outra janela, ela aparecerá normalmente como de costume, sem nenhuma instabilidade sistêmica de exibição gráfica. </p><p>Desde já, agradeço pela assistência e por lerem esta mensagem. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1130;,firefox,other,pt-BR,"",Meirasi
