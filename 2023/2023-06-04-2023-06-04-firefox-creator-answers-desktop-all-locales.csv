Às vezes, quando uso o recurso de sobreposição de imagem, também conhecido como <em>Picture-in-Picture</em>, ao assistir alguma metragem audiovisual no YouTube usando esta funcionalidade, ocorre uma instabilidade gráfica em toda a janela e na exibição da página. A falha abrange tanto a página onde o conteúdo é exibido quanto a janela. Isso resulta em instabilidades de exibição que afetam vários aspectos da página, como palavras visualmente distorcidas e corrompidas graficamente, além de oscilações e outras falhas de exibição da página que tornam impossível usar a janela de exibição.  </p><p>Algo curioso de destacar neste caso é que o problema fica localizado apenas na janela de exibição onde usei o recurso de sobreposição de imagem. Se eu abrir outra janela, ela aparecerá normalmente como de costume, sem nenhuma instabilidade sistêmica de exibição gráfica. </p><p>Desde já, agradeço pela assistência e por lerem esta mensagem. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1130;,firefox,other,pt-BR,"",Meirasi
