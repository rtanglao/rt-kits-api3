The problem I'm encountering is when I want to get to something further down the list, it's all of the sudden tabbing to this little 3 dot menu that has ""Remove from history"" and ""Learn More"".  </p><p>I use this feature a lot to visit past pages for researching, so I'm wondering is this 3 dot menu new? Is there a way to disable it? I've attached a screenshot to hopefully more clearly describe what I'm talking about. </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",m.lewis7
