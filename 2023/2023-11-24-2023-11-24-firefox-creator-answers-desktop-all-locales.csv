Unfortunately whenever I try to open it, it loads a blank screen and then crashes, and brings up the crash reporter. This has happened every time I try and open Firefox, even during Troubleshoot mode. I have over 180+ tabs and thousands of bookmarks on my account that I do not want to lose (I have not used Refresh Firefox for this very reason) but if I can't even access them on my computer then what can I do? </p><p>Please help me, I want to know how to fix this and keep my tabs and history. I am desperate. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",andrewpillinger3
