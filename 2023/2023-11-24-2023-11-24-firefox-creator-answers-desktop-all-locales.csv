This app has always run well on Firefox. But a few weeks ago, when selecting the option to print an article, multiple pop-up screens began displaying. It is normal for the article to display in a pop-up screen just before printing but not multiple times. And every time I print an article the number of pop-ups increase... the first time twice, the second time three times, the seventh time eight times, etc. If I open the app using Chrome this does not happen. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,other,en-US,"",gfcdata

It will crash even when I use safe/troubleshoot mode, when I open a private window, and when I run it as an administrator.  </p><p>I got to a point where it would give me a sliver of time before crashing.
