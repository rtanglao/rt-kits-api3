I have had little-to-no problems with Firefox before now. Since this morning, every time I open Firefox, it almost instantly crashes. Even after refreshing it and reinstalling it a few times, the problem persists. I have no idea what the cause is; I don't remember drastically changing any settings or anything like that. It will crash even when I use safe/troubleshoot mode, when I open a private window, and when I run it as an administrator.  </p><p>I got to a point where it would give me a sliver of time before crashing. Following the advice of a Firefox help article, I managed to clear all of its stored cache and cookies(if I remember correctly). Still no fix.  </p><p>If anyone knows how to fix this, I'd love to hear the solution when convenient for you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",teampoggies

Unfortunately whenever I try to open it, it loads a blank screen and then crashes, and brings up the crash reporter. This has happened every time I try and open Firefox, even during Troubleshoot mode. I have over 180+ tabs and thousands of bookmarks on my account that I do not want to lose (I have not used Refresh Firefox for this very reason) but if I can't even access them on my computer then what can I do? </p><p>Please help me, I want to know how to fix this and keep my tabs and history. I am desperate. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",andrewpillinger3
