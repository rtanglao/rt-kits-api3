I don't have time to go through them at the moment so I prefer to highlight select each one with my mouse and copy and paste them to my email. </p><p>But because Facebook I presume is using lazy load, as the slider moves to the next slide of profiles it eventually stops because eventually it gets to where profiles have to load due to me now going to that area of the html elements, and now i hate to wait until they load to then re-hightlight and select each one of a continuous pattern which is very annoying </p><p>I'd rather be able to just have the webpage that I'm currently on of facebook to have everything load at once, so I don't have to wait for new profiles in the selection to load, when I scroll, or press a button for next list </p><p>The image I provided will visually show what I mean I get a selection list of suggested profiles to befriend on Facebook but eventually of either clicking on the right arrow button to slide over to next list to next or by highlight selecting eventually the sliding to next list stops due to the next list of profiles not loaded yet </p><p>The second image will show what was once white because it hasn't loaded yet now has </p><p>But thats just it I don't want to wait and have to scroll, or click a button and wait for the next batch of elements in which this case is image and link of their picture and name. </p><p>I want all those elements to load at once! So I don't have to wait for it to load after I reach that destination on the HTML. </p><p><br> Javascript. Firefox.

I have had little-to-no problems with Firefox before now. Since this morning, every time I open Firefox, it almost instantly crashes. Even after refreshing it and reinstalling it a few times, the problem persists. I have no idea what the cause is; I don't remember drastically changing any settings or anything like that. It will crash even when I use safe/troubleshoot mode, when I open a private window, and when I run it as an administrator.  </p><p>I got to a point where it would give me a sliver of time before crashing. Following the advice of a Firefox help article, I managed to clear all of its stored cache and cookies(if I remember correctly). Still no fix.  </p><p>If anyone knows how to fix this, I'd love to hear the solution when convenient for you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",teampoggies

Unfortunately whenever I try to open it, it loads a blank screen and then crashes, and brings up the crash reporter. This has happened every time I try and open Firefox, even during Troubleshoot mode. I have over 180+ tabs and thousands of bookmarks on my account that I do not want to lose (I have not used Refresh Firefox for this very reason) but if I can't even access them on my computer then what can I do? </p><p>Please help me, I want to know how to fix this and keep my tabs and history.
