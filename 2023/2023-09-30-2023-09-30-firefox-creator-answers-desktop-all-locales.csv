I once had a problem of not having enough Shortcuts, but that problem has been solved. </p><p>My problem now is that the number of COLUMNS in my TopSitesRows often change, without my permission, from 6 Columns to 8.  That leaves me with a lot of blank links as well as a lot of links I have visited only once &amp; have no plans to visit again.  Why can't I keep the number of COLUMNS the same like I can when I choose how many Rows when I choose TopSitesRows? </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,customize,en-US,1607212;,Chris72209
