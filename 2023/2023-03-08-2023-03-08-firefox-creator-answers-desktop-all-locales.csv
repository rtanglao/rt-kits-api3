I kept getting notifications in one of my email addresses. I opted out of it, but I've still been getting the desktop notifications. Even though I've contacted them about it several times, they're not much help. They left an address which took me to this area in Firefox &amp; their instructions are very vague &amp; don't make any sense. This is what I received to copy &amp; paste, which is how I got here... about:preferences#privacy Then this... After the options open, scroll down a little and you will find the option notifications, beside that you will find settings option, click on the same, to find all the website you have allowed for receiving notifications from, choose the options accordingly. </p><p>There isn't a place to reverse this. Other than asking for help here, I know nothing else to do except to contact my State Attorney General. Thank you in advance for any potential help you can give me. </p><p>God bless! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,other,en-US,1569497;,JulieB

The problem I have is that on my Macbook pro the log in will not log me out of some sites and then it will log me out of other sites but then no longer load the log in screen on the laptop. Even if I do log in and clear all my cookies. I have all my security turned off so it isn't cross site cookies or a firewall blocking the site from loading. Please help. The site does work completely fine on my windows PC so I do not know if it is a mac issue or a Firefox issue </p>,desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",andrewpostol

At attempted login I find I must always type (or paste) my username. Autofill by my password manager is not accepted as on all other websites. Upon having so entered the userid, the password manager may then autofill the password as if this were a first-time visit to the website. Further, the login process demands verification via code sent to my email address. This happens over and over. It occurs no matter which browser I use: Firefox or Safari. This is entirely inefficient and encourages me NOT to bother with the website whatsoever! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",albopf
