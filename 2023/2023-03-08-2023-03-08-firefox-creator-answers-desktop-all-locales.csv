I was having problem last December since Yahoo required as a verification a cell phone number, not having a cell phone I was allowed to use an alternate email (Hotmail) today I cannot get in because after entering the username and password it once more asks for cell phone. Last month I had an issue trying to log into our Capitol 1 account only to find the once again update from Mozzilla was interfering with access to that account (had to place a call to Capitol 1 tech that informed me why I could not access account). Apparently Mozzilla fixed the problem as it has gone away. Last night after logging off from Yahoo and today while trying to log in with 3 hours spent chasing my tail numerous resets of password and clearing the cache and cookies I am still unable to get into my email at Yahoo is this a problem that you are aware of? </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,other,en-US,"",vito2455

The 13 processes use 750 MB of memory and once the drive is tied up, nothing else can be loaded or run.  Sometimes if FF is closed, usage will eventually fall to the point where other processes can run or mouse clicks will be recognized.  Sometimes if CCleaner is run after FF is closed, FF will crash even though Task Manager shows no FF processes in the list.  This all seemed to start with the installation of v. 110.0.1. I have reinstalled v. 110.0.1 with no effect on the hang issue.  The system has been running without FF and no drive hang or 100% usage has been experienced.  Will not run FF until a new version is released.  Chrome running the same websites does not hang the drive and uses WAAAAAYYYY less RAM.  Sad, been using FF for decades.  Problem does not exist on my old iPad either.  Browser crash data has been sent at least twice. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jamis4764

The problem I have is that on my Macbook pro the log in will not log me out of some sites and then it will log me out of other sites but then no longer load the log in screen on the laptop. Even if I do log in and clear all my cookies. I have all my security turned off so it isn't cross site cookies or a firewall blocking the site from loading. Please help. The site does work completely fine on my windows PC so I do not know if it is a mac issue or a Firefox issue </p>,desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",andrewpostol

At attempted login I find I must always type (or paste) my username. Autofill by my password manager is not accepted as on all other websites. Upon having so entered the userid, the password manager may then autofill the password as if this were a first-time visit to the website. Further, the login process demands verification via code sent to my email address. This happens over and over. It occurs no matter which browser I use: Firefox or Safari. This is entirely inefficient and encourages me NOT to bother with the website whatsoever! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",albopf
