The problem I have is that on my Macbook pro the log in will not log me out of some sites and then it will log me out of other sites but then no longer load the log in screen on the laptop. Even if I do log in and clear all my cookies. I have all my security turned off so it isn't cross site cookies or a firewall blocking the site from loading. Please help. The site does work completely fine on my windows PC so I do not know if it is a mac issue or a Firefox issue </p>,desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",andrewpostol

At attempted login I find I must always type (or paste) my username. Autofill by my password manager is not accepted as on all other websites. Upon having so entered the userid, the password manager may then autofill the password as if this were a first-time visit to the website. Further, the login process demands verification via code sent to my email address. This happens over and over. It occurs no matter which browser I use: Firefox or Safari. This is entirely inefficient and encourages me NOT to bother with the website whatsoever! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",albopf

So I have to SO INCONVENIENTLY go to the 'library' to access my bookmark menu which always showed up on the left hand side of my screen.  There is nothing now to allow me to do this.  If I can't organize my bookmarks I might just have to find a new browser. </p>,desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1569467;,susan.mcmahon
