They pop-up in search but then they can't be updated when they are outdated and are forever noise in the Internet. </p><p>For example this post: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1376551"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1376551</a> </p><p>It is incorrect. Now it is possible to revert to the previous useful behavior from `about:config` -&gt; `browser.download.start_downloads_in_tmp_dir` </p><p>But I can't update neither the support thread, nor the reddit thread because both are locked. And I can't save other users from half an hour search. </p><p>I understand that many users tend to reuse threads incorrectly. But this is not much if at all harder to moderate than low quality new threads. It will be much more useful to allow editing old threads. Even if the new comment requires a moderator approval. </p><p>For example I try to post a comment, it warns me that this is an old thread and if I'm not adding an update because of product improvements, I should ask a new question. And that a moderator should approve my post. </p><p>Only then it adds to some moderator queue. </p><p>I think it is apparent from other forums and sites like the stackexchange bunch that editing old questions is often very valuable. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1150;,firefox,other,en-US,"",akostadinov

It says in my Firefox settings that my search engine is Google. On my Google account I had specific settings on for location tracking, cookies etc. When it says it's using Google as a search engine, is there a way I can be 'signed in' to my Google account (the way you could be signed in to Google if you were using Safari on an iPhone) so that those settings will still be on while using Firefox? I'd like to continue not allowing Google to track my location and other preferences I had when I used Chrome. Or if I use Youtube in Firefox that I'd be automatically signed in to my Youtube account. </p><p>I hope this makes sense! </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",taradoodle3

Mi è successa una cosa strana: andando in: Impostazioni - Privacy - Mostra Certificati, la finestra che appare sopra che tiene memorizzati i certificati installati su Firefox è diventata enorme, tanto da non farmi vedere nulla se non il Dispositivo che li ha generati, ma niente altro si visualizza che mi dica le carattestiche di tali certificati. Ho provato in ogni modo a ridurre tale finstra sovraimpressa, ma sembra che l'unico modo per ridimensionarla sia l' angolo in basso a destra, che purtoppo io non riesco a vedere, ne a prendere in altro modo. Chiedo a Voi, se esiste un metodo alternativo, anche con i comandi dalla tastiera o magari qualche tool, che permette il ridimensionamento, senza dover per forza disinstallare e reinstallare Firefox. </p><p>Ringrazio da ora quanti di Voi mi risponderanno. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1160;,firefox,other,it,1594716;1594717;,massimantonio

So I believe this problems come from the Firefox printing setting. When I print from another browser or another application such as Word, Excel, this problem never come. I also browse some topic about this problems and it seem no answer can be used. So is anyone here having the same problem as me? If yes, how can you resolve it? Please help to advise me.
