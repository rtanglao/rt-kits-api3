It seems quality dpi&lt; 150 although I changed <strong>print.default_dpi</strong> to 600 or 1200 but nothing happens. If I switch to ""Save to PDF"", quality will good. So I believe this problems come from the Firefox printing setting. When I print from another browser or another application such as Word, Excel, this problem never come. I also browse some topic about this problems and it seem no answer can be used. So is anyone here having the same problem as me? If yes, how can you resolve it? Please help to advise me. Thank you very much. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",phong_tan8462

It's usually fast and follows to exactly where my cursor is, but now it's slow. It used to have the same speed as just dragging the scrollbar. Google doesn't have this problem. I refreshed firefox and uninstalled my smooth scroll extension, but the issue is still there. Was there an update today or yesterday that did this? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1160;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",hipx2
