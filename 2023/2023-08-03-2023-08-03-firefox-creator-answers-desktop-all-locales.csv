Il problema si manifesta con due tastiere wireless diverse che funzionano perfettamente fuori da firefox. Utilizzo w10. Prima di ieri non ho mai avuto problemi e non ho fatto nessuna implementazione o modifica di recente. Penso proprio derivi dal vs ultimo aggiornamento. La funzione ripristino non ha dato risultati.
