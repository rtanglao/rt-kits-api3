This extension automatically generated the website address to the ""bookmarks toolbar"". I deleted the extension and deleted the shortcut as well. But when the bookmarked website shortcut ""firefox"" is closed and reopened, it adds itself to the bookmarks toolbar again. No matter what I did, it didn't work. I don't want to delete Firefox completely and reinstall it. Because there are too many shortcuts and data that I use all the time. How do you think I can solve this problem? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,bookmarks,tr,"",emredmc28
