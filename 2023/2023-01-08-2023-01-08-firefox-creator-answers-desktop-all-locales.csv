Some time ago, I must have had one device which probably generated a new device UID everytime it synced, or some kind of bug in the Firefox IOS client. This results in having a large magnitude of devices in my firefox sync account. I can only delete them one-by-one with a confirmation dialogue and a reload of the page, which is really cumbersome. I have the feature request of some easier device management policy here. Ideas would be either a ""delete all"" button and afterwards signing in again on all still active devices, or a series of check boxes to perform actions like a delete on multiple devices at once, perhaps even with a ""select all"" shortcut at the top. Feasible? Cheers, Niels </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,sync,en-US,1558288;1558292;1558301;,niels.wittje
