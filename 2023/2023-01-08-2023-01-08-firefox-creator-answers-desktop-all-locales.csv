I can display it by activating different app on the other display but when I want to play the full screen video on one display and work in other Firefox window on another display, the system tray is not visible. </p><p>Version: 108.0.2 (64-bit) and many older versions. </p><p>OS: macOS 13.0.1 </p><p>Reproducible: Always </p><p>Steps to Reproduce: Open the Firefox window. Open a new tab and move this new tab on another display. In the first tab, play some video in full screen mode. (E.g. some YouTube video.) </p><p>Actual Results: The system tray is not visible on all displays without the full screened video. </p><p>Expected behavior: The system tray is visible on all displays without the video playing in full screen mode. </p><p>Workaround: Firstly opening the tab with video in full screen mode (⌃⌘F) and then entering the full screen video ensures the visibility of system tray on other displays. </p><p>The system tray is visible also when working with other apps but Firefox. (Not possible when need to work in other browser window.) </p><p>Do you have this issue as well, how should we proceed? </p>",desktop;tabs;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",firefoxino

Some time ago, I must have had one device which probably generated a new device UID everytime it synced, or some kind of bug in the Firefox IOS client. This results in having a large magnitude of devices in my firefox sync account. I can only delete them one-by-one with a confirmation dialogue and a reload of the page, which is really cumbersome. I have the feature request of some easier device management policy here. Ideas would be either a ""delete all"" button and afterwards signing in again on all still active devices, or a series of check boxes to perform actions like a delete on multiple devices at once, perhaps even with a ""select all"" shortcut at the top. Feasible? Cheers, Niels </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",niels.wittje
