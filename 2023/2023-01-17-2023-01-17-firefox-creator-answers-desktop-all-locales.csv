The laptop has two video cards, Intel HD graphics 520 and NVIDIA GeForce 940MX. (I stopped NVIDIA on Ubuntu.) Since Ubuntu 21.10, I've run into various performance issues. However, when Windows boots up, the laptop behaves normally. Firefox is my main tool today. I have noticed that Firefox on Linux consumes much more CPU and memory than Firefox on Windows when I do the same thing on the web: open the same pages and watch the same videos. This is a clear sign that my Firefox on Ubuntu is not running smoothly. The audio stream is often interrupted for a while when I'm working on a page or opening another tab. On Windows, the audio stream is much more stable. What could be causing such poor performance of Firefox on Linux? Linux may have broken the Intel driver in version 21.10, however, I never run GPU-heavy tasks </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",YDUBINSKY
