Yes if I turning off the increased DPI scaling on my main screen it no longer happens, but if other UIs work fine why not Firefox, why do my preferences have to change to suit... :) </p><p>Any tips on this would be greatly appreciated </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1080;,firefox,other,en-US,"",djfrikition
