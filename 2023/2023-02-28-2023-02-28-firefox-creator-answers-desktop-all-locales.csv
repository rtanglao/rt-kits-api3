After doing so, maybe user chooses to open another link in same listing nearby-say #51 bookmark in a new tab browser window (multitasking etc.), ...often now, user gets put to top of said list, to bookmark#1  (especially after ) selecting a saved bookmark by clicking on either the ""&gt;&gt;"" icon or selecting ""Daily Links"".  </p><p>In my experience with Firefox, this action never reverted back to top of either list prior to latest 110.0 update (64bit).

I recently switched from Chrome to Firefox on both my stationary and my laptop. It works great on my laptop. However, on my stationary a lot of the times when I open a new tab, and sometimes (rarely) when I try to open another webpage in an already open tab (by typing in the new url, not clicking links), the tab won't load for quite some time. Then after a while it seems to reset itself and works. If I have typed in an url and wait where it shows suggestions, it resets whatever I have typed into the address field. This does not seem to happen if I type an address, press enter and wait. The problem happens regardless of extensions/addons. It's fairly annoying so I would like to find a fix, but I understand that since this doesn't happen on my laptop at all, it might not be the browser that is the problem. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",wagenius.daniel

Question: Will be above choices in both areas get me where I want to be, which is retaining cookies for chosen protected sites, while deleting cookies for all others whenever Firefox is closed? If this is where a lot of people want to be, why are these choices presented in such a complicated way? If relevant, under Enhanced Tracking Protection I choose Custom, and leave all the boxes checked. The sites I choose to use seem to perform well with this option.

Gostaria de lançar uma pergunta simples e direta para a turma da comunidade, pois não encontrei respostas ainda para tal pergunta e outros assuntos. O MOZILLA, tem algum tempo afirmando ter desenvolvido uma VPN para garantir o ANONIMATO do dados em fluxo. O Mozilla, solucionou todos os problemas de HACKEAMENTO que o uso do JAVASCRIPT proporciona? O Mozilla, conseguiu resolver os problemas de HACKEAMENTO, que impedi o atacante de usar a ATUALIZAÇÃO do NAVEGADOR para instalar um versão maliciosa? Última pergunta, o antigo TOR PROJECT, desenvolvido utilizando o NAVEGADOR MOZILLA, e que por anos foi confiável, ainda poderá ser utilizado pelos DESENVOLVEDORES do MOZILLA para criar uma conexão mais segura para seus usuários, através de RELÉS DE CONEXÃO para manter o anonimato do FLUXO DE DADOS? </p><p>A REDE TOR, de alguns anos para cá teve sua privacidade quebrada expondo muitos dos usuários, e com certeza todos nós usuários de BROWSER iremos agradecer a desenvolvedores que devolvam a liberdade de acesso a informações globais. Acabando com a tirania daqueles que ""tentam"" impedir o acesso a dados em toda a rede global. </p><p>Atenciosamente, </p>",desktop;other;windows-81;firefox-10280;firefox-1028;,firefox,other,pt-BR,"",magazinepandavendas
