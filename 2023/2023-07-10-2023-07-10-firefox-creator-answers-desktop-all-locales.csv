The icons disappeared and were replaced by the first letter of the title field for the link - a few of the shortcuts were gone.  After a short while some of the original icons reappeared, but not all.  In addition, a few of my shortcuts have been randomly replaced by shortcuts to web sites that I have just visited.  This seems to have started with the most recent Firefox update.   Is this unique to me?  Any feedback would be appreciated. </p><pre>                                                                                                  Bill </pre>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1150;firefox-11501;,firefox,other,en-US,"",wg5

I am using fiber optics, I've got other things running that never crash on different devices yet since the update only Firefox gives me this error. I can be playing an online game without any connection issues, running Hulu on my PS4, but when I use Firefox at least a dozen times a day I get this disconnect issue. I am only using uBlock Origin as an extension. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1150;firefox-11501;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Nightlistic

I uninstalled firefox completely including the profile folders from both the local and roaming locations, I've tried starting in safe mode/troubleshooting mode. All it does when I try opening is flash the window for half a second. In task manager it pops up for half a second, I can't even check the properties, cancel the process tree, etc. Even worse: there is no crash reports/files. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1589664;,mmtuals

I usually scroll down a way, possibly to the bottom. I step away, and when I come back I want to refresh the page. Up until about two weeks ago, when I press F5 to refresh the page, it would automatically scroll back to the top of the page. Now it seems to go to (maybe) a percentage of the page based on where it was last scrolled. I then have to manually scroll back to the top to see the latest headlines. Was Firefox behavior changed? Is there a setting to control page refresh behavior? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1140;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",pwrgreg007
