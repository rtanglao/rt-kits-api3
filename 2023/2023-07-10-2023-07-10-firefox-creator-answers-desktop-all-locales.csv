In my case it is ESET Internet Security. Normally once I tried to access a banking website on Firefox, antivirus automatically put me through to a secured tab. Since the update, it's not happening and the only way to do it is to force antivirus to used that security addon on all websites, not just those selected in the program. I see no reason to use it apart from banking websites. I would like to point out that other browsers I have tried don't have that problem. And it's definitely not a problem with antivirus software, since there were no changes or updates to ESET software between period when Firefox received updates. I have also tried out a beta release of Firefox (116) and the problem is present there as well. </p><p>I am waiting for your feedback. Thank you in advance.

Switching to another tab reset the context and links were opened on the right of the new active tab. However entering a new location in the address bar didn't reset the context and links were still opened relative to the order they were opened from the active tab, regardless of the location in the address bar. Let's say I visit site A and open three links, then visit site B by entering its address in the address bar without changing of tab. Opening a fourth link will open a fourth tab after the three others. </p><p>In FF115 the behavior is different.
