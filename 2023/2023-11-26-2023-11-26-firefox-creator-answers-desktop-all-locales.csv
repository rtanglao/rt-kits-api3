Why I think FF, if I am able to kill it with task manager- all is well.  Prior to that system is pretrty much locked up, sometimes can't even get task manager running.  Also, about twice a week I get a message from FF about oops your Foxnews tab has stopped., please send report.  I haven't sent report, just do a reload. </p><p>I have run 3 virus checkers, chkdsk and sfc /scannow and all are okay no virus, disk or system files missing.   </p><p>Thinking of switching browsers for awhile??  Then seems there is a place in profile that has passwords, but I forgot where.  Maybe I could download a completely new copy of firefox and keep my profile??  Then again maybe my profile is messed up.   </p><p>Any suggestions the best way to get a completely new copy of FF??   </p><p>On Windows 10 current release and now FF 119.0.  Down to using Flagfox, Malwarebytes Browser Guard, tab reloader, undo close tab, web threat shield (webroot).  Was for years using Noscripts, but stopped it for the last few weeks.  Actually I stopped Malwarebytes Browser Guard, web threat shield and noscripts and still got hung up.  That only left Flagfox, undo close tab and tab reload running as addons. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1190;,firefox,other,en-US,"",diverjer
