One feature of the app is to be able to print parts of the paper such as the crossword puzzle. When selecting to print the selected section, the section displays in a pop-up which it should. However recently when using Firefox the pop-up displays twice. And when printing again, the pop-up opens three times and then four times and then five times. I can get it to print ok from the last displayed pop-up and then I just have to close all the other pop-ups. </p><p>When using this app with Google and Edge this does not happen so I was wondering if there is a setting in Firefox that needs to be changed. Turning off pop-ups doesn't help in that I get the same of screens displayed telling me pop-ups have been disabled. </p><p>This odd behavior only began a few weeks ago. </p><p>Thanks, JB </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1200;,firefox,other,en-US,"",gfcdata

I usually leave about a half inch or so free on each side. This way, I still have easy access to any desktop shortcut that is alone the top/bottom, or left right of the screen, without having to minimize my browser windows completely to see the entire desktop. But for some reason, for the last several Firefox versions, it will always resize its height to take up the entire height of the desktop. The width stays the same, the way I want it. But the height is always from the top of the screen all the way down to the task bar. I don't know if it happens every single time I close out of Firefox and reopen, but I know my manual resizing never lasts long. what is happening here? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",accident55

For example, I've set the default sans serif to Source Sans 3, but websites use Arial regardless of the settings. The only custom font I've gotten to work is Segoe UI (the UI font on Windows); all other just fall back to Arial. The problem persists even if I disable all extensions/add-ons. I'm also experiencing the problem for non-Latin scripts; I've tried to set the default Bengali font to Noto Sans Bengali, but websites are using Vrinda instead. </p><p>I'm running Firefox version 120.0 on Windows 11, any help is greatly appreciated! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1200;,firefox,customize,en-US,1620298;,sssushimonster12

Also, about twice a week I get a message from FF about oops your Foxnews tab has stopped., please send report.  I haven't sent report, just do a reload. </p><p>I have run 3 virus checkers, chkdsk and sfc /scannow and all are okay no virus, disk or system files missing.   </p><p>Thinking of switching browsers for awhile??  Then seems there is a place in profile that has passwords, but I forgot where.  Maybe I could download a completely new copy of firefox and keep my profile??  Then again maybe my profile is messed up.   </p><p>Any suggestions the best way to get a completely new copy of FF??   </p><p>On Windows 10 current release and now FF 119.0.

Actually I stopped Malwarebytes Browser Guard, web threat shield and noscripts and still got hung up.  That only left Flagfox, undo close tab and tab reload running as addons. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1190;,firefox,other,en-US,1620315;,diverjer
