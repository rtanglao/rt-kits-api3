One feature of the app is to be able to print parts of the paper such as the crossword puzzle. When selecting to print the selected section, the section displays in a pop-up which it should. However recently when using Firefox the pop-up displays twice. And when printing again, the pop-up opens three times and then four times and then five times. I can get it to print ok from the last displayed pop-up and then I just have to close all the other pop-ups. </p><p>When using this app with Google and Edge this does not happen so I was wondering if there is a setting in Firefox that needs to be changed. Turning off pop-ups doesn't help in that I get the same of screens displayed telling me pop-ups have been disabled. </p><p>This odd behavior only began a few weeks ago. </p><p>Thanks, JB </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1200;,firefox,other,en-US,1620350;,gfcdata
