The issue is especially with Gmail because I have been late to online meetings because I am finding myself signed out. This is very frustrating and I need this resolved ASAP otherwise I am going to have to use a different browser. I really like Firefox so I prefer not to.  </p><p>Please advise how to fix this, I would really appreciate a quick response on this one.  </p><p>Thank you,  ~Ray </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1100;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",raymond.cantone

This occurs on any and all of our 4 computers using all of the 3 different internet providers, one of which is the largest Internet provider in Canada, BELL including also the their BELL Mobility Network.  I appreciate that as you can see we're using older operating systems, but Firefox reports our version 110 is up to date. Our adult children have much newer computers and later if not the latest Mac OS, and are attempting to access Netflix from other internet providers elsewhere in the province of Ontario. One of them is using the next largest internet provider in Canada, or at least the province, ROGERS. She too is still having this problem. I've been through the mill with Netflix's support people and they blame you guys and our internet providers. I cannot resolve the issue, and for that reason we have ceased using Netflix because of the implicit security vulnerability attached.  </p><p>What can I do about this? -Peter </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1012;firefox-1100;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1567596;,peter683

It caught my attention that an excessive amount of Firefox related 'DENIED' AppArmor log messages is generated during the browser activity. </p><p>According to messages, Firefox is occasionally denied read access to '/sys/devices/' area and read/write access to 'oom_score_adj' target in '/proc/'. Could somebody clarify why would that access be required for regular browser operations? I'm a bit puzzled as I haven't noticed anything similar with the older Ubuntu and Firefox versions. A complete suppression of those messages is also an option as long as there's no negative impact on application's performance. </p><p>I already posted this question to Ubuntu forum but seems like nobody there could provide an explanation.
