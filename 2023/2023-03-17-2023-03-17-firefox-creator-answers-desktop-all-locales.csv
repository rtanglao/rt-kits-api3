It can take 1-15 seconds every time I switch tabs, but sometimes I can switch back and the tab is the same as I left it without blinking out and into existence. On certain sites, this makes whatever I was reading get lost in the feed, but it's always distracting and frustrating. I work fast between lots and lots of tabs and this eats a lot of time and makes me lose focus, and adds massive friction to my workflow. How do i make it keep tabs loaded and looking as they did when i switched out of them, instead of pretending I just typed in the url and loading that from scratch every time?  I'm not the best with technical terms if anybody knows this can you explain it like I'm five please? Pictured: a tab I switched out of a little while ago but needed to copy something off - it went blank and slowly re-loaded when I switched back over to it </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",serpentscathedral
