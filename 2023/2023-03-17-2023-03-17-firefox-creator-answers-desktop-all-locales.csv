I have ""Check for updates but let you choose to install them"" selected in settings. On my Windows 10 machine, I always get prompted to download a new Firefox update. On Windows 11, nothing. I'd never know a new version was available if I hadn't already been prompted by Firefox on my Win 10 machine. </p><p>Outside of the OS, all the Firefox settings and addons are identical between the two machines. I do have sync on for Firefox. Notifications are turned on in Win 10 and Win 11, but Firefox isn't listed as an app in either to turn notifications off or on in Windows. Not certain why I'm notified on one computer but not the other regarding Firefox updates being available. </p><p>Issue seems to have begun with Firefox 110. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1110;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jkseidel
