EVENTUALLY - despite waiting long time for the Java Script to complete, I had to power off the m-c &amp; restart. ... It is VERY FAR from good that Through any web page - that FFox can crash my machine... IMHO - TOTALLY DANGEROUS, and far from good.

This happens if the cursor is not exactly in a specific search box or designated area on the screen.  I can reproduce the problem by clicking on the page (just the page, not a box or input area) then typing. It may be a function but has become so overwhelmingly annoying that I find it necessary to find a way to deactivate it.  If I click something else like another window and don't click the mouse exactly on a specific search box or input area when I go back to the page, it inputs the text I am typing down in this box. I don't like this; I don't want this.  Please help me rid the browser of this menace.  I put an image of the problem below and circled the offensive box.  Thanks for any help given.  I did try to search for this issue to see if there was already a solution but could not find one, hence posting this question.  I just found out this is the same box that pops up when you click the menu bar button ""edit"" followed by ""find in page"".
