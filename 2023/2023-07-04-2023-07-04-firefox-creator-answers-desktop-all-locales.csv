( In my case the file manager is Nautilus ) ( Ubuntu 20.04 ) </p><p>I have seen this: <a href=""http://kb.mozillazine.org/Links_to_local_pages_do_not_work"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kb.mozillazine.org/Links_to_local_pages_do_not_work</a> but it does not describe a scenario that uses the file:/// interface. </p><p>It also does not provide any information about how the files will be handled. </p><p>I can get the folder link to work currently , but it appears with the: 'Index of file///...' in a browser tab. </p><pre>Obviously you can not use that for anything useful. </pre> <p>The main goal is to open the folder and be able to use the system file manager to include more content for the site without having to navigate to the folder manually. The folders I want to display are buried many levels down without the possibility of having descriptive names. I have ~121 pages/folders in this arrangement , and each one has content for each page.  I would like to add a button on each of the 121 pages that will open each of the pages content folder. </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1588495;,Tyranna

(The latest was Malware Browser Guard.)  When I click to install them, I'm warned that I'll be allowing the app to read what I enter, change things, etc.  When I read more it sounds more reasonable -- it sounds like that at each step I'll be asked if I give permission for the app to read or edit -- the implication being read this specific page or edit this particular entry. </p><p>So by downloading these apps am I giving blanket authority to them to monitor my every click and keystroke or am I only telling the browser that I might want them to be able to do these things, but I need to be informed first when they are actively seeking to do something so I can decide whether to allow it at that point? </p><p>I don't suppose I have any guarantee that any software I use isn't collecting my userids, passwords, sites I visit, email I write, etc.  -- but when I'm specifically warned I am authorizing a program to read what I enter, etc. it gives me pause.  It's one thing to not know, another to say, no problem, have at it. </p><p>I'd like to take advantage of what some of these apps purport to provide.  I'm hoping for some reassurance about downloading ones from presumably reputable companies. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1588470;1588482;,splammond
