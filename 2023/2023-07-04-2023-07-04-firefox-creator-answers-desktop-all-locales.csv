(The latest was Malware Browser Guard.)  When I click to install them, I'm warned that I'll be allowing the app to read what I enter, change things, etc.  When I read more it sounds more reasonable -- it sounds like that at each step I'll be asked if I give permission for the app to read or edit -- the implication being read this specific page or edit this particular entry. </p><p>So by downloading these apps am I giving blanket authority to them to monitor my every click and keystroke or am I only telling the browser that I might want them to be able to do these things, but I need to be informed first when they are actively seeking to do something so I can decide whether to allow it at that point? </p><p>I don't suppose I have any guarantee that any software I use isn't collecting my userids, passwords, sites I visit, email I write, etc.  -- but when I'm specifically warned I am authorizing a program to read what I enter, etc. it gives me pause.  It's one thing to not know, another to say, no problem, have at it. </p><p>I'd like to take advantage of what some of these apps purport to provide.  I'm hoping for some reassurance about downloading ones from presumably reputable companies. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1588470;,splammond
