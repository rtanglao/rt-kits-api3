Or what is it problem Bug? </p><p>Now Version 114 on Windows 11 64 </p><p>When I print the keyboard to find in a box or typing wrong, then search popup taskbar in Firefox is appear! Why? it's like click the menu bar F10 button ""edit"" followed by ""find in page"".? What is it? According to the sample image. Sometimes there is a lot of code for writing a website! It is a virus spam. Or what is it? </p><p>There was a user asking this problem. Which is like my problem as follows </p><p>“Whenever using Firefox, I keep getting a pop-up box on the left side of the bottom of the browser which seems to search the webpage for whatever is in the box.  This happens if the cursor is not exactly in a specific search box or designated area on the screen.  I can reproduce the problem by clicking on the page (just the page, not a box or input area) then typing. It may be a function but has become so overwhelmingly annoying that I find it necessary to find a way to deactivate it.  If I click something else like another window and don't click the mouse exactly on a specific search box or input area when I go back to the page, it inputs the text I am typing down in this box. I don't like this; I don't want this.  Please help me rid the browser of this menace.  I put an image of the problem below and circled the offensive box.  Thanks for any help given.  I did try to search for this issue to see if there was already a solution but could not find one, hence posting this question.  I just found out this is the same box that pops up when you click the menu bar button ""edit"" followed by ""find in page"".  Don't know why in the world this thing is popping up by itself when it is neither needed or desired.” </p><p>I use firefox More than 100 versions and no problem But my problem would be like above. Thank you for helping each other. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1140;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Meows21

(The latest was Malware Browser Guard.)  When I click to install them, I'm warned that I'll be allowing the app to read what I enter, change things, etc.  When I read more it sounds more reasonable -- it sounds like that at each step I'll be asked if I give permission for the app to read or edit -- the implication being read this specific page or edit this particular entry. </p><p>So by downloading these apps am I giving blanket authority to them to monitor my every click and keystroke or am I only telling the browser that I might want them to be able to do these things, but I need to be informed first when they are actively seeking to do something so I can decide whether to allow it at that point? </p><p>I don't suppose I have any guarantee that any software I use isn't collecting my userids, passwords, sites I visit, email I write, etc.  -- but when I'm specifically warned I am authorizing a program to read what I enter, etc. it gives me pause.  It's one thing to not know, another to say, no problem, have at it. </p><p>I'd like to take advantage of what some of these apps purport to provide.  I'm hoping for some reassurance about downloading ones from presumably reputable companies. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1588470;1588482;,splammond
