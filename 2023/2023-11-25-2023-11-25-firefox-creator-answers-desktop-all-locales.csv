This time I directly modified the settings of applications, their type and which action I expect. Again problems and files are stored elsewhere. Once again modifications and it seems to be fixed. </p><p>It seems that this part of Firefox is modified too but I'm not sure. One download is still running and the file and the temporary part exists but not in the specified base directory.  The other ones are working as result of my second approach. </p><p>Any other experience concerning download and where to store? </p><p>Kind regards </p><pre> Stephan Albert </pre>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1200;,firefox,other,en-US,"",stephanalbert

IF I run Firefox in trouble shooting mode the videos play as normal with video and audio tracks.  </p><p>I have already refreshed fire fox and uninstalled and reinstalled it but the video track is still a blank field of green in both full screen and small screen modes. </p><p>Anyone have any ideas on what configuration setting may be causing this?

This can happen after just a few minutes of video or after hours.  It affects nearly all input: typing or clicking in webpages, the toolbar, the address bar, etc., though I can click the 'x' button to close tabs.  When I close the final window, a dialogue will appear stating that Firefox is non-responsive and allowing me to kill the process.  This seems unusual, because the OS's system monitor indicates there is plenty of unused and available RAM and CPU resources.  Firefox behaves normally after restarting. </p><p>OS: Xubuntu 22.04 Firefox version: 120.0 (though previous versions have been affected for the last few months) </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1200;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1620051;,ff.acco

On 1 we can ad the Ublock Origin extension no problem. But except for only 2 times, the other computer says installation aborted because add-on appears to be corrupt.  Like I said, we have gotten it to load twice but both times it disappeared and now it won’t load.  I’m not sure how it can be a connectivity issue, since they both access the internet from the same source.  Is it that the problem system has Window 11 and the other 10?  Why would it install twice and then disappear?  Note that as a test I have uninstalled Ublock and then reinstalled it no problem on the Windows 10 machine.  Does anyone know how to fix this?
