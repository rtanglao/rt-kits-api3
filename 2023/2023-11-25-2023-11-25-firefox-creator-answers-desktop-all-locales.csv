This can happen after just a few minutes of video or after hours.  It affects nearly all input: typing or clicking in webpages, the toolbar, the address bar, etc., though I can click the 'x' button to close tabs.  When I close the final window, a dialogue will appear stating that Firefox is non-responsive and allowing me to kill the process.  This seems unusual, because the OS's system monitor indicates there is plenty of unused and available RAM and CPU resources.  Firefox behaves normally after restarting. </p><p>OS: Xubuntu 22.04 Firefox version: 120.0 (though previous versions have been affected for the last few months) </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1200;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1620051;,ff.acco
