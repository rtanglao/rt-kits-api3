AND when that box offers options, the links come in the most awful blue-green I've ever seen. Tried to change the color by command -- no luck.  and it's not reading ""use system colors"" which it did before. </p><p>This is an utter crap preset MAC OS Ventura </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1200;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",arens3

On 1 we can ad the Ublock Origin extension no problem. But except for only 2 times, the other computer says installation aborted because add-on appears to be corrupt.  Like I said, we have gotten it to load twice but both times it disappeared and now it won’t load.  I’m not sure how it can be a connectivity issue, since they both access the internet from the same source.  Is it that the problem system has Window 11 and the other 10?  Why would it install twice and then disappear?  Note that as a test I have uninstalled Ublock and then reinstalled it no problem on the Windows 10 machine.  Does anyone know how to fix this?  Thanks. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1620036;,pjmobilet
