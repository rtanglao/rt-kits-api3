I have a decent internet connection, so it's usually not a problem.  But if there's any kind of disruption - say, for example, if I run the microwave for more than a minute - it causes the video to stop. </p><p>It seems we used to be able to buffer entire Youtube videos at one time.  But now, for some reason, I can't get more than about a minute or so. </p><p>There are plenty of old articles about certain settings that might work.  However, none of their recommendations work. The main one is setting media.cache_readahead_limit and media.cache_resume_threshold to high values.  This doesn't work anymore. </p><p>Another suggestion was to set media.mediasource.enable to false.  This increases the buffered amount, but has the side effect of SEVERELY limiting video quality, and can cause playback problems. </p><p>I just don't understand why Youtube won't buffer more than about a minute worth of video.  I don't even need it to load complete videos; I just want a little bit more than 1 minute worth of buffer. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",r.thomas.wright

Firefox did not play any sound over the headphones while all the others worked flawlessly. </p><p>I restarted my computer and tried the steps again and still got the same results. </p><p>I also deleted Cookies and Site data from Firefox settings and still no luck. </p><p>Any suggestions? </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,other,en-US,"",chris1810
