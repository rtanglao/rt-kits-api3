CCleaner having bought (some time ago, but it invariably appears at, or near, the top of any google search for browser protection) by We-Spy-Avast. So: </p><p>1) It' been known for many years that FF refuses js in address bar; bookmarklets have been praised as a work-around. Thus, a bookmarklet named ""some"", with keyword ""s"", and with ""javascript:alert(1);"" even continues to work today, by entering ""sEnter"" in the address bar. (The alleged work-around to reset about:config?filter=browser.urlbar.filter.javascript to false having been abandoned many years ago...) </p><p>2) It seems that FF tries to wrongly ""protect"" its settings by all means? Speaking about about:preferences#privacy where the ""Inspect (Q)"" doesn't work, but where by looking at the source code, I was able to identify the ""Clear Data"" button as button id=""clearSiteDataButton"" or then: data-l10n-id=""sitedata-clear"" (whatever that means...), whilst </p><p>2a) on that page, the buttons (among others) ""Clear Data"" has the ""l"" (lowercase-L) underlined, ""Manage Data"" has the ""M"" underlined, and ditto for the ""Manage Data"" dialog then, in which the button ""Remove Selected"" has the ""R"" underlined, the ""Save Changes"" button comes with an underlined ""a"", and the the ""Remove All"" has its first ""e"" underlined, etc., etc. - whilst NO a, r, e or whatever, also with ""alt"" or with ""control"", then would ever activate or trigger those buttons, which arises the question, ""WHY come those buttons with an underlined character, when they are not available BUT by - physical-only? - mouse click anyway?""? Or HOW would I then access those buttons by keyboard, their underlined characters obviously not working anymore? (?) </p><p>2 again) And so, I changed the above (then working) bookmarklet's url to: javascript:document.getElementById(""clearSiteDataButton"").click(); and now, when I trigger that bookmarket on the about:preferences#privacy page, nothing happens: </p><p>Have I made a js mistake here? Or does FF simply prevents any FF user's try to protect themselves, with material-on-board? </p><p>(I understand I can just send a mouse click to that button by AutoHotkey or similar, and that's what I currently do, send a click to x1150, y1320 into the FF window, but obviously, those values depend on my screen (size, resolution, etc), and my hiding both the menu bar and the bookmarks toolbar...) </p><p>(We're not 3-years-olds, but perhaps, the FF CEO has such children at home, and then extrapolates for the masses of money she gets? And no, even without add-ins, and lots of memory, FF has NOT been brought to a rally stable state yet...) </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1570518;1570531;,frqariszxtizknjvnc

This increases the buffered amount, but has the side effect of SEVERELY limiting video quality, and can cause playback problems. </p><p>I just don't understand why Youtube won't buffer more than about a minute worth of video.
