Since Spin Safe Browser is built-in with NSFW filtering but it's only available for Android/iPhone, and no, emulating Android or iOS is NOT an option. None of the current desktop browsers met the criteria for me to be safe enough to block NSFW (porn) content on default settings, only SPIN Safe Browser can do this and it's not available for PC/Windows, or Linux for that matter, so my best bet is to configure Firefox as much as possible so it can block as much unsafe content as possible but there are two or three problems I am facing right now which aren't exactly easy to fix: </p><p>1. Troubleshoot Mode DISABLES all addons, meaning that if I restart Firefox on this mode, I will be able to search and view for NSFW material. There could be a relatively easy way to fix this by building Firefox from source without this specific option. If this is possible then all I need are to instructions on how to build it without Troubleshooting Mode. Doing this step is critical as Troubleshoot Mode is more or less the equivalent of ""Turn the filter off, I want to watch porn"", as it disables every customization made to enforce web filtering. See image 1. </p><p>2. The addons themselves can be removed, either by manually disabling or uninstalling them. This is a huge problem because once this is done, Firefox no longer is capable of filtering unsafe content by itself. I need that these addons cannot be removed, or as a workaround, add as many layers of difficulty to prevent this from happening or making it as difficult as possible so the user simply gives up because it's too complicated. Or, building Firefox from source with these addons by default would solve this issue. You don't have to install ALL the addons for this step, just a few of them will do the work. See image 2. </p><p>3. Additionally, if there could be a way to permanently enable DoH and set a specific DNS by default and prevent it from being disabled or changed to something else. For example: <a href=""https://adguard-dns.io/es/public-dns.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://family.adguard-dns.com/dns-query</a> could potentially help me achieve the result I want. See image 3. </p><p>Please note that SPIN Safe Browser always blocks NSFW content by default and it's impossible to search this type of content with this browser, there is no way to turn off the filter and this is exactly how I want Firefox to behave. I have read something about converting APKs into PWAs but I'm not really versed in that, but if you know a way to ""port"" SPIN Safe Browser to PC/Windows/Linux please let me know, or if you have any other suggestion than can help me make Firefox behave more like SPIN Safe Browser on it's default settings I would really appreciate that. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,customize,en-US,1570567;1570569;1570570;,leodexe

CCleaner having bought (some time ago, but it invariably appears at, or near, the top of any google search for browser protection) by We-Spy-Avast. So: </p><p>1) It' been known for many years that FF refuses js in address bar; bookmarklets have been praised as a work-around. Thus, a bookmarklet named ""some"", with keyword ""s"", and with ""javascript:alert(1);"" even continues to work today, by entering ""sEnter"" in the address bar. (The alleged work-around to reset about:config?filter=browser.urlbar.filter.javascript to false having been abandoned many years ago...) </p><p>2) It seems that FF tries to wrongly ""protect"" its settings by all means? Speaking about about:preferences#privacy where the ""Inspect (Q)"" doesn't work, but where by looking at the source code, I was able to identify the ""Clear Data"" button as button id=""clearSiteDataButton"" or then: data-l10n-id=""sitedata-clear"" (whatever that means...), whilst </p><p>2a) on that page, the buttons (among others) ""Clear Data"" has the ""l"" (lowercase-L) underlined, ""Manage Data"" has the ""M"" underlined, and ditto for the ""Manage Data"" dialog then, in which the button ""Remove Selected"" has the ""R"" underlined, the ""Save Changes"" button comes with an underlined ""a"", and the the ""Remove All"" has its first ""e"" underlined, etc., etc. - whilst NO a, r, e or whatever, also with ""alt"" or with ""control"", then would ever activate or trigger those buttons, which arises the question, ""WHY come those buttons with an underlined character, when they are not available BUT by - physical-only? - mouse click anyway?""? Or HOW would I then access those buttons by keyboard, their underlined characters obviously not working anymore? (?) </p><p>2 again) And so, I changed the above (then working) bookmarklet's url to: javascript:document.getElementById(""clearSiteDataButton"").click(); and now, when I trigger that bookmarket on the about:preferences#privacy page, nothing happens: </p><p>Have I made a js mistake here?

I have a decent internet connection, so it's usually not a problem.  But if there's any kind of disruption - say, for example, if I run the microwave for more than a minute - it causes the video to stop. </p><p>It seems we used to be able to buffer entire Youtube videos at one time.  But now, for some reason, I can't get more than about a minute or so. </p><p>There are plenty of old articles about certain settings that might work.  However, none of their recommendations work. The main one is setting media.cache_readahead_limit and media.cache_resume_threshold to high values.  This doesn't work anymore. </p><p>Another suggestion was to set media.mediasource.enable to false.  This increases the buffered amount, but has the side effect of SEVERELY limiting video quality, and can cause playback problems. </p><p>I just don't understand why Youtube won't buffer more than about a minute worth of video.  I don't even need it to load complete videos; I just want a little bit more than 1 minute worth of buffer. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",r.thomas.wright
