Chat is working fine, and is active despite the stream not being displayed on my end. If I check the Twitch mobile app the stream displays as normal, so I know they are currently streaming. I tried disabling all of my add-ons and restarting the browser to no avail. I am a noob, so please be patient with me. I have attached images of an example, but this happens with any live channel, not just ones I am following (I do not have any active subscriptions as far as I know). </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",boarself
