No changes made to any options or add ons.  Date noticed about mid- December 2023.  Reverting Firefox to its state from before the issue occurred did not resolve the issue.

In addition there is no Owl Zoom icon in the video task bar.

I suspect that it is a Windows issue, but I don't have any leads or proof. For context first: </p><p>- I use Firefox on both my desktop and my laptop. - I do NOT use sync. Both are kept separate as my laptop is strictly for work. - I am on Windows 10, and use the same Microsoft login for both the laptop and desktop. - I do NOT have any desktop syncing between the laptop and desktop through Windows (that I know of). OneDrive is enabled, but Firefox is stored locally on both devices. </p><p>Currently, I have these symptoms and outcomes: </p><p>- Firefox settings have been reset. (Light mode, search engine preference, etc.) - Plugins are all gone, EXCEPT for UBlock Origin. It is a plugin I have on both my laptop and desktop, but on both devices I have other unique plugins as well. - History is (almost) all gone. There are a few items from my laptop's recent (last couple of days) history, but not everything. Trying ""restore previous session"" brings up one tab that was open on my laptop, but not everything. - Downloads history has items from several days ago which I downloaded on my desktop, but not anything more recent. - Bookmarks are all gone. </p><p>Finally, to my questions: - What happened? - Can I restore my desktop Firefox to its previous self? - If I don't have any manual saves of my Firefox setup, am I out of luck? - How can I prevent this from happening again? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,other,en-US,"",nottenounce

This issue first arose when I attempted to log in to Youtube, and had never occurred before. When I did that login, the tab crashed, and I have been unable to access the website since (100% crash rate). </p><p>Basic details: The website does not visually load at all. However, the URL bar icons for the website do briefly appear prior to tab crash. (Autoplay button, etc). The crash is never reported in about:crashes. </p><p>I've tried the following tests, unsuccessfully: - Logging out of all Google accounts separately - Disabling all extensions - Transferring all of my data to a new computer - Reinstalling Firefox - Rebooting Firefox in troubleshooting mode </p><p>This problem does not occur on my Windows machine but occurred on my previous intel-based Mac and now on my current Apple Silicon Mac. </p><p>The only success I have had is in creating an entirely new Firefox profile. However, I would prefer to fix the issue, as I assume that porting all my settings to the new profile would... also probably bring the bug along. </p><p>Thanks for reading &amp; any advice is appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1624077;,Michael_sdev
