When I did that login, the tab crashed, and I have been unable to access the website since (100% crash rate). </p><p>Basic details: The website does not visually load at all. However, the URL bar icons for the website do briefly appear prior to tab crash. (Autoplay button, etc). The crash is never reported in about:crashes. </p><p>I've tried the following tests, unsuccessfully: - Logging out of all Google accounts separately - Disabling all extensions - Transferring all of my data to a new computer - Reinstalling Firefox - Rebooting Firefox in troubleshooting mode </p><p>This problem does not occur on my Windows machine but occurred on my previous intel-based Mac and now on my current Apple Silicon Mac. </p><p>The only success I have had is in creating an entirely new Firefox profile. However, I would prefer to fix the issue, as I assume that porting all my settings to the new profile would... also probably bring the bug along. </p><p>Thanks for reading &amp; any advice is appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1624077;1624130;1624140;1624144;,Michael_sdev

Chat is working fine, and is active despite the stream not being displayed on my end. If I check the Twitch mobile app the stream displays as normal, so I know they are currently streaming. I tried disabling all of my add-ons and restarting the browser to no avail. I am a noob, so please be patient with me. I have attached images of an example, but this happens with any live channel, not just ones I am following (I do not have any active subscriptions as far as I know). </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1624055;,boarself
