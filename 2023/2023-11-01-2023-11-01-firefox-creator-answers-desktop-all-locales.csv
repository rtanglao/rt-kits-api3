I have checked every Firefox setting but am still unable to load their site to order oil. I have successfully been able to load their site not only on my smartphone but also on my work PC. I need to know how to fix this. Please advise and many thanks in advance for any assistance. BTW, it also doesn't load on my home PC in Firefox, Edge or Chrome but again loads just fine on my phone and work PC and my home PC VPN is turned off when I try to access this site and I have it added to my Firefox exceptions to be allowed. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1190;,firefox,other,en-US,"",eyelidstudio

I had a problem with this when I first switched to Firefox a few months ago and I found a solution in an old reddit post, but since updating to 119.0, that solution no longer works and I have exhausted all fixes I can think of. The previous solution was: ""Firefox 104 introduced some new video performance improvements, you can disable them by going to about:config and changing media.wmf.zero-copy-nv12-texture and gfx.direct3d11.reuse-decoder-device to false then restart."" I have tried watching videos both with these settings and without these settings and the issue persists. Other things I have tried that did not work: -disabling all extensions/troubleshoot mode and watching in an incognito window -clearing cache/cookies/data -disabling hardware acceleration -viewing youtube with the popout media player -crying and begging </p><p>I'm at my wits' end please help </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1190;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",Yeetony
