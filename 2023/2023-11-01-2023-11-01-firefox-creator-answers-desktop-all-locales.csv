For as a long as I remember, the spellchecking (when entering text in textedit boxes) has never worked.  But that's been ok because I only had the Mac for an xcode/iOS development job, and did most of my web browsing (using Firefox) elsewhere (Linux machines running Debian) and spell checking always worked fine there. </p><p>However stupid typos slipping through when I was using Firefox on the Mac eventually led to me wanting to get to the bottom of this. </p><p>It wasn't so much simply that the spellchecking doesn't operate... it's that the right-click menu is strangely devoid of anything but  </p><pre> Undo Redo | Cut Copy Paste Delete Select All | Inspect | Block Element </pre> <p>(that last one from uBlock Origin plugin).  <strong>NB</strong> there were no ""Language"" or ""Check spelling"" items there at all, which are the first things I'd look for on my other machines if spellchecking went awry. </p><p>I tied all the usual diagnostics/fixes: remove plugins (uBlock Origin is the only one I ever use), new profile, ""refresh firefox""... none of it made any difference.  I went through a ton of items on this site by nothing seemed to be quite the same problem and the suggested solutions didn't work for me. </p><p>I eventually decided reinstalling from scratch was the only option: binned Applications/Firefox and Library/Application Support/Firefox and did a fresh install of the 119.0 download.  But no joy.  I'm typing this in it right now and there's no spellchecking happening and the right-click menu is just the same as it was before: devoid of ""Check spelling"" or ""Language"" items. </p><p>The Firefox settings ""Language"" section does show ""English (GB)"" selected, and ""Check your spelling as you type"" enabled.  But spell-checking certainly isn't happening in any text box I'm using. </p><p>(I've attached a screenshot of what the right-click menu does look like, when I bring it up in this text box I'm typing in now.) </p><p>I'm not a ""Mac native"" so I'm not sure what else on the system could be messing things up.  In the system settings the Trackpad is set to ""Click with 2 fingers"" and certainly brings up a menu in Firefox text edit boxes... but it seems odd that the Language/Spelling-related items I'd expect to see are missing from it. </p><p>I'm totally baffled.

I had a problem with this when I first switched to Firefox a few months ago and I found a solution in an old reddit post, but since updating to 119.0, that solution no longer works and I have exhausted all fixes I can think of. The previous solution was: ""Firefox 104 introduced some new video performance improvements, you can disable them by going to about:config and changing media.wmf.zero-copy-nv12-texture and gfx.direct3d11.reuse-decoder-device to false then restart."" I have tried watching videos both with these settings and without these settings and the issue persists. Other things I have tried that did not work: -disabling all extensions/troubleshoot mode and watching in an incognito window -clearing cache/cookies/data -disabling hardware acceleration -viewing youtube with the popout media player -crying and begging </p><p>I'm at my wits' end please help </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1190;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",Yeetony
