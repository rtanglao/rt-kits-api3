I had a problem with this when I first switched to Firefox a few months ago and I found a solution in an old reddit post, but since updating to 119.0, that solution no longer works and I have exhausted all fixes I can think of.

I have tried watching videos both with these settings and without these settings and the issue persists. Other things I have tried that did not work: -disabling all extensions/troubleshoot mode and watching in an incognito window -clearing cache/cookies/data -disabling hardware acceleration -viewing youtube with the popout media player -crying and begging </p><p>I'm at my wits' end please help </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1190;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",Yeetony
