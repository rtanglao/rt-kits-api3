Users with this specific browser setting and version combination may be unable to access the Amazon Connect CCP when embedded in another application, preventing them from handling contacts. </p><p>To prevent impact to your users (agents), we recommend that your users do one of the following: </p> <ol><li> Confirm (or set) Enhanced Tracking Protection as Standard in their browser settings. Users can do this by following instructions documented here. </li></ol> <p><br> </p> <ol><li> Do not upgrade their Firefox browser version to v86 or higher. </li></ol> <ol><li> Use Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge to access the Amazon Connect CCP.<em><strong> </strong></em> </li></ol> <p><br> </p><p>That's how AWS is blocking firefox users to access the sound in a firefox browser.
