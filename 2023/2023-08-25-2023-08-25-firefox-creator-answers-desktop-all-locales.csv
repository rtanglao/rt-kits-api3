My Seamonkey profile isn't even old. I'm using the version compiled about a year ago because the two more recent ones crashed occasionally. </p><p>There presently doesn't seem to be any code in Firefox to import data. Supposedly there used to be. It's still needed or very desirable. </p><p>I don't have a question because it's pretty clearly not there. It's something for you to fix. </p>,linux;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-10212;firefox-102120;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",democritus7

What can I do to get it to retain the words I had typed in? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Larry951

Problem is that I don't belong to any organizations or enterprises having anything to do with my online life. I have been hacked in the past and am paranoid when I see something that doesn't make sense. When I click on the link (trusting that it is indeed from you), it takes me to your Enterprise Policy page showing the following: </p><p><br> Active Policy Name 	                 Policy Value </p><p>DNSOverHTTPS	           Enabled	false 	                                   Locked	true </p><p>I always use secure DNS (DOH or DOT) on everything - network adapters,  routers (except the ISP one whose default I can't figure out to circumvent) etc. but on the browser setting pages I am only given the option of having it off: the default, increased, and max protection options are greyed out and cannot be chosen. I guess that explains the policy values but who locked it? My only guess is that is use a Surfshark VPN and realize that in so doing I am using Surfshark's DNS servers but I believe I had this problem before using the VPN. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanx. </p><p>Pat Ford - dpfmd@msn.com </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1599662;1599663;1599664;,dpfmd
