YouTube video controls). OS Master volume is maxed. </p><p>But the volume of the Firefox in Windows Volume Mixer is a fragment of the volume set. If I adjust it to max, it jumps to a fragment of it. If I adjust it to lower, it gets even lower, like a percentage of what I actually set. The level I actually set gets a grayed out slider button, and the actual slider button slides to this lower level. See the screenshot in the attachment. </p><p>It may sound like an OS issue, but as I understand, this is the output level set by the application (Firefox, in this case).

Pressing the key does not bring up the Start menu, Pressing Win-D does not minimize the windows to the desktop, Win-Tab does not bring up the task switcher, etc.  This is true for the built-in keyboard, the on-screen keyboard, and an external USB keyboard. </li><li> VMWare Workstation is unable to Power-on Suspended or Powered-Down virtual machines.  A dialog pops up simply stating ""Failed to power on . . ."" and listing the .vmx file.  If I already have a VM running when I start Firefox, Workstation behaves normally, and also registers the press of the Windows key, even though the host OS ignores it. </li></ul> <p>I've restarted multiple times;  the problem persists. </p><p>The problem begins about 15 -- 30 s after Firefox starts, and stops about 10 -- 15 s after Firefox closes. </p><p>The system exhibited similar behavior with the Obsidian notetaking program.  I uninstalled and reinstalled Obsidian, and it stopped for a little while, but it's back to  showing the same behavior. </p><p>I've uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox (restarting between). </p><p>I'm running Windows 11 Home (22H2) on an HP laptop w/ 64 GB RAM.

Problem is that I don't belong to any organizations or enterprises having anything to do with my online life. I have been hacked in the past and am paranoid when I see something that doesn't make sense. When I click on the link (trusting that it is indeed from you), it takes me to your Enterprise Policy page showing the following: </p><p><br> Active Policy Name 	                 Policy Value </p><p>DNSOverHTTPS	           Enabled	false 	                                   Locked	true </p><p>I always use secure DNS (DOH or DOT) on everything - network adapters,  routers (except the ISP one whose default I can't figure out to circumvent) etc. but on the browser setting pages I am only given the option of having it off: the default, increased, and max protection options are greyed out and cannot be chosen. I guess that explains the policy values but who locked it? My only guess is that is use a Surfshark VPN and realize that in so doing I am using Surfshark's DNS servers but I believe I had this problem before using the VPN. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
