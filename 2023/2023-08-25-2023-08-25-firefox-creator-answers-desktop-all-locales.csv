Pressing the key does not bring up the Start menu, Pressing Win-D does not minimize the windows to the desktop, Win-Tab does not bring up the task switcher, etc.  This is true for the built-in keyboard, the on-screen keyboard, and an external USB keyboard. </li><li> VMWare Workstation is unable to Power-on Suspended or Powered-Down virtual machines.  A dialog pops up simply stating ""Failed to power on . . ."" and listing the .vmx file.  If I already have a VM running when I start Firefox, Workstation behaves normally, and also registers the press of the Windows key, even though the host OS ignores it. </li></ul> <p>I've restarted multiple times;  the problem persists. </p><p>The problem begins about 15 -- 30 s after Firefox starts, and stops about 10 -- 15 s after Firefox closes. </p><p>The system exhibited similar behavior with the Obsidian notetaking program.  I uninstalled and reinstalled Obsidian, and it stopped for a little while, but it's back to  showing the same behavior. </p><p>I've uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox (restarting between). </p><p>I'm running Windows 11 Home (22H2) on an HP laptop w/ 64 GB RAM.  Firefox V116.0.3.  VMWare Workstation 16 Pro (16.2.5 build-20904516). </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1160;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",smrogue31+mozilla

My Seamonkey profile isn't even old. I'm using the version compiled about a year ago because the two more recent ones crashed occasionally. </p><p>There presently doesn't seem to be any code in Firefox to import data. Supposedly there used to be. It's still needed or very desirable. </p><p>I don't have a question because it's pretty clearly not there. It's something for you to fix. </p>,linux;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-10212;firefox-102120;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1599680;,democritus7

Problem is that I don't belong to any organizations or enterprises having anything to do with my online life. I have been hacked in the past and am paranoid when I see something that doesn't make sense. When I click on the link (trusting that it is indeed from you), it takes me to your Enterprise Policy page showing the following: </p><p><br> Active Policy Name 	                 Policy Value </p><p>DNSOverHTTPS	           Enabled	false 	                                   Locked	true </p><p>I always use secure DNS (DOH or DOT) on everything - network adapters,  routers (except the ISP one whose default I can't figure out to circumvent) etc. but on the browser setting pages I am only given the option of having it off: the default, increased, and max protection options are greyed out and cannot be chosen. I guess that explains the policy values but who locked it? My only guess is that is use a Surfshark VPN and realize that in so doing I am using Surfshark's DNS servers but I believe I had this problem before using the VPN. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanx. </p><p>Pat Ford - dpfmd@msn.com </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1599662;1599663;1599664;,dpfmd
