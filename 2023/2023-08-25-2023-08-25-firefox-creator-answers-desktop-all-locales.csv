For example, in Google homepage after typing something or even gibberish the page froze and not responding for about 10 second but the browser is still functioning (meaning I can still move other tabs or open option). Once that 10s delay is over, it responded with my result. And something when I when to search back something again(not in the homepage), more of the time is response back fast like 0.2s but other time the same 10s delay. This problem also happens in some other website but not all in their search bar. I have try in safe mode. disable all my extension, reinstall Mozilla Firefox, check any windows update and such. Also other browser does not have this problem such as chrome and brave. If this problem still persisting then I would such to other browser but prefer not to as I quite fond of Firefox.
