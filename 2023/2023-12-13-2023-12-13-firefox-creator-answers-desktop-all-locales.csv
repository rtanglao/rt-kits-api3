Aside from the safety question, I noted that at least 2 FF reviewers of SimplyCodes stated that no discount registered for them upon checkout, so it seems they added it to Add-Ons for nothing.  </p><p>I don't use a smartphone, rather just a home thinkpad. Might that cause promo-codes to malfunction for me too? If SimplyCodes really is safe, and wouldn't malfunction, then I'd go for it. Thanks to anyone who can offer informed feedback. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1200;,firefox,other,en-US,"",enkwirer

I'm lucky if my restoring lasts 2 days. For example; this morning I opened Firefox and all appeared to be OK. This is afternoon and Firefox has come up with a dark screen, changed preferences and altered my security settings. I've raised this subject before and I'm really tired of doing this. I favour Firefox because I like the relative independence of it, whereas MS and others seem to pry on everything one does. I also think MS is deceitful in that I cannot get back my MS Office (that I paid for) after a rebuild. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",weepingangel21742
