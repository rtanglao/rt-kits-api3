I have also set an exception for a few websites, so they should save cookies and data. However, this does not work as intended. After closing and reopening Firefox, both cookies and data are gone from these websites. I have looked for a solution in older forum entries, and it was recommended to adjust the history settings. It seems that checking the box at ""Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed"" automatically sets the history settings to what can be seen in the attached screenshot. Altering these automatic settings unchecks the box above. Is this issue related to the website or is there a way to solve it? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Firkraag

I favour Firefox because I like the relative independence of it, whereas MS and others seem to pry on everything one does. I also think MS is deceitful in that I cannot get back my MS Office (that I paid for) after a rebuild. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",weepingangel21742
