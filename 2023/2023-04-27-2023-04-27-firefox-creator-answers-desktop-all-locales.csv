Not only is You Tube still a mess, but it seems that I have lost all of my bookmarks... they do not appear to be in my profile folder...  Have I lost these bookmarks (quite a collection), and any idea why my YouTube is now so bad (e.g. whereas previously I had no problems with image and video with the Auto p setting), now I have constant freezing and only very low quality.... Also despite setting adblocks and other security addons, I am getting adds whereas before I got none.  In short, the browser was very satisfactory until I tried to upgrade.

It is off centre slightly from the top and left, about 4mm as u can see below and I can see my desktop. its so weird because it happens 90% of the time and EVERYTIME after I close fullscreen and put it back again - it works perfectly fine, but it is kind of PIA if u have to do it all the time and its unpleasant.
