There are a few websites that just don't open for some reason. Either they don't load at all and I get a blank page or there's a problem with the way they load. I've done some troubleshooting. Figured it might be an add-on, safe mode didn't fix it. Tried a 'refresh'. Didn't fix it. Figured it might be corrupt cache after the first visit, but deleting cache didn't fix it. </p><p>Finally tried reinstalling Firefox and it did... but not for long. After the reinstall, the websites were accessible again no problem. But then the next time I closed Firefox and restarted it or shut down my computer, the problem was back. This is 100% consistent. No exceptions. Always reproduces the issue. </p><p>To give examples of websites that for some reason stop working: A couple of websites for a game I play (trackmania.exchange and <a href=""http://trackmania.io"" rel=""nofollow"">trackmania.io</a>) My work Outlook inbox and more generally the whole Office 365 suite online. The Twitter feed. For some reason the UI loads but the feed just says ""Something went wrong. Try reloading"". I'm sure there are others I haven't found yet, but for some reason I have no problem accessing YouTube, Google, Facebook, Instagram, etc. </p><p>I have no clue how to troubleshoot this any further. Something goes wrong after closing Firefox after reinstalling it. I can't keep reinstalling it every time I turn my computer on. I also don't want to have to use hibernate constantly to keep the first instance open. </p><p>Any ideas? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1577572;1577578;1577581;,bakhayman

Also, sometimes if I open multiple tabs, it hangs up and I have to log out and back in again.  I like FireFox and prefer it as a browser, so I'd like to fix this.
