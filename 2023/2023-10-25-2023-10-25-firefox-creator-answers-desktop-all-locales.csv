I saw the option ""Enable account names for email masks"" it had a lengthy explanation that if i leave it disabled that my masks will have no names.  But my masks have names (i have not opened the relay site since the relay beta therefor i assume it was checked as disabled as my account never had this option before?!)  Confused by this i clicked on enable. Then disable again to see if the explanation pops up again, it did. So i left it at ""enabled"" and clicked save. </p><p>immediately after, all my mask names that were created since the beta of relay were gone from the website.  I checked my Firefox itself, they were still present! So i searched for the option to disable sync. But it was too late.  </p><p>I assume sync has no versioning?  </p><p>I still have local backups of my Firefox folder. But if I just overwrite them i guess the sync will restore the one from the cloud? </p><p>Is there a way to get my mask names back? </p><p>greetings. </p>",desktop;sync;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",hfpisd
