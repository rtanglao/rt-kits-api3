I need some help in getting rid of that smaller google search tab in my upper left hand corner. I have google search as my search engine in Firefox. That works just fine. It comes up in middle of my page like it should. When i go to open up Firefox on my desktop it opens up just fine but on upper left hand corner of google search page there is another google search tab which is much smaller. I don't want that at all. How do i get rid of it and just have the bigger google search in middle of page.
