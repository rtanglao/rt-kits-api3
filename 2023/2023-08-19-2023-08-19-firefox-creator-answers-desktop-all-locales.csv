Whenever I try to share my screen in Microsoft teams and Google Meet, the participants only see a black screen with a cursor. I am able to reproduce the issue on this test page. I had to downgrade to 115 in order to “fix” this critical feature. Before that it was broken in 114 and I had to use Chromium for presentations. I no longer want to touch Chrome with a 100 ft pole since they are trying to introduce Web Environment Integrity. </p><p>The only bug I have been able to find is from three years ago: </p><p><a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1640771"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1640771</a> </p><p>I don’t want to add a “me too” comment, but was wondering how to show/give my support to get this issue fixed? It is crippling to my work workflow, and I don’t want to be on 115 forever. I am an engineer so I can provide advanced support to a Firefox dev, just not development as firefox is gargantuan beast of a code base. </p><p>Any guidance or pointers would be appreciated, Thanks! </p>",linux;desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1150;firefox-11503;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1598442;,jeezusjr
