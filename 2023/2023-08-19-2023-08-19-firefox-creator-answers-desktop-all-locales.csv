If I click it away - it provides me with the firefox browser but its original set up. To get to ""my firefox browser"" set up I have to log in. I cannot find anywhere in the Microsoft settings the possibilty to remove Firefox from this requirement. I have tried to unstall and reinstall Firefox, also reset Windows security (which is a joke - as nothing is reset). Can you tell me how to get ridd of this - so that I simply can open the Firefox browser without having to fall each time over Windows Hello. (I have tried to unsign from Hello and use on the classical password sign in - no hope - still asking then for the MS password). Firefox is in some super secure vault - and I would like to get it out of there. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1598546;,islandsheep
