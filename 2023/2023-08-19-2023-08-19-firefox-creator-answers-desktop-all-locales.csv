I do not wish any other Firefox data such as Bookmarks, History or Passwords included with it.

This shall not contain site specific settings. </p><p>I currently run Windows 10 but would be happy if the solution is generic that can be applied to other platforms as well. </p><p>Please also include how to restore said backup. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1160;,firefox,other,en-US,1598487;1598499;,cy_narrator

Resulta que en la actualización del día de la fecha descubrí que la pestaña de Whatsapp web dejó de poder pegar lo que tengo copiado en el portapapeles de Windows 10. Normalmente tengo habilitado historial del portapapeles y siempre pego lo que allí quiero copiar pero hete aquí que hoy se actualizó, se bloqueó el navegador, reinició y borró todas las pestañas abiertas de forma inesperada y luego de iniciar desde cero y al cargar Whatsapp web ya no puedo pegar contenido y si lo puedo hacer en otro navegador, como Microsoft Edge. Lo hice hasta antes de ese bloqueo. ¿Alguien sabe si conviene regresarlo a la publicación de esta actualización serviría? Saludos. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,fix-problems,es,"",Flinsy

Now it opens the link in BOTH current tab and a new background tab. This has started occurring in the last few days (mid Aug 2023). This is especially a problem when viewing CraigsList where it was very helpful to be able to cmd-click on links of no interest to mark them as ""read"" while remaining on the main list page. Now it is necessary to back up to previous page (main list) after clicking on each link...

Whenever I try to share my screen in Microsoft teams and Google Meet, the participants only see a black screen with a cursor. I am able to reproduce the issue on this test page. I had to downgrade to 115 in order to “fix” this critical feature. Before that it was broken in 114 and I had to use Chromium for presentations. I no longer want to touch Chrome with a 100 ft pole since they are trying to introduce Web Environment Integrity. </p><p>The only bug I have been able to find is from three years ago: </p><p><a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1640771"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1640771</a> </p><p>I don’t want to add a “me too” comment, but was wondering how to show/give my support to get this issue fixed? It is crippling to my work workflow, and I don’t want to be on 115 forever. I am an engineer so I can provide advanced support to a Firefox dev, just not development as firefox is gargantuan beast of a code base. </p><p>Any guidance or pointers would be appreciated, Thanks! </p>",linux;desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1150;firefox-11503;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1598442;,jeezusjr
