Now it opens the link in BOTH current tab and a new background tab. This has started occurring in the last few days (mid Aug 2023). This is especially a problem when viewing CraigsList where it was very helpful to be able to cmd-click on links of no interest to mark them as ""read"" while remaining on the main list page. Now it is necessary to back up to previous page (main list) after clicking on each link... Is this perhaps a recent change (I had auto-update turned on)? </p>",desktop;tabs;mac-os-x-1013;firefox-1151;firefox-11510;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1598558;1598562;1598566;1598574;1598581;,garth4

Whenever I try to share my screen in Microsoft teams and Google Meet, the participants only see a black screen with a cursor. I am able to reproduce the issue on this test page. I had to downgrade to 115 in order to “fix” this critical feature. Before that it was broken in 114 and I had to use Chromium for presentations. I no longer want to touch Chrome with a 100 ft pole since they are trying to introduce Web Environment Integrity. </p><p>The only bug I have been able to find is from three years ago: </p><p><a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1640771"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1640771</a> </p><p>I don’t want to add a “me too” comment, but was wondering how to show/give my support to get this issue fixed? It is crippling to my work workflow, and I don’t want to be on 115 forever. I am an engineer so I can provide advanced support to a Firefox dev, just not development as firefox is gargantuan beast of a code base. </p><p>Any guidance or pointers would be appreciated, Thanks! </p>",linux;desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1150;firefox-11503;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1598442;1598505;1598551;,jeezusjr
