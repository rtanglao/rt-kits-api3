Instead of these windows consuming resources and sitting open, I want a really, really easy way of ""saving"" each window as is (as they're organised by topic), closing them, and then by hitting just a couple of buttons voila, I can see all the potential windows, select what I need and have it open, and easy to shut again in reverse. </p><p>How can I do this?  I can't make head nor tail of Firefox bookmarks - have examined the menu option, have read the articles, still as clear as mud.  For example, ""save all tabs"" doesn't seem to mean save all tabs, it just means save tabs in the window you've maximised. Then after creating its own folder in Bookmark menu, when I added a new tab to it I thought that would update. It doesn't. Then I manually did another ""save all tabs"" for that menu - and the new tab didn't appear. </p><p>I don't even know if Bookmarks is the way to even attempt what I'm trying to do here in my question. Does anyone have any great tips on how to minimise the firefox window clutter, but have it really accessible easily? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;tabs;mac-os-x-1013;firefox-1150;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1600313;,l569

However, they don't always work for me. Most notably, spacebar often toggles the last thing I clicked in picture-in-picture mode. For example, I enter full screen mode and press spacebar to play the video, but instead it exits the full screen. Or I click on one of the ""rewind"" buttons, after which spacebar adopts the function of that button until I manually click play. For some reason, the arrow keys also don't always work. I suspect it's the problem of the same origin. </p><p>I also feel the need to say that this behavior is not limited to picture-in-picture. This is similar to what happens in almost all video players online and, possibly, some of the offline ones as well. I have also checked a few forums (VLC development thread and Stack Overflow) and it seems to be a common issue across many video players. </p><p>Still, if anyone knows any way to deal with this problem in Firefox picture-in-picture as a user, I would greatly appreciate it, as it interferes with multitasking a lot more than on any other players. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,other,en-US,1600273;,alkir-2

All the other members of my household use Firefox on their Mac laptops and iPhones. I have only ever signed into my own account on Firefox, and in the same way I have only ever signed into my own account on Mozilla VPN, which I have used for over a year while living elsewhere and have never had a problem with this. I also have only my own Google account in the data imported from Chrome. I have no one else's information for any account on anything in my device nor, to my knowledge, do they have any account information of mine on theirs. However, sometime in the 10 or so months since I imported my Chrome data - around the same time I moved into a house with others who use Firefox - my laptop's Firefox seems to have...connected somehow, in a way atypical with normal syncing, with the other devices in my house. Occasionally, when I open Firefox on my computer, whatever tab another household member has open on their computer will open instead of a homepage. Also, a little icon pops up occasionally to tell me Firefox is ""open on iPhone"" when another household member is using Firefox on their iPhone. I use an Android which does not have Firefox installed, so it's not a glitch syncing with my own device. I do not know how this happened and I do not know how to stop it. There doesn't seem to be any evidence of this connection in any place I can see in the preferences window, nor can I find any way to permanently unsync my device's Firefox application from anything unless I sync something first.

If you have a few card numbers stored, this gets really annoying because there's no way to tell which expiry date corresponds to the credit card number that you filled in previously. Is there a way for Firefox to display the last 4 digits of the card number next to the expiry dates? </p><p>I've attached a screenshot to illustrate the issue. </p><p>Many thanks! </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",richardyusen

I have checked the communications tab under sound settings to verify that my system is to do nothing when i switch between applications, so i am assuming this is not the cause. are you aware of any issues like this happening? i cannot find answers on your website or forums </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",evanicox3
