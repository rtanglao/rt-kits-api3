The most recent and big one being Twitter, where there are two accounts saved on Chrome, but Firefox says it has none. I've tried all the usual, restarting both browsers and PC, checking there's no security I can find that locks those down (if there is I cannot find it) and the like. I'm on Windows 10 Pro, fully updated with latest patches on all browsers and Win10 itself. </p><p>Is this a security thing from those specific sites? Could it be a drastic change to the address fooling Firefox (and if so, why if I go back to Chrome do they load in fine?) or something I'm just not thinking of? I'm really hoping I don't have to keep going back to Chrome randomly to find a password when Firefox finds one it doesn't remember, kind of destroys the purpose of moving away from Google... </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",lee.bryn.thompson

But i cant past it into the address bar on Firefox, or here in this textbox (Cant Past any text into Firefox). </p><p>The text is being copied, as i can past it into other applications with no issues. Refreshing Firefox has not fixed or affected the issue. </p><p>Running Firefox on troubleshoot mode has not had any effect. </p><p>The issue appears to start occurring after Windows 11 goes to sleep, and is then woken up, to resume. Restarting the computer fixes the issue. (Note that terminating the Firefox process and starting it again does not fix the issue). </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,other,en-US,"",stianaamodt2

I think it is associated with the fact that the New York Times ads are missing or haven't loaded on that iMac. On our other iMac, New York Times articles load fine and the ads are present. I've looked in the Firefox settings on both and can't find any significant differences differences that would create this problem. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1600192;,ed121

If you have a few card numbers stored, this gets really annoying because there's no way to tell which expiry date corresponds to the credit card number that you filled in previously. Is there a way for Firefox to display the last 4 digits of the card number next to the expiry dates? </p><p>I've attached a screenshot to illustrate the issue. </p><p>Many thanks! </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",richardyusen

I have checked the communications tab under sound settings to verify that my system is to do nothing when i switch between applications, so i am assuming this is not the cause. are you aware of any issues like this happening? i cannot find answers on your website or forums </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",evanicox3
