If you have a few card numbers stored, this gets really annoying because there's no way to tell which expiry date corresponds to the credit card number that you filled in previously. Is there a way for Firefox to display the last 4 digits of the card number next to the expiry dates? </p><p>I've attached a screenshot to illustrate the issue. </p><p>Many thanks! </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",richardyusen

I have checked the communications tab under sound settings to verify that my system is to do nothing when i switch between applications, so i am assuming this is not the cause. are you aware of any issues like this happening? i cannot find answers on your website or forums </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",evanicox3
