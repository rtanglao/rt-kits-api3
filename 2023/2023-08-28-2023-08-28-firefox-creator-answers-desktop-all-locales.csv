I think it is associated with the fact that the New York Times ads are missing or haven't loaded on that iMac. On our other iMac, New York Times articles load fine and the ads are present. I've looked in the Firefox settings on both and can't find any significant differences differences that would create this problem. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",ed121

However, on other sites like osu's website, <a href=""http://chess.com"" rel=""nofollow"">chess.com</a>, duolingo, and others, there's no sound at all. I've tried refreshing, restarting, running in safe mode, and even reinstalling the browser but none of it has worked. My tabs are also not muted. Does anyone know how to fix this? </p>",desktop;beta;other;windows-10;firefox-1170;,firefox,other,en-US,"",maxmoulton150

If you have a few card numbers stored, this gets really annoying because there's no way to tell which expiry date corresponds to the credit card number that you filled in previously. Is there a way for Firefox to display the last 4 digits of the card number next to the expiry dates? </p><p>I've attached a screenshot to illustrate the issue. </p><p>Many thanks! </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",richardyusen

I have checked the communications tab under sound settings to verify that my system is to do nothing when i switch between applications, so i am assuming this is not the cause. are you aware of any issues like this happening? i cannot find answers on your website or forums </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",evanicox3
