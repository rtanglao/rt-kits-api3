I was watching amazon shows and movies until last night, started to get the message from Amazon, ""Video Unavailable- We're experiencing a problem playing this video, for assistance, etc..."" I pulled up Chrome and the movies are playing just fine there. I put FF in 'safe mode' and the video is playing, so what does this tell me? If I can play the movie in safe mode why not in regular mode? Keep in mind that I was watching other movies earlier in the day and nothing changed during the day, I didnt download anything new, just business as usual. So what do I do now if the vid plays in safe mode and not the regular mode? </p><p>Thanks very much for any help. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1013;firefox-1152;firefox-11521;,firefox,other,en-US,1605378;,sunnyskyez

If I use the touch keyboard on Firefox and then exit Firefox without without closing the touch keyboard, when I next start Firefox it only opens with a half view. if I close the touch keyboard first and then exit Firefox it opens as normal in a full screen view. it has nothing to do with either an extension or a theme. is there any way of ensuring that FF opens in full screen view if I forget to close the touch keyboard before exiting the browser? thanks in advance.
