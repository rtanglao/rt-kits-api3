It seems to only be on the digital advisor page, though. When viewing other accounts or sections, dark mode seems to work correctly. </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",cameron.carruth

But if I type a 2nd search into a website search bar, such as on <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a>, there is about a 12 second delay between me hitting enter and the page actually starting to load. The page freezes during this time and is unable to be interacted with. This issue does not happen in any other browsers outside of Firefox. </p><p>Things I've tried so far: Troubleshoot mode/safe mode, clearing cookies and cache, uninstalling and re-installing Firefox </p><p>Nothing has helped... wondering if this was caused by an update? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1170;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",skeletoast
