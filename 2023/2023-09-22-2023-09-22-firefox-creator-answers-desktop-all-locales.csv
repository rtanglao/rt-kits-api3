Purtroppo quando tento di accedere ad un sito che richiede la firma digitale per l'autenticazione parte la rotella del caricamento, ma non appare il popup con la richiesta di pin della smartcard e, pertanto, il caricamento prosegue all'infinito senza soluzione. E' un sito al quale accedo continuamente per lavoro, quindi fino a qualche giorno fa non ho mai avuto problemi. Il problema mi si è presentato dopo l'aggiornamento a MacOs Ventura 13.5.2 (potrebbe essere un caso). Altra cosa che ho notato è il mio macbook air che tenta in automatico un aggiornamento di Java, il cui tentativo prosegue all'infinito senza completarsi mai. Ho provato a farlo in manuale ma risulterebbe installata già la versione più recente. Fatto sta che al momento non mi viene richiesto più il pin della smartcard. Qualcuno può aiutarmi? Ho provato ad accedere allo stesso sito con Safari e non ho problemi. Grazie a chiunque potrà darmi un aiuto </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,fix-problems,it,1605425;,avvocatidipaolo
