If I use the touch keyboard on Firefox and then exit Firefox without without closing the touch keyboard, when I next start Firefox it only opens with a half view. if I close the touch keyboard first and then exit Firefox it opens as normal in a full screen view. it has nothing to do with either an extension or a theme. is there any way of ensuring that FF opens in full screen view if I forget to close the touch keyboard before exiting the browser? thanks in advance.

But if I type a 2nd search into a website search bar, such as on <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a>, there is about a 12 second delay between me hitting enter and the page actually starting to load. The page freezes during this time and is unable to be interacted with. This issue does not happen in any other browsers outside of Firefox. </p><p>Things I've tried so far: Troubleshoot mode/safe mode, clearing cookies and cache, uninstalling and re-installing Firefox </p><p>Nothing has helped... wondering if this was caused by an update? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1170;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",skeletoast
