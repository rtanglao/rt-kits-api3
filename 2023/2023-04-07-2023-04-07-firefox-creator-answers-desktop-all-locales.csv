I refreshed Firefox a couple times, issue came back. I isolated a duplicate font that may have been causing the problem. That was resolved but I now I've lost the Firefox color theme I had, which apparently isn't offered anymore, but more importantly my bookmarks are a mess. Some are duplicated, some are not in the folder where they originally were, and the bookmarks sidebar looks different. The bookmark setup looks correct in the Library window. Can I get that layout back somehow? I do have many bookmarks. </p><p>Thanks for the help. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",jostarla3
