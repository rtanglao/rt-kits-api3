How can I get that icon back on the address bar?

Bohužel je strašný bordelář a tak má otevřené minimálně desítky panelů v jednom okně. Krom toho, že to zpomaluje přohlížeč, tak to zpomaluje logicky i PC. Ale kvůli tomu nepíšu. Stává se jí, že když už nějaké okno zavře, po resetu/vypnutí-zapnutí PC se jí opětovně otevřou i ony již zavřené stránky. Tím pádem se z toho stává nekonečný kolotoč stránek, co zhoršují situaci. Je nějaké nastavení/plugin, které by tomuto zabránilo? Logicky ona nechce vše prostě zavřít a začít s čistým štítem, protože si chce každou jednotlivou stránku projít a pak buď uložit jako záložku nebo zavřít. Budu ráda za každou radu. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;,firefox,customize,cs,1574423;,sevcikova.magda
