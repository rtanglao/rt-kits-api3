If it is not a thing, this a suggestion that would be amazing to implement into the web-browser! </p><p>On my phone, when you scroll, it automatically hides the address bar and everything on it, to go 'full-screen'. I want this on my laptop. How can I make it, that when I scroll, or even just sit on a webpage for a moment, the URL bar will smoothly transition into being 'hidden'? </p><p>I want to be clear: I do NOT want to use the fullscreen, CTRL + F11 function, because then my Windows task bar is not accessible. Right now I have my taskbar hidden, which is fantastic because it gives my laptop screen a bigger feel. And if FireFox's URL could do the same... that would be beautiful. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1090;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",DJCactus

Too often (well more than I'd like) I've closed Firefox and when I come back (start up Firefox again) my previous Tabs are lost. And, there is no option to restore previous session, nor closed tabs. Firefox keeps history, why can't it keep a history of previous tabs. And, why does it frequently not provide: Restore previous session. It seems that keeping a history previous tabs for a period of time isn't that difficult. Please enlighten me. This has happened to me (losing the previous tabs) more than care to remember. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1090;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1560774;1560782;1560786;,robert.kunkle

Firefox isn't helping much because it uses too many processes and memory. i tried deleting some extensions, I tried using task manager to close separate processes but i always end closing the wrong one and closing firefox completely i tried going to dom.ipc.processCount and change the count to 1. I'm so confused, it's slowing down my games i play. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1090;,firefox,other,en-US,1560761;1560781;1560785;,collinsmarcus69
