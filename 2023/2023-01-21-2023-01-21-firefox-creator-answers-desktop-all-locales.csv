Quindi vorrei sapere se è un mio problema oppure avete eliminato voi la funzione, a mio avviso molto utile poter bloccare i  mittenti indesiderati. Attendo vostra risposta qualsiasi essa sia.

Firefox keeps history, why can't it keep a history of previous tabs. And, why does it frequently not provide: Restore previous session.
