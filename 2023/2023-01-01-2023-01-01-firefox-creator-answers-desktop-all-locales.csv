As such I'm trying to used to the new browser and set it up to my preferences. </p><p>So far I've had some problems, and I'd be thankful for any help I could get. </p><p>Firstly, when zoomed in using application menu, the scroll does not adjust the amount scrolled. For example, let's say the standard lines scrolled when i scroll with my mouse is 4. It's still 4 when zoomed in, as if I was still at 100%. This makes it scroll further down than needed, and to a person who likes to read, bothering. I presume there is an solution to this, as this doesn't happen on chrome for me. I tried checking out about:config and change mousewheel.default.delta_multiplier_y from 100 to somewhat lower.  </p><p>This made all scrolling way too slow, even if only slightly lowered. And the amount scrolled normally isn't the problem, the problem is the amount scrolled does not adjust when zoomed in, still scrolling as if I was on 100% zoom instead of 250% zoom. </p><p>Second question, is there a way to change the default zoom percentages. Instead of 100-110-120-150 ect... to 100-120-150-175-200-225-250 and so on.  </p><p>Thirdly does firefox automatically have tabs sleep when not in use to save ram.

On and off for the last two weeks tabs just keep crashing intermittently on Firefox and they only way to fix it is take a break and come back in an hour+.

I didn't realize this until i reinstalled some of my disabled addons. I was wondering if someone could go through with me an easy way to restore my history and addons? I did some searching beforehand, and I currently have 2 profiles, and for the more recently edited profile, there is a corrupted places file. I was wondering if someone could explain what I should be doing to be able to restore as much of my old history as possible? Thanks! I attached what the corrupted places file looks like, and what the disabled apps section looks like. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",opennn

Un paso totalmente inútil porque luego te la vuelve a pedir la aplicación de DNIe que es quien gestiona la autenticación realmente. Este paso estúpido no existe en Google Chrome. </p><p>Luego, en la pasarela de autenticación nacional te quedas esperando unos cuantos minutos hasta que sale el error de conexión fallida. Le das a recargar la página y sale el error SEC_ERROR_PKCS11_GENERAL_ERROR y ya es imposible hacer nada. </p><p>En otras pasarelas como las autonómicas a veces se queda totalmente colgado, otras veces se cierra por completo y otras veces consigues acceder (después de esperar un buen rato). </p><p>En Google Chrome introduzco la contraseña una sola vez y funciona en todas las pasarelas en cuestión de segundos. </p><p>Para colmo, no puedo contactar con Mozilla de ninguna manera para avisar de los errores y tengo que escribir aquí a ver si algun voluntario tiene algún primo que tenga un amigo que conozca a Richard Stallman para que pueda decirle a algún ingeniero (en el mal sentido) de Mozilla que hay toda una maldita colección de errores en una de las características más críticas de los navegadores, que es el uso del DNI electrónico para hacer cualquier cosa seria relacionada con las administraciones y servicios públicos. De manera que tengo que utilizar Firefox para los jueguecitos y las tonterías y para las cosas serias tengo que ir a Google Chrome. </p><p>Todos los navegadores son más o menos iguales con las mismas características, aspecto y rendimiento. De hecho son casi idénticos. No me extraña nada que Google Chrome haya terminado acaparando todo el mercado y derrotando de esta manera a Mozilla Firefox.
