I do not have an organization.  Mine is a personal computer for just my personal stuff.  I tried to find answers in previous posts and all I found were posts saying this was something done by Avast.  I do not use Avast.  I am an older user and don't understand much, so talk to me like you would if you were writing the Dummies books.  What is this thing and how do I get rid of it? It appeared another time long ago.  Later disappeared.  Have I been hacked?  Is someone else controlling my computer?  HELP1 I am running Windows 7 Home premium and not changing it.  My computer is an older Dell business machine. Its been pretty clean, not had any incidents. </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",shonatrill
