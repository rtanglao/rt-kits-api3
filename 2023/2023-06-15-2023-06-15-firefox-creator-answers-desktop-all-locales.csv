Due to a software update, I had to login and confirm the IMAP password of on particular email provider (<a href=""http://web.de"" rel=""nofollow"">web.de</a>). Somehow this failed (both in outlook and directly at the <a href=""http://web.de"" rel=""nofollow"">web.de</a> website via firefox), and I reset my password for this email. Firefox did not allow me to login directly into my mail on the <a href=""http://web.de"" rel=""nofollow"">web.de</a> website, whereas I succeeded to do so in Safari. I updated the new password in outlook, all good. I turned off enhanced tracking protection, cleared all cookies and history, restarted the computer and still cannot login to <a href=""http://web.de"" rel=""nofollow"">web.de</a> via firefox. Any ideas? </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;website-breakages;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",rbollongino

I am using the latest version of Mozilla. I seached the internet for solutions and tried many gfx.font_rendering settings in the config but no result. Changing Sandbox security settings do not help either. Unselecting ""Allow pages to choose their own fonts"" in the settings works but this is not my preferred solution because this way all websites are displayed in the same fonts. </p><p>The attached images are from website <a href=""https://onlinevideoconverter.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://onlinevideoconverter.com/</a> which is using the Raleway font. The image which is clearly readable if visited in Edge. The bad one is from Mozilla.
