Cleared cache, no addons are out of date or tamper with Youtube. Tried every fix I could find on the matter, nothing seems to have worked. Issue persists. I had similar issues with Kaspersky AV installed, so I had just uninstalled it. Prior to this newest firefox update, I have had no issues at all. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1585535;1585553;1585554;,kilsym
