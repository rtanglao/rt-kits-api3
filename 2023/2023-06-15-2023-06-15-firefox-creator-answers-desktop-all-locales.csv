When filling out forms I cannot use the mouse to tick boxes to designate my choices.

Yes, I would like to receive e-mails from those who are experiencing similar problems or have solutions to offer. </p><p>Trying to enter an address in the address bar triggers a big black rectangle, making it impossible for me to see what I am typing. To make matters worse, when I try to make a screenshot of the black rectangle, suddenly the problem vanishes as I drag the screenshot box into position. </p><p>I don't know whether this is some misguided initiative that Firefox has implemented in its latest version (114.0.1) or whether is is a power play by the other main browsers to challenge Firefox with a sudden shift of standards. The problems cropped up simultaneously on several different computers within the past week (Mid-June 2023). I have had trouble working under both Windows 10 and 11. </p><p>I like Firefox, but it is badly damaged in its present state and I fear I will have to shift temporarily to using other browsers until the problem can be fixed.

Whenever I attempt to install ANY add-on from the Firefox add-ons page, I get the message ""[Add-on name] could not be installed because Firefox could not modify the needed file"". Furthermore, attempting to download the add-on file manually (should it be available on a github page or the like) leads to the same message or a notification that the download failed. </p><p>As a matter of fact, downloading almost any kind of file on Firefox inevitably fails. The exact notification is shown in the upper-right corner of the browser window, where downloads are shown, and beneath the file in question is an indicator that says ""Failed"". Everything from .png to .zip to .exe appears in the downloads queue for a second, then fails. </p><p>I have tried every solution the Firefox add-on troubleshooting page has suggested, including solutions suggested in other threads, such as deleting/creating new profiles. I have also attempted to completely reinstall Firefox on multiple occasions, as well as the refresh Firefox option. </p><p>To recount, the following troubleshoot solutions did not work: </p><p>--Everything on the Firefox add-on troubleshooting page --Restart Firefox --Refresh Firefox --Create new Firefox profile and attempt to install add-ons from there --Delete and renew the extensions* files from the profile root folder --Modifying the xpinstall.signatures.required in about:config (true or false, doesn't matter) --Modifying the extensions.alwaysUnpack in about:config (again, true or false, doesn't matter) --Double-checking allow list and permissions on local firewall and antivirus software (the app is protected, add-ons are allowed) --Disabling antivirus software --Running Firefox as Administrator --Reinstall Firefox --Restarting PC </p><p>If I want to download a file or add an extension, I need to switch to a different browser such as a chromium-based one or Microsoft Edge to download the file. In the case of add-ons, I switch browsers, download the file, and select the ""install add-on from file"" option under ""manage extensions"" in about:addons. </p><p>One final thing. It seems that sometimes streaming sites won't work on Firefox (even with ad-blocker disabled or the site allowed through the ad-blocker), and sometimes video won't properly load either. These things work fine on other browsers. </p><p>I really like Firefox as a browser and enjoy the privacy it provides built-in. I didn't have any of these issues up until last year and I was forced to switch over. I would really appreciate any help with this. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",BecauseLogic

Firefox did not allow me to login directly into my mail on the <a href=""http://web.de"" rel=""nofollow"">web.de</a> website, whereas I succeeded to do so in Safari. I updated the new password in outlook, all good. I turned off enhanced tracking protection, cleared all cookies and history, restarted the computer and still cannot login to <a href=""http://web.de"" rel=""nofollow"">web.de</a> via firefox. Any ideas? </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;website-breakages;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",rbollongino
