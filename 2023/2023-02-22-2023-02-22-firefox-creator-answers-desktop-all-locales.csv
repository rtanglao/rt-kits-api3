Right after turning on the computer (Windows 10), if I try to start Firefox (or other browsers based on it), I get a message saying ""Firefox is already running, but is not responding. The old Firefox process must be closed to open a new window.""  Of course, since I just started the computer, no old process is running.  I've looked in Resource Monitor and Task Manager to be sure. If I click on ""Close Firefox"" I just get the same message again. I installed the latest version of Firefox. I deleted one of the other browsers and reinstalled it.  I've tried doing a clean boot. Nothing helps.  Meanwhile, I can still open browsers not based on Mozilla. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",cliffordblau

I lost all my bookmarks and settings when that happened. I was able to recover most the bookmarks from the another browser option. Thank god! But now when I access my bookmarks from the menu tab, my bookmarks don't' appear any longer?  The list that used to appear no longer appears? What appears when I access my bookmark tab is a small box that says Manage Bookmarks, Edit Bookmarks, Bookmark Toolbar, Other Bookmarks and Mozilla Firefox.  How do I get back my bookmark list that I used to have and my bookmarks in the order they were???? I have many bookmarks so my bookmarks are important! Can someone please explain how I get back my bookmark list that I had before I made the change? Thank you. </p>",windows-7;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-1100;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",sciencemagic

My scroll wheel on my mouse stopped working. Only way to scroll is to press Ctrl+Shift and then use scroll wheel, which makes it work fine. But i would prefer to not have to press down Ctrl+Shift to scroll. This problem is only happening on Firefox and no other browser or program on my computer. Do you know any solutions? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1566892;,zuribeo8050

I used Google Authenticator for 2FA, reset the phone, found out GA doesn't back 2FA accounts up remotely. That was a few years ago; I gave up and went back to Chrome. Trying again to regain access to my FF account now, if possible. I don't have the backup codes, but I do have the 32 character recovery code, but I'm getting this error (screenshot) trying to use it. I tried the key with spaces (8 4-character blocks) and without, got the error both times. What am I doing wrong here? </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;,firefox,sync,en-US,1566901;,cloudmobileusa
