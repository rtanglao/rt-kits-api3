When I try to open them, they instantly close. The browser that I'm currently able to use is Microsoft Edge. After this didn't work, I checked for Windows updates, and had some queued. After restarting and applying the updates, the issue persisted. Although it might be worth to mention that after a few moments from restarting my laptop, they both worked fine. But given like ten-ish seconds, they both started to crash again. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1566922;,i.masterofskills

I am logged into the site correctly. I have disabled all of the Firefox extensions, used the troubleshooter, cleared the cache and cookies, and refreshed Firefox yet nothing seems to work. I also opened the site in private browser mode. Everything worked on the home page, but when I tried to view a specific page (in this case the crosswords, of all things), the problem continued. I've clicked on the little padlock for the WP home page and on the ""connection not secure"" page and both say there is no security problem. What is going on? How can I fix this?

Right after turning on the computer (Windows 10), if I try to start Firefox (or other browsers based on it), I get a message saying ""Firefox is already running, but is not responding. The old Firefox process must be closed to open a new window.""  Of course, since I just started the computer, no old process is running.  I've looked in Resource Monitor and Task Manager to be sure. If I click on ""Close Firefox"" I just get the same message again. I installed the latest version of Firefox. I deleted one of the other browsers and reinstalled it.  I've tried doing a clean boot. Nothing helps.  Meanwhile, I can still open browsers not based on Mozilla. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1566930;,cliffordblau
