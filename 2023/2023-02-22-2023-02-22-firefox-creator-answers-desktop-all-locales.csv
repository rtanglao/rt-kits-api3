Since the update my saved logins keep getting dropped, and each time I want to use several sites (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc) I have to login again.  I have just turned off enhanced tracking for some of these sites, but this is annoying.  Can I revert to the older version of Firefox?  If not I may change browsers.  I wish I had know you messed with security setting before I updated the browser.  </p><p>Thanks Tom </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1100;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",tbmaher2018

When I try to open them, they instantly close. The browser that I'm currently able to use is Microsoft Edge. After this didn't work, I checked for Windows updates, and had some queued. After restarting and applying the updates, the issue persisted. Although it might be worth to mention that after a few moments from restarting my laptop, they both worked fine. But given like ten-ish seconds, they both started to crash again. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1566922;,i.masterofskills

I've clicked on the little padlock for the WP home page and on the ""connection not secure"" page and both say there is no security problem. What is going on? How can I fix this?

Right after turning on the computer (Windows 10), if I try to start Firefox (or other browsers based on it), I get a message saying ""Firefox is already running, but is not responding. The old Firefox process must be closed to open a new window.""  Of course, since I just started the computer, no old process is running.  I've looked in Resource Monitor and Task Manager to be sure. If I click on ""Close Firefox"" I just get the same message again. I installed the latest version of Firefox. I deleted one of the other browsers and reinstalled it.  I've tried doing a clean boot. Nothing helps.  Meanwhile, I can still open browsers not based on Mozilla. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1566930;1566985;,cliffordblau
