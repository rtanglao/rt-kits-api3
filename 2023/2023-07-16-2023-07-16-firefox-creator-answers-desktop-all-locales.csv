I don't care for it but I don't want to permanently remove it either. I have tried going to the address bar and entering [about:config} and turning several [extension.pocket.xxxx] to [UNTRUE]. It made no difference. </p><p>Also, the 8 favorite boxes above POCKET, can they be locked so the favorites don't change UNLESS I want to change them myself? </p><p>Respectfully, </p><p>Walter J Baxter Jr </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,other,en-US,1590837;,wb7usv

1418465,2023-07-15 18:48:22 -0700,2023-07-15 20:17:03 -0700,File download always fails,"<p>No matter what type, size or source of file I try to download, the download invariably fails withn 30 seconds of starting. Once it fails, retrying the download gets me another piece of the file until the download fails again. To get the file to completion, I have to retry numerous times until it gets to the end. If I have multiple files downloading simulteneouly, that requires dedicated man-management to ensure all of them are fully saved. </p><p>Having to accompany any download like that is highly annoying and takes time and attenition away performing other tasks in my browsing session. On the same Windows 10 PC, I do not encounter similar issues using other browsers to try to download the same file - it's a one-click, fire-ans-forget process there. I even recently reset my Windows installation and then reinstalled a fresh copy of Firefox (my favourite browser to use) but this annoying issue persists. </p><p>Can anyone help? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1590815;,Scotty.Ranking
