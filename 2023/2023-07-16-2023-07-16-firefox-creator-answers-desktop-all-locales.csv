I am easily overwhelmed by information and am slow to understand - especially anything to do with I.T. </p><p>Recently, I began successfully accessing the internet / Firefox via my Wifi Repeater.  As of two or three days ago. I keep being asked to ""log in to access the Internet"", but even after I do it (successfully, as far as my repeater is concerned) I'm no further forward; I keep being asked to log in. </p><p>Thanks to my repeater I have a strong signal when in my garden office. But after a month, Firefox has suddenly stopped allowing me to use it.  I am back at Square 1, before I purchased the thing. </p><p>I need need to work from my office.  Please help resume  my Repeater's access. </p><p>Kind regards, </p><p>Sean </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",seanhindle4

It made no difference. </p><p>Also, the 8 favorite boxes above POCKET, can they be locked so the favorites don't change UNLESS I want to change them myself? </p><p>Respectfully, </p><p>Walter J Baxter Jr </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,other,en-US,1590837;1590839;,wb7usv

Once it fails, retrying the download gets me another piece of the file until the download fails again. To get the file to completion, I have to retry numerous times until it gets to the end. If I have multiple files downloading simulteneouly, that requires dedicated man-management to ensure all of them are fully saved. </p><p>Having to accompany any download like that is highly annoying and takes time and attenition away performing other tasks in my browsing session. On the same Windows 10 PC, I do not encounter similar issues using other browsers to try to download the same file - it's a one-click, fire-ans-forget process there. I even recently reset my Windows installation and then reinstalled a fresh copy of Firefox (my favourite browser to use) but this annoying issue persists. </p><p>Can anyone help? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1590815;,Scotty.Ranking
