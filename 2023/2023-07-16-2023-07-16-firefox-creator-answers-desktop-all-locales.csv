Since an update a while back, though, that seems to have been replaced with autofilling whatever the most popular search is. I used to be able to just hit p and go automatically to a site I frequently visit, but now it automatically sends me to pinterest. I don't have pinterest. I don't want or like pinterest. I filter pinterest out of my searches. There's absolutely no reason for my search bar to be autofilling to pinterest. I've already got sponsored suggestions disabled so it's not that.  </p><p>I'm getting really tired of accidentally going to pinterest due to muscle memory (and, presumably, reinforcing that suggestion by accident). Haven't been able to find a setting that turns it off. Would really, really like to. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1013;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",patchtheincinerator
