Once it fails, retrying the download gets me another piece of the file until the download fails again. To get the file to completion, I have to retry numerous times until it gets to the end. If I have multiple files downloading simulteneouly, that requires dedicated man-management to ensure all of them are fully saved. </p><p>Having to accompany any download like that is highly annoying and takes time and attenition away performing other tasks in my browsing session. On the same Windows 10 PC, I do not encounter similar issues using other browsers to try to download the same file - it's a one-click, fire-ans-forget process there. I even recently reset my Windows installation and then reinstalled a fresh copy of Firefox (my favourite browser to use) but this annoying issue persists. </p><p>Can anyone help? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Scotty.Ranking
