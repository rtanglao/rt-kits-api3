I checked Windows Task Master and 10 instances of firefox were open (I was only using one tab) and they were using 68% of my CPU and 90% of my available memory, basically locking up my computer.  I tried closing it and reopening it, but the same thing happened.  I had to go to another browser.  I remember this happening in the past, and I had to move to another browser permanently.  I would much rather stay with Firefox if you can prevent this from happening. </p><p>thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1140;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1584624;,kcourcey1
