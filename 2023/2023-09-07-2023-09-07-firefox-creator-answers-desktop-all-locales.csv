I've tried to reinstall, Firefox. I've also tried removing extensions, as that's where I think the problem might be coming from. But it didn't seem to solve anything. I've also gone into about:config and set blockautorefresh to true, but this didn't help either. I went into about:performance and extracted one of the profile performances for the Firefox system. Furthermore, I am not knowledgeable about Firefox and/or web development and the services to understand and isolate the problem causing this issue. I'm running on macOS, and I've only recently switched to Firefox, as I used to run Arc as my primary browser. Has anyone had any similar issues with this and are there any fixes that might work to prevent this from happening? It severely impacts my work as I'm not able to use Firefox until I restart it, and that would be happening every 10–15 minutes. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1602171;,miguet122
1423226,2023-09-06 20:07:42 -0700,2023-09-06 20:07:42 -0700,File associations are stuck on arch Linux,"<p>When you download and click on a file without the program to use it installed, the KDE portal opens up, and the only option is to go to the discover store to get the required program since you dont have anything else that's usable. However, the new program does not show up in this window, and the window to choose the associated program cannot be closed. </p><p>So, to get it to go away, I chose to associate .pptx with the dolphin browser temporarily so I could choose the correct program afterwards. After going into the firefox settings (General&gt;applications) and setting the powerpoint files to open with ONLYOFFICE, it still ignores my changes and opens up the dolphin browser every time. I set the normal linux file association to ONLYOFFICE, so clicking on the file outside of firefox opens the correct program. I tried uninstalling firefox and deleting ""all"" associated files through the discover store, and still had the same problem upon reinstalling. I can clearly see there are some remaining Mozilla files on my drive despite the fact I said to delete all of the associated files, but for some reason I do not have permission to delete them, no matter what I try.  </p><p>When downloading and clicking a .pptx file through chromium, the correct application loads right away, so this is clearly a problem with only firefox not updating its file associations despite me repeatedly trying to do so through the system settings. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1170;,firefox,other,en-US,"",nagrfi
1423225,2023-09-06 19:48:33 -0700,2023-09-06 19:48:33 -0700,Firefox constantly reloading all tabs?,"<p>Hiya. I usually have a fairly large number of tabs open on the browser. I use the <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/panorama-view/"" rel=""nofollow"">Panorama View</a> add-on for tab management. Usually this means that on any given container I have about 10-20 tabs open for a total of some 300 odd tabs. The nice thing is that Firefox doesn't usually load all my tabs so this works out for me. Recently however something weird's been going on and Firefox just refreshed ALL my tabs across all the containers. This kills my performance completely, especially given a fair number of tabs are just random youtube links. When all my tabs are open Firefox eats up like 25 GB of RAM, which is understandably not great. </p><p>I tried refreshing Firefox to no avail. Is there any way to stop this constant loading of all tabs? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1170;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",akashsara
