The sound works without problem on chrome with the same streaming services. Also, the sound works without problem with all other apps. Just not firefox...after one second.

Without a mobile phone, using the Firefox browser on a computer or laptop?","<p>Okay, I give up.  So, Facebook is or has implemented this Turn on two-factor authentication or whatever it is.  What this means for me at the moment is that I am unable to access my Facebook account as it is now forcing me to use this Two-factor authentication thingie, despite that I do not have a mobile phone. (yes, I know it's unusual in this day of age not to have one. I did have one at one time, but for the moment I have no interest in getting another one).  I would rather use my laptop anyway.   </p><p>Doesn't Firefox have a Two-factor Authentication thing that I can use with Facebook? Without a mobile phone using the Firefox browser on a computer or laptop? </p><p>Now, from what I can see, Facebook is offering 3 ways of doing this. #1) Authentication app, like Google Authenticator or Duo Mobile.  #2) Text message (SMS).  #3) Security Key.  So, because I do not use or have a mobile phone, I was guessing that my option would only be #1 Authentication app, like Google Authenticator ... which I have never used before, and while reading up on it, I keep reading that I can only use it with the Google Chrome browser?!?  If that wasn't bad enough, I typically use Microsoft Outlook, not Gmail.  So, I am at a loss at this point.   </p><p>Again, I do not have a mobile phone.  Doesn't Firefox have a Two-factor Authentication thing that I can use with Facebook? Without a mobile phone using the Firefox browser on a computer or laptop?  </p><p>Help please. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1090;firefox-10901;,firefox,other,en-US,1564166;1564167;1564170;1564181;,Teagan
