Currently I am using Firefox Sync to sync my bookmarks between an andriod, Linux laptop and Linux desktop. At times I have difficulty relocating a bookmark to a given position on my desktop or laptop, but my biggest problem centers around bookmarks that I relocate in a different place in the ""Unsorted"" folder or to a different folder not always appearing in the new position on the other machines. In an attempt to troubleshoot this further I went to my Linux desktop, signed out of FF sync, backed up my 2000+ bookmarks, exported my bookmarks (both to local directories), exited firefox and then renamed the places.sqlite. When I then attempted to restore from json file and when I input bookmarks from the html file I saw all my bookmark directories recreated but all my files were dumped into the ""Unsorted Bookmarks"" folder. I finally had to put the places.sqlite file back in place in order to continue working, however, my original problems remains. When I attempt to verify the places database I get the following, but clearly something is out of whack. How best can I create a cleaner bookmarks database? </p><p><br> &gt; Task: checkIntegrity + The places.sqlite database is sane + The favicons.sqlite database is sane &gt; Task: invalidateCaches + The caches have been invalidated &gt; Task: checkCoherence + The database is coherent &gt; Task: expire + Database cleaned up &gt; Task: originFrecencyStats + Recalculated origin frecency stats &gt; Task: vacuum + Initial database size is 5120KiB + The database has been vacuumed + Final database size is 5120KiB &gt; Task: stats + Places.sqlite size is 5120KiB + Favicons.sqlite size is 13600KiB + pragma_user_version is 69 + pragma_page_size is 32768 + pragma_cache_size is -2048 + pragma_journal_mode is wal + pragma_synchronous is 1 + History can store a maximum of 74615 unique pages + Table moz_origins has 1722 records + Table moz_places has 4244 records + Table moz_historyvisits has 4542 records + Table moz_inputhistory has 3 records + Table moz_bookmarks has 2039 records + Table moz_bookmarks_deleted has 0 records + Table moz_keywords has 0 records + Table sqlite_sequence has 1 records + Table moz_anno_attributes has 2 records + Table moz_annos has 6 records + Table moz_items_annos has 0 records + Table moz_meta has 6 records + Table moz_places_metadata has 0 records + Table moz_places_metadata_search_queries has 0 records + Table moz_places_metadata_snapshots has 0 records + Table moz_places_metadata_snapshots_extra has 0 records + Table moz_places_metadata_snapshots_groups has 0 records + Table moz_places_metadata_groups_to_snapshots has 0 records + Table moz_session_metadata has 0 records + Table moz_session_to_places has 0 records + Table moz_previews_tombstones has 0 records + Table sqlite_stat1 has 16 records + Pages sequentiality: 60.3 + sqlite_schema: 32KiB (0.8%), 30.4% eff. + moz_inputhistory: 32KiB (0.8%), 0.3% eff. + sqlite_autoindex_moz_inputhistory_1: 32KiB (0.8%), 0.2% eff. + moz_bookmarks_deleted: 32KiB (0.8%), 0% eff. + sqlite_autoindex_moz_bookmarks_deleted_1: 32KiB (0.8%), 0% eff. + moz_keywords: 32KiB (0.8%), 0% eff. + sqlite_autoindex_moz_keywords_1: 32KiB (0.8%), 0% eff. + sqlite_sequence: 32KiB (0.8%), 0.1% eff. + moz_anno_attributes: 32KiB (0.8%), 0.2% eff. + sqlite_autoindex_moz_anno_attributes_1: 32KiB (0.8%), 0.2% eff. + moz_annos: 32KiB (0.8%), 1.8% eff. + moz_items_annos: 32KiB (0.8%), 0% eff. + moz_meta: 32KiB (0.8%), 1% eff. + moz_places_metadata: 32KiB (0.8%), 0% eff. + moz_places_metadata_search_queries: 32KiB (0.8%), 0% eff. + sqlite_autoindex_moz_places_metadata_search_queries_1: 32KiB (0.8%), 0% eff. + moz_places_metadata_snapshots: 32KiB (0.8%), 0% eff. + moz_places_metadata_snapshots_extra: 32KiB (0.8%), 0% eff. + moz_places_metadata_snapshots_groups: 32KiB (0.8%), 0% eff. + moz_places_metadata_groups_to_snapshots: 32KiB (0.8%), 0% eff. + moz_session_metadata: 32KiB (0.8%), 0% eff. + sqlite_autoindex_moz_session_metadata_1: 32KiB (0.8%), 0% eff. + moz_session_to_places: 32KiB (0.8%), 0% eff. + moz_previews_tombstones: 32KiB (0.8%), 0% eff. + sqlite_stat1: 32KiB (0.8%), 2.7% eff. + moz_bookmarks_itemindex: 32KiB (0.8%), 67.7% eff. + moz_bookmarks_parentindex: 32KiB (0.8%), 73.6% eff. + moz_bookmarks_dateaddedindex: 32KiB (0.8%), 99.5% eff. + moz_keywords_placepostdata_uniqueindex: 32KiB (0.8%), 0% eff. + moz_annos_placeattributeindex: 32KiB (0.8%), 0.2% eff. + moz_items_annos_itemattributeindex: 32KiB (0.8%), 0% eff. + moz_places_metadata_placecreated_uniqueindex: 32KiB (0.8%), 0% eff. + moz_places_metadata_referrerindex: 32KiB (0.8%), 0% eff. + moz_places_metadata_snapshots_pinnedindex: 32KiB (0.8%), 0% eff. + moz_places_metadata_snapshots_extra_typeindex: 32KiB (0.8%), 0% eff. + moz_origins: 96KiB (2.3%), 63.8% eff. + sqlite_autoindex_moz_origins_1: 96KiB (2.3%), 59.5% eff. + moz_places_url_hashindex: 96KiB (2.3%), 60.4% eff. + moz_places_visitcount: 96KiB (2.3%), 34.7% eff. + moz_places_frecencyindex: 96KiB (2.3%), 40% eff. + moz_places_originidindex: 96KiB (2.3%), 42.2% eff. + moz_historyvisits_fromindex: 96KiB (2.3%), 41.3% eff. + moz_bookmarks_itemlastmodifiedindex: 96KiB (2.3%), 39.1% eff. + moz_bookmarks_guid_uniqueindex: 96KiB (2.3%), 41.5% eff. + moz_places_lastvisitdateindex: 128KiB (3%), 51.3% eff. + moz_places_guid_uniqueindex: 128KiB (3%), 64.7% eff. + moz_historyvisits_placedateindex: 128KiB (3%), 65.7% eff. + moz_historyvisits_dateindex: 128KiB (3%), 55.4% eff. + moz_historyvisits: 160KiB (3.8%), 71.4% eff. + moz_places_hostindex: 160KiB (3.8%), 66.4% eff. + moz_bookmarks: 256KiB (6.1%), 81% eff. + moz_places: 1152KiB (27.3%), 96.1% eff. &gt; Task: _refreshUI </p><p><br> So, any ideas how I can move forward and get my bookmarks working between between all my machines? </p><p>Thanks very much for your time, John C </p>",linux;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-1090;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",thehikingfool

I'm beginning to regret it but just to keep it going for a couple of years I offered to update to Mint 20 Xfce, which is the last version listing 1 Gb as the minimum Ram (everything later or other version are 2 Gb or more), which is the most that system can use. Once the wifi was eventually working (old b43 broadcom driver) most things went fine (except Team Viewer, which works on another Mint 20 Xfce system, but that's not a question for here). However, she uses Yahoo mail, and for some reason just attempting to load the login page (<a href=""http://login.yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">login.yahoo.com</a>) causes Firefox to crash (I mentioned Thunderbird in the title as I attempted to access Yahoo Mail with it, but because it needs to access the Yahoo Mail page (as I think this is now based on App codes rather than passwords), and doing that crashed Thunderbird also). I'm pretty sure I have methodically gone through all the troubleshooting steps on <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-and-diagnose-firefox-problems"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-and-diagnose-firefox-problems</a> (clear cookies &amp; cache by deleting history; clear startup cache; refresh; reinstall; new profile). Firefox doesn't crash in Troubleshoot mode, despite the fact is seems to still use hardware acceleration, even though I thought it would disable that. Hence, I'm at the end of what I know to try (and that's just from following the guide, I am not an expert) and would be grateful for any help anyone can offer. I attach an image that lists all the submitted crash reports, as they will refer to slightly different conditions as I tried all the options mentioned above. I'm using my own PC to submit this (so any hardware &amp; system data submitted by this web-form won't be relevant), not the Inspiron 1501 that has the issue. I can open the Yahoo mail page on this machine (same version of Firefox) and also on the Inspiron 1501 using Chrome (but there was a different reason relating to security why we couldn't log in via that). Would really like to get Firefox (and Thunderbird) working on the laptop, if possible. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1090;firefox-10901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1564302;,jacterry40
