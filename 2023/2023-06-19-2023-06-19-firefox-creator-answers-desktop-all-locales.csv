I just came back ready to finish up some stuff and all, but whenever I open any page it shows (translated to english) - ""Oh - this card has crashed"". Under that there is a text, along with three buttons, that translates to: </p><p>We can help! Use the ""Restore Tab"" or ""Restore All Tabs"" button to reload the page or pages. ""Close tab""   ""restore tab""   ""restore all tabs"" </p><p>but whenever i click restore, it just loads for a few seconds and goes back to the crash error. It's seriously annoying and the whole thing is running slowly. How can I fix that up? (firefox is the only app with the problem, i run a virus/ comp cleaner twice and it showed nothing) Sorry for any spelling mistakes!
