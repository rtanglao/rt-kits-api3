When I click them, nothing happens, that I'm aware of, at least. </p><p>If I login to the same website using Safari (it's the only other browser installed), clicking on the link opens a preview of the PDF document on the open webpage (it doesn't open a new tab or window), but it's this that doesn't seem to be working in Firefox.  However, if I click on the link and then the Download PDF link, the correct document downloads as expected, just no preview. </p><p>Is there a Firefox setting that could help with this, or is it more a compatibility issue in the website's design? </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Nightowl999
