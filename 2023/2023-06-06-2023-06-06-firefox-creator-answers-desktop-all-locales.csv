This isn't a browser problem, because the other tabs I have open work perfectly fine, but FB takes forever to load, and any button I press to interact with it, (like the reload button,) also lags, (but, again, works fine on other tabs,).  It doesn't even register links as being clickable for a good minute after loading.  The page also seems to reset every time I switch from another tab to it, showing a blank page with a loading symbol.  I have tried deleting the entire history, and restarting the browser, and deactivating the adblocker, (the only extension active) and nothing seems to help.  Does anybody know why it's doing this, (other than because the company follows the 'if it isn't broke, break it' theory, which we all already knew,) and how to fix it? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1584259;,Khat
