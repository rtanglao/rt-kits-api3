I have my chosen tabs all pinned and I even have them saved as bookmarks that I've synced that I can load up in Chrome. However, when I go to the three horizontal lines button and clicking on my account name/email address, it's showing me tabs that are synced to one of my other devices (in this case, my laptop), but the tabs aren't quite right. There's a couple that are old now that I want removed. The double arrows showing me more extensions/options comes up with Synced Tabs, but they're also showing the same incorrect ones. Even when it synchronizes, it never changes anything. </p><p>What's the correct way of changing/removing tabs in Firefox and then syncing them? </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",DustyShinigami
