I had to do something, because your instructions on for instance Bookmarks suggest I click on the Toolbar button, but my version has not got one. Also I had to Download something called Filelink so I could send a Video by Email. Accept I can't find the link called ""Preferences"" that is in your instructions to make it work. Is your instruction schematics up to date or do I have to download another version or do I have to personalize my Website. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,other,en-US,"",gregaryus
