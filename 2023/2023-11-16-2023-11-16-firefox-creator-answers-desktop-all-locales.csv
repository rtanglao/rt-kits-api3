Of course this is rejected by 99.999% of the forms on the web making this part of the autofill useless. So I go to edit it by removing the +1 and save. It appears to save fine but when I look at it the +1 is back again.  </p><p>Why the stupidity and and why not let me edit it to whatever I want? </p>,desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",whatatay

I had to do something, because your instructions on for instance Bookmarks suggest I click on the Toolbar button, but my version has not got one. Also I had to Download something called Filelink so I could send a Video by Email. Accept I can't find the link called ""Preferences"" that is in your instructions to make it work. Is your instruction schematics up to date or do I have to download another version or do I have to personalize my Website. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,other,en-US,"",gregaryus
