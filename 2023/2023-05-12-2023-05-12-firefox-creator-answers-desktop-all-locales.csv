I tried refreshing Firefox, which was a challenge because of the problem of hanging in memory after closing, but it did not resolve the problem. I also tried uninstalling it, then deleting the Mozilla folders and clearing out any references to Firefox in the Windows registry, and reinstalling it. I haven't installed any extensions yet; but sadly, I continue to encounter the problem. Any ideas about how to resolve the problem? </p><p>I should mention that I had bought a new SSD for my computer and migrated everything over from the old SSD to the new one.
