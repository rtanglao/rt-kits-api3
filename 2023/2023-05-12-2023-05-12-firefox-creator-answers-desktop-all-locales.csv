After I close Firefox, the Windows Task Manager shows it still in memory. After a couple of minutes, the Mozilla Crash Reporter screen pops up informing me that Firefox had a problem and crashed, with an option to restart Firefox or Quit. I tried refreshing Firefox, which was a challenge because of the problem of hanging in memory after closing, but it did not resolve the problem. I also tried uninstalling it, then deleting the Mozilla folders and clearing out any references to Firefox in the Windows registry, and reinstalling it. I haven't installed any extensions yet; but sadly, I continue to encounter the problem. Any ideas about how to resolve the problem? </p><p>I should mention that I had bought a new SSD for my computer and migrated everything over from the old SSD to the new one. The problem with Firefox began after the migration. Everything else that was installed there works without a problem. I would be surprised if this is related to the issue considering I've reinstall Firefox. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1580077;,itzallan2

When I attempt to stream movies I OWN via Vudu or Youtube, it tells me that DRM features are not active when they very much are. I checked my settings and DRM content is enabled. I have also run into the same issue with Netflix as well. I cleared out my browser cache, which did not help. I disabled and re-enabed the DRM options. This did not help either. I restarted my computer multiple times and this did not help either.  </p><p>Firefox says it is installing the features needed to watch the content but it never does, or rather, it doesn't show any progress.

My Windows compatibility checker has found incompatibility of the application/browser and malicious. I am running Windows 11 and did not have this problem until 4 days ago. A lot of my sites are requesting to reset passwords and/or never were available.  So far my installed security has not found a problem, nor will the Firefox browser allow it to add it as an extension to protect, but reads is is installed but it is not. Some sites shows other avatars or owners of my accounts, as if I have been hacked. </p><p>Please advise. When I open the browser as the Administrator,  it appears like a totally different account than the one I have been working with daily. I initially  registered the account with a password and it is not accepting it for me to start all over, using google to log in. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1130;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1580078;,dve.ventures2
