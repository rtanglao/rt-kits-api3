My Windows compatibility checker has found incompatibility of the application/browser and malicious. I am running Windows 11 and did not have this problem until 4 days ago. A lot of my sites are requesting to reset passwords and/or never were available.  So far my installed security has not found a problem, nor will the Firefox browser allow it to add it as an extension to protect, but reads is is installed but it is not. Some sites shows other avatars or owners of my accounts, as if I have been hacked. </p><p>Please advise. When I open the browser as the Administrator,  it appears like a totally different account than the one I have been working with daily. I initially  registered the account with a password and it is not accepting it for me to start all over, using google to log in. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1130;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",dve.ventures2
