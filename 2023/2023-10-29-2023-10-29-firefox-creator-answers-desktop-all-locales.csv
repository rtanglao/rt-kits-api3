All open tabs NOW disappear after power failure or Comcast temporarily loses service or I restart my computer.  This never happened to me before ~ if my computer was affected by outage or I manually restarted it a message came up to click on asking if I wanted my tabs restored.  1 click and they were restored ~ that option is not available to me now.  It's frustrating and time consuming for me to ""look"" for, and ""try"" to find those tabs I had open.  If someone does respond to my question I won't know its been done unless I receive an email because I'm not certain I can find my way back to this support page, primarily because I cannot remember HOW I even found this page in the first place!  I bookmarked this page so perhaps I will be able to return to it.  Thanks for the ""How to restore tabs"" help I HOPE you can give me.

I tried every password i commonly used and none of them worked, so I think that this one was auto-generated and then saved, in my firefox account... What is really killing me is the 7 years of bookmarks and password that are locked behind this password, i can access the account by password recovery but that would defeat the purpose since I just learned that its linked to my data. I just changed my OS back to windows so file recuperation is gonna be a pain/impossible. The way i understand things i have to make my peace with all the websites I accumulated for years (and also the PWs) or wait and don't touch my PC because the firefox folder that was deleted was on the same HDD that i used for the new OS. Of course all of this wouldn't be a problem if I didn't have had a problem to my phone and send it back to the constructor for the warranty, which means if I'm not mistaken that my account just lost it's last link to me, except the auto-destruction button. Is starting to learn cryptography my best bet to reach my account&nbsp;? Or is there something I didn't cover and there still a way&nbsp;?
