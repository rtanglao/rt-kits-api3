The first time I started Firefox I entered them and everything worked, but the second time I started it the proxy stopped working. When I close the browser, a window asking for login and password opens. If I enter my username and password again, nothing changes. So, when I close the browser, the window that should appear at the beginning appears.

I tried every password i commonly used and none of them worked, so I think that this one was auto-generated and then saved, in my firefox account... What is really killing me is the 7 years of bookmarks and password that are locked behind this password, i can access the account by password recovery but that would defeat the purpose since I just learned that its linked to my data. I just changed my OS back to windows so file recuperation is gonna be a pain/impossible. The way i understand things i have to make my peace with all the websites I accumulated for years (and also the PWs) or wait and don't touch my PC because the firefox folder that was deleted was on the same HDD that i used for the new OS. Of course all of this wouldn't be a problem if I didn't have had a problem to my phone and send it back to the constructor for the warranty, which means if I'm not mistaken that my account just lost it's last link to me, except the auto-destruction button. Is starting to learn cryptography my best bet to reach my account&nbsp;? Or is there something I didn't cover and there still a way&nbsp;?
