Sometimes, when I browse the web, the text on some websites appears glitchy and distorted. Some letters are missing and some colors are wrong. I tried refreshing Firefox and it fixed the problem once, but then it came back. I also tried restarting my computer, clearing my cookies and cache, restarting Firefox in Troubleshoot Mode, updating my graphics driver, and disabling hardware acceleration. None of these worked. I’m using the default theme and I don’t have any extensions enabled. Does anyone know what might be causing this problem and how to fix it?
