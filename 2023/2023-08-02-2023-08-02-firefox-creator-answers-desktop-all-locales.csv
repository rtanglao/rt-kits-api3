As I am transferring from a Windows/Chrome environment, there is a lot of setting up to do. Firefox transferred most of the chrome info for me, and so I was able to get up and running with bookmarks and logins quite quickly. However, there is one problem that I can't seem to resolve. </p><p>I have been able to set up my credit card details, and these are prompted when needed, BUT, Firefox will not remember my name, email,  phone or address. Thus for every form that I have to fill, I have to enter these details, again and again (and again). </p><p>I have looked at settings and see that the 'Autofill Address' option is not present (see attachment). </p><p>I have followed and implemented the fix proposed elsewhere, to update/add GB as an address format. This has not made a difference. </p><p>Can anyone please help. </p><p>Regards, </p><p>Mark </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",mark_holtom

Sometimes, when I browse the web, the text on some websites appears glitchy and distorted. Some letters are missing and some colors are wrong. I tried refreshing Firefox and it fixed the problem once, but then it came back. I also tried restarting my computer, clearing my cookies and cache, restarting Firefox in Troubleshoot Mode, updating my graphics driver, and disabling hardware acceleration. None of these worked. I’m using the default theme and I don’t have any extensions enabled. Does anyone know what might be causing this problem and how to fix it? Thanks in advance. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1160;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1594464;,takagomez15
