Sometimes after it hangs it will allow me to scroll again but most of the times it closes itself automatically like it crashed but doesn't give me a prompt or ask me to send a report.  I've turned off hardware acceleration but it still does it even with it off.  It also only happens in Firefox and is more frequent when scrolling sites like Facebook. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1150;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Licentia
