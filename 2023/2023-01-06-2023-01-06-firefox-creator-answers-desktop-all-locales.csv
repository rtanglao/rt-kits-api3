I don't know what <em>artifact</em> command does, but I think it's not it. Is there any command that can produce .deb file (which can be easily installed in one command)? My only hope right now is to copy whatever <em>mach install</em> is doing (all necessary folders etc.) and bundle everything in a custom archive. The main problem is the ginormous size of 32 GiB after build is complete. (I can't archive that and use as a portable installer/builder, which indeed would be very convenient but the sizeâ€¦) </p>",linux;desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",Andrew15_5

These are Google KPIs for measuring the user experience on a page (https://web.dev/vitals/#core-web-vitals). Unfortunately, some of the KPIs (like the Largest Contentful Paint or Cumulative Layout Shift) are currently only accessible using Chrome and it's preformance API. That's a pity, because there are also many people using Firefox who visit our site... and it would be interesting to have such KPIs as well.  </p><p>In an article by Cloudflare (<a href=""https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/web-analytics/understanding-web-analytics/core-web-vitals/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/web-analytics/understanding-web-analytics/core-web-vitals/</a>) we recently learned that Firefox is also planning to expose the metrics used in the CWV... only the ""coming soon"" from the article is a bit vague. That's why I'm contacting you to get some more information on that topic. Do you perhaps know whether the topic is planned and will be tackled this year? </p><p>Thank you for your attention.
