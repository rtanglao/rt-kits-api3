Some days ago I have install this web browser in an old Desktop PC, a Compaq Presario, working with Windows 7 Professional x64, an Intel Core 2 Duo 6300 of 1,87 Ghz, 4 Mb of RAM, 1Gb ethernet adapter with a 1 Gb Router LAN ports and an Internet connection of 300 Mb. Using the same Internet speed test I have observed the following results in differents moments of a day: </p><p>Firefox Download speed 130 Mb Opera Download speed 210 Mb Microsoft Edge Download speed 220 Mb Google Chrome Download speed 270 Mb </p><p>Firefox can work faster (near the 300 Mb of the Internet provider) with newer Intel processors (Intel i7, for example), but with older Desktop PC its seem not possible. I hope this information can be useful for future developments to allow Firefox to work in a wide variety of Computers. </p><p>Thanks so much and Happy New Year to everyone. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1080;,firefox,other,en-US,"",enriquespain
