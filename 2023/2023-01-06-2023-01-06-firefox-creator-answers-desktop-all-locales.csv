Clearing cookies and site data from the padlock left of the address bar will successfully load the front page - however clicking on anything or trying to log in will then break the site completely. Even after navigating back to the homepage or restarting the browser the site will remain completely unresponsive until cookies and site data are reset, again presenting only the front page loading correctly and nothing else working. </p><p>I have tried using torubleshoot mode and the results are the same, so the issue shouldn't lie with any extensions. </p><p>Any ideas?

Some days ago I have install this web browser in an old Desktop PC, a Compaq Presario, working with Windows 7 Professional x64, an Intel Core 2 Duo 6300 of 1,87 Ghz, 4 Mb of RAM, 1Gb ethernet adapter with a 1 Gb Router LAN ports and an Internet connection of 300 Mb. Using the same Internet speed test I have observed the following results in differents moments of a day: </p><p>Firefox Download speed 130 Mb Opera Download speed 210 Mb Microsoft Edge Download speed 220 Mb Google Chrome Download speed 270 Mb </p><p>Firefox can work faster (near the 300 Mb of the Internet provider) with newer Intel processors (Intel i7, for example), but with older Desktop PC its seem not possible. I hope this information can be useful for future developments to allow Firefox to work in a wide variety of Computers. </p><p>Thanks so much and Happy New Year to everyone. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1080;,firefox,other,en-US,"",enriquespain
