These are Google KPIs for measuring the user experience on a page (https://web.dev/vitals/#core-web-vitals). Unfortunately, some of the KPIs (like the Largest Contentful Paint or Cumulative Layout Shift) are currently only accessible using Chrome and it's preformance API. That's a pity, because there are also many people using Firefox who visit our site... and it would be interesting to have such KPIs as well.  </p><p>In an article by Cloudflare (<a href=""https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/web-analytics/understanding-web-analytics/core-web-vitals/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/web-analytics/understanding-web-analytics/core-web-vitals/</a>) we recently learned that Firefox is also planning to expose the metrics used in the CWV... only the ""coming soon"" from the article is a bit vague. That's why I'm contacting you to get some more information on that topic. Do you perhaps know whether the topic is planned and will be tackled this year? </p><p>Thank you for your attention. Best regards, Carlos </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,other,en-US,"",carlos.cohen
