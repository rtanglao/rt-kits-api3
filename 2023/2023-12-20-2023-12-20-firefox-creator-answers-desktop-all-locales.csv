However, as of recently, I had moved into a new apartment, and with that came a new internet connection, which was very slow since the beginning, but usable. </p><p>At first I had assumed that Firefox on my PC was loading websites more slowly because of my poor internet, which was partly the case - however, my laptop and Android phone were on the same network as the PC and were both much faster. So I assumed it had something to do with the differences between WiFi and Ethernet connections - the PC was plugged into the latter while the laptop and phone were using WiFi.  </p><p>But then I noticed that Firefox was the only program with lacking speeds. Spotify loads video podcasts with no problem, Steam downloads are relatively fast (as much as my network allows), only Firefox took MINUTES to load a simple web site. For example, I tried opening Reddit on my PC to write this post, gave up, and am now writing it on my phone. The Reddit website is still loading on my PC as we speak. </p><p>I honestly don't know what could be causing this issue. I checked Task Manager, and Firefox isn't using any more resources than it normally would. I am also using the latest version, I just checked. </p><p>Any ideas or fixes? Even diagnosing the problem would go a long way. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1210;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1625466;1625477;,segecicluka
