Sorry if this is addressed somewhere &amp; I just glossed over it by accident, but here's the problem: </p><p>I use a Password Manager called Byepass on several devices, but recently decided to remove it from my laptop as it was slowing my browser down considerably -- the problem is, once it was removed, Firefox just kinda... refused to remember any of my passwords? Even though it's synced to my account + imported them again from another browser? It says I don't have <em>any</em> logins saved, but on my mobile devices (all attached to the same account) I can clearly see them being there? Do I need to uninstall &amp; then reinstall Firefox? I'd rather not, but I will if I have to. </p><p>Thank you! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1210;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",gisnape
