I have more than one Office 365/Outlook account, so I use different containers for each account.  </p><p>Whenever I click on any link in New Outlook, it opens in one of my Firefox containers rather than in a default No Container tab.  </p><p>Unfortunately, it opens in a container where I am logged into a different Office365 account than the one I use for the desktop client. This means any Office or organisation-specific links fail to work unless I copy and paste the link across.  </p><p>Is there some way to force Outlook to open these tabs as No Container? </p><p>Thanks, penguinoid </p><p>(*) I'm using a university owned/managed computer and they've disabled the option to update to Windows 11 </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",penguinoid

After debugging got to know that if firefox receives rtp packets of a participants before the sdp provided by media server than the video of that participants results in black screen while for other browsers it is working fine. My architecture is having a delay of 200 ms due to the cross region operation that's why the sdp reaches to the firefox client with 200 ms (approx) delay mean while rtp packets for some participants reaches earlier than the sdp. On debugging more over firefox got to know that firefox calls <em>NotifyUnsetCurrentRemoteSSRC</em> in such scenario and after it ""stops receive stream"". Please provide some suggestions over this to avoid calling NotifyUnsetCurrentRemoteSSRC in the scenario explained above. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",nitinkumarsaini.j

After that, I'm prompted ""Do you want to Trust this browser"" to which I ALWAYS say ""Yes"", but it doesn't seem to work; the next day, if I try icloud again, it does it all over, like the ""Trust"" option is ignored.  In settings, ""Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed"" is unchecked, Clicking ""Manage Data"" shows that cookies for <a href=""http://icloud.com"" rel=""nofollow"">icloud.com</a> are saved.

I'm building a website in Squarespace.  On that website, I have a PDF link that, when clicked, will open in a new browser window, with an option to download.  I've set that up in SQSP settings, but clicking the link only allows a download.  Squarespace Support and myself were able to open the PDF in a new window in Chrome and Safari.  Is there a setting in Firefox or something else that I'm missing that will allow opening the PDF in a new browser window?  Thanks!
