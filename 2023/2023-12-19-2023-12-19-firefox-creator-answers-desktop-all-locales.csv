After that, I'm prompted ""Do you want to Trust this browser"" to which I ALWAYS say ""Yes"", but it doesn't seem to work; the next day, if I try icloud again, it does it all over, like the ""Trust"" option is ignored.  In settings, ""Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed"" is unchecked, Clicking ""Manage Data"" shows that cookies for <a href=""http://icloud.com"" rel=""nofollow"">icloud.com</a> are saved. I've just added <a href=""http://icloud.com"" rel=""nofollow"">icloud.com</a> into Exceptions to Allow to use cookies/site data, though I wouldn't think I'd NEED that if I'm never deleting them. I tried this with Chrome, and the Trust DID work; I can sign in with that browser and not have to put in the code.  </p><p>What's up with that? </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-10;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,cookies,en-US,"",nathan-elke

In the past, when I used Ubuntu Desktop 22.04, this method would display all the bookmarks I had saved on other devices that also use Firefox. However, for this case, syncing did not successfully display bookmarks in the Firefox toolbar. </p><p>I then tried exporting bookmarks to an HTML file, then importing them into the newly installed Firefox using the Bookmarks Manager, but the window for selecting the HTML file did not open, so I couldn't import bookmarks.html into the new Firefox installed on Linux Lite 6.6. I also tried restoring from the Bookmarks Manager, but the window for selecting the HTML file did not open either. </p><p>Is there another way to transfer these bookmarks to the newly installed Firefox on Linux Lite? </p>",linux;desktop;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",hidayatdevacc

I'm building a website in Squarespace.  On that website, I have a PDF link that, when clicked, will open in a new browser window, with an option to download.  I've set that up in SQSP settings, but clicking the link only allows a download.  Squarespace Support and myself were able to open the PDF in a new window in Chrome and Safari.  Is there a setting in Firefox or something else that I'm missing that will allow opening the PDF in a new browser window?  Thanks!
