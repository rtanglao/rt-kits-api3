This is obviously annoying, so how do I stop that suggestion from popping up?

My architecture is having a delay of 200 ms due to the cross region operation that's why the sdp reaches to the firefox client with 200 ms (approx) delay mean while rtp packets for some participants reaches earlier than the sdp.
