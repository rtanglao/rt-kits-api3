It suddenly started working again last year and now I'm setting up a new laptop and once again, Firefox will not save the username in a dropdown menu.  I use a particular website that has well over 100 different usernames for work that I do and having to type out the whole username every time I log in (I'm logging in and out upwards of 50 times a day in the spring each year) is a huge time waster over the course of a workday. </p><p>There must be some sort of setting change that can be done or patch to make the username box behave like the old Firefox.  I do NOT want passwords to be saved on this site (it contains personal info for over 1000 people) but do want the username saved so all I have to do is type a portion of the username and it pulls it out of the menu.  For example, it could have a username of firefox23 or firefox112 and all I have to do is type in 23 or 112 and it pulls up the rest of the username I need out of the dropdown menu. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1090;firefox-10901;,firefox,customize,en-US,1565018;,christy.presley
