1407775,2023-03-12 08:16:05 -0700,2023-03-12 10:15:07 -0700,Firefox refusing Primary Password,"<p>Today, after browsing about whether or not I should continue using Firefox as my password manager, I decided to mitigate the most important security flaw in browser based password managers, by setting up a Primary Password. I choose to use an easy to remember 8 word long passphrase as my Primary Password. I noted down the passphrase in my diary. Due to problem while loading YouTube, I decided to restart Firefox by going to about:profiles and selecting ""restart normally"". This issue where Firefox starts to struggle connecting to internet is a relatively common occurrence on my Firefox install, and restarting Firefox fixes the issue.  When Firefox restarted, I was prompted to enter the primary password. I confidently entered my passphrase, but it was rejected. I tried to typing to it more carefully several times. I got my diary and checked it to make sure I was entering the passphrase correctly.  Following troubleshooting steps on a similar thread, I restarted firefox, no luck. I than rebooted my computer, issue persisted. I decided to restart Firefox with extensions disabled, and also in troubleshooting mode. Firefox still rejects my passphrase.  I have my Firefox account synchronized with two Android phones. Will reinstalling Firefox and syncing with my Firefox account solve the problem? In a similar troubleshooting thread, renaming key4.db and logins.json is suggested. However, it has not been explained very clearly. My logins.json file was modified an hour before disaster, even though I had made no changes to any of my logins or the master password. Is my logins.json corrupted causing the issue?  I will like to point out a design flaw in Firefox which might have caused the issue. I usually want to see what I am typing when I am entering an encryption password. This is to make sure that I don't mistype something. However, in Firefox Primary Password configuration window, there is not option to see what you are typing. Firefox relies on low probability of typing the wrong password twice. I don't think devs should be so worried about shoulder attacks to not even allow users option to view what they typing. My case might be that low probability situation where I made the same mistake while typing the passphrase twice. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1570192;1570214;,sushreysrivastava1999

I have logged into Google and Mozilla but they are not saved.  I also have that ""Your browser is being managed by your organization."" again.  I'm running Windows 11 Pro 22H2 on my Dell Inspiron 5759 laptop.  I'm not sure what else to provide for details.  I actually have two of the laptops and they both will not save logins in Firefox 110. I changed the policy for Firefox in Regedit but that didn't help getting rid of the GPO notice. Both of these computers are for personal use only.   I don't know if there is a conflict between Firefox 110 and Windows 11 Pro. I have used Firefox for many, many years with few issues. I don't like Chrome but I guess I'll try it. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,other,en-US,1570108;,leoman1
