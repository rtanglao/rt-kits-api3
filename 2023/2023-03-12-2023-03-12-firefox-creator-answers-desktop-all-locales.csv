My bookmarks won't stay sorted in the <em>Bookmark Menus</em> folder. The last solution I saw is a broken link having to do with corrupt 'Places'. Doesn't work anyway. I only have another device syncing with Firefox and not very often because I seldom use that laptop. Always this desktop. </p><p>I do have a lot of bookmarks over the years and it just keeps getting worse. If I <em>Manage Bookmarks</em> and sort them, they only stay sorted as long as I open that window separately. When I close it, the bookmarks are unsorted again. When will Firefox fix this? It's leaving a mess that is making my bookmarks unusable. When I click on that tab, I expect to see a bunch of folders, then files. Instead, I see files, then folders somewhere in the middle, mixed with other folders I don't even use, then a bunch more files. <em>Sort by name</em> doesn't show up as an option if I right click in the middle of all the files I see. </p><p>I have tried to delete those files, but they won't stay deleted. It's pulling them from somewhere, but I don't know where that 'somewhere' is. Does anybody have an idea how to contact Firefox tech support for an answer? Nobody seems to know what's going on with this issue. I won't list all my bookmarks, because some are more personal than others. This is just an idea. Please be nice. I've been using Firefox forever and a day. </p>",windows-7;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-1100;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",RayGibson57

Every time I want to enter/modify a customer's card info, Firefox wants to autofill MY saved card information. While I can work around this, 1) It's annoying; 2) One day I might slip-up, and not notice I accidentally let Firefox autofill my card info in place of a customer's card info. That would be bad. </p><p>Is there a way to disable the Saved Credit Card on individual web sites?

I have logged into Google and Mozilla but they are not saved.  I also have that ""Your browser is being managed by your organization."" again.  I'm running Windows 11 Pro 22H2 on my Dell Inspiron 5759 laptop.  I'm not sure what else to provide for details.  I actually have two of the laptops and they both will not save logins in Firefox 110. I changed the policy for Firefox in Regedit but that didn't help getting rid of the GPO notice. Both of these computers are for personal use only.   I don't know if there is a conflict between Firefox 110 and Windows 11 Pro. I have used Firefox for many, many years with few issues. I don't like Chrome but I guess I'll try it. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,other,en-US,1570108;,leoman1
