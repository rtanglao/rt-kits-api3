Every time I want to enter/modify a customer's card info, Firefox wants to autofill MY saved card information. While I can work around this, 1) It's annoying; 2) One day I might slip-up, and not notice I accidentally let Firefox autofill my card info in place of a customer's card info. That would be bad. </p><p>Is there a way to disable the Saved Credit Card on individual web sites? In my case, I want it OFF on <a href=""http://Stripe.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Stripe.com</a>, and ON everywhere else. </p><p>Thanks for any info. </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",larrycoon

I have logged into Google and Mozilla but they are not saved.  I also have that ""Your browser is being managed by your organization."" again.  I'm running Windows 11 Pro 22H2 on my Dell Inspiron 5759 laptop.  I'm not sure what else to provide for details.  I actually have two of the laptops and they both will not save logins in Firefox 110. I changed the policy for Firefox in Regedit but that didn't help getting rid of the GPO notice. Both of these computers are for personal use only.   I don't know if there is a conflict between Firefox 110 and Windows 11 Pro. I have used Firefox for many, many years with few issues. I don't like Chrome but I guess I'll try it. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,other,en-US,1570108;,leoman1
