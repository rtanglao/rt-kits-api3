This time, I noticed UBlock was not on my toolbar.  It also did not appear in the Puzzle Piece drop down menu.  It was still installed, but inoperable.

Today, after the Ublock reinstatement, once again blank button appeared.   </p><p>I develop profiles in stages, like templates for further enhancements.

The trailers run just fine, but the movies/shows themselves will not play. I get no error message, no loading icon, nothing, just a blank black screen. When I turn my adblocker off, sometimes ads will play, but then the blank black screen returns with no explanation. Netflix will give me the error code F7351, but that error code does not show up when I search for it in Netflix's help menu (I have added screenshots of the error message and the lack of search results). I have downloaded the Hulu app which does play, but I would like to rule out all possible solutions before resorting to downloading separate apps for each of these streaming services. In my browser, Hulu will show a loading bar for about 30 seconds before the screen just goes black, and the options to full screen or minimize work while the option to exit the media player does not (screenshot included). HBO Max just goes to a black screen with different watching options to the side. </p><p>At the same time as this happened, YouTube stopped offering to play videos at a quality higher than 720p, and all videos looks as though they are playing at 360p even when they are set to 720p. Loading times for starting new videos or redirecting back to the homepage are dreadfully long now, the audio and video skips or pauses whenever I unpause a video and sometimes when I enter or exit fullscreen. </p><p>I have tried turning off all of my extensions (DuckDuckGo, AdBlocker Ultimate, HTTPS Everywhere, uBlock Origin, Unhook, YouTube Search Fixer), clearing my cookie cache, emptying my device storage, restarting my laptop, everything I could think of and nothing has worked. I've toggled off and on DRM content, turned off enhanced tracking permissions, allowed cookies, connected to different networks, even switched browsers, and none of it has helped. I'm not sure what else to do, and as I said above, installing the apps for each of these services is my last resort, as all of the websites were working perfectly fine at the beginning of December. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1210;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mercury
