Now all of my shortcuts have disappeared and I can't get them back.,<p>Firefox opened with a set of questions just now. I did what was appropriate then it was like FF reset.  All of my home page shortcut boxes were gone and I want them back. FF/Mozilla sent a verification code to my email. I typed the url for my gmail account and FF did nothing. A page came up with the url and it was blank. The tab had an icon grayed out and the page was blank.  So I had to go to Edge to sign in to my gmail to get the code.  I am at work. I do not have time to search through a plethora of articles trying to find how to get my shortcuts back.  Why did they go away in the first place.  This is maddening. I've used FF for years and it has always been simple. I just need an answer to what should be a simple question. </p><p>Thanks in advance for your help. </p>,desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1210;,firefox,other,en-US,"",becky.pottsbaker

Firefox wasn't like that, what did you do? </p><p>√çcone ""Verificada pela comunidade"" Abrir no Google Tra </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1210;,firefox,fix-problems,pt-BR,"",ricardokiller
