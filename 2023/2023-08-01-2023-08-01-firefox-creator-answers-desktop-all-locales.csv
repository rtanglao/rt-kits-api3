Not chronological or alphabetical, just random placements, making finding anything a dizzying &amp; time consuming experience, as I have to look up and down each &amp; every time. I don't know of any other browser that gives no option as to how to sort this list.  </p><p>I don't care if it's chronological, or if sorted alphabetically, which technically it is. However, it's in the order of the specific tab title, not the website's name, which is of little use, since how many of us remember the title of every tab we've opened? We remember the website, which is far more relevant, since we may only briefly glance at the exact title of the page. I don't know why there could not be the option to sort it via the website name, as the Task Manager is sorted that way! Just do the same with the Window menu, and quit making life harder on your users... it's not rocket science. </p>",desktop;tabs;firefox-1150;firefox-11503;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",StevenCee

I used to use IE11 (Internet Explorer 11),  on Windows XP / 7  (32 bit), which worked spot on, the steps were as follows: (I write websites from scratch most of the time) 1) Click on, say,  index.html 2) IE11 shows the actual page 3)Click on View/ Source  4)The source code shows up in Notepad 5) Edlt the code,     Save      and click Reload the webpage. You can straightaway see the changes. </p><p>Currently my new laptop runs Win 11 pro, Microsoft does NOT support IE11 anymore, I can however run IE11 as a add-on, BUT it does not work very well . I also tried a couple of free dedicated editing programs also, BUT they are exceedingly clumsy to use and  can't equate to the old IE11 at any level.
