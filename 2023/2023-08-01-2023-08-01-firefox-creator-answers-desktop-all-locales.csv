I used to use IE11 (Internet Explorer 11),  on Windows XP / 7  (32 bit), which worked spot on, the steps were as follows: (I write websites from scratch most of the time) 1) Click on, say,  index.html 2) IE11 shows the actual page 3)Click on View/ Source  4)The source code shows up in Notepad 5) Edlt the code,     Save      and click Reload the webpage. You can straightaway see the changes. </p><p>Currently my new laptop runs Win 11 pro, Microsoft does NOT support IE11 anymore, I can however run IE11 as a add-on, BUT it does not work very well . I also tried a couple of free dedicated editing programs also, BUT they are exceedingly clumsy to use and  can't equate to the old IE11 at any level. Somewhere I read that Firefox ( i have v115) can emulate what IE11 could do, hence I am on this forum posing the question, as i can't find the solution, </p><p>Anyone in the same boat? </p><pre>Please share your ideas, Many thanks </pre>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1150;firefox-11503;,firefox,other,en-US,"",pendragon2

It was reported right after 115.0.1 was released. When watching FreeVee on a Windows 10 desktop it stops a short while after an ad plays. It looks like it loses the ability to stream the main movie while streaming the ad. After the ad it plays about 20 seconds of the movie, probably what was in the buffer before the ad started, and then it freezes. I get the circle wait icon, like what typically happens when the Wifi goes down. After a while a message appears saying the Internet is not working. See attached image. Then I get the message (see other attached file) saying Video Unavailable. We're experiencing a problem playing this video.
