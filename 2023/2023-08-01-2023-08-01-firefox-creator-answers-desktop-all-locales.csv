It was reported right after 115.0.1 was released. When watching FreeVee on a Windows 10 desktop it stops a short while after an ad plays. It looks like it loses the ability to stream the main movie while streaming the ad. After the ad it plays about 20 seconds of the movie, probably what was in the buffer before the ad started, and then it freezes. I get the circle wait icon, like what typically happens when the Wifi goes down. After a while a message appears saying the Internet is not working. See attached image. Then I get the message (see other attached file) saying Video Unavailable. We're experiencing a problem playing this video.
