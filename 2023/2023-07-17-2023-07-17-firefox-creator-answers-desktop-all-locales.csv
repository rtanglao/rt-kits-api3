I need the tabs for my work, and as usually happens, this has occurred at a time when I'm running to meet a critical deadline. </p><p>I've tried going to history, but the ""recently closed tabs"" option was greyed out:-(  I've tried searching for other solutions, but cannot fine any that fit my situation.  I'm not an IT expert - I know my way around what I need to use (i.e. professional worker), so clear &amp; simple explanation would be much appreciated. </p><p>Can I recover the lost tabs from backed up data or a previous system image?  My system is Windows 7, and I'm currently running Firefox version 115.0.2.  All suggestions welcome! </p><p>Thanking you in anticipation off prompt assistance, MLH </p>",windows-7;desktop;tabs;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",PoodleFamily
