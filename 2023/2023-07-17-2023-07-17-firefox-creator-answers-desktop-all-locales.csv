Following instructions from the Apple Support Desk I have since Command ""R"" reloaded the Mac operating system (both normally and in Safe Mode) and the Firefox app as well but the issue persists.  While it might be a minor issue (no auto-load) I am concerned there might be more serious underlying compatibility problems or system failures I have yet to experience.  In contrast, my current macOS installation will add/delete Thunderbird (and couple of other apps I experimented with) on the auto start up list without any problem.   The only recent macOS system change I think was to install an update to bring it up to Ventura 13.4.1 (c), from 13.4.1 I think. </p><p>The Apple Genius Desk at the Canberra store ran a complete hardware check which did not report any faults only a few days ago.  In all other respects the iMac and apps ""appear"" to be running normally. </p><p>Any advice on rectifying the problem would be appreciated - e.g. a full Apple Store Reset/Reload of macOS followed by a fresh start with a complete reload of my current app collection as I am not all sure where the problem rests - with the macOS or the Firefox app, some incompatibility or a download corruption in either? </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",Poppa

Maybe a month ago i changed a lot of passwords, saved them and synchronized with account using PC. Now, when I install Firefox and sign in to my account on my mobile, passwords (old versions) was send from my phone to the Firefox server and changes made on PC was overwritten by older versions from mobile.
