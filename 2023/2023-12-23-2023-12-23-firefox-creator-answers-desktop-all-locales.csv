But if I tried to open a new tab for my protonmail account, I would get hit with a login page. This happened even though I had another active protonmail session going on in the existing tab. </p><p>I contact Protonmail and they linked me to <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/tn/questions/1373748"" rel=""nofollow"">this question</a>  and I tried to follow it but noticed something odd. the selected solution says &gt; Make sure you use ""Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed"" and not ""Clear history when Firefox closes"" to clear the cookies as the latter doesn't honor exceptions.  </p><p>But, on my firefox, clicking ""Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed"" automatically results in ""Clear history when Firefox closes"" also being clicked and I can't seem to undo the association. </p><p>Is that answer outdated? </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-11560;firefox-1156;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",modernNeo

The whole tab will suddenly go blank except for blank placeholders for buttons, frames, etc., after which a few seconds later the tab reloads. If I was watching a video, that video is still there but has been reset to the start. There does not seem to be any particular trigger (I read another thread from about a year ago in which another user described the same problem.) I have never seen this kind of random reset/reload behavior in Firefox. Let me know if there is a way to collect more information if possible.

All I see is that spinning circle. </p><p>I must close the tab, and reopen it, usually with my Undo Closed Tabs addon.  It also often happens with multiple adjacent tabs.  I have this tab manager, and If I open the window the tab list, the icons of several of the the tabs below the tabs that won't load are spinning, even tho they haven't been selected yet, and I must repeat the close/open process.   It's like a chain reaction.  When one tabs is closed and reopened, it prompts other to repeat the behavior.  </p><p>After a while it stops. There's really no pattern.
