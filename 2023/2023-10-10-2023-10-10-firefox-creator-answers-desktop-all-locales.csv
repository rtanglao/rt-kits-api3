1426930,2023-10-09 22:57:13 -0700,2023-10-09 22:57:13 -0700,Firefox is what I wanted. But it is very slow loading Torn.com (text MMO),"<p>I had to type all of this again. Why??? It just didn't send the question after... It said error I will copy and paste this somewhere as a backup... ARGH </p><p>I use Chrome on a daily basis. But I really hate the feature that it just automatically autocompletes/search suggestions whatever I want to search. But I tried everything, I tried changing the settings, tried asking the community but I violated the TOS (I insulted Googles CEO, but I won't insult anyone here&nbsp;: ). Every single setting I tried. YouTube videos are out of date... Answers on the Google community and they won't help. </p><p>Until I found this little genius. And I'm glad that I'm typing this again. FireFox is a little genius. It finally doesn't autocomplete/search suggest/force you to backspace  whatever I want to search. Until I came back to what I was doing on this text based MMO RPG website. </p><p>It was okay with whatever I was doing. Until I went to that text based <a href=""http://torn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">torn.com</a> game. But until when I attacked a player. It lagged and slowed down, until the point that my temporary weapon effect just expired. It was also very slow and I was unsatisfied by it. </p><p>I also noticed that FireFox doesn't support Timeline on Google maps. I don't want to add how I emphasized on Google and Opera with a fake WW2 quote. So if you are a part working with Mozilla, an employee of Mozilla Foundation. Yes, take this as a feedback. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,other,en-US,"",desmondnyh350
