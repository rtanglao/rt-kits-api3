E.g. When I go to <a href=""http://startpage.com"" rel=""nofollow"">startpage.com</a> the page is blank. When I click on the Privacy Badger icon it is blank, when I click on the STG icon it shows the spinning sign but never loads. If I go into the Options page for STG it is blank. Whatsapp Web doesn't load, it stays stuck on the grey loading screen. I have this kind of behaviour with lots of sites and other addons. </p><p>The problems exist in Troubleshooting mode but not in Private Browsing or another profile. Closing all tabs and loading a clean window doesn't change anything. I've tried clearing ALL cookies, cache, site settings, active logins and offline data, and that doesn't fix the problem. </p><p>Originally, before the refresh, as well as the blank pages Firefox was also incredibly slow at loading any tab. All of these problems seemed to start happening after 118.0.1 update. I've just installed 118.0.2 and the problems persist. </p><p>I tried everything on these pages: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/quick-fixes-if-your-firefox-slows-down"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/quick-fixes-if-your-firefox-slows-down</a> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-uses-too-much-memory-or-cpu-resources"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-uses-too-much-memory-or-cpu-resources</a> </p><p>I discovered the error 500 problem when I tried to login here to get help!
