I have a WordPress page that works perfectly in Opera, Edge, Safari, etc., but in Firefox, some plugins I'm using don't work, specifically this plugin is called Complianz, it's a cookie manager. The most curious thing is that from the frontend, it looks and works, but when I exit the frontend and run the page, the cookie warning does not appear. On the other hand, with Firefox on Android, there is no plugin problem, they work fine, it only happens to me with the PC. I am attaching two screenshots, one with the web page where the plugin does not appear and the other with the frontend, where it does appear, I have marked it in green. Any solution? Thank you. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1120;,firefox,other,es,"",mannix

A couple weeks ago I decide to delete this account using the Delete Account in the Firefox profile page (<a href=""http://accounts.firefox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">accounts.firefox.com</a> -&gt; settings -&gt; profile -&gt; Delete account button at the bottom). Then, I wanted to create a new profile with the secondary email address from the former (now is deleted) account. Surprisingly <a href=""http://accounts.firefox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">accounts.firefox.com</a> thinks that the secondary email still in use, because I can't register with it. Even if I create a new account with some email, and I try to add the secondary email as secondary email, I get the error message, that ""This email was already confirmed by another user"". Which is not possible since I deleted the account. </p><p>So, what can I do? </p>",linux;desktop;sync;firefox-1120;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",bpeter.sub
