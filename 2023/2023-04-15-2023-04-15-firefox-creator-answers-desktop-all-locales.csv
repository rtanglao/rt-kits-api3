I have a WordPress page that works perfectly in Opera, Edge, Safari, etc., but in Firefox, some plugins I'm using don't work, specifically this plugin is called Complianz, it's a cookie manager. The most curious thing is that from the frontend, it looks and works, but when I exit the frontend and run the page, the cookie warning does not appear. On the other hand, with Firefox on Android, there is no plugin problem, they work fine, it only happens to me with the PC. I am attaching two screenshots, one with the web page where the plugin does not appear and the other with the frontend, where it does appear, I have marked it in green. Any solution?
