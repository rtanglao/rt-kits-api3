The only choice is to save the file rather than onening it with MS access. Under Firefox settings/applications the file type .mdb does not appear. If I answer the question ""What should Firefox do with other files?"" with ""Ask whether to open or save files"" it has no effect at all. I expect to find an entry for .mdb files where to choose ""always ask"" as was the case earlier. Please help! </p><p>Regards  Volker Zipp </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,other,en-US,"",vozi
