However, when I started Firefox on my computer, since Firefox tried to load the content of all sent tabs immediately instead loading them lazily (which I think probably should be the default behavior), it took a very long time for Firefox to display even the tab that was currently selected, and I therefore decided to kill Firefox and reopen it, in the hope that all new tabs would load lazily. Instead, when I reopened Firefox, none of the new tabs where there anymore; it was as if they had never been sent. I would like to get them back, but I have no idea how to.

Most of the time when I reopen FF, the tabs are still there, as expected. Sometimes, the browser opens with just a new home page and the pinned and other tabs have closed. I can sometimes see the 16ish tabs in history and reopen them. More recently, I find that they are not in history as a number of tabs so I have to set them up again. This rarely happened on my old PC and if it did I would have bookmarked a group of open tabs that I used regularly.  </p><p>The failsafe FF General setting is as follows: Startup, Open previous windows and tabs.  </p><p>I don't know how I can stop losing my open Tabs but if I was able to bookmark all the open tabs to be used in case of a problem I would feel more secure.  </p><p>How do I bookmark ALL or several my open tabs? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1622582;1622600;1622605;1622619;1622623;1622629;1622637;1622650;1622670;1622686;1622742;,phildiamo

The only choice is to save the file rather than onening it with MS access. Under Firefox settings/applications the file type .mdb does not appear. If I answer the question ""What should Firefox do with other files?"" with ""Ask whether to open or save files"" it has no effect at all. I expect to find an entry for .mdb files where to choose ""always ask"" as was the case earlier. Please help! </p><p>Regards  Volker Zipp </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,other,en-US,"",vozi
