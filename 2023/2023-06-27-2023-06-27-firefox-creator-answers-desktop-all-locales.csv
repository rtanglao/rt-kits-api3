This is more me checking to see if i'm alone in this situation or not. Currently using the December 2022 drivers and while it seems to be playing nice so far, this will become an issue sooner or later again. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-10212;firefox-102120;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",onionknight0125

Not even the profile manager which is supposed to fix these problems. Firefox flashes open for like a millisecond and then closes immediately afterwards not even full screen a tiny window. </p>,desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",SilasExperiment

I have noticed that some of my tabs are missing and i have found out that restored session is about 1 month old. Then I have opened History Library and searched it for at least some of my lost tabs. I noticed that if I select May it shows me 6434 items for May but if I select April, it shows history for April, May and June, but now it has only 194 items for May. Then I select March, and it has only 125 items for May. For January it has 131 items for May so there is something very strange going on. What purpose does this history hiding serve? It should either show history only for selected month or all history from selected month to current date, or even better all history between two dates selected by user. Another great improvement would be filtering by ""-"" symbol for example ""-<a href=""https://www.google.com/maps"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/maps</a>"" will remove google maps from viewed items (but everything is still saved in history). </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1140;,firefox,other,en-US,"",peto819
