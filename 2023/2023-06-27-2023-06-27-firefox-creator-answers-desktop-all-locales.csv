Thus also, yes, Firefox. </p><p>This site, for instance, is ""Light Mode"", which is addressed by someone else. The response was: ""Hi Dennis, this support site does not have a dark mode. Sorry. Add-ons are not allowed to inject scripts into certain Mozilla sites because this would give them elevated privileges to access certain internal information hidden from normal websites and add-ons. So let's focus on other sites, since I assume you don't really use this one very often."" </p><p>This support has no dark mode? UNFORGIVABLE! I mean, seriously: You offer in Firefox a ""Dark Mode"" which hardly works, seeing most websites coming up ""Light Mode"". Then NOT allowing a script which would make this side become Dark Mode, is not unforgivable ... it is downright wrong! I mean, why am I not allowed to see this site in Dark Mode, as this bright white is hurting my sight? This is darn user unfriendly, and breaches our customisation rights. </p><p>It is not that we turn it into an illegal style, like some porn style for instance. We just want it DARK. How wrong can that be? </p><p>More, what is the logic in offering it, but then to deprive us in this by you (Mozilla, not the users) revoking Dark Mode TOTALLY. EITHER you (Mozilla) gives us Dark Mode, and TOTALLY, EVERYWHERE, or remove it. Since this dualistic mindset, having severe Asperger's and ADHD, is something in which my brain conflicts. It is either All, or nothing. Not this half baked cookie you give us. Contradictions are a bad thing for us, we need clarity, and this ... just ain't clear. Is it yes or no? Can't be both. </p><p>Please make up your mind? </p><p><br> To the users responding, I thank you for the help you offer. Sadly, you often encounter issues that are not in your control, such as this one. Maybe we all should make a stand together, and ask Mozilla to het their heads out of the sand, for a second, to address the issues you users can't fix? Merely thinking out loud. </p><p>Is there a way to ENFORCE Dark Mode as setting to all websites, please? Tried several addons, but those all were equally half baked (not really, the damn website owners refuse the option of Dark Mode, for whatever reason, and like here, this light-blasting menace of a site which gives me a spectacular migraine, block addons from functioning. It had come so far, we are not even masters any more of our own damn health!!! </p><p>So, if you have a good alternative (I tried Dark Reader, Dark Mode, BlackOut and a few others, none truly seem to black all sites out ...)? </p><p>Thank you.

This is more me checking to see if i'm alone in this situation or not. Currently using the December 2022 drivers and while it seems to be playing nice so far, this will become an issue sooner or later again. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-10212;firefox-102120;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",onionknight0125

I have noticed that some of my tabs are missing and i have found out that restored session is about 1 month old. Then I have opened History Library and searched it for at least some of my lost tabs. I noticed that if I select May it shows me 6434 items for May but if I select April, it shows history for April, May and June, but now it has only 194 items for May. Then I select March, and it has only 125 items for May. For January it has 131 items for May so there is something very strange going on. What purpose does this history hiding serve? It should either show history only for selected month or all history from selected month to current date, or even better all history between two dates selected by user. Another great improvement would be filtering by ""-"" symbol for example ""-<a href=""https://www.google.com/maps"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/maps</a>"" will remove google maps from viewed items (but everything is still saved in history). </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1140;,firefox,other,en-US,"",peto819
