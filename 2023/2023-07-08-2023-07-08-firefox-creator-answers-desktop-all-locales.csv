But then suddenly something happened; the icon went ""white"" and I had to first remove it and then put it back in the taskbar. Now Firefox does not open in the same way anymore. To be able to open a new window, you must right-click and select ""open in new window"". Previously, the ""opening of a new window"" happened automatically when I clicked on the icon. How do I get the old ""opening"" back, which I think is better? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-10213;firefox-102130;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",LJV777

It was showing an old synced tab list.. I tried multiple times and nothing happened... So I logged out of my account and logged in again but this time I couldn't login... So I uninstalled my Firefox app and installed it again but it still didn't work. </p><p>What happens is... I use the login button in sync feature... It shows to scan a barcode from pc or through email (i tried both)... I use my PC to login in... It logs in but as soon as I go back or open the firefox app again... It goes back to the same login again mode... I have tried it multiple times... This is all shown in the pictures given below. </p><p>Whatâ€™s causing this and how do I solve it? Some feedback will be helpful as I can't use my mobile and PC properly... All the addons, preference are gone for now. </p>",desktop;sync;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",Imsar53
