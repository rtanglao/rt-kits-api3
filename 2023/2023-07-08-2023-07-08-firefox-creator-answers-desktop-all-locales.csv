I work for a Corporation that handles delicate data. Now, my Asperger's requires clarity, but this ad-on is all BUT clear. Which is a serious annoyance, since, more and more, life is becoming unclear, due to continuous contradictions everywhere. More so ... it, at first glance, appears to be not quite right: The ad-on promises security and privacy, BUUUUUT ... does seemingly the absolute opposite? Let me explain: </p><p>So, I got the Multi-Account Container ad-on. Upon installing it, it requested: </p><pre>   Access your data for all web sites    Access browsing history    Monitor extension usage and manage themes    Access browser tabs </pre> <p>Why on earth are these needed? Now, you speak of privacy, security, all very nice, but then you throw these ""necessities"" in the ad-on, which totally counter the promised privacy, security and whatnot. </p><p>I have certain data that I access through the Private Window in Firefox, related to my work. Several tabs are Corporate Account information, log ins, ... , which I darn sure refuse to give out. Not to mention, Corporate project data. </p><p>Your ""necessities"" breach privacy, security, and even invoke the possibility of personal data theft, bank data theft, and even, indeed so, Corporate espionage! </p><p>1) Access data for all websites: Why not just ask the darn info directly? I will open the Corporation for you, give you all access keys. Way faster. 2) Access browsing history: If you need money, just ask ... I do not like my data shoved out for money so they can ""offer targetted advertising"". I HATE advertising, each ad I encounter brings my IQ down by 10 %, because my poor dumb brain can't understand the stream of lies in those. Also: you have no rights to dive into my history data, it is ""private"" for a reason, protected by LAW. This then breaches these Privacy Laws. 3) Monitor extension usage and manage themes: Oh? Am I per chance a COMPLETE idiot? That I can't read, or think? I am quite sure, I am just clever enough to handle this myself, I reckon. Could be wrong, but then there's google and the likes to help me out, in case I do not find the right colour and icon for my tab. 4) Access Browser Tabs: Here's a smarter idea, I think ... well, for as far as I CAN think, seeing the above uncalled for ""assistance"" provided: Come to my place and have my computer. Direct access thus no need to do all that network doing thingy needed for remote Browser Access. </p><p>Sorry for appearing angry, but these kinds of ""necessities to ensure the ad-on to work"". This ad-on can just as well work without these ""kindly offered assist tools"". So why are they in here, while you provide your ad-on as a means to secure and privatise my data? </p><p>I would appreciate some information here.

But then suddenly something happened; the icon went ""white"" and I had to first remove it and then put it back in the taskbar. Now Firefox does not open in the same way anymore. To be able to open a new window, you must right-click and select ""open in new window"". Previously, the ""opening of a new window"" happened automatically when I clicked on the icon. How do I get the old ""opening"" back, which I think is better? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-10213;firefox-102130;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",LJV777

It was showing an old synced tab list.. I tried multiple times and nothing happened... So I logged out of my account and logged in again but this time I couldn't login... So I uninstalled my Firefox app and installed it again but it still didn't work. </p><p>What happens is... I use the login button in sync feature... It shows to scan a barcode from pc or through email (i tried both)... I use my PC to login in... It logs in but as soon as I go back or open the firefox app again... It goes back to the same login again mode... I have tried it multiple times... This is all shown in the pictures given below. </p><p>What’s causing this and how do I solve it?
