I will be borrowing my families laptop for studying and work, and i would like to transfer everything, even my layouts, tabs, plug in settings etc etc from my old pc to this laptop. Is this possible in a simple straightforward way? Also. Can i have my tabs always be synced between 2 out of my 3 devices? Lets say i am studying on a field, and have opened 10 tabs about the subject. And the time that i have to leave the house comes. I wouldnt like to have to reopen each and every tab from my laptop. I would like to just press the broswer, and have everything be the same way as it was with my pc </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1150;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",super12001

I am clueless to what may cause this very disturbing issue because I love using Firefox as my main browser but now I'm forced to browse this newspaper in chrome instead to see the videos.

I work for a Corporation that handles delicate data. Now, my Asperger's requires clarity, but this ad-on is all BUT clear. Which is a serious annoyance, since, more and more, life is becoming unclear, due to continuous contradictions everywhere. More so ... it, at first glance, appears to be not quite right: The ad-on promises security and privacy, BUUUUUT ... does seemingly the absolute opposite? Let me explain: </p><p>So, I got the Multi-Account Container ad-on. Upon installing it, it requested: </p><pre>   Access your data for all web sites    Access browsing history    Monitor extension usage and manage themes    Access browser tabs </pre> <p>Why on earth are these needed? Now, you speak of privacy, security, all very nice, but then you throw these ""necessities"" in the ad-on, which totally counter the promised privacy, security and whatnot. </p><p>I have certain data that I access through the Private Window in Firefox, related to my work. Several tabs are Corporate Account information, log ins, ... , which I darn sure refuse to give out. Not to mention, Corporate project data. </p><p>Your ""necessities"" breach privacy, security, and even invoke the possibility of personal data theft, bank data theft, and even, indeed so, Corporate espionage! </p><p>1) Access data for all websites: Why not just ask the darn info directly? I will open the Corporation for you, give you all access keys. Way faster. 2) Access browsing history: If you need money, just ask ... I do not like my data shoved out for money so they can ""offer targetted advertising"". I HATE advertising, each ad I encounter brings my IQ down by 10 %, because my poor dumb brain can't understand the stream of lies in those. Also: you have no rights to dive into my history data, it is ""private"" for a reason, protected by LAW. This then breaches these Privacy Laws. 3) Monitor extension usage and manage themes: Oh? Am I per chance a COMPLETE idiot? That I can't read, or think? I am quite sure, I am just clever enough to handle this myself, I reckon. Could be wrong, but then there's google and the likes to help me out, in case I do not find the right colour and icon for my tab. 4) Access Browser Tabs: Here's a smarter idea, I think ... well, for as far as I CAN think, seeing the above uncalled for ""assistance"" provided: Come to my place and have my computer. Direct access thus no need to do all that network doing thingy needed for remote Browser Access. </p><p>Sorry for appearing angry, but these kinds of ""necessities to ensure the ad-on to work"". This ad-on can just as well work without these ""kindly offered assist tools"". So why are they in here, while you provide your ad-on as a means to secure and privatise my data? </p><p>I would appreciate some information here. Thank you."" </p><p>I received no reply yet, though I asked 11 creators nigh 2 weeks ago. Seems ... fishy ... no? I mean, can someone give an explanation on this? </p><p>Thank you.
