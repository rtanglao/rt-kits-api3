But ALL that seems to do is allow me to ADD an open page TO Pocket. I have NO clue how to simply **Go t o POCKET** and VIEW any / all my saved items there. </p><p>Good God, WHAT is the secret handshake??! ...in trying to figure this out I see numerous things telling me to SIGN IN to pocket ... IF way back when I began using pocket I MADE a USER NAME / Password for it, that info is long forgotten. I HAVE a FIREFOX account ... was sent therewhile supposedly (according to Firefox"" HELP"") to 'sign in' to my POCKET account. Only took me to an overall FIREFOX account page - wherein NO LONK there referred AT ALL to POCKET. </p><p>I 'SAVE' to my pocket (ICON) almost daily. NEVER need any kind of sign in for this. NOW I want to LOOK AT / READ some of these - BUT FIND NOWAY TO GET THERE. ICON omly SAVES a page. </p><p>Ridiculous. HOW do I VIEW / SEE / FIND /READ my saved pocket items? </p>",desktop;tips;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1130;firefox-11301;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",BilboPISSED

I like the feature where if I saved the password, Firefox automatically puts them in for me, but for some unknown reason, the settings keep reverting back and removing this option.  It does not save my preferences so if I restart my computer, I have to change the settings again which is getting frustrating. Is there anything I can do to make this option permanent? Thanks for any info and have a great day Kind Regards John </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1130;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",johnattard
