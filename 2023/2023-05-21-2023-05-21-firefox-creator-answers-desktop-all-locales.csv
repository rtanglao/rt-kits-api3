It pertains to at least Firefox profiles, and sync. </p><p>A little background: I have been using Firefox, happily, over countless updates, on a single computer, for maybe 2 decades, logging in to ""shopping"" websites (travel-tickets, government websites, blah-blah, so password memory is very important). Now on 113.0, on a Mac,  Catalina 10.15.7 </p><p>Recently, I've a need to travel, using a laptop. Linux, Mint, Ubuntu, various. Should maybe think about ""Sync"". Just care about logins/passwords. So signed  on to Mozilla ""Sync"" (password safe on a bit of paper). What could go wrong? Not yet tried to sync to anything else... </p><p>Wrong. Firefox wanted to update to 113.0.1. Why not? Go ahead. I've 2 previous versions in /Applications. What could go wrong? On 113.0.1, Firefox warned me (in capital letters IIRC) that my bookmarks, passwords and history might be corrupted unless I created a new profile. </p><p>Perhaps because I panicked, I now have 7 profiles. Obfuscating slightly: blahblah1.default-esr-1 blahblah2.default-esr-4 orig.default blahblah3.default-esr-3 blahblah4.default-esr blahblah5.default-esr-2 and blahblah6.default-release </p><p>I have parked the 113.0.1 update in a holding directory, and continue to use 113.0. I've had to change some passwords, but the new ones are written safely (AFAIK) on bits of paper, or memory sticks. </p><p>How to sort this out? My super-duper backups have been failing for lack of space. </p><p>I appreciate (see above) that ""Sync"" is not a backup strategy. I THINK I know what it is intended. However the mere word ""Sync"" does not really cut it as a dependable specification. I've not (AFAICR) tried to sync this computer's firefox profile to any other. But I was in an extreme panic. </p><p>I depend heavily on Thunderbird. I'm hopeful that any false steps I take won't extinguish any remaining ability I have to communicate with the outside world.

Sub addresses within PDFs enable links to be made to content within the document. This supports users wishing to bookmark specific content, and indexes to large collections such as journals and society newsletters. Firefox comes out well, it can take users to page numbers in PDFs for many platforms. (Example HyperlinkAddress#page=100) However, it doesn't find range name sub addresses. (Example HyperlinkAddress#RangeName) The request is for the addition of a range name capability to all versions of Firefox. Below is an extract from the Hyperlink Report <strong>Hyperlinks Containing Range Name Sub Addresses</strong> When a hyperlink containing a range name sub address is opened, the user <strong>should </strong>be taken to the correct range. Ranges and their names <strong>will </strong>be defined during document creation, which includes indexing. A selected range <strong>should </strong>be made easily visible. Where a selected range is small, it <strong>should </strong>be artificially extended to make it visible.
