Sub addresses within PDFs enable links to be made to content within the document. This supports users wishing to bookmark specific content, and indexes to large collections such as journals and society newsletters. Firefox comes out well, it can take users to page numbers in PDFs for many platforms. (Example HyperlinkAddress#page=100) However, it doesn't find range name sub addresses. (Example HyperlinkAddress#RangeName) The request is for the addition of a range name capability to all versions of Firefox. Below is an extract from the Hyperlink Report <strong>Hyperlinks Containing Range Name Sub Addresses</strong> When a hyperlink containing a range name sub address is opened, the user <strong>should </strong>be taken to the correct range. Ranges and their names <strong>will </strong>be defined during document creation, which includes indexing. A selected range <strong>should </strong>be made easily visible. Where a selected range is small, it <strong>should </strong>be artificially extended to make it visible. Users <strong>should </strong>be able to read range names and to determine their start and end locations. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1130;firefox-11301;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",barry.campbell

I like the feature where if I saved the password, Firefox automatically puts them in for me, but for some unknown reason, the settings keep reverting back and removing this option.  It does not save my preferences so if I restart my computer, I have to change the settings again which is getting frustrating. Is there anything I can do to make this option permanent? Thanks for any info and have a great day Kind Regards John </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1130;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",johnattard
