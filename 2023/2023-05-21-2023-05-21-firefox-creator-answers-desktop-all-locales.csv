I'm getting this error while working from my localhost. I have been working on a personal project for years with this set up with no issues until today. I can no longer click on the errors in the console log and be directed to the Debugger tab. When I click on errors, nothing happens. If I try to open them in a New Tab, I get the error below: </p><p><br> <em>The address wasn’t understood </em> </p><p>Firefox doesn’t know how to open this address, because one of the following protocols (webpack) isn’t associated with any program or is not allowed in this context. </p><pre>   You might need to install other software to open this address.<em> </em> </pre> <p><br> I have also noticed firefox does not even load all the files until I refresh it at least twice. Even when it is all loaded properly, the error persists. </p><p>I have tried: - restarting firefox - restarting my computer - clearing ALL cache and cookies - running firefox in safe mode - disabling all add ons - disabling performance mode (was already off) - checking network.protocol-handler.external.javascript = false (it is) </p><p>Let me know if there is any other information I can provide. I really dislike having to work in chrome for this so I hope I can find a solution as soon as possible. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11301;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",iamshi

IF way back when I began using pocket I MADE a USER NAME / Password for it, that info is long forgotten. I HAVE a FIREFOX account ... was sent therewhile supposedly (according to Firefox"" HELP"") to 'sign in' to my POCKET account. Only took me to an overall FIREFOX account page - wherein NO LONK there referred AT ALL to POCKET. </p><p>I 'SAVE' to my pocket (ICON) almost daily. NEVER need any kind of sign in for this. NOW I want to LOOK AT / READ some of these - BUT FIND NOWAY TO GET THERE. ICON omly SAVES a page. </p><p>Ridiculous.

I like the feature where if I saved the password, Firefox automatically puts them in for me, but for some unknown reason, the settings keep reverting back and removing this option.  It does not save my preferences so if I restart my computer, I have to change the settings again which is getting frustrating. Is there anything I can do to make this option permanent? Thanks for any info and have a great day Kind Regards John </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1130;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",johnattard
