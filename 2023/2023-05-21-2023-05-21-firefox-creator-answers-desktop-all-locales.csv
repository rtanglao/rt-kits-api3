Too much contrast, too vibrant. I checked all my settings on my monitor, and all is as it should be. I'm a photographer and aware of image quality and settings. Still images are perfect and the monitor displays stills correctly. My monitors are working fine. When I checked videos via Google Chrome, they all displayed perfectly. So, I can only deduce that it's a Firefox browser issue. I haven't added any new add-ons or extensions. I know that the browser has updated at least twice in recent weeks.    </p><p>I have attached a screen shot of the difference between a chrome and firefox video. Please help.
