It comes out of nowhere on all different sites (it has happened 6 times and all were different sites), but it usually is only once a day though tonight it happened twice within an hour. Moving the mouse all over the place makes it worse with more copies. It also slows all response from my computer to several seconds no matter what I try (closing the browser, opening task manager, etc). Sometimes I can get to the reboot screen and do it there, but most of the time everything is so slow I have to hit the power button on my HP which is the standby or sleep button so when I hit it again, I am at the login screen and can reboot there. </p><p>As I said, a single reboot normally solves the problem for the rest of the day or several days until tonight. I have a basic wired scroll mouse that I'm wondering if pressing down on it is causing Firefox to glitch. Otherwise, I've got no idea. Firefox has updated to 119, Windows 11 has updated a couple of times, my NVIDIA GeForce card driver updates weekly. I have no malware or viruses on my PC. Nothing is pulling hard on my resources as it only pulls 40% of my memory max when checking it in Task Manager when I can get it to open. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1190;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",scott_smart2000
