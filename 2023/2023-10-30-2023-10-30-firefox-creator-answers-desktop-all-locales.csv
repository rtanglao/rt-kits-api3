Extremely frustrating. </p><p>In my experience, in some ways, sync acts more like a backup program, that deletes whatever is in the destination that is not in the source.  I'm my mind, syncing should have an option to go in only ""one direction"", in this case, from my desktop to my mobile, <strong>not</strong> which one is the latest, which seem to be happening here. </p><p>There should also be an option to '<em>combine </em> the data from the two sides. </p><p>I'd really like to get some feedback on the this.  Perhaps I'm doing something wrong.  If so, please help me deal with this. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1190;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",noel_envoide

A temporary workaround is to maximize the window using either of these methods: </p> <ul><li> right-click the thumbnail image of the Window that floats above the Windows Taskbar button, then click Maximize (if there are numerous windows open, there will be a list of titles instead of thumbnails, but same method) </li><li> while the window is active, press Alt+Spacebar to call up the window control menu, then click Maximize </li></ul> <p>In the past, I've given the advice that you could bring the window back into view using the window control menu (Size, then right arrow, etc.). However, I discovered today that this wasn't practical because a window was so far offscreen to the left.  </p><p>While the window was maximized, I used the web console (Ctrl+Shift+K) to capture the left and top positions of the window. Then I click the restore button on the title bar, the window vanished, and I re-ran the commands (without the benefit of being able to see, of course), and then I re-maximized the window. The news was bad: </p><p>Maximized: </p><p>09:43:15.730 window.screenX 09:43:15.756 -8 09:43:20.347 window.screenY 09:43:20.380 -8 </p><p>Restored: </p><p>09:43:37.429 window.screenX 09:43:37.457 -31164 09:43:40.811 window.screenY 09:43:40.833 484  </p><p>What would be perfect in this situation would be to run the JavaScript command </p><p>window.moveTo(0,0);  </p><p>to pop the window into the upper left corner of the screen. But actually, this is considered the same as the page doing it, and pages are barred from using this method unless the window was launched by a script in the first place. That command <em>does</em> work in the <em>Browser Console</em> (Ctrl+Shift+J), but only if you have enabled the command line, which most user will not be aware of. (And it didn't occur to me in the moment so I proceeded with the next step...) </p><p>In my case, I quit Firefox and edited the xulstore.json file to fix this problem so that the window would be positioned normally at the next startup. That is similarly obscure, but it's kind of obvious once you get in there with a text editor. </p> <blockquote><img src=""https://assets-prod.sumo.prod.webservices.mozgcp.net/media/uploads/images/2023-10-30-10-31-42-0567e1.png""></blockquote> <p>The difficulty of quickly getting your window back into view makes me think that Firefox needs some kind of failsafe to prevent invisible windows. I'll probably file a bug report for that, but wanted to document this story before returning to regular work. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1190;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jscher2000
