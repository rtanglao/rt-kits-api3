If the page is scrolled down, then one is able to view various details of all of the people logged-on, and, clicking on any one person takes you back to the map (very zoomed in) at their precise location. </p><p>My problem is that on two of my Windows PCs this does not happen.  When I log into the site I only see the world map but without any icons showing on it.    However, if I scroll down the page I can still see listed all of the current users and, clicking on any one of them takes me back to the map (zoomed-in) and shows me (presumably) their location. </p><p>I have asked the question of virtualflight.online why this may be the case and was given the following answer 'The ""who's online"" is incompatible with Firefox - not sure why. I think it's to do with Firefox not implementing some of the scalable vector graphics interface properly.' </p><p>I would be grateful if you could give me some advice on this? </p><p>I also run Firefox on my iPhone and that opens up the web page exactly as it should and shows me immediately who is on-line and where they are 'flying'. &nbsp;??? </p><p>Many thanks, Tony </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",tony.farrington

My issue with that is that auto-fill keeps suggesting the address that I DON'T want it to. Specifically, I want ""ya"" to auto-fill to ""<a href=""http://ya.ru"" rel=""nofollow"">ya.ru</a>"", instead it keeps suggesting ""<a href=""http://yandex.com.ge"" rel=""nofollow"">yandex.com.ge</a>"". Now, I have tried deleting all the history of ever going to ""<a href=""http://yandex.com.ge"" rel=""nofollow"">yandex.com.ge</a>"" as well as just ignoring the issue and typing out the full ""<a href=""http://ya.ru"" rel=""nofollow"">ya.ru</a>"" by myself and giving Firefox some time to catch onto this, however after a couple of weeks nothing's changed. What's interesting is that when I type ""ya"" in the address bar, Firefox shows the following (in order): the wrong auto-fill suggestion (""<a href=""http://yandex.com.ge"" rel=""nofollow"">yandex.com.ge</a>""), some search suggestions (yahoo, yandex, yahoo mail, etc), then after the search suggestions there is a separator that says ""Firefox suggests"" and what do you think, the CORRECT auto-fill that I want is first right in there - ""<a href=""http://ya.ru"" rel=""nofollow"">ya.ru</a>"". So Firefox actually knows that I want it, since it's the first thing in ""Firefox suggests"", but why can I not get it as a default auto-fill suggestion? </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",arteq
