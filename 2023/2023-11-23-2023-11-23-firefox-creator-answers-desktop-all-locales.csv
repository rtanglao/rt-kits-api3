I can't think of anything I'm doing differently since before the crashes started. I can only assume that it started after a specific Firefox update. I do have a lot of windows/tabs open at once, but that was never an issue in the past. Occasionally individual pages will crash, usually several at once. The entire software crashes all at once regularly as well. Sometimes the crash seems to cause other issues, such as my computer hanging up for a bit, or my monitors going blank and the graphics system seeming to reset, before Firefox actually crashes. I don't always get a crash report dialogue when the whole thing crashes. </p><p>Most recent crash report ID: bp-bd37576c-c5ef-419f-a031-fe1910231123 </p><p>I keep my Windows and Firefox up to date. I tried turning off hardware acceleration, but I think that might have made it worse so I turned it back on. I cleared the caches (which took well over five minutes), and ran speedyfox a few times. I exit Firefox through File &gt; Exit whenever I need to restart or run other heavy software. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1200;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",klimber_2
