I store all my passwords using Firefox, there are several hundred of these. I have four devices a Windows 10 Laptop, A Win 11 PC, an Iphone and a PC. My Firefox login is stored on three of these devices, but not on my Windows Laptop. This means I can't access any account that used a password as I can't login to Firefox to gain access to these passwords.  When I try to change my Firefox password, it warns me that I may lose all my currently Firefox stored passwords. This is something I cannot risk.
