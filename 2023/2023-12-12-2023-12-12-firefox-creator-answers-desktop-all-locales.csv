As mentioned this has just started it has worked no problem from the change over from Hotmail to Outlook years ago up until about two weeks age. I am using an old version of Firefox 86.0.1 (64-bit) because I don't not like the layout of newer versions and 86 works for me and does what I want it too so you know ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"" anyway just of late I can not scroll my folders where I save emails and therefore have a hard time finding folders that don't show in the  navigation pane without scrolling you get the gist. As you can see in attached photo. I have done all the clearing of Cookies, Cached Web Content ect as mentioned in some google searches but still no go.  It's now a problem except I have found if I click on ""View"" and change the settings under Density to ""Compact"" all the folders in the nav pane show but even with my good reading glasses on the type is so small it's hard to read and I would prefer if I could just scroll the list of folders. Oh also I have not done any updates to Outlook, don't know if I can, or for that matter Firefox or any other app on my PC. </p><p>Many thanks in advance. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-860;firefox-8601;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Dungogvolts
