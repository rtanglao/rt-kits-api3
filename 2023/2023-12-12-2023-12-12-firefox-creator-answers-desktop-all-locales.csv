This also adds it to the download history.    I have set the <strong>about:config</strong> flag <strong>browser.download.start_downloads_in_tmp_dir</strong> to true so the files I just open and don't want to permanently download don't clutter my <strong>$HOME/Hämtningar</strong> (downloads) folder. I tried to first prevent that by selecting the default action to do when tasked to open a PDF, but that didn't fix it, so I set the <strong>about:config</strong> flag. Unfortunately, setting the default action stopped Firefox from opening a PDF inline without downloading it and I cannot find any option along the lines of ""Preview in Firefox"" (as described in <a href=""/en-US/kb/new?title=How+do+I+OPEN+and+read+pdf+docs+on+line+rather+than+download%2C+save+and+then+read+and+delete.+This+only+happens+on+some+sites+%26+started+recently."" class=""new"" title=""Page does not exist."" rel=""nofollow"">this support article</a> ). </p>",desktop;beta;other;firefox-1210;,firefox,other,en-US,1623723;,christian.lampe

As you can see in attached photo. I have done all the clearing of Cookies, Cached Web Content ect as mentioned in some google searches but still no go.  It's now a problem except I have found if I click on ""View"" and change the settings under Density to ""Compact"" all the folders in the nav pane show but even with my good reading glasses on the type is so small it's hard to read and I would prefer if I could just scroll the list of folders. Oh also I have not done any updates to Outlook, don't know if I can, or for that matter Firefox or any other app on my PC. </p><p>Many thanks in advance. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-860;firefox-8601;,firefox,other,en-US,1623696;1623712;1623714;,Dungogvolts
