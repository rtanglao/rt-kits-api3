It is a similar problem others have had in the past, and no solutions have come up that worked. I can print double-side/duplex in other browsers, and this feature used to work with firefox in the past. I updated the Brother drivers. Is there anyone who knows how to fix this issue? It seems like others have commented on it happening with other Brother printers with Firefox. </p><p>If you reference this question (Duplex printing not available on default Firefox profile) and others on the support site, the option does not show up in the print menu, or if using the system dialogue. Please help! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1120;firefox-11201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",write.isamel

I have attempted to live stream to my Facebook groups using Zoom many times. It never connects. Zoom opens a ""Connect to Facebook"" page that will not connect. I can copy the url into a different browser (Chrome, Edge, etc) and it works fine. I have cleared the cache, uninstalled and reinstalled Zoom, and the live stream fail continues. </p><p>Is there any way to fix this, or is FireFox going by by like its predecessor Netscape did? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1120;firefox-11201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",danielkilburn
