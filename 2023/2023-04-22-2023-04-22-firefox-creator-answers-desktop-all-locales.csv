I always have to fill in the log in page twice, the first attempt always disappears after I get the""Authenticating your device"" message; I have to accept cookies every step of the way and once I have eventually logged in to the site I have to accept cookies every time I move from one page to another in the website. I have tried clearing all history and have also completely removed and installed Firefox all to no avail.  I contacted NSandI but they assure me the problem lies at my end and I am sure they are right because if I log on to the site using Chrome none of these problems arise. This is the only website I have such problems with when using Firefox/ Duck Duck Go which is my default browser. Can you assist me in finding a solution please rather than the obvious one of not using Firefox. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1120;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",grtate

Not with other browsers and, with the Internet Download Manager extension, I'm usually able to download multimedia content in FF. (That's been my workaround.) </p><p>For example, when loading this humble URL ... <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/d/d8/Plattenknistern_record.ogg/Plattenknistern_record.ogg.mp3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/d/d8/Plattenknistern_record.ogg/Plattenknistern_record.ogg.mp3</a> ... if I have autoplay enabled, it'll crash right away (""Your tab just crashed""), without autoplay, it'll crash as soon as I hit play. Until a few days ago, no crash report was created under about:crashes, but, after upgrading to 112.0.1, I've finally been able to submit a crash report: <strong>bp-203a462b-e949-47b0-90f3-a99760230422</strong> </p><p>No difference if I create a new user profile and disable add-ons. Disabling hardware acceleration doesn't help either. I can't do without most of my settings and add-ons, so refreshing FF is not an option. I'd sooner try a new install (and then import my profile and reinstall add-ons), but that's laborious and not guaranteed to solve the problem. </p><p>(I've submitted this question before, about half a year ago - now archived -, but that didn't go anywhere for lack of crash diagnostics.) </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1120;firefox-11201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",fucsi

Oggi vado su <a href=""http://wordpress.com"" rel=""nofollow"">wordpress.com</a>, clicco in alto a destra su ""accedi"" e mi si apre una pagina bianca con al centro il logo ""W"" di Wordpress, senza la finestra di login nè alcuna altra possibilità di fare alcunchè.  Ho provato e riprovato, ma niente.  Ho provato anche a disattivare i componenti aggiuntivi di Firefox sia uno alla volta che tutti insieme: niente. Ho provato anche con la navigazione in anonimo: niente. Ho provato sul cell, e lì non c'è problema, la finestra di login si vede.  Ho un Mac e uso Firefox. Per curiosità, ho provato anche con Safari, ma mi esce una pagina con la scritta ""Il browser non supporta la pagina"" (ma da Safari me lo aspettavo... ed è il motivo per cui non lo uso mai). Cosa posso fare? Grazie a chi mi vorrà aiutare. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1010;firefox-7815;firefox-78150;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,it,1576866;,lube61

I started realising that some passwords were for the wrong site. I have a different password for each website which I mentally compute. When I saw that websites weren't letting me in with saved passwords, I went to see the password manager and the saved password IS definitively one of my passwords, since it is in the right format, but certainly IS NOT for that website.  It only happened for at least 3 websites, more like 5-6 (it started by me having to reset several passwords, which I never had to do before) so it could not possibly have been me saving a wrong password for a different site by mistake. I don't think it could be done even if I wanted to.  I checked random entries in the password manager and all seem to be ok, except the ones I remembered were wrong. I think it is Firefox for Windows that is doing this, since one of these sites I access only from PC. But clearly, I can't be sure, since they synchronise across platforms. Most wierd that no one else complains about this problem. I can't think of how I could be doing this myself.

And worse; it can't maintain a connection to Gmail which forces me to completely restart the browser every day. Mention this to Mozilla support and all you get from the devs is, ""I don't experience this (on my high-end dev system) so it can't exist"". Yeah, I'm running Firefox in the 2GB left over on my 8GB laptop - how hard can it be to write efficient code.. memory hog or slightly worse memory hog isn't much of a difference to me. </p><p>And of course I cant get the extensibility I used to have; and the constant pestering every-single-time the browser gets focus to do an upgrade.
