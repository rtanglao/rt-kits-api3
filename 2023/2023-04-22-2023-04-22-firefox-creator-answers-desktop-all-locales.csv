I've also read other similar articles but they didn't work either.

I started realising that some passwords were for the wrong site. I have a different password for each website which I mentally compute. When I saw that websites weren't letting me in with saved passwords, I went to see the password manager and the saved password IS definitively one of my passwords, since it is in the right format, but certainly IS NOT for that website.  It only happened for at least 3 websites, more like 5-6 (it started by me having to reset several passwords, which I never had to do before) so it could not possibly have been me saving a wrong password for a different site by mistake. I don't think it could be done even if I wanted to.  I checked random entries in the password manager and all seem to be ok, except the ones I remembered were wrong. I think it is Firefox for Windows that is doing this, since one of these sites I access only from PC. But clearly, I can't be sure, since they synchronise across platforms. Most wierd that no one else complains about this problem. I can't think of how I could be doing this myself. Thanks for any help </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1120;firefox-11201;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1576825;,george195

Time to pull the ripcord.,"<p>I came back to Firefox - which was my preferred browser for many years - because Chrome is a big fat memory hog, and would spend quite a while swapping pages into memory if it had been out of focus for a while. Opinions at the time varied widely, but suggested Firefox was more efficient. </p><p>Nope.. Firefox is at least as bad. And worse; it can't maintain a connection to Gmail which forces me to completely restart the browser every day. Mention this to Mozilla support and all you get from the devs is, ""I don't experience this (on my high-end dev system) so it can't exist"". Yeah, I'm running Firefox in the 2GB left over on my 8GB laptop - how hard can it be to write efficient code.. memory hog or slightly worse memory hog isn't much of a difference to me. </p><p>And of course I cant get the extensibility I used to have; and the constant pestering every-single-time the browser gets focus to do an upgrade. Going back to Chrome; though I expect things to get shaken up for the better soon enough (so over this old-skool grind with poorly functional, slow and unreliable software: bring on the AI) </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1100;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1576828;,rwhitebrook
