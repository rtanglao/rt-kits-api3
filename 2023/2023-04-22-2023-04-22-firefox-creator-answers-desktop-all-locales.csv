I have attempted to live stream to my Facebook groups using Zoom many times. It never connects. Zoom opens a ""Connect to Facebook"" page that will not connect. I can copy the url into a different browser (Chrome, Edge, etc) and it works fine. I have cleared the cache, uninstalled and reinstalled Zoom, and the live stream fail continues. </p><p>Is there any way to fix this, or is FireFox going by by like its predecessor Netscape did? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1120;firefox-11201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",danielkilburn
