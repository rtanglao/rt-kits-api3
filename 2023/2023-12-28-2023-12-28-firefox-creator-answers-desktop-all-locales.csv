I also use Firefox on my IOS phone.  </p><p>After an update (I don't know which one, updates are frequent), the app on my phone stopped showing my passwords for most of my accounts. For example, in the passwords section of my Firefox IOS app, it would show the names of the over 100 websites I had saved logins for, but would say there was nothing saved as an email/username or password, just empty boxes. There were 8 logins for accounts I had created on my phone, and those ones did display.  </p><p>I eventually got tired this and tried to sync my account so I would have all of the passwords I saved on my laptop and on my phone, but Firefox, instead of combining the over 100 logins on my laptop with the 8 logins on my phone, removed all of the over 100 logins I had saved on my laptop and replaced them with the 8 logins that were saved on my phone. My phone also still has the 8 logins. </p><p>Now I am missing most of my logins, including the email accounts I used and passwords. This is a big issue for me because I've used multiple emails across my accounts. Resetting all of my passwords will be impossible, and I need to access the over 100 saved logins that are no longer on any of my devices. </p><p>I followed the instructions in the ""Recover user data missing after Firefox update"" support page. The only other profile that showed up for me has no logins saved at all, so that's a dead end. I read other pages about ""wrong way syncing"", but its too late for me to try to tell Firefox my laptop was the master account because the damage is already done.  </p><p>I need to know if there's a way to recover my profile with all my accounts. Please, share any information that could be helpful. I need it badly. </p><p>Edit: grammar mistakes </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1210;,firefox,sync,en-US,1627065;1627073;1627077;,jessupfamily129

I've deleted cookies for both the employer and the third-party two-factor authentication tool (OKTA), but I can't seem to kill it.  The reason I think this is a Firefox issue rather than a Microsoft issue is that I never used Teams with Chrome or Edge and they do not have this spurious connection.  Any suggestions?

Every single OTHER folder and bookmark within NOT called ""mobile bookmarks"" IS transferring!!! Worst is 1) I didn't start these bookmarks on the computer I'm using...and use 'sync' but no one ever told me that would become a dodo bird distinction when it comes to easy bm transfers.  I have tried saving it in JSON or plain text  on desk top as new folder and again, it just doesn't like the particular Foolhardy file from any otherwise complete 'add to Chrome from Firefox"" etc. There's some dudes on a google search on this with a converter, but it doesn't do a darn thing, and no clear way to contact them ""if somethings not working"".  My concern is if I can't get this bookmark folder to convert out of mobile format, its pretty pathetic, meaning it is trying to make me stay within Firefox/Mozilla format....ugggh! </p>",desktop;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1626938;1626939;,buggeroff6969

Other tumblr domains (such as specific blogs like [username].tumblr.com or their support database <a href=""http://help.tumblr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">help.tumblr.com</a>) all load fine, it's just specifically the main page/dashboard that won't load. Likewise, when I go to my own blog domain, the blog and all pages load just fine EXCEPT for the ask page, which displays the same error view in the ask box field with the rest of the page loading like normal (see attached screenshots). </p><p>I have done standard troubleshooting including clearing my cache (this did not work), reloading in troubleshooting mode to determine if the issue is being caused by one of my extensions (it does not appear to be), and refreshing firefox (also did not work). I can load tumblr just fine on both their mobile app and through firefox mobile, and I can load all other websites with no issues on my laptop, and I have confirmed with other firefox users that they are not experiencing the same issue. It's literally just 1) my laptop, 2) on firefox desktop version only and 3) this specific site. I've exceeded my own ability to troubleshoot this issue and would appreciate any advice on how to fix this. </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1210;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1626980;,laurali.bean
