Every single OTHER folder and bookmark within NOT called ""mobile bookmarks"" IS transferring!!! </p><pre>  Worst is 1) I didn't start these bookmarks on the computer I'm using...and use 'sync' but no one ever told me that would become a dodo bird distinction when it comes to easy bm transfers.  I have tried saving it in JSON or plain text  on desk top as new folder and again, it just doesn't like the particular Foolhardy file from any otherwise complete 'add to Chrome from Firefox"" etc.  There's some dudes on a google search on this with a converter, but it doesn't do a darn thing, and no clear way to contact them ""if somethings not working"".  My concern is if I can't get this bookmark folder to convert out of mobile format, its pretty pathetic, meaning it is trying to make me stay within Firefox/Mozilla format....ugggh! </pre>",desktop;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1626938;1626939;,buggeroff6969

Some type of bug or coding problem.  This began happening 3-4 months ago.  It used to work fine on FireFox.  Would love to stay using FireFox and avoid the Safari thing.  Love the browser!!!

1435096,2023-12-27 16:16:15 -0800,2023-12-27 16:16:15 -0800,Cannot load tumblr,"<p>I cannot access <a href=""https://www.tumblr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.tumblr.com</a> or <a href=""https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.tumblr.com/dashboard</a>, I just get a Server Not Found error. Other tumblr domains (such as specific blogs like [username].tumblr.com or their support database <a href=""http://help.tumblr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">help.tumblr.com</a>) all load fine, it's just specifically the main page/dashboard that won't load. Likewise, when I go to my own blog domain, the blog and all pages load just fine EXCEPT for the ask page, which displays the same error view in the ask box field with the rest of the page loading like normal (see attached screenshots). </p><p>I have done standard troubleshooting including clearing my cache (this did not work), reloading in troubleshooting mode to determine if the issue is being caused by one of my extensions (it does not appear to be), and refreshing firefox (also did not work). I can load tumblr just fine on both their mobile app and through firefox mobile, and I can load all other websites with no issues on my laptop, and I have confirmed with other firefox users that they are not experiencing the same issue. It's literally just 1) my laptop, 2) on firefox desktop version only and 3) this specific site. I've exceeded my own ability to troubleshoot this issue and would appreciate any advice on how to fix this. </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1210;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",laurali.bean
