Even click and drag only works ONE bookmark at a time (it just disappears if I drag a bunch whether 10 or 4000!). </p><pre>   I am trying to get the bookmarks easily onto other browsers such as Chrome, Yahoo or lastly, gmail.  All of these have the simplest of directions, either to ""export as HTML"" or as JSON (from Fri the 13th?!).  In any event, they worked with ALL other bookmark files/folders, but not the ones within the mobile bookmarks on f.fox.    How in heck am I going to be able to export them in a significant #, if Mozilla doesn't have a feature to correct them out of whatever gosh darn format they're in, and let them be unencumbered for direct ""export to"" or ""import to"" settiings on other browsers or from the mac/firefox ""save as new file"".    At first I thought it was the fact that bookmarks for the mac also get designated as icloud if I move them to desktop sometimes (i.e there's a cute little icon on desk above file/name/pic.  I don't think that is the case as the other bookmarks I've sent would have failed (but they didn't).   Isn't there a simple app that can extricate these ""mobile bookmarks' as they certainly are NOT, and were not posed to me as a issue when I started using SYNC! </pre>",desktop;download-and-install_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1210;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",buggeroff6969

I've looked up and down my files and I can't find it anywhere; I don't have it as a shortcut. I use it everyday via the taskbar, but I nothing seems to help me find it.

This left me with a sessionstore.jsonlz4 file consisting of no open tabs but with an enormous closed window full of tabs.

I've done it many times.  However, this time I'm finding that the only way to access Recently Closed Windows seems to be to first Restore Previous Session, and the only way to Restore Previous Session seems to be to have at least one tab in the sessionstore file that is not in a closed window.  Therefore, I cannot access the tabs in my sessionstore file.  </p><p>The best solution I can think of would be to edit my sessionstore file so that it contains at least one tab that is not closed.  This would allow me to Restore Previous Session, and then find the tabs I want under Recently Closed Windows.  However, I do not know how to edit a sessionstore file.  </p><p>Specs: MacOS Monterey 12.6.9 Firefox 121.0 </p>",desktop;tabs;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1210;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",matthewtiscareno

Every single OTHER folder and bookmark within NOT called ""mobile bookmarks"" IS transferring!!! Worst is 1) I didn't start these bookmarks on the computer I'm using...and use 'sync' but no one ever told me that would become a dodo bird distinction when it comes to easy bm transfers.  I have tried saving it in JSON or plain text  on desk top as new folder and again, it just doesn't like the particular Foolhardy file from any otherwise complete 'add to Chrome from Firefox"" etc. There's some dudes on a google search on this with a converter, but it doesn't do a darn thing, and no clear way to contact them ""if somethings not working"".  My concern is if I can't get this bookmark folder to convert out of mobile format, its pretty pathetic, meaning it is trying to make me stay within Firefox/Mozilla format....ugggh! </p>",desktop;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1626938;1626939;,buggeroff6969
