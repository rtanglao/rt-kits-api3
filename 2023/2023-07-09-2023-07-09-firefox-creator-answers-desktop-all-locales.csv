This morning when I opened my WIN 7 HOME tower PC, and </pre> <p>opened FIREFOX, I saw the notice that this latest release is the latest for WIN 7. That's fine, but I wish to tell you something about WIN 7 PRO &amp; MICROSOFT. </p><pre> Evidently, there is some major user of WIN 7 PRO who has demanded that MICROSOFT continue to support this version.  I have two H-P laptops, which I use for Ladder programming. Both are loaded with WIN 7 PRO, </pre> <p>and both receive periodic updates from MICROSOFT.  So, it would seem that ALL support for these older releases of Windows has not ended. </p><pre> I am in the process of moving all my files &amp; applications from this WIN 7 HOME PC to my WIN 10 tower PC. </pre> <p>THANK YOU. robert herold  17mkombi@gmail.com   OR   rhh.jr5387@gmail.com </p><p>P.S.  Had no problem porting the FIREFOX data to the 10, but had a lot of problems doing the same for THUNDERBIRD on this PC to the 10, despite getting assistance from your tech people. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1150;firefox-11501;,firefox,other,en-US,"",KARL_TAUSCHEN
