If I sign-in the two profiles using one common Firefox account, this seems to be impossible: a change of the language setting in one profile immediately reflects into the other profile. Is there a way to disable the sync of language? I want histories and bookmarks to be synced across the profiles and thus I want to use the same account. Thank you. </p>",desktop;sync;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-10213;firefox-102130;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",kazuma.tateiri16
