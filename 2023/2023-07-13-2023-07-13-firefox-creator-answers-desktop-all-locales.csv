What really won me over was the Primary Password feature, so that my saved passwords will be safe. But I'm a little confused: When I open Firefox, the dialog box comes up asking me for my Primary Password. As soon as I type the first two characters of my password, the browser is totally unlocked. I can either type in the rest of my password at that point and press Enter, or I can just press the Cancel button. Either way it only needs the first two characters of my password to unlock Firefox. That doesn't seem very secure. Is there any way to set it to require my entire password? </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1150;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1590290;1590297;,scott185
