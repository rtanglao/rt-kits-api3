This morning, following a firefox update, I was told there was a new version available. When I clicked the link I was shown ver 115. I did note that there is a ver 116 when I checked the drop down menu. A few moments ago I clicked an update to latest version link here and got the same version I have and from the firefox help menu I see that my firefox is up to date. So the obvious question is, do I even bother to dl ver 116? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1150;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Rosaliy-Lynne

I have always used Firefox to access the ""SOLD"" listings in Ebay like the item I'm going to sell.  Recently when I look at the SOLD listings the ""see original listing"" option is not there.  I need to access this information to decide what price I'm going to ask for my item!  I talked with Ebay and they walked me though the issue.  In order to determine if it was an Ebay problem or a Firefox problem I opened Chrome and did the same search.  I was able with Chrome to ""see original listing"" so this is obviously a Firefox issue.  Since I've been using this information for over 10 years, it must be a recent update that caused me to lose this function.  i've used Firefox exclusively for all my browser use.  I don't want to change to Chrome!  Help! </p><p>Rachel </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,other,en-US,1590229;,rachel38
