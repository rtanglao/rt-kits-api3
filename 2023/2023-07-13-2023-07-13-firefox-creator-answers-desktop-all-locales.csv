S podporou ESET jsme vyloučili vliv samotného produktu ESET a vzhledem k tomu že v jiných prohlížečích funguje bezproblemově soudím že musí být problem v samotném Firefoxu.

What really won me over was the Primary Password feature, so that my saved passwords will be safe. But I'm a little confused: When I open Firefox, the dialog box comes up asking me for my Primary Password. As soon as I type the first two characters of my password, the browser is totally unlocked. I can either type in the rest of my password at that point and press Enter, or I can just press the Cancel button. Either way it only needs the first two characters of my password to unlock Firefox. That doesn't seem very secure. Is there any way to set it to require my entire password? </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1150;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1590290;1590297;,scott185

I have always used Firefox to access the ""SOLD"" listings in Ebay like the item I'm going to sell.  Recently when I look at the SOLD listings the ""see original listing"" option is not there.  I need to access this information to decide what price I'm going to ask for my item!  I talked with Ebay and they walked me though the issue.  In order to determine if it was an Ebay problem or a Firefox problem I opened Chrome and did the same search.  I was able with Chrome to ""see original listing"" so this is obviously a Firefox issue.  Since I've been using this information for over 10 years, it must be a recent update that caused me to lose this function.  i've used Firefox exclusively for all my browser use.
