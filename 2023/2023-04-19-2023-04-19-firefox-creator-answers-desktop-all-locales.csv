Melyik verzió váltásánál, tehát mikor módosult ez? - és másodjára a sokkal fontosabb, hogy MIÉRT kapcsolták ki, ha már az be volt nekem kapcsolva? </p><p>Ugyanis pont úgy alakult, hogy decembertől a múlt hétig csak a mobilomon (Android készülék) használtam Mozilla böngészőt.  Az otthoni Linux-os webes böngészőt külföldi tartózkodás miatt nem használtam. Most viszont rendkívül meglepődve tapasztaltam, hogy a jelszavaimat védő biztonsági funkció, azaz a Mester jelszó funkció valamiért NEM működik. Megnéztem a beállítások közt és akkor láttam, hogy most már Elsődleges jelszó néven van, de számomra teljesen érthetetlen módon INAKTÍV.

Viszont az rendkívül felháborít, hogy értesítés nélkül egyszerűen kikapcsolták a már korábban beállított biztonsági funkciómat. Miért tették ezt? S miért nem figyelmeztettek erre? Ugyanis ez komoly veszély forrás lehet, és akár akaratom ellenére hozzáférhetnek a jelszavaimhoz. Most már ismét beállítottam egy fő jelszót, de elfogadhatatlannak tartom, hogy egyszerűen kikapcsolásra került egy verzió frissítéssel. </p><p>Kérem jelezzenek vissza, hogy MIKOR történt ez a változtatás, és miért nem maradt bekapcsolt állapotban a név változtatáskor? </p><p>Köszönettel, Timon Bence </p>",linux;desktop;customize;needsinfo;firefox-1120;firefox-11201;,firefox,customize,hu,1576329;1576334;1576339;,bence.timon

And sometimes when I hit clear all history, the back arrow is still lit up as if you can indeed go back to a previous page. Clicking away from that tab and then back appears to fix the issue, but it did confuse me the first time it happened. Doesn't seem to be an every time thing though. But I did think you guys should know that it happens. Might be something that will be fixed in the next update, maybe. But I'd never seen that happen before so I figured I'd mention it here so you guys can be aware of it. and go from there. </p><p>Mild edit: Seems I spoke too soon as now it <em>is</em> becoming a thing that happens every time I hit clear now when I clear the history. It even happened just as I did so while clearing the history here. I'll include a pair of screen grabs. Normally when I hit clear now on the clear all history, the back button is grayed out. But it isn't doing it anymore. Again, not sure if this is a glitch or what, but it's getting annoying as I have to navigate away from the most recent tab and then back to it to get it to gray out properly.  I have included two screenshots. The first shows the back button as active even though I had just hit 'clear now' after clicking on clear all history. The second image shows it properly grayed out as it should normally look after doing so. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1120;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Marc7

When accessed from the Internet, one has to authenticate but authentication is bypassed when accessing on LAN.  So obviously, we have split DNS. </p><p>The Problem: I first accessed the site before I switched on VPN and hence Firefox resolved the site via the Internet route.  Since I could find my RSA token to login, I connected to VPN (non-captive portal).  I then refreshed the site but still got the Auth page.  I navigated to `about:networking#dns` and clears DNS cache.  I then closed the tab where I was getting the Auth page and opened a new one to access the service.  However, I still got the Auth page.  On clisking the Refresh button in the Firefox DNS about page, I saw it was still pulling in the external IP.  So decided to wait until it expired from the cache - hit the refresh button until it disappeared all on its own.  I then closed the tab again and opened a new one, and still got the Auth page as it still resolved to the external IP again. </p><p>While all this happening, running `dig`, `nslookup`, and `getent`, all return the LAN IP to the service but Firefox insists on resolving to the internet address. </p><p>What gives???
