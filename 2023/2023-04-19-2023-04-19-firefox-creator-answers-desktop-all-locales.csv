I the drag and drop the second window to monitor 2 and maximize it..in the older version of firefox (pre 112.0.1) I could go back to the taskbar on monitor one, hover over the firefox icon and it would show two mini versions of my two open windows. Both windows would remain open, nothing would change. But now when i hover over the icon I still get two mini firefox windows but when i hover my cursor over the left mini window (which shows monitor 1) the main window on monitor 2 closes (minimizes) automatically...and vice versa...how can i fix this?? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1120;firefox-11201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",timmermanwoodcraft1

Meant to type ""^"" when writing an equation? Well, too bad, you accidentally pressed ctrl instead of shift, you are now on the 6th tab of your whole browser, and you gotta go find the tab you were on. The ctrl+page up/down hotkeys are slightly less annoying, although still very infuriating.

And sometimes when I hit clear all history, the back arrow is still lit up as if you can indeed go back to a previous page. Clicking away from that tab and then back appears to fix the issue, but it did confuse me the first time it happened. Doesn't seem to be an every time thing though. But I did think you guys should know that it happens. Might be something that will be fixed in the next update, maybe. But I'd never seen that happen before so I figured I'd mention it here so you guys can be aware of it. and go from there. </p><p>Mild edit: Seems I spoke too soon as now it <em>is</em> becoming a thing that happens every time I hit clear now when I clear the history. It even happened just as I did so while clearing the history here. I'll include a pair of screen grabs. Normally when I hit clear now on the clear all history, the back button is grayed out. But it isn't doing it anymore. Again, not sure if this is a glitch or what, but it's getting annoying as I have to navigate away from the most recent tab and then back to it to get it to gray out properly.  I have included two screenshots. The first shows the back button as active even though I had just hit 'clear now' after clicking on clear all history. The second image shows it properly grayed out as it should normally look after doing so. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1120;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Marc7

When accessed from the Internet, one has to authenticate but authentication is bypassed when accessing on LAN.  So obviously, we have split DNS. </p><p>The Problem: I first accessed the site before I switched on VPN and hence Firefox resolved the site via the Internet route.  Since I could find my RSA token to login, I connected to VPN (non-captive portal).  I then refreshed the site but still got the Auth page.  I navigated to `about:networking#dns` and clears DNS cache.  I then closed the tab where I was getting the Auth page and opened a new one to access the service.  However, I still got the Auth page.  On clisking the Refresh button in the Firefox DNS about page, I saw it was still pulling in the external IP.  So decided to wait until it expired from the cache - hit the refresh button until it disappeared all on its own.  I then closed the tab again and opened a new one, and still got the Auth page as it still resolved to the external IP again. </p><p>While all this happening, running `dig`, `nslookup`, and `getent`, all return the LAN IP to the service but Firefox insists on resolving to the internet address. </p><p>What gives???  Is there another hidden page that I need to reference??? </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1120;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ak.mozilla

In order to go full screen I have to click on the resize button twice. Okay, not a biggie, just annoying. I've looked at some suggestions attached to other similar requests, but nothing fixes this. I know of nothing that I did that bring this on. I feel it started with the recent upgrade. I wonder if other users have had a similar experience. Thank you for any suggestions.
