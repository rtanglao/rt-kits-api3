In order to go full screen I have to click on the resize button twice. Okay, not a biggie, just annoying. I've looked at some suggestions attached to other similar requests, but nothing fixes this. I know of nothing that I did that bring this on. I feel it started with the recent upgrade. I wonder if other users have had a similar experience. Thank you for any suggestions.

Now that I have decided that FF is what I want, I'm trying to get it working properly.  The big hangup is the bookmarks, I had trouble importing bookmarks and it looks like I have a bunch of menus. I have one bookmark that is set but it does not come up in the menu.  In manage bookmarks, I find that I have several menus linked one to another.  Is there some way to incorporate the menus into one? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",DandZS
