I need to know if mozilla/firefox is censoring my sites and if so WHY? They display fine in other browsers. I used the developer console to identify the issue, seems that firefox is altering the html <img> data to not display the link banner.

I subsequently spent some days reorganizing and editing the bookmarks but inadvertently deleted a large subfolder from these. Of the number of options to get that back I see there are 10 or so recent bookmark backups I can try restoring from. The folder I want exists in one of those, but I will also have lost many recent edits. Is there perhaps a way to view both bookmark trees side-by-side, or a way to restore bookmarks selectively or to a different location than the bookmark root? </p><p>(I know I can back up what I have now, restore an older version, manually copy out the missing folder, restore my new version and reinsert the lost data, but hoping for less work) </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",tns1

The ""Enable Container Tabs""  option is missing in the Tab section in Settings. There is a notification ""Your browser is being managed by your organization.""  Thus, the lack of container tabs may be due to corporate policy. However, I  don't see anything on the Active Policies page except one irrelevant record: ""InstallAddonsPermission	Default	false.""   Additionally, ""Container Tabs"" are unavailable only in Firefox. Nightly has them.  But, Nightly is not officially supported by my company.  I have tested several corporate PC and different versions of Firefox and Nightly. Is it a weird Firefox bug or something else? </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1180;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",YDUBINSKY

However, the SSD is only large enough to run windows and a few other core programs, therefore all other memory mostly must run on the exrernal drive.     Despite the the format, can the external drive be used in a windows format instead of explorer. That was my friends indication.
