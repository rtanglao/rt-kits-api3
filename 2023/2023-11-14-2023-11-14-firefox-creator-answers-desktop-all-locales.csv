There nothing to help on the email page.,"<p>How can you find the place to compose and send an email.   This may be the 16th time I've asked.  Used to be on the header of the email listing to compose.   You clicked it and a form showed up.   Now there is no place you can send an email unless you go to the list of all the emails you've ever sent and then send from there.   If you have a new email person not on the listing,   can you install an app on the header above the inbox email or somewhere like we used to get before you changed the appearance of how the emails look.  This is from G. Stewart at hickorystewart@charter.net.   This 10:04pm on 11/13/23 </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",hickorystewart

There's no button to push like compose at the top of the email page like there used to be so we could write an email and send it.,"<p>This is the concern that we have asked about  10 or 20 times today.   Where do you find the place to compose and send an email.   There used to be a header over the email page that you could click and then you could write and send an email.   No longer.  This is a big problem.   There's a big listing of past email addresses, but if you have to send a new email,   where does one start?   from hickorystewart@charter.net </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",hickorystewart
