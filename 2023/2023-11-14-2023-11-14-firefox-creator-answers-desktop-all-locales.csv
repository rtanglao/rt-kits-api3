I'm running Firefox 119.0.1 on Windows 11 Pro (48GB RAM, Ryzen 3900X, RTX 2060) and it's happened for multiple sites, including Duo security and <a href=""http://WebAuthn.io"" rel=""nofollow"">WebAuthn.io</a>. Though I have been using my hardware keys for quite a while, I had never seen that dialogue before the past day or two (""touch your security key to begin with [X site]"") and I have not had (and still do not have) similar issues when using the Brave browser (1.60.114). Typically, It would ask me to select among the verification options (using my phone, using a dedicated hardware key, or a QR code) that Windows knows, then I would be asked to insert and tap my key, but that doesn't seem to be happening anymore. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,other,en-US,"",misterlindon

There nothing to help on the email page.,"<p>How can you find the place to compose and send an email.   This may be the 16th time I've asked.  Used to be on the header of the email listing to compose.   You clicked it and a form showed up.   Now there is no place you can send an email unless you go to the list of all the emails you've ever sent and then send from there.   If you have a new email person not on the listing,   can you install an app on the header above the inbox email or somewhere like we used to get before you changed the appearance of how the emails look.
