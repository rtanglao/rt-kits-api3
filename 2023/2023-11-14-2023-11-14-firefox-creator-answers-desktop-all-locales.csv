I put Youtube tutorials in my rightmost screen and have unreal engine open in my leftmost screen. I use my keyboard keys to pause the videos so I can type stuff or make changes as I follow along tutorials. Each and every time I hit pause/play this popup appears in the top-left of my leftmost screen showing a picture of the video that I have open (why this redundancy....I have it full screen already on screen), it shows a huge title of the vid (again with the redundancy I don't need another title of a vid that I am watching to keep appearing), it shows a rewind/play/fast forward which is really really poorly thought out.........we have those keys on our keyboard this just is more stuff blocking our view. All of these things block out the top left stuff in my window (file/edit/asset/window/tools/help)...its so large it blocks out all tabs open in this window...its so large it even blocks out part of my viewport and other areas in that vicinity. Now all of these things it blocks out are important and I need to use them. When I pause vid I am immediately needing to use things in this space. This pop up however just sits there...you can't click it or do anything to get rid of it...it provides NO useful info...it forces you to keep stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...stopping...waiting...Yes this is exactly how it feels when using it. </p><p>Then you turn it off using the solution: media.hardwaremediakeys.enabled = false  and your buttons also stop working. So now you cannot pause/play without mousing off screen to YouTube and manually restarting. </p><p>So my first and most important question is how to HIDE not disable the use of the buttons associated with this.  </p><p>My second question that I really want to put in all caps with expletives and maybe copy and paste the question like 5000000 times so that the amount of frustration this causes on a  constant basis with every workflow that I need to use vids as part of it...is WHYYYYY?!?!?!  </p><p>Ait now that last bit was for flair but I'm not even really joking with that one. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,customize,en-US,1617907;,jacobmentalconstruct

I'm running Firefox 119.0.1 on Windows 11 Pro (48GB RAM, Ryzen 3900X, RTX 2060) and it's happened for multiple sites, including Duo security and <a href=""http://WebAuthn.io"" rel=""nofollow"">WebAuthn.io</a>. Though I have been using my hardware keys for quite a while, I had never seen that dialogue before the past day or two (""touch your security key to begin with [X site]"") and I have not had (and still do not have) similar issues when using the Brave browser (1.60.114). Typically, It would ask me to select among the verification options (using my phone, using a dedicated hardware key, or a QR code) that Windows knows, then I would be asked to insert and tap my key, but that doesn't seem to be happening anymore. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,other,en-US,"",misterlindon

Used to be on the header of the email listing to compose.   You clicked it and a form showed up.   Now there is no place you can send an email unless you go to the list of all the emails you've ever sent and then send from there.   If you have a new email person not on the listing,   can you install an app on the header above the inbox email or somewhere like we used to get before you changed the appearance of how the emails look.
