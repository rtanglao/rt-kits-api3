I have Sumatra PDF set up in Windows as my default PDF viewer. </p><p><a href=""https://vdocuments.net/dowland-john-lute-fantasie-p71pdf.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://vdocuments.net/dowland-john-lute-fantasie-p71pdf.html</a> </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,customize,en-US,1571434;,Highland_Itinerant

Starting in the last few weeks (I don't know when exactly, sorry), I now get this error message (in the stream Event log) when I stream: </p><p>Too low key frame rate (currently 0.13 key frames/second; recommended minimum 0.25 ) </p><p>And I get a separate warning from Facebook that the key frame rate is too low, and will result in poor video quality. </p><p>If I stream from Chrome, I don't get the error (but Chrome has other problems), so I think it must be related to Firefox.  Is there anything I can do about it?  Thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1110;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",paulmchamb

1408527,2023-03-19 23:59:43 -0700,2023-03-20 02:44:12 -0700,Can I change the the full-screen video mode or force which GPU is used for playback?,"<p>Hi&nbsp;:) </p><p>I use Firefox on my Asus laptop running Windows 10. It's one of these laptops with both integrated and dedicated graphics (Intel plus Nvidia). </p><p>I often experience this issue when putting a video in full-screen (especially when viewing trailers on Steam, but this may just be because I mainly use my Windows laptop for gaming, and thus most of my video consumption here is from steam). This screen will briefly (for less than one second) turn black and audio will pause before the video appears in full-screen, and playback resumes normally. </p><p>It ""feels"" like a GPU switch is taking place, I'd assume from the integrated graphics to the GeForce card. This is not the proble. The issue appears when I return from full-screen mode. I always have several Command Prompts open with SSH connections to my Linux server and sometimes my MacBook Pro. These windows are now empty. That is, all text is gone, and I can no longer interact with the sessions. They're not ""broken,"" as in they're not saying ""Not responding"" and don't ask to be forcefully closed, they're just black windows with borders around them. All I can do is close them all down and open new ones to reconnect and start over from where I think I remember I was. </p><p>I should note that this doesn't ONLY happen with Firefox videos going into full-screen, it has also happened after launching a game and returning to the desktop. This strengthens my belief that this has to do with GPU switching and/or video ""mode"" change(s). </p><p>Assuming I'm correct (my IQ is 5,000 and I do do the very big brians), is there any way to control how videos go into full-screen in Firefox? Or ""lock it"" to a specific GPU? I've rummaged through about:config and haven't seen anything that seems directly relevant. </p><p>I've already tried using the Windows settings to tell the system that Firefox.exe should use the integrated Intel graphics only, but this has no effect.  </p><p>I remember I used to use ""Media Player Classic"" many years ago, and it had a slew of options of how to render full-screen video. IIRC, it had stuff like ""Overlay,"" ""Windowed,"" ""Windowed borderless,"" ""DirectX,"" etc. This make me wonder if there's multiple ways of chosing how to render video in full-screen, then maybe one could direct Firefox to use a different one than the default and my problem might disappear? Or maybe one could tell Windows that if an app wants to go into full-screen video mode, Windows should pick a specific mode for it? </p><p>I'm not a Windows developer, so I don't know&nbsp;:) But I'm hoping someone has a good tip, because I'm finding myself using this system more and more, and this is my biggest problem with it currently. </p><p>Thanks in advance&nbsp;:) </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,customize,en-US,1571431;,DemDarnInterwebs

This didn't happen until I went to version 11.4.18 of NoScripts and Version 111.0 of Firefox (both at same time).   All 8 tabs load when I initially start FF 111.0.  All tabs reload with no problems when I initially start or restart FF with Noscripts active.  It is only after FF been running for an hour or so that tabs stop reloading.  I do have another addon running called tab reloader.  Addon tab reloader and the FF reload icon both stop working after FF runs for awhile.  You will see the web page name in bottom left corner of screen and an hour class on tab.  Stop NoScripts, the hour class goes away and all tabs reload, both with the FF tab reload icon and the tab reloader addon.    </p><p>I thought it might be the tab reloader addon, so I set 8 tabs to reload every 10 seconds for awhile, just a couple minutes.  NoScripts was running.  This didn't cause a problem, everything was reloading.  So I set tab reloader back to reload 8 tabs every hour, No scripts still active.   </p><p>Come back in a little over an hour and the FF tab reload isn't working as described earlier.  Stop NoScripts and tabs finish reloading. </p><p>Now is this a Noscript 11.4.18 or FF 111.0 issue, I did both at same time.  Prior to that I was on FF 110.0.1.  Currently running Windows 10 64 bit, haven't done the March update as nothing much there.  All was fine until FF and NoScript update.  All is fine until FF runs for awhile.  For now I just turned NoScripts off. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",diverjer

Due to unforeseen circumstances, I had to reset my PC. Upon doing that and downloading Firefox all of my data is gone. Bookmarks, saved logins, etc. all gone. I thought once I logged into my Firefox account everything would be there. I've logged into my account on other computers in the past and all my stuff was there but not this time. Now it's saying all of my stuff (profiles, etc) was created today. Is my stuff really gone forever? I thought the whole point of the Firefox account was so I could just login and have everything sync. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1110;,firefox,sync,en-US,1571417;,HoennMaster
