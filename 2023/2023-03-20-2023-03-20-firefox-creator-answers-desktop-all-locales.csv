This didn't happen until I went to version 11.4.18 of NoScripts and Version 111.0 of Firefox (both at same time).   All 8 tabs load when I initially start FF 111.0.  All tabs reload with no problems when I initially start or restart FF with Noscripts active.  It is only after FF been running for an hour or so that tabs stop reloading.  I do have another addon running called tab reloader.  Addon tab reloader and the FF reload icon both stop working after FF runs for awhile.  You will see the web page name in bottom left corner of screen and an hour class on tab.  Stop NoScripts, the hour class goes away and all tabs reload, both with the FF tab reload icon and the tab reloader addon.    </p><p>I thought it might be the tab reloader addon, so I set 8 tabs to reload every 10 seconds for awhile, just a couple minutes.  NoScripts was running.  This didn't cause a problem, everything was reloading.  So I set tab reloader back to reload 8 tabs every hour, No scripts still active.   </p><p>Come back in a little over an hour and the FF tab reload isn't working as described earlier.  Stop NoScripts and tabs finish reloading. </p><p>Now is this a Noscript 11.4.18 or FF 111.0 issue, I did both at same time.  Prior to that I was on FF 110.0.1.  Currently running Windows 10 64 bit, haven't done the March update as nothing much there.  All was fine until FF and NoScript update.  All is fine until FF runs for awhile.  For now I just turned NoScripts off. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",diverjer

Due to unforeseen circumstances, I had to reset my PC. Upon doing that and downloading Firefox all of my data is gone. Bookmarks, saved logins, etc. all gone. I thought once I logged into my Firefox account everything would be there. I've logged into my account on other computers in the past and all my stuff was there but not this time. Now it's saying all of my stuff (profiles, etc) was created today. Is my stuff really gone forever? I thought the whole point of the Firefox account was so I could just login and have everything sync. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1110;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",HoennMaster

It keeps my bookmarks, theme and what extensions are installed, but again all of my new tab shortcuts and my extension are reset, which is a pain in the rear for extensions like NoScript and taking the time to rebuild all of the new tab shortcuts.  </p><p>Is there any way to set a device as the primary to push out to others or download those settings to avoid having to set them up again? </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",travis.sadlowski
