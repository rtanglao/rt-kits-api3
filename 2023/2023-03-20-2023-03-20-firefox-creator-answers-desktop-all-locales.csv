I am not sure at this point if it is Firefox or Yahoo.  I use Yahoo as my home page and my e-mail address.  It keeps signing me out and then I cannot sign in without restarting the computer  sometimes more than once.  When Yahoo loads, it doesn't load the pictures, etc. that are normally to the left of the story headline.  Facebook is the same way.  I do have some add ons from Firefox and not sure if one of them is causing an issue.  I cannot even talk to  Yahoo as they will only help if you have a paid account - which I do not.  I play some games on line and issues with those also.  I really do not want to use Edge or anything else.  I really like Firefox, but not sure what is going on.

It's one of these laptops with both integrated and dedicated graphics (Intel plus Nvidia). </p><p>I often experience this issue when putting a video in full-screen (especially when viewing trailers on Steam, but this may just be because I mainly use my Windows laptop for gaming, and thus most of my video consumption here is from steam). This screen will briefly (for less than one second) turn black and audio will pause before the video appears in full-screen, and playback resumes normally. </p><p>It ""feels"" like a GPU switch is taking place, I'd assume from the integrated graphics to the GeForce card. This is not the proble. The issue appears when I return from full-screen mode. I always have several Command Prompts open with SSH connections to my Linux server and sometimes my MacBook Pro. These windows are now empty. That is, all text is gone, and I can no longer interact with the sessions. They're not ""broken,"" as in they're not saying ""Not responding"" and don't ask to be forcefully closed, they're just black windows with borders around them. All I can do is close them all down and open new ones to reconnect and start over from where I think I remember I was. </p><p>I should note that this doesn't ONLY happen with Firefox videos going into full-screen, it has also happened after launching a game and returning to the desktop. This strengthens my belief that this has to do with GPU switching and/or video ""mode"" change(s). </p><p>Assuming I'm correct (my IQ is 5,000 and I do do the very big brians), is there any way to control how videos go into full-screen in Firefox? Or ""lock it"" to a specific GPU? I've rummaged through about:config and haven't seen anything that seems directly relevant. </p><p>I've already tried using the Windows settings to tell the system that Firefox.exe should use the integrated Intel graphics only, but this has no effect.  </p><p>I remember I used to use ""Media Player Classic"" many years ago, and it had a slew of options of how to render full-screen video. IIRC, it had stuff like ""Overlay,"" ""Windowed,"" ""Windowed borderless,"" ""DirectX,"" etc. This make me wonder if there's multiple ways of chosing how to render video in full-screen, then maybe one could direct Firefox to use a different one than the default and my problem might disappear? Or maybe one could tell Windows that if an app wants to go into full-screen video mode, Windows should pick a specific mode for it? </p><p>I'm not a Windows developer, so I don't know&nbsp;:) But I'm hoping someone has a good tip, because I'm finding myself using this system more and more, and this is my biggest problem with it currently. </p><p>Thanks in advance&nbsp;:) </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,customize,en-US,1571431;,DemDarnInterwebs
