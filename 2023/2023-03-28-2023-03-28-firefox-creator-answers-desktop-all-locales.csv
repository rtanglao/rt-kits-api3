Today I tried it out on Chore and I had zero issues withe playback.  </p><p>I can only come to the conclusion that firefox has cocked summat up. This is only been happening for the past past month or two. </p><p>I don't know if it's anything to due with Nvidia software or not but it needs to be sorted out.
