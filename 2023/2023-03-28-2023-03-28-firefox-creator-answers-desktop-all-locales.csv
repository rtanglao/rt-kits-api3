For some strange reason, even though I have it set to Allow that website to have access to my Built-In microphone, I get a pop-up error window ""Unable to setup microphone!"" when I try to record. It's simply refusing to acknowledge the Permission setting. </p><p>What's strange is that I *am* able to record a video and within that video, the audio IS recorded, so Firefox is allowing access to my camera AND my Built-In microphone when recording a video. The url is *exactly* the same for Camera Permissions and Microphone Permissions in Firefox Settings. Weird, right? </p><p>It is ONLY when I try to record a voice-over (audio ONLY) that it won't allow me to do so. I have to switch to Safari. I'd like to stay on Firefox and not have to switch back and forth. Any ideas how to fix this? I've cleared my cache, restarted my iMac, removed website from Permissions then put it back on. </p><p>Firefox is up-to-date: 111.0.1 (64-bit) MacOS Big Sur Version 11.7.4 (iMac) </p><p>Should I uninstall Firefox then re-install it? And, if so, will it keep my Bookmarks, Toolbar sites, info, etc? I read some instructions for Windows PC, but couldn't find anything re: a Mac re-install or ""Clean Re-Install"" for iMacs. Thanks in advance for any help! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",lab58604

Previously, if any nickname disappeared, then if you entered it again, it was saved. I'm not talking here about saving the auto-completion of the nickname and password. Only about the nickname (login). I don't want to save passwords on all pages. On google chrome everithing it's ok. Nicknames not disappeared. Only nicknames (logins) are stored there. Until recently, firefox was also preserved. Please fix this issue. I am already tired of writing all the nicknames every time.

I thought this was just a Youtube issue but then I decided to boot up Edge and Brave to see if the issue still persisted. It doesn't. What happens in those browsers is that there is that the bottom part of the video is darkened just enough so that when the chapters are displayed there is enough contrast to read them. In Firefox this overlay cuts out before it reaches the chapters making them very difficult to read. I tried in Troubleshoot Mode and the issue persists.  </p><p>I've linked pictures that demonstrate the difference. </p>,desktop;beta;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1120;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",MonsieurJambon
