1409341,2023-03-27 20:54:26 -0700,2023-03-27 20:54:26 -0700,Youtube Chapters Hard to Read in Firefox,<p>I've been noticing for a while that Youtube chapters were very hard to read if they were displaying over a white background. I thought this was just a Youtube issue but then I decided to boot up Edge and Brave to see if the issue still persisted. It doesn't. What happens in those browsers is that there is that the bottom part of the video is darkened just enough so that when the chapters are displayed there is enough contrast to read them. In Firefox this overlay cuts out before it reaches the chapters making them very difficult to read. I tried in Troubleshoot Mode and the issue persists.  </p><p>I've linked pictures that demonstrate the difference. </p>,desktop;beta;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1120;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",MonsieurJambon

Lately I noticed that my video rate was too low and the play back was skipping and stopping.  I run a 64gb Nvidia graphic card so it cant be that. </p><p>I normally run firefox and it's always the latest release. Today I tried it out on Chore and I had zero issues withe playback.  </p><p>I can only come to the conclusion that firefox has cocked summat up. This is only been happening for the past past month or two. </p><p>I don't know if it's anything to due with Nvidia software or not but it needs to be sorted out. I've been using firefox since it started. I'm used to the ecosystem. I don't want to have to adjust to chrome. </p>,desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",kakashi
