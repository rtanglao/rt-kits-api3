It should be pretty simple. I have a bunch of folders that I add bookmarks to. I can see all the folders when I add another bookmark. But that's it. They are not available to go to, to find a bookmark. There are no folders. There are a bunch of bookmarks listed in ""always show"". Then if I do a search for answers, the answers do not address the issue bc it seems everyone who uses firefox has the same issue. My bookmarks aren't ""hidden"". What I need is to see the same setup with my folders when I want to find a bookmark that I see when I'm saving a bookmark, instead of scrolling through 1000 bookmarks with no context.  (There is also no way for me to delete or clean up folders.) I need to access all the information I have stored in an organized, productive, fast way. It appears there are a lot of other frustrated people on these discussions with the same issue. I couldn't find any information or discussion of a system for clicking on something, opening up a folder, and clicking on the needed bookmark. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",karenbensonstudios
