When I synced firefox settings, and transferred all of my passwords. On the computer I transferred the passwords to (new firefox download on new installation), it states (in firefox security section) that all of my passwords were used on the date I did the sync. I am wondering if the sync made it look like I used the passwords on that date, or if the party that did the reinstall (a local computer store) tried to hack my accounts and passwords. I am changing the most sensitive account passwords, but there are so many passwords it would take me many hours to do so. If someone can confirm that the sync made it look like the passwords were used to access the accounts, but the accounts were not actually accessed, I do not have to worry. However, if the sync process does not make it look like all of my passwords were used, then I need to be concerned about my accounts being hacked. If someone can help me with this I would appreciate it. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",leiko49

If I quit Firefox and relaunch, it functions normally, but then slows down again.  I'm on a Mac running System 10.14.6, and I have a Dashlane extension mounted in the browser.  Once I've engaged Dashlane, Firefox seems to slow down quickly, so I am wondering if the problem is partly the way the two are interfacing, or if there are other factors. </p><p>Chrome runs normally, as does Thunderbird--only Firefox seems to be struggling right now.  Can you help? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1014;firefox-1150;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1589190;,melissaj2

It should be pretty simple. I have a bunch of folders that I add bookmarks to. I can see all the folders when I add another bookmark. But that's it. They are not available to go to, to find a bookmark. There are no folders. There are a bunch of bookmarks listed in ""always show"". Then if I do a search for answers, the answers do not address the issue bc it seems everyone who uses firefox has the same issue. My bookmarks aren't ""hidden"". What I need is to see the same setup with my folders when I want to find a bookmark that I see when I'm saving a bookmark, instead of scrolling through 1000 bookmarks with no context.  (There is also no way for me to delete or clean up folders.) I need to access all the information I have stored in an organized, productive, fast way. It appears there are a lot of other frustrated people on these discussions with the same issue. I couldn't find any information or discussion of a system for clicking on something, opening up a folder, and clicking on the needed bookmark. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1589179;,karenbensonstudios
