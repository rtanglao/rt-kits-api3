After spending too many hours trying all the leads provided online, and not being too familiar with some terminology, I am bewildered.  Instead of a simple set of instructions, I  am tasked with deleting something.  Wha??  I don't wish to delete something, I simply would like to dump the contents of the old data file that appeared when I re-installed F back, and be rid of the nag. Had I had been warned that this problem would occur, I would never have re-installed FF.    I wound up with something that contradicts its premise; delete what?  The title to Restore FF Profile  is misleading. Logically, here should be a link to click on to re-install the old files, or better yet, they should have been installed automatically.  The file folder raises the question, why even have it?  It's useless.  If it had a list of extensions that were deleted, it would be helpful.  Luckily, I hand copied the extensions, recalling that many years ago, they disappeared down the rabbit hole, never to be seen again I apologize for being ungrateful, as FF and the work done by volunteers  is most appreciated. but wasting what little time I have here on earth is not good for the psyche. If there is a simple, understandable solution, it would be most appreciated. Thank you, Nick M. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1160;firefox-11601;,firefox,other,en-US,"",mr.nick

The size of the bookmarks toolbar cannot be changed. I've found solutions online that unfortunately I cannot use on my pc due to limitations.  <a href=""https://github.com/xiaoxiaoflood/firefox-scripts#instructions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/xiaoxiaoflood/firefox-scripts#instructions</a> Is there a way to edit the width of the toolbar in the firefox setting without the need of any script? The aim is to have multiple lines available in the bookmark toolbar so I can see all saved bookmarks there (I had three lines before changing PC and I managed to do so by modifying firefox' settings only, but it was a long time ago). Thanks! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1150;firefox-11503;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",mattto
