The size of the bookmarks toolbar cannot be changed. I've found solutions online that unfortunately I cannot use on my pc due to limitations.  <a href=""https://github.com/xiaoxiaoflood/firefox-scripts#instructions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/xiaoxiaoflood/firefox-scripts#instructions</a> Is there a way to edit the width of the toolbar in the firefox setting without the need of any script? The aim is to have multiple lines available in the bookmark toolbar so I can see all saved bookmarks there (I had three lines before changing PC and I managed to do so by modifying firefox' settings only, but it was a long time ago). Thanks! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1150;firefox-11503;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",mattto
