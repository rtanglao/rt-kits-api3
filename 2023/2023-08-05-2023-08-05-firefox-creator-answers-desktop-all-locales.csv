After spending too many hours trying all the leads provided online, and not being too familiar with some terminology, I am bewildered.  Instead of a simple set of instructions, I  am tasked with deleting something.  Wha??  I don't wish to delete something, I simply would like to dump the contents of the old data file that appeared when I re-installed F back, and be rid of the nag. Had I had been warned that this problem would occur, I would never have re-installed FF.    I wound up with something that contradicts its premise; delete what?  The title to Restore FF Profile  is misleading. Logically, here should be a link to click on to re-install the old files, or better yet, they should have been installed automatically.  The file folder raises the question, why even have it?  It's useless.  If it had a list of extensions that were deleted, it would be helpful.  Luckily, I hand copied the extensions, recalling that many years ago, they disappeared down the rabbit hole, never to be seen again I apologize for being ungrateful, as FF and the work done by volunteers  is most appreciated. but wasting what little time I have here on earth is not good for the psyche. If there is a simple, understandable solution, it would be most appreciated. Thank you, Nick M. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1160;firefox-11601;,firefox,other,en-US,1595179;,mr.nick
