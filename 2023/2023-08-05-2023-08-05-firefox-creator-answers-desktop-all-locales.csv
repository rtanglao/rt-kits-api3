As soon as the screen goes full, where ever my mouse pointer is sitting, a small tool tip window opens up that shows the page url, or other kind of gibberish that I have no idea how to describe.  It will stay on the screen no matter what, until I click to exit full screen mode of the video. </p><p>I have replicated this with Youtube, Netflix, Hulu, or any other social media page with video links, or any other website with an imbedded video that I can make full screen.  I have tried it in Incognito mode and standard mode and it is always the same.  Click full screen, tool tip appears.  Every.  Time. </p><p>The only way I can get it to not appear is to immediately swipe my mouse pointer to the bottom right corer of the screen immediately after clicking the full screen button.  If I am fast enough it will either not show, or I get it to show on the edge of the screen where it can't be seen, but I'm not sure.  This has been extremely frustrating having to constantly switching from full screen to non-full screen repeatedly to time it just right to not have this appear and stay on my screen.   </p><p>Please tell me there is a way to stop this from happening.  It has been many, many months this has been going on.  I probably couldn't even remember the last time I didn't have to deal with this.  I've kept my browser up to date, I've turned off all extensions, used the Troubleshooting mode, everything except uninstalling and reinstalling the whole browser.  I'd much rather not have to deal with that and hope you can help.  I have been a loyal user of Firefox browser for nearly 17 years (probably more) and I will not use any other site.  Please help me to stop going crazy every time I want to watch anything in full screen. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1150;firefox-11503;,firefox,other,en-US,1595479;,tmoyer42

My logins were gone and copying and pasting the login.json with the key4.db files from other profiles didnt give them back. </p><p>Luckily am still logged into my mobile app where i have my logins but there is now a warning sign to reconnect to resume syncronizing and Im afraid if i reconnect its going to delete my saved logins on the app instead of using them.  </p><p>What do i do now?

In any other browser (mobile, laptop, computer) if I click the button to go to the first unread message, I go to the first unread message. In Firefox, it depends. </p><p>- Most of the times it will just go to the top of the last page of the thread, even if there are 2, 5 or 25 messages that I've read earlier. It will not go to the actual first new post. - If there's a new page of the thread (let's say page 4/4) with posts, but there are unread posts at page 3/4, Firefox will go to the top of page 4/4 anyway. And I'll have to manually find out if I missed new messages at page 3/4. </p><p>This week I bought a new laptop (Windows 11) and I logged in at Firefox with the same profile, hoping that the new device would erase this 'unconvenience'. However, it didn't. This makes me believe that there's an option I clicked once on my older device (Windows 10), but can't find back. Can you wizards maybe tell me where to find this box I need to (un)tick to stop Firefox from doing this? I tried using Firefox on my Android mobile once, but it had exactly the same thing, so I stopped using that and swtiched to another browser. </p><p>Something strange at these same forums is that if I click ""Show threads with new posts"", it will give me a list. If I visit one of the threads, go back to the list and hit refresh, sometimes not only the thread I just read will go to 'read', but randomly one or more other threads will also show up as 'read', while I never touched it.

After spending too many hours trying all the leads provided online, and not being too familiar with some terminology, I am bewildered.  Instead of a simple set of instructions, I  am tasked with deleting something.  Wha??  I don't wish to delete something, I simply would like to dump the contents of the old data file that appeared when I re-installed F back, and be rid of the nag. Had I had been warned that this problem would occur, I would never have re-installed FF.    I wound up with something that contradicts its premise; delete what?  The title to Restore FF Profile  is misleading. Logically, here should be a link to click on to re-install the old files, or better yet, they should have been installed automatically.  The file folder raises the question, why even have it?  It's useless.  If it had a list of extensions that were deleted, it would be helpful.  Luckily, I hand copied the extensions, recalling that many years ago, they disappeared down the rabbit hole, never to be seen again I apologize for being ungrateful, as FF and the work done by volunteers  is most appreciated. but wasting what little time I have here on earth is not good for the psyche. If there is a simple, understandable solution, it would be most appreciated. Thank you, Nick M. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1160;firefox-11601;,firefox,other,en-US,1595179;,mr.nick
