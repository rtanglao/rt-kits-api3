I can't even find the previous profile.  I see only one file under Firefox\App\bin that says ""sqlite3.exe"" which I think is how they name themselves.  A rational person would name it PROFILE of course.  But we're in the realm of the insane.   </p><p>I do see ""profile"" in Firefox\Data though but its filled with dozens of files.
