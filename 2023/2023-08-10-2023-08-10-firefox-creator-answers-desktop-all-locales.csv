I had to redownload Thunderbird (Ver. 115.1.0) and eventually reconfigured it to talk to my <a href=""http://att.net"" rel=""nofollow"">att.net</a> server. It retrieved all the mail from the server but put it all in the one folder. I started creating sub folders from my memory (at 75 that ain't easy). Monday, when I shut down the computer, it ""updated"" windows again and once again Firefox and Thunderbird are gone, or at least all the data is gone, emails, bookmarks etc.    Does anyone know if there is a way to retrieve the old profile for both programs and is there a way to prevent Windows from EVER upgrading?

There was a time not too long ago where I ran for a City position in my local government and during this period of running for office I spent months learning the matrixes of operations necessary to understand IF someone (myself) was to run for and accept a seat in government tasked with the management of these complexities and challenges.  I took this on myself as a civilian who wanted to make a difference in the community where I reside.  Unbeknownst to me, when one from the outside enters the arena whether it's blatantly stated or left for your personal discovery, suddenly you've set yourself up as a target for Media persons and all sorts of other clandestine characters who might and absolutely do, walk into your life from this air; in and out, in and out.  As I was saying, I became close with many facets and fixtures within the community and at a particular point I realized they were so diligent about manipulating every aspect of this community, myself included, I suddenly realized I was surrounded by people who couldn't believe what I was saying was true:  I was being investigated by the ""Movers and Shakers"" of the small town where I reside.  They went so far as to insulate my attic and place cameras and wire taps inside and out I have aerial photos of strange automobiles in my driveway and neighbors informing me that people where entering my house while I was away from it.  The Mayor at the time had a relative on the Board of Directors at AT&amp;T and they illegally tapped my computer, car, phone, etc.   The question is, now that everyone is aware that they do this, how can I prove it to anyone who can make it stop?  How can I effectively prove this typesetting isn't being broadcast to some remote location where they continue to disrupt my personal life?   </p><p>Please say there is a way.  This is a big HUGE dilemma in society.  They don't care.  I do.   </p><p>Thank you </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1596615;,Trevor007
