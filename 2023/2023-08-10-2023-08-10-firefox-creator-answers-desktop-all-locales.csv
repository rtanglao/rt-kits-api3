Some strokes are one pixel in width, others two pixels. The letter 'o' becomes squashed on the right hand side for example. I've attached a screenshot. </p><p>I presume this is because when aa is disabled, font hinting becomes disabled as well. I would like to be able disable aa and keep font hinting enabled. </p><p>I like to disable aa because I have below average eye sight and I prefer to display text fonts with hard edges because I find it easier to read. </p><p>I'm on Linux, so ClearType options aren't available. </p><p>I've tried all the other fonts, they all come out with the same issue (displayed in that font of course). </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",infinitesimalau
