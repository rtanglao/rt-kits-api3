There was a time not too long ago where I ran for a City position in my local government and during this period of running for office I spent months learning the matrixes of operations necessary to understand IF someone (myself) was to run for and accept a seat in government tasked with the management of these complexities and challenges.  I took this on myself as a civilian who wanted to make a difference in the community where I reside.  Unbeknownst to me, when one from the outside enters the arena whether it's blatantly stated or left for your personal discovery, suddenly you've set yourself up as a target for Media persons and all sorts of other clandestine characters who might and absolutely do, walk into your life from this air; in and out, in and out.  As I was saying, I became close with many facets and fixtures within the community and at a particular point I realized they were so diligent about manipulating every aspect of this community, myself included, I suddenly realized I was surrounded by people who couldn't believe what I was saying was true:  I was being investigated by the ""Movers and Shakers"" of the small town where I reside.  They went so far as to insulate my attic and place cameras and wire taps inside and out I have aerial photos of strange automobiles in my driveway and neighbors informing me that people where entering my house while I was away from it.  The Mayor at the time had a relative on the Board of Directors at AT&amp;T and they illegally tapped my computer, car, phone, etc.   The question is, now that everyone is aware that they do this, how can I prove it to anyone who can make it stop?  How can I effectively prove this typesetting isn't being broadcast to some remote location where they continue to disrupt my personal life?   </p><p>Please say there is a way.
