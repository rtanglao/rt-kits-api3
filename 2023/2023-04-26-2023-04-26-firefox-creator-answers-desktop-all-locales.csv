1411793,2023-04-26 03:45:47 -0700,2023-04-26 03:45:47 -0700,Wikipedia and Fandom page previews appear to be entirely broken on Firefox specifically,"<p>Hi. I'm experiencing a minor but very noticeable issue with Wikipedia's (and to a lesser extent, Fandom)'s page preview functionality. For those of you who don't know the exact terminology, Wikipedia loads previews of hovered links when on desktop- it's extremely useful to prevent needing to load a separate tab when you can vaguely guess or get a grasp of the basics from just a single look at the starting paragraph. On Fandom wikis (which are extremely varied), it can also be helpful just to understand a single item in a game which has its own wiki page, or otherwise see otherwise webpage-bloating information without blowing up the amount of windows you have open. </p><p>Currently, neither are working on Firefox. I checked with Edge, and Wikipedia's previews work as intended. Hovering Wikipedia's internal links in Firefox results in the normal tooltip appearing (a small bar showing the title of the page being hovered). I have tried: </p> <ul><li> Checking the network page. There is no network request for a page showing when the link is hovered in Firefox, but there is a network request in Edge. </li><li> Messing with a few config settings in Firefox. None functioned well, though I'm sure I don't know every single one (I'm not very well-learned in regards to that.) </li><li> Clearing the cache, cookies, and more on Wikipedia. No changes. </li><li> Changing Wikipedia's internal Page Preview settings. No differences- though I did note there was no ""enable Page Preview"" link at the bottom of the page, which should have been there as per Wikipedia's own documentation. </li><li> Started Firefox multiple times in troubleshooting mode. It's not an extension issue, and behaviour did not change. </li><li> Manually turned off adblocking extensions. Nope. </li><li> Attempted to make the&nbsp;?debug=true portion of Wikipedia work. No javascript errors returned in the console, but there was also no javascript section to filter through so I'm not sure if I did it correctly. </li></ul> <p>I'm fairly certain this is a personal issue with my version of Firefox rather than a Wikipedia issue. If it was a Wikipedia issue, then it would definitely have more than around three results on a Google search. I also know as of a month or so ago that it worked on my other computer; this computer appears to have a fairly-well reported GPU memory leak in reference to Firefox, so I assume something there is going wrong. (The GPU memory leak should be fine. A restart and cleared memory on RAMMap fixes things up for the short term.) </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",josh22756
