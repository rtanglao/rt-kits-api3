I cannot access any command that directly relates to the underlying image and so I am not able to save it. The website developers assured me that with their own browser (not Firefox, I presume) the ""Save Image As..."" option is still available, suggesting me to install a different one. I believe the reason of this change in behaviour is because the mouse does not find a direct link to the image any more (as if there was a layer in between running a script to enlarge the image). </p><p>My question: is there any other way to access the menu option I need?

I keep <a href=""http://Ring.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Ring.com</a> open to the dashboard in a pinned tab. A few days ago, I had viewed and cleared videos as usual and later returned to view new activity. The site requires logging in every 30 days and so seeing that I needed to do so was not a surprise. What was a surprise was that the login buttons were grayed out. I closed the tab, cleared the Ring cookies and cache and tried again. No luck. I wondered if there was some other setting that I didn't know about and decided to open a private window and try it there. To my surprise, it works. I'm stumped. I'll attach the raw data from the private window as a .txt file. Darn. I can only attach an image. Well, I have it available and can copy and paste it into a subsequent post if you think it would help </p>",windows-7;desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1130;firefox-11301;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1581511;1581516;,lburg
