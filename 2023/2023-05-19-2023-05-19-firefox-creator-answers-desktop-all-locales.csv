The silly thing is that this only happens when I sign in and it doesn’t happen when I use chrome – although I prefer using Firefox, not least because the bookmarks sidebar is better. I have tried getting rid of all extensions and running in troubleshoot mode but without success. Any help/advice would be appreciated (as long as it is not about football!) </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11301;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",johnr4308

Here's more details about the specifics, and what I've found so far: </p> <ul><li> Some are more noticeable / louder than others (sometimes I second guess if I actually heard one, but others I'm certain because of how loud they are). </li></ul> <ul><li> I can go back and re-listen to the same audio squeaks at the time that it happened for non-live videos. I can go to the same spot in that video on a different browser, eg. brave, and it wont happen. Don't just say its part of the videos or playback because its not. <strong>Also I think this can kind of confirm its something that has to do with how firefox is interpreting the sounds being played on some sites.</strong> </li></ul> <ul><li> I have already tried to disable all extensions and modifications made in about:config, it still occurs (it isn't the fault of an extension/modification). </li></ul> <ul><li> I can pick up a recording of the high pitch sound in audacity loop-back (can see the peak in the recorded wave form). </li></ul> <ul><li> Its likely something to do with firefox's audio encoder or some audio setting (not super knowledgeable on any of the encoder stuff). </li></ul> <ul><li> SO FAR I have only gotten it to happen on twitch and youtube, doesn't even occur for video or audio in google drive even though the video player is literally the same video player as youtube. </li></ul> <ul><li> It still happens in troubleshoot mode / safe mode. </li></ul> <p>Some extra things I am certain of but want to make sure nobody asks because its a stupid question that should already be obvious: </p> <ul><li> Its not a headphone problem, only happens in firefox. </li></ul> <ul><li> A reinstall of firefox does nothing. </li></ul> <ul><li> Doubt its drivers because it only happens in firefox. </li></ul> <p>Honestly it could probably be something dumb so dont be afraid to tell me to update something if you can see something outdated in troubleshooting information attached (I dont know if everyone can see that). </p><p>If you have any ideas please let me know, thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1130;firefox-11301;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",sarrio
