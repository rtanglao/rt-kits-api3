I have a second filesystem mounted at /970 but trying to open any file whose URL starts with file:///970 elicits a ""File not found"" error message, e.g. ""Firefox can’t find the file at /970/stuff.jpg"".  Setting security.sandbox.content.level to a lower number (I've tried 0, 1, and 2) does not fix the problem.  I didn't have this problem with earlier versions of Firefox; it started after I upgraded to Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (x86_64)which got me a newer Firefox as well.  Chrome continues to open files in /970 with no difficulty. </p><p>mount information for / (which includes my home directory) and /970: /dev/nvme0n1p2 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,errors=remount-ro,stripe=32) /dev/nvme1n1p3 on /970 type ext4 (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,x-gvfs-show) </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1130;firefox-11301;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Tom239
