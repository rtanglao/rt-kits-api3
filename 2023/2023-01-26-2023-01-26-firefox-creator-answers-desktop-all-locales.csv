I can see them fine on my regular t.v. but now not on the laptop.  That's a huge change in the last few months because for years I could stream every Sling channel to my laptop.  Since my t.v. does not use Firefox, that suggests the problem is something Firefox has done.  Not surprising, I guess.  Probably happened when it was fixing some other something it screwed up.  Nonetheless, any ideas for how to resolve this WITHIN Firefox capabilities?  (And don't suggest it's Sling's fault.  Sling streams just fine, thank you very much, in Edge.) </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1090;,firefox,other,en-US,"",LManross

You can watch 'live' and watch recent programs. Playing live gives only few amounts of harddisk write access. However (!!!) when I playback a recent program, Firefox writes 55 Mbyte/s to 2 caches on  ..\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla and ..\AppData\Local\Mozilla. I was stupified when I discovered that 3 hours of watching recent programs wrote 1700 GB (1.7 TB) to my SSD by FireFox (according to Windows 10 Task Manager). This data is produced by FireFox since my 30 days usage of internet was only 30GB. I assume FireFox writes decompressed video to cache or something. I made a temporary fix by using symbolic links from ..\AppData to an old fashioned harddisk, which has a hard time writing, when looking ""non live"". I  looked if ZIGGO installed some kind of plugin, but could not find it. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1090;,firefox,other,en-US,1561814;,eofsfifx

How can I--or can I--set my Home Page to all the tabs open on both monitors and have clicking the Home button put me back to those two sets of tabs?  I can set Home on one monitor or the other, but there seems to only be one 'Home' slot and it evidently is whichever was more recently set using ""set home to current open tabs"" (I think that's close to the wording) </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1090;,firefox,other,en-US,1561815;1561820;,dennyw0713
