Some of the bold I knew to be there because I had personally put it in. </p><p>When I changed the skin, I was dismayed to find I could not only still not see bold, but I could no longer see italics with NVDA either. The AO3 sidebar menu was also tucked away behind a dropdown button, but I could open that up and get to the controls, so I didn't mind that so much. The formatting, however, posed a real problem, since italics are used for, among other things, emphasis, telepathic speech, and the speech of Pokémon in fanfics featuring humans who can understand Pokémon. So I definitely wanted this problem fixed. </p><p>I thought I could simply change the site skin back, but to my further dismay, switching back to the Default skin did not restore my former view of the site's pages. I began trying other things, seeking advice from other tech-savvy acquaintances after I'd exhausted all the possible fixes I could think of to no effect. Here is a list of everything I've already tried: </p> <ul><li> As mentioned before, changing the site skin back with the buttons on the site </li><li> Soft/Hard-Refreshing the page. </li><li> Logging out of and back into my AO3 account to artificially end the session. </li><li> Restarting the computer, and NVDA, by extension. </li><li> Disabling each of the three extensions I have in Firefox, just in case one of them had caused the issue. </li><li> Viewing the site while logged out to see if that made a difference. </li><li> Cleared browser cache, and when that failed to help, also cleared specifically the AO3 cookies. </li><li> Created a clean Firefox profile with no settings changed and no extensions added, pasted url of one of the pages I was using as a test into the address bar. Still no formatting visible. </li><li> Viewed page in Incognito mode. </li><li> Briefly thought I had a solution when I found the Page Styles submenu in the View menu, set the page to No Style. Got my old sidebar back, but not the formatting, and lost even that change after a refresh. Not ideal solution. </li><li> Downloaded the portable version of Firefox, opened it and pasted in a url again. Still no formatting. </li><li> Reluctantly, opened AO3 in Google Chrome. Could see all the formatting with NVDA when logged out, and when I logged in, could still see the formatting. </li></ul> <p>I also discovered Reader View while testing some of these things, and this allowed me to read the text of a fic or chapter with all its formatting, but that view doesn't include the Author's Notes, or the comments, and that sacrifices some of the nuance of those because I don't see the emphasis on any words/phrases without the formatting. </p><p>I have contacted the AO3 support team, but they are just as confused as I am and don't know what could have happened. They say they haven't changed anything on the site that they could pinpoint as causing this problem. </p><p>I have tried asking on the BlindTech email list I'm subscribed to, which is where I was given the link to Portable Firefox, but I have exhausted all their ideas as well, some of which were included in the above list. </p><p>Now I come to you. Please, if you can shed any light on what might have caused this problem, I would deeply, sincerely appreciate it. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1090;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",TheImaginatrix

When I first activate the camera, I am presented with a dropdown of available cameras. The USB camera appears in the list. All is fine. I instruct Firefox to ""allow"" this camera to be used. (first image) However, after a short time, less than a second, the same dialog is shown again, this time without the USB camera. (second image) There have been no actual hardware changes. I can then click ""allow"" again and the *integrated* camera works, i.e. not the desired camera. So, two questions, really. First, what just happened? Did Firefox try to control the USB camera, find that it couldn't, and redisplay the dialog showing only the ""controllable"" option? Second, my desired endpoint here is for the web site to use the USB camera. How do I achieve this?  I can easily do this with Chrome but I like Firefox.

Sometimes, totally out of control. </p><p>So, two questions: </p><p>1.  What is Mozilla's intended way for the user to terminate an autoscroll event? </p><p>2.

You can watch 'live' and watch recent programs. Playing live gives only few amounts of harddisk write access. However (!!!) when I playback a recent program, Firefox writes 55 Mbyte/s to 2 caches on  ..\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla and ..\AppData\Local\Mozilla. I was stupified when I discovered that 3 hours of watching recent programs wrote 1700 GB (1.7 TB) to my SSD by FireFox (according to Windows 10 Task Manager). This data is produced by FireFox since my 30 days usage of internet was only 30GB. I assume FireFox writes decompressed video to cache or something. I made a temporary fix by using symbolic links from ..\AppData to an old fashioned harddisk, which has a hard time writing, when looking ""non live"". I  looked if ZIGGO installed some kind of plugin, but could not find it. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1090;,firefox,other,en-US,1561814;,eofsfifx
