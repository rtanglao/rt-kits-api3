I am logged into a lot of places. </p><p>I am looking for how I can open new windows/tabs and when I close THEM THEIR cookies are deleted.   NOT the ones from other windows/tabs. </p><p>Selecting the `delete cookies when I close tabs` works, but each time I load Firefox I have to log back into a lot of things. So - to me - that isn't doing what I want. </p><p>I will accept that cookies I have. I want any NEW ONES I get from windows/tabs I open to be deleted when I close those windows. </p><p>Is this possible? </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1160;firefox-11602;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",teeny_weeny
