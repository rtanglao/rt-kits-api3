Many times I'm starting to write only to find out that I was on the wrong language. Checking the current language near the clock is annoying, so I'm looking for something that will indicate the current language I'm on before writing.

I was advised to stop using Adblock Plus. Adblock plus had an icon which I could click to see if it was working. uBlock Origin doesn't seem to have any visible icon.  The add ons manager indicates that uBlock Origin is the only enabled extension, but is it doing any advert blocking? Shouldn't there be a clickable icon? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1160;firefox-11602;,firefox,other,en-US,1597488;,Jacklx
