Video still works but even audio only streams produce no volume. As far as I've checked its only Firefox. All other browsers and media apps play sounds fine. Tried all the solutions in the help <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/fix-video-audio-problems-firefox-windows"" rel=""nofollow"">article</a> article . No luck. I have been using Firefox for 8 years now. Unfortunately, it seems I will have to abandon it soon. A lot of websites don't have compatibility with Firefox and now this.  Hopefully there's a simple solution and soon. It would be sad to see you go. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",hello.mioko

It's meant to look like the first image attached below, but when I try to open it in Firefox, it looks like the second image and I can't input my code. I'd like to be able to use Firefox for EVERYTHING but I end up having to use Chrome to access this site, which I use pretty much every day for work, and it's very inconvenient. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1592112;,nycarrington
