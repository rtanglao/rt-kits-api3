It says my account does not exist when I backspace there is a dialogue box that says the requested document is no available in Firefox cache. This is off and on sometimes it lets me in sometimes it does not I don't know of anything I'm doing differently to Firefox that would account for this missing document is this a problem with FB or FF or what? I've tried to find the cache and can't at least not so far and I can't find anything on the web that answers my problem about this situation so any help that would let me get into FB consistently and fix this problem would be highly appreciated. I have exactly the same problem with Edge, Chrome, Brave and whether or not I use privacy browser mode or not.

I've always had my bookmarks in a column on the left side of my screen. Yesterday I was unable to access my BT acount - which includes my emails via Firefox, wich is my default browser.

However my preference is to continue to use Firefox, and all other bookmarks worked witih Firefox, as did any other searches. The BT Helpdesk then talked me through resetting Firefox to Default  - which worked in enabling me access my BT acount - and my emails - but my bookmarks are now lined up at the top of my Firefox screen and I've spent / wasted  ages trying to get them back to the left side. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1592206;1592211;,patrick.grant5
