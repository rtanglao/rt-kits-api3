When I perform the procedure and give the new folder a unique name, the selected bookmarks appear in the generic ""Bookmarks Menu"" section and the folder I specified with the unique name is created but is empty.  Also, I cannot even store a single tab to an existing folder of Bookmarks.  When I select the existing folder after CNTRL+D, the bookmark just goes to my generic ""Bookmarks Menu"" section and not to the existing folder I selected.  I have reloaded Firefox but the problem continues.  Can someone help me?  Thanks. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",bobdawsonvenice

I read the notes to 118.0.2 but they offer no hints to me.   Could someone check and refix the bug fix? Or something. Thanks. Probably irrelevant but I'm running Windows 11 on a year-old HP laptop. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,other,en-US,"",nabristow
