Anyway i discovered that playing the same youtube video on my computer, the sound quality coming from Tor (based on Firefox 102.15.1) is much better than the sound coming from Firefox 118.0.2.

Flooded with hipsters from a lost generation of shiny and empty queer arguments the Mozilla project lost its tracks on providing technical, secure, and safe material to its community. Today I decided to remove Snap from my Linux box, consequently, Firefox. Then I went to install Firefox through Apt and I realized the ""apt"" is actually a ""transition package to snap""...fine. I then went to the website to download and install it manually (like the good old days), and then I realize there are no instructions for installing the package. You are supposed to figure that out by yourself... </p><p>Again, I give you that: the fact *is* silly, but is shows a broken system, and this broken system is done by those young hipsters full of schema, and colourful, and ""inclusive"" arguments that don't really care about the actual user but their own egos. For instance, go here: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/firefox/install-and-update-firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/firefox/install-and-update-firefox</a>. Go there, get your Firefox. And, please, notice that there is not *a single line* explaining how to install this thing. There is -- like every lazy tech company out there, profit from the ""free"" time of their costumers -- a list of ""#f*ckyourself"" articles to search for your answer... </p><p>That's just too much BS... especially for somebody that actually donate money to what once was a symbol of openess and dedication to users. This hipsters probably don't even know the relevance of Mozilla/Netspace to the world of open-source and freedom... I bet they/you don't... I actually get mad at me to allow these loosers to take over what was a awesome project. </p><p>With that, I quit Firefox and Mozilla. Until you refresh your cynical management and community leaders... </p>",linux;desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",kk.brandt
