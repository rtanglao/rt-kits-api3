Only the active tab is shown with a gray background. </p><p>I have found this bug (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1090432"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1090432</a>) from 8 years ago, which seems to be the same problem, but the fix described does not work: </p><p>In about:config, <strong>browser.tabs.drawInTitlebar</strong> is set to 0 (not true or false). If I set it to something else and back to 0, the blue color remains. If the value is not 0, one could argue that firefox should use the title bar color, but if it is 0, then the regular window color should be used. Also, regardless of which color ought to be used, the tab header is not connected to the window below, but separated using a blue separator, making the window exceptionally ugly. This is the case even when browser.tabs.drawInTitlebar is nonzero. </p><p>I have also created a 100% fresh profile, without addons etc, and the behavior is the same. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1153;firefox-11531;,firefox,other,en-US,"",rogier777

Flooded with hipsters from a lost generation of shiny and empty queer arguments the Mozilla project lost its tracks on providing technical, secure, and safe material to its community. Today I decided to remove Snap from my Linux box, consequently, Firefox. Then I went to install Firefox through Apt and I realized the ""apt"" is actually a ""transition package to snap""...fine. I then went to the website to download and install it manually (like the good old days), and then I realize there are no instructions for installing the package. You are supposed to figure that out by yourself... </p><p>Again, I give you that: the fact *is* silly, but is shows a broken system, and this broken system is done by those young hipsters full of schema, and colourful, and ""inclusive"" arguments that don't really care about the actual user but their own egos. For instance, go here: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/firefox/install-and-update-firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/firefox/install-and-update-firefox</a>. Go there, get your Firefox. And, please, notice that there is not *a single line* explaining how to install this thing. There is -- like every lazy tech company out there, profit from the ""free"" time of their costumers -- a list of ""#f*ckyourself"" articles to search for your answer... </p><p>That's just too much BS... especially for somebody that actually donate money to what once was a symbol of openess and dedication to users. This hipsters probably don't even know the relevance of Mozilla/Netspace to the world of open-source and freedom... I bet they/you don't... I actually get mad at me to allow these loosers to take over what was a awesome project. </p><p>With that, I quit Firefox and Mozilla.
