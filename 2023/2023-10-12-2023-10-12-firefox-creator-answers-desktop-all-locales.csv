When I perform the procedure and give the new folder a unique name, the selected bookmarks appear in the generic ""Bookmarks Menu"" section and the folder I specified with the unique name is created but is empty.  Also, I cannot even store a single tab to an existing folder of Bookmarks.  When I select the existing folder after CNTRL+D, the bookmark just goes to my generic ""Bookmarks Menu"" section and not to the existing folder I selected.  I have reloaded Firefox but the problem continues.  Can someone help me?  Thanks. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",bobdawsonvenice
