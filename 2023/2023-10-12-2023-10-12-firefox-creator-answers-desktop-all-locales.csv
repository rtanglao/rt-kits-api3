As noted, this anomaly also applies to Facebook messenger external news links.   Based on timing of this update 118.0.2 and the repeatability of the failure on various computers (with WIN11) and the absence of any other changes to all of the computers, all indicators are that this is not a Facebook issue and as nothing else on any of the computers has changed the 118.0.2 has an apparent issue. (In summary this effects every one of the 5 WIN11pro64 computers I have tested with the Firefox update, so far)... the only change to ALL OF THESE DEVICES was and is the Firefox update (118.0.2) .   </p><p>In addition have tested Firefox and Facebook on 2 additional computers (WIN764pro) - to keep comparative balance; on 1 win7pro64 unit  the Firefox app was not updated and on the other win7pro64 system it was updated to 118.0.2.  </p><p>And after that round of testing the outcome was conclusive - the Facebook external news links work seamlessly and without issues (NO UPDATE TO FIREFOX ON ONE COMPUTER with WIN7pro64 and an UPDATED Firefox (118.0.2) with WIN7pro64 on the other)... both systems worked and the noted failure was not present. </p><p>These tests conclusively indicate to us internally that updating the WIN 11 units to 118.0.2 was a mistake.  </p><p>Additionally for further comparison for this note - with Firefox update 118.0.2 Facebook external news links DO function on Opera and Chrome (for both WIN 7 and WIN11) all computers tested are the original 7 ... I have not tested other browsers for compatibility nor have I tested other computers, as the data seemed conclusive.   </p><p>NOTE: If you are planning to respond please do not 'guess' (SWAG) at what you randomly speculate the issue(s) might be, as that would be an unproductive use of everyone's time... if you don’t have a proven solution you don’t have a solution, thank you. </p><p>If there is someone with knowledge of the 118.0.2 update that can offer an intelligent and proven solution please do so here...  </p><p>but haphazard proposals of random unrelated experimentation without tested basis...or the concept of incorporating unproven suggestions such as maybe you should ""change this"" or ""reinstall this"" or ""blah blah"" when (I reiterate) the only changes to six (6) of these computers is the update 118.0.2 nothing else the seventh computer has an older version of Firefox and win 7 pro64.  118.0.2 functions correctly with win7pro64 and on Opera and Chrome browsers. </p><p>All intelligent proven workable input is appreciated because as of now Firefox for any and all of the WIN11 computers here Firefox has been removed from our approved list; as further failures are unknown. </p>",websites;mobile;,firefox,basic-browsing-firefox,en-US,1610508;,budgbrown

If the value is not 0, one could argue that firefox should use the title bar color, but if it is 0, then the regular window color should be used. Also, regardless of which color ought to be used, the tab header is not connected to the window below, but separated using a blue separator, making the window exceptionally ugly. This is the case even when browser.tabs.drawInTitlebar is nonzero. </p><p>I have also created a 100% fresh profile, without addons etc, and the behavior is the same. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1153;firefox-11531;,firefox,other,en-US,1610357;,rogier777

Flooded with hipsters from a lost generation of shiny and empty queer arguments the Mozilla project lost its tracks on providing technical, secure, and safe material to its community. Today I decided to remove Snap from my Linux box, consequently, Firefox. Then I went to install Firefox through Apt and I realized the ""apt"" is actually a ""transition package to snap""...fine. I then went to the website to download and install it manually (like the good old days), and then I realize there are no instructions for installing the package. You are supposed to figure that out by yourself... </p><p>Again, I give you that: the fact *is* silly, but is shows a broken system, and this broken system is done by those young hipsters full of schema, and colourful, and ""inclusive"" arguments that don't really care about the actual user but their own egos. For instance, go here: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/firefox/install-and-update-firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/products/firefox/install-and-update-firefox</a>. Go there, get your Firefox. And, please, notice that there is not *a single line* explaining how to install this thing. There is -- like every lazy tech company out there, profit from the ""free"" time of their costumers -- a list of ""#f*ckyourself"" articles to search for your answer... </p><p>That's just too much BS... especially for somebody that actually donate money to what once was a symbol of openess and dedication to users. This hipsters probably don't even know the relevance of Mozilla/Netspace to the world of open-source and freedom... I bet they/you don't... I actually get mad at me to allow these loosers to take over what was a awesome project. </p><p>With that, I quit Firefox and Mozilla.
