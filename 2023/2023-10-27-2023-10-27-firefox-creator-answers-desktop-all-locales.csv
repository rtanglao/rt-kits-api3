It was connected to a firefox account, which is now redundant. The email I now use is drowlin@gmail.com. I have tried to get the account closed, but security checks have prevented me from doing so. The same for the email rowhau@yahoo.co.uk, the firefox account it is connected to, is also redundant. </p><pre>     Any help to close these accounts would be much appreciated. </pre> <p>Another problem I have is I had two aliases 841yrmpcj@relay.firefox.com and 94uecahjg@relay.firefox.com used in an early version of <em>Monitor</em> both of which I want to discontinue.

In gmail, if I type into the search box, gmail shows an instant set of search results as a drop down list from the search box.  The problem is that if my mouse happens to be over where that list appears, then often, once the list appears, subsequent keystrokes are misinterpreted as keyboard shortcut commands, rather than additional characters to add to the text in the search box (the focus is on the search box while I'm typing). This doesn't happen in Chrome, but I'm not sure if it's a Firefox or Gmail issue. Anyone else see this?
