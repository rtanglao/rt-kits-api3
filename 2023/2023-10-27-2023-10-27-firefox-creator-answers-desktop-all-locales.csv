I noticed that my firefox version is 86 even though it was set to update automatically, nor was there a button to update manually. So I downloaded version 119 and unpacked it in a new folder. I did not find an installation file but the firefox file started up, but it was unconfigured and it could not find the bookmarks of my old still installed version even though the old version was still the standard browser and it did find the Opera browsers bookmarks. I found the old version in /lib/firefox, backed the folder up, and manually copied the files of the unpacked folder over, intending to update it that way. But the effect was only that the new unconfigured version started up. Restoring the old version by copying the backup folder back to /lib/firefox did not work; result was an error message that starting up an old version required a new profile, but that option did not restore my bookmark etc either. I took a look and it seems that these things are stored in another folder anyway (/home/.mozilla) but how can I access them? They certainly are still there given the folder size of 250MB. </p>",linux;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-1190;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",vume5

In gmail, if I type into the search box, gmail shows an instant set of search results as a drop down list from the search box.  The problem is that if my mouse happens to be over where that list appears, then often, once the list appears, subsequent keystrokes are misinterpreted as keyboard shortcut commands, rather than additional characters to add to the text in the search box (the focus is on the search box while I'm typing). This doesn't happen in Chrome, but I'm not sure if it's a Firefox or Gmail issue. Anyone else see this?
