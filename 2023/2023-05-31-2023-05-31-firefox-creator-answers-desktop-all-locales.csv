I can click with mouse, but shortcuts (""Play (k)"", ""Back 15 seconds (j)"", or ""Forward 15 seconds (l)"") stop working repeatedly and I'm forced to go back to using my mouse (Wacom Intuos Pro M). This doesn't sound like a big deal until you're forced to watch an offensive ""My Pillow"" ad or worse, and I can't immediately stop the playback of these radicalized terrorists. Or if while watching a DVR recording, it stops allowing me to skip thru commercials, or pause playback without picking up my pen (mouse) to get back in control of the 'playback' features. </p><p>Strangely, this never happens on YouTube videos/content. Those same controls ('shortcuts') work fine there. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",michael294

Font used for this character is Noto Sans Arabic UI. So the text looks broken due to different fonts. </p><p>Please have a look at the attached screenshots for better understanding. </p><p>I've tried to search but could not find how exactly Firefox resolves preferences in Font Settings and CSS ""font-family"" preference to local fonts in Linux. Does this have to do something with ""fontconfig""? </p><p>How can I make Firefox use only the default font for the whole phrase? </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1130;firefox-11301;,firefox,other,en-US,1583347;,mirfatif

The video says its playing and I can hear it normally but I can't see anything. Subtitles show up, but the place where the video is supposed to be is just blank, the same as the background of the page. Weirdly if I click the settings button on youtube, the one next to the sign in or account button, the video will display as long as that menu is up. If I close the menu the video goes away.  </p><p>I have refreshed firefox, deleted and reinstalled firefox, removed all my extensions, turned hardware acceleration off (and then back on when it didn't work) as was recommended in a similar post a few years ago, and restarted my computer. Youtube still won't show me a video. It works fine on chrome, just not firefox. </p><p>I uploaded a screenshot of an ad, which doesn't play but shows the outline of the video player, a screenshot of a normal video where the area the video should be in is just more indistinct background, a screenshot of the video appearing normally when I have the settings menu open, and a screenshot of the captions loading properly over an empty void. </p><p><br> Edit: I installed the Enhancer for Youtube extension?
