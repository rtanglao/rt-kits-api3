This problem started ~last week (or ~two months after I switched OS from Windows to Garuda Linux, a variant of Arch) and has progressively gotten worse. </p><p>Initial problem: Privacy Badger errors and says storage is broken. Putting `navigator.storage.estimate()` into PB's extension console leads to a quota of a large number, and a usage of 0. <a href=""http://Pandora.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Pandora.com</a> then logs me out, and doesn't allow me to log back in. Console reveals it's an indexedDB problem about storage quotas. Many websites are forgetting tokens - I'll log in, and then 15 minutes later, log in again. This happened on Discord, Fastmail, and this support forum (in fact, I couldn't log in on Firefox here. Had to use Chromium). Bitwarden's extension also errors, although this one doesn't directly mention storage and instead says that the sync is out of date directly after syncing. Alright. (If I had to guess, the sync process no longer can write to storage so it's stuck with an old sync). </p><p>OK, this is odd. I load back the profile directory I still have saved from the last machine. Still symptomatic. Maybe it's a permissions problem? I run `chmod -R 777 ~/.mozilla/firefox` and relaunch. Still symptomatic.  I nuke my firefox directory entirely, reinstall firefox (switching to For Developers) in the process, reimport my bookmarks, and run chmod again. Still symptomatic. Alright.  </p><p>Maybe it's a problem with my extensions. I really, really doubt that, but maybe. I restart into troubleshooting mode. The problem still exists, but when I go back my bookmarks and extensions are gone. </p><p>Problem as it stands now: <a href=""http://Pandora.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Pandora.com</a> still logs me out, but I can log back in. Sometimes. It just doesn't remember when I relaunch firefox. Along the way at some point, visiting about:support now shows nothing.
