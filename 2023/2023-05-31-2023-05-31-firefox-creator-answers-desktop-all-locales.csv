New version is supposed to Sync automatically I guess, but it doesn't. I'm logged in to my Firefox account, I got all my bookmarks and synced tabs, but no extensions.  This worked fine changing OS's in the past, including moving to Kodachi, Ubuntu, Kali, or Debian, or different versions of Windows.  Suddenly Firefox should Sync itself, and it doesn't.  How do I get all my extensions back?  I had an easy 50 or 60 extensions, and there is no possible way I'm going to reinstall 50 different addons, assuming I could possibly remember what they all were... </p><p>Any help (<strong>WITHOUT</strong> reinstalling every single one)? </p><p><br> Eric </p>",desktop;sync;firefox-590;firefox-5902;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",InternalSupport
