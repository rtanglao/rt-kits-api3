The video says its playing and I can hear it normally but I can't see anything. Subtitles show up, but the place where the video is supposed to be is just blank, the same as the background of the page. Weirdly if I click the settings button on youtube, the one next to the sign in or account button, the video will display as long as that menu is up. If I close the menu the video goes away.  </p><p>I have refreshed firefox, deleted and reinstalled firefox, removed all my extensions, turned hardware acceleration off (and then back on when it didn't work) as was recommended in a similar post a few years ago, and restarted my computer. Youtube still won't show me a video. It works fine on chrome, just not firefox. </p><p>I uploaded a screenshot of an ad, which doesn't play but shows the outline of the video player, a screenshot of a normal video where the area the video should be in is just more indistinct background, a screenshot of the video appearing normally when I have the settings menu open, and a screenshot of the captions loading properly over an empty void. </p><p><br> Edit: I installed the Enhancer for Youtube extension? Which I haven't ever installed beofre? And now Youtube works? Why </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",reedviolets5

New version is supposed to Sync automatically I guess, but it doesn't. I'm logged in to my Firefox account, I got all my bookmarks and synced tabs, but no extensions.  This worked fine changing OS's in the past, including moving to Kodachi, Ubuntu, Kali, or Debian, or different versions of Windows.  Suddenly Firefox should Sync itself, and it doesn't.  How do I get all my extensions back?  I had an easy 50 or 60 extensions, and there is no possible way I'm going to reinstall 50 different addons, assuming I could possibly remember what they all were... </p><p>Any help (<strong>WITHOUT</strong> reinstalling every single one)? </p><p><br> Eric </p>",desktop;sync;firefox-590;firefox-5902;,firefox,sync,en-US,1583323;,InternalSupport
