I am clumsy as they come, and split a jug of water on it...by mistake. This occurred as I was changing phone providers, because  privatization gives you so many options to choose from, the useless to the inept......the tyranny of choice </p><p>Anyhow when I got my new computer I could not log on to either of my two gmail accounts (yabbieroad@gmail.com/ mydarlinggirlrachael@gmail.com) and I am not that senile just yet, that I can't remember the two or three passwords that I alternate for gmail. Easy fixed, change the password, get a verification number sent to the phone number you had just before you changed providers. Now you have a new number that you can't change because you cannot log in to your account. </p><p>I just had another go at getting in via logging on and of on youtube, and don't ask me how this transpired, but for some reason I got a message to verify my current email, and was informed it will take 5 days to verify that mydarlinggirlrachael@gmail.com is my account. I will believe that when I can long in. </p><p>I did the same again for yabbieroad, and was just denied access with no option offered </p><p>I have had a 20 email exchange with Nord, who acknowledge I have purchased Nord Locker, but unfortunately they cannot move it across to my new email, because they are @#$^%&amp;.  I have had to go through the same process for 20 virtual music plug ins. suppliers, many have been great, others should be put up against a wall and have some stern words fired at them.  </p><p>I would appreciate any assistance, as I have chronic fatigue, and reading and writing are particularly draining, so is thinking, for that matter. So I try not to think about it, which is still thinking, when you think about it. If i can get into my gmail, that's one less thing I have to think about </p><p>Over and out DD </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1210;,firefox,other,en-US,"",daviddieni1313
