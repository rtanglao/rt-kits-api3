Easy fixed, change the password, get a verification number sent to the phone number you had just before you changed providers. Now you have a new number that you can't change because you cannot log in to your account. </p><p>I just had another go at getting in via logging on and of on youtube, and don't ask me how this transpired, but for some reason I got a message to verify my current email, and was informed it will take 5 days to verify that mydarlinggirlrachael@gmail.com is my account.
