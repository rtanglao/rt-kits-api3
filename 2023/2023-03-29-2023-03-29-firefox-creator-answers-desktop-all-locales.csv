For the last ~3 days I've been having a problem that is getting increasingly frequent where tabs will, sometimes even after having previously been loaded and sometimes brand new tabs, turn blank and feature only a small loading animation at the centre of the page.  </p><p>Reopening the url in another tab doesn't work, but the sites will work on Chrome and it's not limited to any one website, it's happened with youtube, google, reddit, fb, random blogs etc. Sometimes it will even happen in the middle of using a website. </p><p>I haven't added any new extensions since before the troubles started, and I tried disabling them all to no avail. I'm not really sure what's going on, though I am to assume that the pages are somehow hanging but I checked the processes page and it didn't seem to be an issue? </p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'd rather not have to move back to chrome. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1110;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",anira.angel
