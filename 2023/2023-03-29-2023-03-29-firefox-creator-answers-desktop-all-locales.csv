On the current versioin of Firefox for Windows, the Wells Fargo website still looks the way it should. </p><p>Attached are 2 screen shots of Wells Fargo's website.  One screen shot, using Chrome for Mac shows the Wells Fargo colors correctly.  The other screen shot using the updated Firefox for Mac shows the colors wrong, pretty much without colors, etc... </p><p>How can this be fixed so that we can use Firefox for all browsing? </p><p>Thanks, </p><pre> - Alan </pre>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1012;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Alan510
