It works great except for one feature.  Maybe there is a setting for it that I have missed. </p><p>When I click on an item in my library to open it, it opens it over top of the right-most tab that I have open.  That means I always have to be careful to have a blank tab open, otherwise I lose the last item I was viewing.  Is there a setting, or can you add a setting, to have the library open links in a new tab, or if one prefers in the existing tab?  I want to be able to open in new tabs. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1590551;,eberger5

When I use the mute button on the PiP controls, it will unmute itself after a few seconds. Instead, I have to find the browser tab and mute it in YouTube's player.

The default engine is set to DuckDuckGo, and Privacy Essentials is installed too. Although the front page of FireFox shows a search box in the main body, when I type into it, the information is transferred to the DDG search box in the Toolbar. How can I get back to where things were before -- i.e. I could type into the main page box and DDG would happily search from there.

It was suggested by their admin that I try a different browser and I can confirm that if I access using 'Chrome' then I don't have this problem. They have also said that one of their other members has also reported an issue using Firefox... so this suggests that something has changed at Firefox during the past 24hrs to cause this issue.

I of course lost all my bookmarks that I've been collecting for the last 20 years.  And as life goes I've now found the authentication key.  My question is can I get anything back now that I have that key or all my bookmarks are forever deleted? </p>,desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",aliciamcg13
