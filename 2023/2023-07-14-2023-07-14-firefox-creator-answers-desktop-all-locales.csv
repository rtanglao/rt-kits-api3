Sometimes its only a few seconds, other times for a few minutes. It is most noticeable when playing videos but does happen at other times as well. During the halt, I can still access Firefox's settings and all menu items. It is just website interactions that stop.  </p><p>For example, when a halt occurs on youtube, the video will eventually stop, depending on the buffer, and scrolling through the comments won't pull up any more and replies won't load. Then after a few moments, everything will start working again without issue, and all the uncompleted actions (such as opening new replies or trying to go to another page) will execute. </p><p>I used to think it was related to my computer's connection to our company's access server, but refreshing my connection through a CMD ipconfig /renewall worked so rarely that I assume it was just coincidental timing. </p><p>I also tried turning off hardware acceleration, but that had no positive effect. I'll make a separate post about that issue. </p><p>The thing that fixes it every time is odd: launching Chrome. I wanted to make sure it was just Firefox, so I tried launching Chrome, and then Firefox started working immediately. (Spotify still plays when Firefox halts too) </p><p>Is there anything I can adjust to keep this halting from happening? I can manage right now, but it is sort of annoying to launch Chrome every time. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",wolfgangprime
