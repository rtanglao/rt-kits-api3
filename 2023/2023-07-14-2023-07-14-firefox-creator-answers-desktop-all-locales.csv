The problem is Firefox built-in notification system just decides to remove any sound at all and only shows the notifications. It's annoying especially when I'm using this [<a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/vi/firefox/addon/pomodoro-clock/|timer"" rel=""nofollow"">add-on</a>]. I really need to hear the notification sound.

How can I stop them?,"<p>I've been noticing for the last month that after a few hours in a browser window, I'll suddenly have a pinned tab for some random website. Some for promotional things, others in languages I don't understand, etc. At first I downloaded a webpage blocker, blocked the ones that were pinned, and deleted the tabs. However, after a short while (an hour or two) they would appear again in pinned tabs only this time it would say website blocked. </p><p>I uninstalled and reinstalled firefox in hopes that would solve the issue, but it is still happening. I unpin the tabs and delete them immediately after I notice them, but they keep appearing. I really like using Firefox and use it often for work, but I'm concerned for my personal and work security. What should I do? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1590486;,estina

Once that was all done I re-downloaded everything I was using before. Once I had installed everything I hopped on FireFox and had started to browse through my bookmarks. I had all of them in one folder but not another in the bookmark sidebar you can open with ctrl+b. So I went to manage bookmarks and went on to import/backup. I had a backup from around 2:30am today and that's the one I had tried using because this was before the time I had started to reinstall windows. I must have looked at something wrong because I have now completely overwritten my backup. </p><p>I still have all logins and history from the past 6 months I just lost my bookmarks by overwriting them myself by mistake. </p><pre>I've tried to go to the bookmark and restore it to a previous version but it doesn't appear to have one. </pre> <p>Just to clear up on the full reinstall I had to completely reformat my drives therefore I no longer had access to any Windows.old folders to go searching through. </p><p>I've included a few pictures to help show what I'm looking at whether or not they'll be helpful. I hope I'm not to SoL on this one but if I am it can't be helped. </p>,desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",MHatter
