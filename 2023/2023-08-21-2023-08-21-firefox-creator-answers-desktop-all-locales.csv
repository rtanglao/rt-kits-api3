Exploring the Legalities and Sustainability,"<p>Dumpster diving, often referred to as ""urban scavenging"" or ""freeganism,"" is a practice where individuals salvage discarded items from dumpsters or trash bins with the intention of reusing or repurposing them. While it's considered an environmentally friendly approach to reduce waste and promote sustainability, the legalities of dumpster diving vary across different states in the United States. In Alabama, like many other states, the legality of this practice is subject to specific conditions and local ordinances. </p><p>As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, Alabama does not have a statewide law that explicitly prohibits dumpster diving. However, the legality can be influenced by a combination of factors including local regulations, property rights, trespassing laws, and intent. </p><p>The legality of dumpster diving often hinges on the concept of ""abandoned property."" Once an item is placed in a publicly accessible dumpster, it might be legally considered abandoned and therefore available for anyone to take. However, this interpretation can differ based on the property owner's intent and local laws. Some businesses may choose to lock their dumpsters or clearly mark them as private property to discourage or prevent individuals from diving into them. </p><p>Trespassing laws also come into play. If a dumpster is located on private property and the diver needs to trespass in order to access it, they could potentially be violating the law. Intent matters here as well; if a person enters the property without permission and with the intent to steal or commit other illegal activities, they could face legal consequences. </p><p>It's important to emphasize that while dumpster diving might not be explicitly illegal in Alabama, divers should exercise caution and respect property boundaries. Always seek permission if a dumpster is located on private property, and avoid making a mess or causing damage. </p><p>From a sustainability standpoint, dumpster diving contributes to reducing waste by rescuing items that would otherwise end up in landfills. This practice aligns with the growing awareness of the importance of recycling, repurposing, and minimizing our environmental footprint. </p><p>In conclusion, the legality of dumpster diving in Alabama is nuanced and can be influenced by local regulations, property ownership, and intent. While there might not be a statewide law against dumpster diving, divers should be aware of potential trespassing issues and respect property boundaries. Ultimately, this practice can serve as a small yet impactful way to promote sustainability and reduce waste in our communities. Keep in mind that legal situations can change, so it's advisable to consult legal experts or local authorities for the most up-to-date information. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1599046;,jamesrobertscs

Here is my problem.  I have saved logins on a lot of sites that all work perfectly.  There are several websites that I have multiple accounts that all have their login credentials saved.  My problem is that there is one specific website that until recently was operating just fine, but in the last week has started a nuisance issue.  When I log into the website I select the login profile I need and everything starts off just fine.  About 5 minutes later, whatever I am working on gets hijacked by a dropdown appearing in the upper corner of the screen that lists the six logins that I have for that website.  If I continue to try typing, nothing happens (as in, the dropdown list stays there and whatever form I was typing on no longer has any data being entered).  If I press ESC, the dropdown list goes away but it also closes down the form I was using.  If I use the mouse and click anywhere on the screen, then the dropdown list goes away and I can continue using the form I have open.  About 5 minutes later, or if I open up a new form, the dropdown list comes back and I have to do this all over again.  I have talked to IT of the website and they stated that they have never seen this issue before.  Other users that also use Firefox have never mentioned this to them before.  Is there a setting that I need to change?  Do I need to clear the cookies for this website?  Do I need to just delete all of the saved login information and then re-save it?
