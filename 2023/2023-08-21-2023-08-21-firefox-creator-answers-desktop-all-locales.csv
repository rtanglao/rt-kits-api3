After about a minute of refreshing the page, they work again (note: this is no internet connection issue: the same pages work on other browsers such as chrome and I even switched to another internet provider hoping to solve the problem, without any improvement) </p><p>2nd issue: Copy-Paste doesn't work on Whatsapp web If I copy a link or text from a page, whatsapp web won't allow me to paste it in any chat.

I'm currently facing a page not loading situation and could really use some assistance. It appears that someone at my company office has made changes to the settings on my PC, and now I'm in a bit of a bind. I'm unsure about the best way to restore things back to normal. </p><p>As a temporary measure, I've installed the Waterfox, browser besided by my private Firefox Focus which seems to be similar in functionality to Mozilla Firefox, as a backup for my work-related tasks. However, this has brought about a new set of issues. Numerous websites, including YouTube, are failing to load correctly. For example, when I access <a href=""http://youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com</a>, I can hear the audio from videos, but the visuals are not displaying. Furthermore, websites like <a href=""http://wishcodes.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wishcodes.com/</a> <a href=""http://wishcodes.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wishcodes.com/</a> are missing images, and even my Facebook page isn't loading. </p><p>I've attempted to clear my prime Firefox browser cache, hoping it would resolve the situation, but unfortunately, it hasn't worked. I'm truly hoping to identify a solution that won't involve losing any of my data, bookmarks, passwords, or other critical information. </p><p>Would you be kind enough to walk me through a simple method to address this problem?
