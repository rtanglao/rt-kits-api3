I can't find a setting to change that. Firefox either needs to respect the region setting of Windows or include an own setting to choose units. I suppose it derives units from the language settings. That's obviously wrong. </p><p>Many Greetings! Remo </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1160;,firefox,other,en-US,1600609;1600610;,mozilla.org14

Upon finding that Firefox was no longer the default browser I installed it.  Apparently snapd is a pre-req and it too was installed.  The installer does not automatically create a link to launch it and I have to do a search for FF.  When I launch it, it seems to run fine.  However when I try to restore my bookmarks from a recently created backup, which came from another system, I cannot.  From bookmark manager when I select restore and then choose file, nothing happens.  No popup window to select the file appears.   Likewise when I try to import from an HTML file and choose file, again nothing happens.  I imported the bookmarks to Chrome from the HTML file then tried to have FF import from another browser but FF says it can find NO other browser with bookmark, history or password data. Any suggestions? </p>",linux;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-1170;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1600592;1600599;,bitbucket1
