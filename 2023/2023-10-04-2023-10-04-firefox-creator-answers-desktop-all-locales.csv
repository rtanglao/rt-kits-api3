Clicking on the link makes a bar show up telling me that Firefox has prevented a popup from being opened (see attached image). I am given the option of managing my preferences / Firefox settings, where I can either go through multiple steps to permanently allow all pop-ups from that website until I restore my original settings, or uncheck a box to permanently allow all pop-ups from all sites until I check that box again. This is annoying because I have no interest in either allowing or disallowing all pop-ups from all websites, or all pop-ups from this specific website, every time I want to open a single pop-up from a specific site. I would rather that the warning bar which tells me that Firefox has blocked a pop-up also display a button allowing me to allow ONLY THIS SPECIFIC POP-UP IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE. </p><p>Is this a setting that exists in Firefox? Alternatively, is there a version of Firefox which does have a setting which would allow this?

For the past week or so, my scroll bar (on right side of screen) has ""disappeared"". It is actually still there, but so skinny that it cannot be seen or used. I Googled solutions to this, and found an article that had 8 possible solutions. I went through all 8, went into the various control options. Still, the same problem. Downloaded the latest version of Firefox and installed. Still the same problem.  So- I decided to see if it was an issue with my pc. I tried the  Chrome browser. It works fine. I tried the Edge browser. It works fine. I know now that the problem is with the Firefox browser. Something ""went wrong"" in the latest version. To add to this -- I also have to note that if I shut down and restart the pc, I can get the Firefox scroll bar to return (sometimes). BUT (this is really weird): if the scroll bar appears normal, the bar at the top of the page (not sure what that is called) does not work correctly/ is missing features. This is what happens: there is no X to exit a page, there is no ""V "" sign to make a page small, etc. All 4 symbols that should be in the top right side of the top bar are missing. Also, there are no tabs available. It won't allow you to have more than one tab! So, if you are in your gmail (for example), you must close out the gmail in order to do a google search or do anything else! Something is terribly wrong with the latest Firefox update. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1608086;1608124;,harvest720
