The mouse will work on closing the browser but will not click on videos or reload the tab. It's inconsistent. Sometimes working without a problem. Sometimes freezing when I first switch on the computer. I've tried everything. System maintenance doesn't help. FireFox uses so much memory, it's difficult at times to get into the Task Manager to assess what's going on. </p><p>(Memory note. This computer is primarily used for Amazon Prime, Netflix and YouTube. Sometimes Peacock.) </p><p>Trying to sync potentially added a glitch where I can no longer delete history and have to manually delete. (When I found it the other computer, it said/showed it had been clearing history. But I had manually delete several months.)  </p><p>Refreshing has no effect. </p><p>I tried to uninstall and reinstall but it reinstalled the exact same set-up without a few pinned links on the new window start up page. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1110;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",zyndell
