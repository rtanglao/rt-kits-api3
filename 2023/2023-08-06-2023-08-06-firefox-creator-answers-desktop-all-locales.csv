Also, in <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a>, https links in emails from trusted senders are somehow being converted to http and then Firefox of course warns me not to go there.  Of note, I downloaded Chrome temporarily for a backup and am not having these problems with Chrome, but of course, Google Chrome is nosy and ad-laden. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1160;firefox-11601;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1595499;1595503;1595504;1595520;1595530;,KayTa
