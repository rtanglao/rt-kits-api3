After some research I found that the Widevine plugin is missing and the OpenH264 Video Codec is also not installed. Following the instructions from similar issues didn't solve the problem. I ticked off and on the ""Play DRM-controlled content"" button but this only brings the widevine plugin for a moment and after that it disappears. In the network tab I see no activity when click on this button, i.e. Firefox does not send requests. </p><p>Additionally the OpenH264 Video Codec is not installed and never installs. </p><p>Any ideas how to solve this? </p>",linux;desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",v.grozev

I also know this is not a theme issue as after I removed ublock origin and re-added it to firefox the extension icon showed up in the menu just like usual, but I do not want to do this for every single extension as I have a large amount and I am worried about personal settings that I have saved being undone. In the past I have used this same firefox setup without any of these issues whatsoever and without changing any settings since then. </p><p>The main issue is that when I click the extensions menu toolbar icon (the puzzle piece) it only takes me to about:addons. On this page I can confirm all my extensions are there, and I know that they are working, due to things like ads still being blocked from ublock origin or tracking links being blocked from clearURLs. However there is no icon for them after clicking/right clicking the the extensions puzzle piece, or when using the ""customize toolbar"" feature, or in the overflow menu, or in any other possible place. I have also tried telling the toolbar to reset to default and this does not help. Since the puzzle piece icon never shows me a menu, there is no way to right-click an extension and get the menu option to ""pin to toolbar"" as this option can't be found in the about:addons page as far as I have found. </p><p>Is there any way to fix this beyond just re-adding every single one of my extensions? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1150;firefox-11503;,firefox,customize,en-US,1595624;,ebinebin
