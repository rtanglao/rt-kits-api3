I have a paypal account for any financing I may need to do, though I don't want to support greedy ISPs that horde resources and spy on their clients. I can provide practically any info you may need and I appreciate any advice you can give to help me avoid paying through the nose for a pet project that will NEVER turn a profit, especially if it has any additional overhead.

I also know this is not a theme issue as after I removed ublock origin and re-added it to firefox the extension icon showed up in the menu just like usual, but I do not want to do this for every single extension as I have a large amount and I am worried about personal settings that I have saved being undone. In the past I have used this same firefox setup without any of these issues whatsoever and without changing any settings since then. </p><p>The main issue is that when I click the extensions menu toolbar icon (the puzzle piece) it only takes me to about:addons. On this page I can confirm all my extensions are there, and I know that they are working, due to things like ads still being blocked from ublock origin or tracking links being blocked from clearURLs. However there is no icon for them after clicking/right clicking the the extensions puzzle piece, or when using the ""customize toolbar"" feature, or in the overflow menu, or in any other possible place. I have also tried telling the toolbar to reset to default and this does not help. Since the puzzle piece icon never shows me a menu, there is no way to right-click an extension and get the menu option to ""pin to toolbar"" as this option can't be found in the about:addons page as far as I have found. </p><p>Is there any way to fix this beyond just re-adding every single one of my extensions? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1150;firefox-11503;,firefox,customize,en-US,1595624;1595641;,ebinebin
