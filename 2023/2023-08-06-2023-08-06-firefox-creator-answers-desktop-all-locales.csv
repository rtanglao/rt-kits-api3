I don't want to be forced to buy the rights to my own intellectual property. When I make it known that I am interested in a specific web address for my own use this will be used to gouge my resources and just make me pay a fee for things I don't need. Mozilla says that my website is not secure but I have an SSL certificate and it even later admits that the information is encrypted. I'm not mad, I simply don't want to be bullied and wrangled into purchasing what I don't need. Nobody has the web address I currently have as my ServerName. The more I advertise it while I am working on it, the more likely I will be gouged or it will be stolen out from under me. </p><p>I've been working on computational engineering topics on my own for about a year and a half since I have been unemployed. I am interested in developing my own website, free and clear. I have gotten to the point that I can access what I have built on my local network. I run a Macbook Air and dual boot a tower with Ubuntu 22.04 and Windows 10. I built a website on Github but I want to run my own version on Apache from my Ubuntu OS. So far I have an Apache server running and I can access my website with the web address (<a href=""httpS://www.example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">httpS://www.example.com</a>) I want from the Ubuntu tower. When I am on my Mac I have to type the IP address of the tower to access the site; the web address won't work. I can do the same thing from my iphone while in the house as well. I have created my own SSL certificate (though I am not a certificate authority). When I access the website on the tower with the web address, Mozilla bonks me with a security warning. It says that there is no ownership information, though when I made the SSL cert, I provided a lot of info. I have a legitimate company verified with the IRS (established Jan 2022). I have a paypal account for any financing I may need to do, though I don't want to support greedy ISPs that horde resources and spy on their clients. I can provide practically any info you may need and I appreciate any advice you can give to help me avoid paying through the nose for a pet project that will NEVER turn a profit, especially if it has any additional overhead. I was given the tower through a contract position and I want to use it to it max value.  </p><p>All that being said, I appreciate  a stranger listening to my problems and considering them for a thoughtful response. I understand you have a boss and you may need to say what you need to say. I will try my best to be respectful; though I am rarely respected. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1160;firefox-11601;,firefox,other,en-US,1595670;,genshihumsup

This happens on my macbook pro running firefox 116.0.1 that is connected to a television monitor. This issue does not happen on my desktop monitor of 16:9 resolution. For about one second or so when the video first enters into fullscreen, the video is played how I want it to be played (non stretched, 4:3 aspect ratio, with vertical black bars on the sides), but then it auto adjusts itself and switches to a stretched resolution, which is what I DO NOT want. In case this info is important: When I exit the video, the entire screen is in a stretched resolution for only about a second until it then adjusts itself again to return to a normal display view. I am in dire need of help, it's driving me crazy.  </p><p><br> (similar to this thread: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1401072"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1401072</a> , except my problem occurs on a non youtube site, so im not sure how the tags solution would work) </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1160;firefox-11601;,firefox,other,en-US,"",greatesteveranimallover

I wanted to migrate it to use Firefox accounts. However, by mistake I created a new firefox account using the signup journey - and I used a different email for this. When I logged into my Pocket account, it asked me to update and I did. I said I'd want to login to my Firefox account using my new account - so typed in my new email address and signin. It was actually prompting me to just enter password and continue using my old account - but I declined and changed the email to login to my new account. I was hoping both these would be merged.  But they didnt' and after a bit of to and fro, I changed my new Firefox accounts email to the one that I'm already using for my Pocket account and did the same signup journey. They are merged now but I've got no data in my pocket - it's like a new account. </p><p>Please can someone help? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1160;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1595644;,rohitetc

I also know this is not a theme issue as after I removed ublock origin and re-added it to firefox the extension icon showed up in the menu just like usual, but I do not want to do this for every single extension as I have a large amount and I am worried about personal settings that I have saved being undone. In the past I have used this same firefox setup without any of these issues whatsoever and without changing any settings since then. </p><p>The main issue is that when I click the extensions menu toolbar icon (the puzzle piece) it only takes me to about:addons. On this page I can confirm all my extensions are there, and I know that they are working, due to things like ads still being blocked from ublock origin or tracking links being blocked from clearURLs. However there is no icon for them after clicking/right clicking the the extensions puzzle piece, or when using the ""customize toolbar"" feature, or in the overflow menu, or in any other possible place. I have also tried telling the toolbar to reset to default and this does not help. Since the puzzle piece icon never shows me a menu, there is no way to right-click an extension and get the menu option to ""pin to toolbar"" as this option can't be found in the about:addons page as far as I have found. </p><p>Is there any way to fix this beyond just re-adding every single one of my extensions? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1150;firefox-11503;,firefox,customize,en-US,1595624;1595641;,ebinebin
