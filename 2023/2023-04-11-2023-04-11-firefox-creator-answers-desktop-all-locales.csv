It may assist you with solving the ""lost pinned tabs"" issue. </p><p>I sent a question about my pinned tabs disappearing and mentioned that I had been exploring with windows 11 shortcut keys.  My problem is not solved but I can inform you which shortcuts led to the issue of losing the pinned tabs.  I was using WINDOWS KEY+D which shows/hides apps on the desktop, but I was using it during browser use.  Then I was using WINDOWS KEY+CONTROL+D and that is when things seemed to get confusing.  Ultimately, my original browser opening page disappeared and did come back but not when re-starting my computer.  There was NO browser history that brought back the page.  There was NO ""last session"" that brought back the page. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-11;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",dallas1
