Since installing Linux Mint in May 2023 I have been having this issue with Firefox. </p><p>Description of issue: When I switch between (or drag) tabs in a Firefox window, the whole window becomes unresponsive, with the last tab I was switching from still in front. Often the contents of the window start to flash (disappear and reappear, leaving a black backgground) every 2 seconds. I can drag the window around, scroll, minimize it, but it is impossible to give any input in any tab. The only action somewhat possible to do inside the window is bring other tabs in front, it is still quite hard for the input to register, and if it does, it takes 10+ seconds. The issue goes away if I close the specific Firefox window, or if I manage to select and drag one tab out of the frozen window into its own new window. Then everything works as intended, like nothing ever happened. </p><p>I can reliably cause the freeze-up in a short time by holding CTRL+TAB and drag one tab to change the order while firefox cycles through the tabs in the open window. </p><p>While the window is frozen, the rest of the desktop is responsive as normal, even other Firefox windows. If I try to interact with the frozen window I can rarely see spikes of CPU usage. RAM stays at normal usage levels, far from being full. </p><p>What I have tried so far that has had no effect on the appearance of the issue: </p><p>1) Disabling all extensions i have </p><p>2) Run in troubleshooting mode </p><p>2) ""Create a new places database"" as suggested [<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-hangs-or-not-responding#w_firefox-hangs-at-random-times|here"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-hangs-or-not-responding#w_fi...</a>]  </p><p>3) Disabled hardware acceleration </p><p>4) Creaing a new firefox user profile </p><p>5) Use ""Refresh Firefox"" from the troubleshooting page </p><p>6) Use the Flatpak version of firefox </p><p>7) Reinstall firefox </p><p>Here is my system information </p><p><a href=""https://ufile.io/6ntf78xm"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1624464;,nico.venuti

I also rapidly type, copy/paste, between windows, etc. and can instantly detect slowdowns - especially irksome when the mouse disappears for seconds while the system is working.  I keep history and cookies...reminds me of pages I've already looked at when color change is enabled.   After crashing a hard drive, I finally realized that Firefox was accessing the disk WAY too much.  Even with the system static (no page changes or updates), it was continually writing to disk.  Occasionally, it would take over the disk system for seconds.  Over time (years), as you guys improved, it became less significant; just broken up into lots and lots of small accesses.  Researched quite a bit... </pre> <pre>  Started with increasing the sessionstore interval, but still was an issue. </pre> <p>To solve MOST of the problem, I saw a help note.  I created and set to FALSE </p><p>browser.sessionstore.enabled </p><p>Plus modified several other sessionstore items This helped a lot... </p><pre>   BUT this did NOT regulate sqlite storage for third-party stuff. </pre> <p>This is probably handled and hidden under another config section/ keyword (not called 'sessionstore', but '??thirdpartystore??' or what?)

This is with only one window open and a static (no change) page.  What changes on a genealogy page that requires updating every second = this is a list of dead people?? Finally, my question(s): What config sections and ""keywords"" handle these third party writes?

Fix?,"<p>New computer, Win 11 and FF 120.0.1 all fresh installed and updated with latest versions. The double line spacing in bookmarks and all other menus is back. There was a fix for ver. 89 with the css file trick, but that DOES NOT WORK with this version. All other options I've run across don't work either. Why do the Mozilla software engineers think it's a good idea to break their flagship application every few years? Rhetorical question, I know. </p><p>Does anyone have a user fix that actually works with this FF 120.0.1 version? Something an experienced user can do that is not a programmer. analyst or engineer?
