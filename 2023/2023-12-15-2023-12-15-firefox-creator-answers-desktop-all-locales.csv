I saw a couple archived posts recommending global changes for all sites via Firefox -&gt; Settings -&gt; Language and Appearance -&gt; Colors, or to install themes. Neither option would work. I don't want to override all sites to dark globally, that's way to much change, just let Dark Reader change just <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a>. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;website-breakages;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1624289;,Leland359

Fix?,"<p>New computer, Win 11 and FF 120.0.1 all fresh installed and updated with latest versions. The double line spacing in bookmarks and all other menus is back. There was a fix for ver. 89 with the css file trick, but that DOES NOT WORK with this version. All other options I've run across don't work either. Why do the Mozilla software engineers think it's a good idea to break their flagship application every few years? Rhetorical question, I know. </p><p>Does anyone have a user fix that actually works with this FF 120.0.1 version? Something an experienced user can do that is not a programmer. analyst or engineer? I've been using FF since it first came out to challenge Microsoft's IE. Late '90s? I'd like to keep using it but this is too annoying to tolerate. </p><p>If anyone can help with step by step instructions, I would be eternally grateful. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,customize,en-US,1624290;,doninwn
