Previously the YouTube video skipping was occurring with Brave browser. So I turned to Firefox for troubleshooting. </p><p>I now confirm that if the tab is in focus, the fast forward occurs and loads the next video in the feed. YouTube videos run OK if I am not watching them on another tab so the fast forward is triggered by browser tab page focus in Windows 10. </p><p>This has been an ongoing issue but it was OK last night. </p><p>So I considered either hardware issues or malware. My keyboard has been frozen in places. I have a keyboard plugged in to replace laptop keyboard. That has helped. It is a touchscreen type laptop. </p><p>I tried to install MalwareBytes, the latest version, but could not get the new copy to install with as admin. I can't get past permission to install application clicking OK. (Other older MalwareBytes were removed.) </p><p>I think if I can fix my laptop security issues then that might help. (My primary desktop computer audio driver does not work at all anymore so I rely on my laptop or phone for YouTube videos. That issue is due to too many repeated Windows 10 update fails.) </p><p>Thank you for any help that you can provide, including any Windows 10 repair issues tangentially related to laptop issues. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",juliek.frey

They both show up and sync well when I install or re-install Firefox when needed. But recently, I got a Mac and installed Firefox, logged in with my account and to my surprise it didn't sync all of the extensions. I waited, then quit and restarted the browser, still no luck. Even after shutting down the computer and then trying did nothing. I checked update despite having just downloaded but no luck yet. Must be some bug so please fix it </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",krishnendulaha
