I have never had any issues with my beloved FF.  If anything minor had happened, I would always find a quick fix on the community forums. </p><p>This one is an odd ball: for a while now <strong>Firefox forgets all saved passwords but only after a cold reboot</strong> (not a restart or sleep). </p><p>It's my elderly mum's laptop, which I manage for her using a remote desktop app.  It's a fairly new Asus Vivobook with Win11, fully updated and free from viruses and hacks as we have installed paid versions of both Malwarebytes and HitmanPro.Alert.  My Windows desktop runs exactly the same OS and those two security software, and my FF never ever forgets anything!  The only difference is that her Windows and FF are set to the Italian language while mine is English. </p><p>After trying a ""refresh"", I exported her passwords and bookmarks and took the drastic step of completely wiping FF and even removing profiles.  Reinstalled the latest x64 version and the problem is still happening. </p><p>Had a good look at both security software to ensure there was no funny setting to cause that to occur, fact is the laptop also runs Chrome and Edge with all the same saved passwords yet those two pesky browsers never forget anything! </p><p>Personally, I'd much prefer for her to continue to use FF rather than the other two, so I am shouting out for HELP, please!  Hope someone has seen this and/or knows how to fix it. </p><p>Many thanks in advance and Merry Christmas to all!

I run a powerful Windows 11 Pro machine (I9 CPU &amp; 256GB of data on the SSD C: drive with five other SATA Drives that are each between 10 to 20TB. We are required to use Google Chrome at the office, and I SYNC that with my home machines. Recently I installed Firefox at home and found quite a difference in load time/speed (latency is what I am thinking) vs. Chrome. Firefox now is set up on other machines in my network (2.5GB Internet download speed and often run internet speed checks ensuring its speed}. My machines are Linux and iMac (M2 processor) as well as Windows 11. I have Eliminated any local network/router/bandwidth issues. I specialize in operating systems. I have been searching for plug-ins, extensions, support articles to find out how to I can get SYNC to work between the Chrome and Firefox browsers. I must trust someone who knows this knowledge to SYNC data between browsers. Please investigate method(s) to get SYNC working between these two browsers.  Assistance greatly needed and appreciated.  </p><p>Thank you much, Kenneth Johnson Kjsys1@gmail.com </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",kjsys1

Previously the YouTube video skipping was occurring with Brave browser. So I turned to Firefox for troubleshooting. </p><p>I now confirm that if the tab is in focus, the fast forward occurs and loads the next video in the feed. YouTube videos run OK if I am not watching them on another tab so the fast forward is triggered by browser tab page focus in Windows 10. </p><p>This has been an ongoing issue but it was OK last night. </p><p>So I considered either hardware issues or malware. My keyboard has been frozen in places. I have a keyboard plugged in to replace laptop keyboard. That has helped. It is a touchscreen type laptop. </p><p>I tried to install MalwareBytes, the latest version, but could not get the new copy to install with as admin. I can't get past permission to install application clicking OK. (Other older MalwareBytes were removed.) </p><p>I think if I can fix my laptop security issues then that might help. (My primary desktop computer audio driver does not work at all anymore so I rely on my laptop or phone for YouTube videos. That issue is due to too many repeated Windows 10 update fails.) </p><p>Thank you for any help that you can provide, including any Windows 10 repair issues tangentially related to laptop issues. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",juliek.frey

But recently, I got a Mac and installed Firefox, logged in with my account and to my surprise it didn't sync all of the extensions. I waited, then quit and restarted the browser, still no luck. Even after shutting down the computer and then trying did nothing. I checked update despite having just downloaded but no luck yet.
