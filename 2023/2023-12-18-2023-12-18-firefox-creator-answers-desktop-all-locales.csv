I have never had any issues with my beloved FF.  If anything minor had happened, I would always find a quick fix on the community forums. </p><p>This one is an odd ball: for a while now <strong>Firefox forgets all saved passwords but only after a cold reboot</strong> (not a restart or sleep). </p><p>It's my elderly mum's laptop, which I manage for her using a remote desktop app.  It's a fairly new Asus Vivobook with Win11, fully updated and free from viruses and hacks as we have installed paid versions of both Malwarebytes and HitmanPro.Alert.  My Windows desktop runs exactly the same OS and those two security software, and my FF never ever forgets anything!  The only difference is that her Windows and FF are set to the Italian language while mine is English. </p><p>After trying a ""refresh"", I exported her passwords and bookmarks and took the drastic step of completely wiping FF and even removing profiles.  Reinstalled the latest x64 version and the problem is still happening. </p><p>Had a good look at both security software to ensure there was no funny setting to cause that to occur, fact is the laptop also runs Chrome and Edge with all the same saved passwords yet those two pesky browsers never forget anything! </p><p>Personally, I'd much prefer for her to continue to use FF rather than the other two, so I am shouting out for HELP, please!  Hope someone has seen this and/or knows how to fix it. </p><p>Many thanks in advance and Merry Christmas to all!

So I turned to Firefox for troubleshooting. </p><p>I now confirm that if the tab is in focus, the fast forward occurs and loads the next video in the feed.
