These clients, inevitably, each assign me a Microsoft 365 userid. I also have my own personal Microsoft 365 userid.  </p><p>Unfortunately, given Microsoft's fairly aggressive attempts to ""capture"" my attention, it has ""remembered"" each and every one of these accounts, and it sort of tries to log me in all the time with the wrong account into different clients' Office 365 online platforms. So I sometimes find myself sending external mails from the wrong accounts etc. It really is a mess, because then certain O365 ""policies"" from one account, prevent another account from logging in, for example, creating what I suspect is an almighty spaghetti bunfight of clashing Microsoft properties in my browser.  </p><p>So I thought I'd assign each client their own container, and using the <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">multi-account container addin</a>, I though this would segregate the accounts, by setting it up automatically to open my different client O365 bookmarks in different colour-coded containers.  </p><p>Unfortunately this not seem to keep Microsoft in check. It seems to be able to ""see"" other MS logins across containers, because a few hours ago I experienced a situation where in Client A's container, Microsoft decided that I should be logged out and logged back in with Client B, for some unknown reason, probably because I had logged in as Client B in another container tab. But this doesn't seem to happen all the time. I can't pin down exactly when it happens. Microsoft is basically able to see across my containers, it appears.  </p><p>Is there any way to keep each Microsoft account where it belongs, namely strictly inside the container tab I have assigned each to? Facebook style? With a nice high unclimbable fence? </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",nicercat

I then checked the settings for the extension itself in which did not have anything for downloads. I next tried a different downloader, video downloader professional ext, that also had same result as the previous extension.  </p><p>Anyone have this problem and have fix? In the meanwhile downloading shows is going to be one extra click of pain for me. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,1572028;,asiancong
