It's very annoying and it happens only on Firefox, other browsers don't have this issue.

I have been having problems in Firefox recently, which I think may have started since recent updates.  </p><p>First problem: I use Mullvad VPN and now pages won't load...the browser seems to get stuck, especially when I google things but also when I put in actual URLs. Mullvad support says that something is trying to set the DNS and this is interfering with the VPN but I don't know what this could be. I checked the DNS setting in Firefox and it says it is turned off. I am having no problem like this when I use Safari.  </p><p>Second problem, which may or may not be related: a teaching interface that I have used for many years, now suddenly won't let me drag and drop files into it or do other routine manipulations.
