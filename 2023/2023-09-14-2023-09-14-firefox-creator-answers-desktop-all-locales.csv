The problem comes when I try to login. I enter my username and password, and that brings up a blank page that does not redirect to anything, so I'm stuck. </p><p>Just out of curiousity, I was looking through Advanced Settings, and found security.csp.enableNavigateTo. It has been set to false, but when I set it to true, I am able to successfully login (I still go to the blank page, but after a brief pause, I'm redirected to a logged-in page). </p><p>I'd like to know something about the security implications of enabling this property. Is it a bad idea?  (Not knowing, I've set it back to false and will continue to use Edge for now). </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1170;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",glchapman.misc
