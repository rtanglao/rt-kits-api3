At first, I would have to try loading two or three times before it would actually load my home page. First try - Invalid applilcation, cannot load. Second try - loads Firefox with a blank home page, no searching; all bookmarks are inactive; only show ""new tab"".  Third try - Firefox loaded BUT all Bookmark Folders have disappeared!!!  Since then nothing is working even after updating it twice.  I am still only getting a blank home page with none of the listed bookmarks being active. Each effort seems to bring about less and less function. Google browser is working fine, but I'm not found of that one - only use it as a backup. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",pfg13
