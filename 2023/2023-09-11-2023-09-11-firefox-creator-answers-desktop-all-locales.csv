Tabs right to the closed one move left 4. Middle-click closes a tab 5. Steps 2-4 may be repeated unless there are no tabs opened 6.

I am working with MacOS Monterey. When I go to click on green full screen button the window freezes, all the settings boxes up top disappear and the browser just totally freezes. I can't even access the 'view' menu to get out of full screen, I have to just quit the application and only use the browser in the minimized version. Please see attached screen shots of the issue I am facing. The first image shows what happens the the drop down menu after attempting to go into full screen, and the second image shows what the browser gets frozen on when I attempt to enter fullscreen. Furthermore, attempting to take any action once the full screen button has been pressed does not work except exciting the application. The window simply just stays frozen or when I click a drop down menu like view the program disappears, and the OS acts like no windows are open for Firefox.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1602873;1602877;,benevansclifford
