The pictures won't stack if i drag them to the exact same place. Ive checked every preference option on both the Mac computer and the Firefox settings but there is nothing about disabling it. The ""snap to grid"" function is disabled on the computer itself and images will stack if dragged from another browser like Chrome. It only does it with Firefox.

I get a blank page when I click on this link: <a href=""https://www.bestmobilelocksmiths.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bestmobilelocksmiths.com/</a> It is a popular mobile locksmith in Cincinnati, Ohio. The website is up and running because I can connect to it using another PC at home. How do I check what messages are sent from my Firefox browser to the website? And then - what is received at my browser from the website? By the way, I have cleared the cache and restarted FF, but I still cannot connect to it. There are other websites that I need help with displaying and interacting properly. How do I know this? - Well - I tried the 3 other websites from other PCs within my home network, and these websites work properly </p>","",firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",quianacrcl
