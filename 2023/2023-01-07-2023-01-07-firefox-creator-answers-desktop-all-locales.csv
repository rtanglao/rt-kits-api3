Firefox still keeps blocking despite my setting.

I cannot afford a new computer or as someone trained in computer graphics (before I became disabled) I would. After installing the latest moxilla firefox browser updat last night I shut down my computer as usual. Today upon trying to get my laptop to boot I started getting windows software validation errors. I had not done any software updates except that new firefox update so there is no question what caused the problem. I managed to get a temp resolution by using my last restore point.   Now I love firefox as my preferred browser (99% of the time, but I am concerned that the validation errors will start again if I install the current update. Anyone else seen anything like this? Or have a fix? </p><p>I always keep my software including my antiviral up to date. </p><p>Not sure what data I could share, or if its even relevant)  because I had to use a restore point to get my computer to validate my 100% genuine windows software.
