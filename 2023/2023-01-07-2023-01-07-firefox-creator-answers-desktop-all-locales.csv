Since a few weeks firefox refuses to open websites more and more. these are websites that can be opened without problems by other browsers (like ""brave""). The error i posted above IS ONLY ONE OF PLENTY SIMILAR ERRORS shown on that occasions. It seems to be always a different one. This is going on also when i make an exception in MalwareBytes, which i am using for quite some time now with unchanged settings, and never had issues like that before. Couldn´t find any help on the support pages.....

It remembers my passwords but will not keep me logged in to Amazon, Yahoo, Facebook, etc. This is a home computer only used by me so I don't want to be logged out. Also, I get messages from sites saying there's a login from a new browser and I keep having to confirm it's me. It will work for a day, but when I start the computer on the next day, I'm logged out of everything.   </p><p>I have done all these things: </p> <ul><li> Refreshed FF </li><li> Uninstalled &amp; reinstalled FF </li><li> Cleared the Cache </li><li> Cleared Cookies </li><li> Settings: Remember History </li><li> No checkmark for Private Browsing </li><li> Tried turning off Enhanced Tracking Protection for affected sites </li><li> Tried changing Privacy to Custom, and un-checked Cookies to allow them </li><li> No checkmark for ""Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed"" </li></ul> <p>I think I have solved the problem after re-starting or completely turning computer off and on again, as long as it's the same day. The next day it's like it's a whole new FF browser.  This started a month ago or so. Can anyone help? Nothing I do seems to work.
