The pictures won't stack if i drag them to the exact same place. Ive checked every preference option on both the Mac computer and the Firefox settings but there is nothing about disabling it. The ""snap to grid"" function is disabled on the computer itself and images will stack if dragged from another browser like Chrome. It only does it with Firefox.
