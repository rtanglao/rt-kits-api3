I think, the number of times this file has been referenced at the time it was bookmarked. If I sort the bookmarks by name, this number makes finding duplicate bookmarks by sight almost impossible over a non-insignificant number of bookmarks. Is there a way (e.g.: an addon) using a regular expression to delete the prepended numbers from all the bookmarks in a folder? I believe I can backup the bookmarks in JSON format, run a regexp in notepad++ to delete the leading--and useless--numbers, delete the existing bookmarks (backing them up of course in a virginal JSON), and reload the bookmarks. But, I don't want to do that if I don't have to. I didn't find an applicable thread. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",BuckRogers

Even some of the add-ons change preferences. Since I don't speak or read French it can be a real hassle to get everything changed back. What I usually end up doing is going to the page on the Mozilla site that has different downloads for different languages and I download the correct one. Once I install it over the existing installation things go back as they should be until I do another Windows Update or like I said before, sometimes after just a restart. This just happened again a few hours ago when I did a Windows Update. All the menu items and drop downs were suddenly in French. My Forecast Fox changed to Celsius instead of Fahrenheit. My Notifier for GMail changed to French. A couple log in pages for some web pages were in French. This never happened with other laptops I have had that were different brands. I once tried just uninstalling Firefox and then reinstalling the correct language version and things were fine until the next time I did an update. My preferences are set to how I want them and I just don't understand why it keeps getting changed. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,other,en-US,1565750;1565753;,mstqbfan
