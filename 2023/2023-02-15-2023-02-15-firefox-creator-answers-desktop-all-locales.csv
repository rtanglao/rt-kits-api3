Furthermore, Firefox seems to slow down my internet speeds of the whole system, as I can observe in other applications which want to download or upload data. As long as Firefox is running (even if I am just in the default tab and doing nothing in Firefox) it slows the internet speed of the whole system down. </p><p>So I tried a plethora of things to fix this and I can <strong>rule out the following</strong> possible causes with <strong>high confidence</strong>: </p> <ul><li> History, Cache, Add-Ons and so on: performed a clean re-install of Firefox, cleared all cache and history data, removed add-ons, reset to default, etc.. </li><li> ISP problem: performed repeated speedtests from other devices within the network, everything is fine within my local and wide area network, ISP does not report any problems </li><li> Firewall &amp; AV: turning on / off, even uninstalling, no effect observed </li><li> Driver problem: driver updated, driver removed, used default Windows Driver, used Troubleshooter etc., nothing helped. </li><li> OS issue: Nope. I even performed a clean new installation of Windows today, the problem remains. Furthermore: I ran the speedtests using Microsoft Edge and there are no issues (as long as Firefox is not running.) </li><li> HW / System issue: Nopes again. I have used a live Ubuntu-image to cross-check whether the HW might be an issue, but running speedtests using Ubuntu and Firefox worked well. </li></ul> <p>I did not observe similar effects on other machines using Firefox under Windows in my network. So it seems to be a very specific problem within Firefox under Windows 10 on my machine. </p><p>By the way the machine: HP Pavilion Gaming - 15-dk0200ng CPU: Intel Core i5-9300H RAM: 16 GB DDR4-2666 SDRAM WiFi: Realtek RTL8822BE 802.11ac (via PCIe) (I also have an Ethernet chipset on this system, but since I have tested everything using only WiFi I'll omit the info here.) </p><p>So is this a bug of Firefox? Or am I missing something? </p><p>Attached are some screenshots of the disappointing test results using Firefox. (I have similar problems on other sites like <a href=""http://speedtest.net"" rel=""nofollow"">speedtest.net</a> or the speedtest of Google). As reference: I've got 500 Mbit/s downstream and 50 Mbit/s upstream. Usually these speeds are achieved from other devices (or other browsers on my system), or are at least within the top 80%. But what I get with Firefox is significantly worse. It's also strange that the speed goes up first, which is fine, but then falls down completely after reaching some point. A few seconds after that it goes up again, but much much slower. </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1565855;1565870;,lupus-terre

If I sort the bookmarks by name, this number makes finding duplicate bookmarks by sight almost impossible over a non-insignificant number of bookmarks. Is there a way (e.g.: an addon) using a regular expression to delete the prepended numbers from all the bookmarks in a folder? I believe I can backup the bookmarks in JSON format, run a regexp in notepad++ to delete the leading--and useless--numbers, delete the existing bookmarks (backing them up of course in a virginal JSON), and reload the bookmarks. But, I don't want to do that if I don't have to. I didn't find an applicable thread. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",BuckRogers

Even some of the add-ons change preferences. Since I don't speak or read French it can be a real hassle to get everything changed back. What I usually end up doing is going to the page on the Mozilla site that has different downloads for different languages and I download the correct one. Once I install it over the existing installation things go back as they should be until I do another Windows Update or like I said before, sometimes after just a restart. This just happened again a few hours ago when I did a Windows Update. All the menu items and drop downs were suddenly in French. My Forecast Fox changed to Celsius instead of Fahrenheit. My Notifier for GMail changed to French. A couple log in pages for some web pages were in French. This never happened with other laptops I have had that were different brands. I once tried just uninstalling Firefox and then reinstalling the correct language version and things were fine until the next time I did an update. My preferences are set to how I want them and I just don't understand why it keeps getting changed. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,other,en-US,1565750;1565753;1565866;,mstqbfan
