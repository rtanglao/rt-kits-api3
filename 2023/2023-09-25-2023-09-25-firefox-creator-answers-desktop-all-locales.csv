I use Pocket and have used them for a number of years. I received an email from Pocket saying they were migrating to Firefox and in order to access what I saved to Pocket in the past, I need to use Firefox. I downloaded Firefox and LastPass is not letting me log in. I use BitWarden as my password manager. I tried accessing Firefox with the sign in and password that I used in the past but LastPass keeps giving me an error message. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;,firefox,other,en-US,1605951;,lletuno
