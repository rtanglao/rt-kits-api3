Certain actions cause the cursor to jump around in the document.   </p><p>For example, if I am sitting in a bulleted list, if I invoke the ""increase indent"" function through a menu or through the keyboard shortcut (tab key), the increase indent function executes correctly, but then the cursor moves to a new position a few lines earlier in the document. </p><p>Other operations cause similar movement of the cursor. </p><p>I am not alone in seeing this.  When I originally encountered it I tried google support and found this thread where somebody else reported similar behaviour: <a href=""https://support.google.com/docs/thread/236206911/cursor-jumps-to-some-random-location-when-i-press-enter-or-tab?hl=en-GB&amp;sjid=15035544943505962877-NA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/docs/thread/236206911/cursor-jumps-to-some-random-location-when-i-press-enter-or-tab?hl=en-GB&amp;sjid=15035544943505962877-NA</a> . </p><p>I contributed to that thread, and on the advice of Google technical support tried various things.  I disabled all my add-ons and refreshed firefox.  The problem still occurred.  But if I tried Google Chrome, I did not see the problem. </p><p>The problem persists across different documents. </p><p>I observed the problem in two separate environments: on both my laptop and my desktop computers.  In both cases I'm running the latest release version of firefox (117.0.1).  My desktop runs windows 11 while my laptop runs windows 10 -- both are up-to-date. </p><p>However, my wife can edit the same documents without seeing the problem.  So, it's something specific to my environment.  We use the same add-ons.  The only difference I can think of is that I use a firefox account for syncing bookmarks across devices while she does not. </p><p>If I can provide any additional information, please let me know.

Jsem zvyklý primárně používat tento vyhledávač a tak mě štve, že když zapomenu , že objednávat a platit věci musím na jiném prohlížeči, tak objednávka projde , ale visí, jako nezaplacená.
