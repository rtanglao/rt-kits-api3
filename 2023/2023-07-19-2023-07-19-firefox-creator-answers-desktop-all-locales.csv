So after update I launch from command line terminal or through launcher bar: </p><p>firefox -p </p><p>And It starts up profile manager, then I choose my usual profile and check it as default one. After that, when I open Firefox again, it uses my usual profile as expected. </p><p>Now the question: - is there a way to automate this procedure so I have not to repeat it anytime after I update the browser? </p><p>PS. I noticed my ""profiles.ini"" file is populated with a lot of profiles sections, likely maybe anytime I update, a new one is added in here.
