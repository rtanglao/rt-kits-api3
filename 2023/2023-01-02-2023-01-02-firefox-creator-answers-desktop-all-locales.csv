On Youtube, It takes about 5 seconds to start a video (including ads), 5 seconds to load up a place I skipped to in the video even if it's loaded, and if I go to the start of the video sometimes it won't even try playing. On Twitter, videos are hit or miss, most won't play, and others will autoplay but will stop working if you pause or skip. Tumblr and TikTok work fine.  </p><p>I've tried running a private tab (disabling extensions) and still have issues, I've tried turning off hardware acceleration, clearing data, and even reinstalling Firefox. I tried both Twitter and Youtube on Chrome and video playback worked just as well as Firefox used to. I also updated my video card driver to see if it'd help without luck. I have great internet that I haven't had recent issues with either to cause loading problems. </p><p>I hope to find a solution soon, I haven't found anyone else sharing this issue yet, but that I've found, it's Firefox. If there's any additional information that'd be helpful that I can get I can try getting it. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",brando9g

I've set it so that FF asks me if I want to close all tabs when I close a window or exit. This is to restore pages when I restart next. What I've noticed is, this number of tabs in the question only keeps increasing -for example, if I have 50 tabs open, close 10 of them during a browsing session and open 20 more, when I go to exit, it'll ask me if I want to close 80 tabs. And when I start up FF next time, that number 80 just keeps increasing when I open/close tabs. It doesn't seem to be refreshing the 'tab memory'.  There needs to be a button perhaps that purges that tab cache and takes a fresh 'reading' of all current tabs open and updating the total number. </p><p>Anyone else experiencing this?
