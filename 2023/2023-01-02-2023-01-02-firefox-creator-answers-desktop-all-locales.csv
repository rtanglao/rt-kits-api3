I've set it so that FF asks me if I want to close all tabs when I close a window or exit. This is to restore pages when I restart next. What I've noticed is, this number of tabs in the question only keeps increasing -for example, if I have 50 tabs open, close 10 of them during a browsing session and open 20 more, when I go to exit, it'll ask me if I want to close 80 tabs. And when I start up FF next time, that number 80 just keeps increasing when I open/close tabs. It doesn't seem to be refreshing the 'tab memory'.  There needs to be a button perhaps that purges that tab cache and takes a fresh 'reading' of all current tabs open and updating the total number. </p><p>Anyone else experiencing this? Thanks </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",glennfen
