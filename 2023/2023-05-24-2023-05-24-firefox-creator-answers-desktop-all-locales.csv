Often Firefox is not supported and I am told to use Google. I have used Firefox for many years. I like it. I feel safe on it. Now the computer world has me so confused. I am told by Vizio to sign up  to get MAX which is thru Warner Bros. </p><p>I have A Fire Vizio adapter or plug in&nbsp;??? on my TV. I do not understand what I am being asked to do. I find myself wanting to cry with confusion and feeling so overwhelmed with what used to be so simple. I really do not know what to do next.  </p><p>I was trying to get MAX information with Vizio. I am asked to sign into my account. AACK!!!! I cannot find a VIZIO account. I go search on Passwords, computer takes me to a ROKU address with password. No VIZIO!! I want to cry. Too much of a good thing is BAD. It is a horrible feeling to be reading supposed English which might as well be Greek. Needless to state, my mind rejects all. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-1130;firefox-11301;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",carwick548
