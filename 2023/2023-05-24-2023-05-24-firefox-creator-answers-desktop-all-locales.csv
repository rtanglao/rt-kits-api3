However, for reasons to me unknown is missing a very important feature (natively at least): tab grouping. This feature is extremely simple to implement and in today life, where in most jobs (I'm a researcher) you have to deal with a tons of tabs opened in your browser, being able to effectively organize them is a must. </p><p>My question is: has Firefox the intention to implement (again) this feature? Will this happen soon? </p><p>I'm really trying my best to not switch to a competitor browser and I really want to support Firefox and hope that it gains more and more users. But for this to happen it really needs to be on par with time. How come every other popular browser has a very good tab grouping feature and Firefox doesn't?  </p><p>Please, let me know if there's a chance to see this feature implemented in reasonable times. Sooner or later, you will probably have to do that reagardless. </p><p>Wish you the best, A. </p>",linux;desktop;tabs;firefox-1130;firefox-11301;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1582277;1582284;1582286;,alessandro.d.montella

Since there are a few options on how this can be accomplished in theory, the only way I way able to get it working was by using an Http Proxy. I looked at the connections Firefox is initiating towards the proxy using Wireshark. I was shocked to say the least. When trying to use an HTTPS Proxy, Firefox doesn't encrypt the connection to the proxy at all. So the domain I'm trying to connect to and the Credentials I use to log into the proxy are visible in cleartext. That is an absolute No-Go! Is there a way I can configure Firefox to encrypt the connection between itself and the proxy? If not, are there any plans on implementing this kind of functionality? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1130;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Log4JExploit
