I don't want ""full-screen"" mode but I do want the window to take up my whole desktop when I'm using it. There are no buttons to maximise or minimise and no dragging arrows when I hover over the edges. I don't know why this is happening all of a sudden. How do I fix it please? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1190;,firefox,other,en-US,"",thelittlestjourno
