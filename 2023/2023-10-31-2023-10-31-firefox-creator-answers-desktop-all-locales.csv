This happens if the HTML file size is big (&gt;4MB), smaller file doesn't crash. </p><p>I've tried opening the file on Chrome, it doesn't crash and open just fine. So it seems like this is a bug with Firefox. </p><p>I've uploaded the HTML file if anyone wants to test: <a href=""https://www.mediafire.com/file/ipmu7ugrd2vvelr/LICENSES.chromium.html.zip/file"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mediafire.com/file/ipmu7ugrd2vvelr/LICENSES.chromium.html.zip/file</a> </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1190;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",cookie.master

So I finally deleted every trace of Firefox off my computer, deleting the library files, everything.  I download a brand new copy of Firefox, start it up and within seconds have a <a href=""http://reddit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">reddit.com</a> cookie.  There are no reddit pages open, no tabs, no nothing.   </p><p>Also, I keep reading that you can right-click or control-click on a cookie to inspect it but that does not work for me on FF 115.4.  I cannot find any way to look at the cookie code in Firefox. </p><p>I'm on the verge of just giving up on Firefox at this point.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1014;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",photonboy

I don't want ""full-screen"" mode but I do want the window to take up my whole desktop when I'm using it. There are no buttons to maximise or minimise and no dragging arrows when I hover over the edges. I don't know why this is happening all of a sudden. How do I fix it please? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1190;,firefox,other,en-US,"",thelittlestjourno
