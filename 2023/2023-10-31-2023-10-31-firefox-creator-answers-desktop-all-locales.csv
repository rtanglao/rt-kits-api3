If I then click on another Folder, the one that disappeared, reappears… but now there is a blank space where I clicked on the second folder… Nothing actually is lost, but the name of the clicked Folder disappears, leaving a blank space… This is strange behaviour. I have Windows running under Parallels and the Windows Firefox still functions correctly without problems. On the Mac Firefox I have tried deleting all Bookmarks and re-importing, but doesn't help. I have also Refreshed Firefox and that does not help either. I do not really wish to delete and re-install the Firefox App. as I have many modifications, extensions, search engines etc. installed. Is this behaviour perhaps a quirk of Version 119.0??? Thanks for any help or advice. Colin </p>",desktop;bookmarks;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1190;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",Cobracon9

I HAVE EXTREME CHRONIC PAIN THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING... </p><p>There are even studies that show tab overload is problem and we live in ""information age"" (information overload), yet browsers UI didn't change basically at all since 1999... I am genius philosopher you won't believe me this, now i am demented trash. Anyways i had 3000 tabs and that was yet when i had chronic pain worked like on 40-60% of my potential max... probably lower... All bookmarks managers, or note taking programs, or tab managers are moronic, i gave devs feedback and they will say i am brilliant when it was just more core logical stuff... And on all pages only 4-11% is actual text, can't wait on better ai tools... </p><p>1. i have chronic headaches i couldn't read even 1 sentence most of the times no joke, yes that's bad, 2. i cannot hire programmer for everything every time i need 1 small thing 3. i have chronic pain 8 years and i was also super busy and i can't do everything myself, if i am to do any real work done... society slows me down so much </p><p>There is no tools, and rewriting something to documents is laborious, i have poor long term memory... ANd bookmarks are so terrible even with tags, i won't recall how that thing was tagged i read 1+ year ago. I read so many diverse stuff from all areas of science and philosophy and about everything that exist... </p><p>Even on market you have 100 same to do apps, with almost identical core/features and same issues... I don't understand like that no one took advantage didn't do something better... Software devs not much smart and management is problem, it is what it is... </p><p>There is no absolutely nothing. </p><p>Ai should track eye moment/mouse movement, multi-modal tracking and save important information and make trees and connect similar topics and tag everything for you, so you can find it later and also adjust based how you search and use some note-taking program etc. and all sites should reduce text to 4-11% which is hard... Everything is so inefficient every industry i looked, when i wasn't demented i had constant ideas about improvement so many diverse fields, when i see how inefficient everything is... I lost 99.999% from over 1 million of articles, studies, papers i read, because there was nothing to save knowledge any viable way... it was hell for me... </p><p>i know you will probably laugh as normal ppl are degenerate and want even less then they have and whoever proposes anything better they laugh, it is absurd, if it doesn't bother you why bother commenting on something else someone else needs... </p><p>i couldn't work even properly because of that, no one under 160IQ even understands me, i am genius in philosophy, but i have ADHD and other problems... my life was torture, i am now totalled and i couldn't do anything, it is torture for gifted from 3sd ppl realize how humanity stupid is, tho intelligence is spectrum... everyone is good at something else, ppl don't want to admit it because ego... </p><p>You cannot even order firefox windows on taskbar, which is more microsoft issue but still it is so idiotic, there are no solutions. i was reading 16 hours a day philosophy had 3k tabs it was impossible to navigate most of the time... as i see 20 things from every other thing instantly i didn't have time even to order it, i needed solutions so i can work and do what i good at but... Try to imagine how annoying this was for me... I never could do even 1% of my ideas don't have resources etc. I didn't think i was so smart, but even 140/150IQs resist me in every word, but multiple 160IQ+ told me that i am extremelly intelligent, cannot make this shit even up. I never really spoken about it honestly much because i know ppl are so insecure... </p><p>Might as well mention it, when most ppl give answer like i use 10 tabs why you need more, it is absurd, if you dont need more why do you care and laugh at someone who need some else solution, normal ppl are spiteful and act like rabid monkeys... for no reason even that it doesnt make sense literally bots... Tehy buy unhealthy food from supermarkets = support corporations, destryos planet, and damaged their health and causes them chronic illness it is proven and if you politely notify them about that: they will laugh and defend it yet ,it is stockholm syndrome, it is insane, 99.9% ppl are outright insane...
