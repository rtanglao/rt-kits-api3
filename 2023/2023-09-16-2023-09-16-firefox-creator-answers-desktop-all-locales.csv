Like text, button borders, even the exit, fullscreen and minimize buttons. I have seen that this has been an issue for quite some time before so I am looking if there is a fix or a workaround. I have and Nvidia graphics card and drivers if that means anything. And my swap file is 20 GB and my RAM is 16 so the space shouldn't be a problem. It gets fixed when I turn off Firefox but not when I refresh tabs. </p><p>The crazy thing is that when I take a screenshot inside firefox (with firefox integrated screenshot option, like when I press right click and then take screenshot. I can see the text so it seems like it is a display problem but this only happens with firefox and not other apps. </p><p>Appreciate all the help. I will ask of ubuntu formums next if I don't find a solution here.  </p><p>Thank you all for reading and answering! </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ivan.bukac

I have used Firefox on and off so I don't have a time frame of when this would have started exactly, but I have had some random completely black screens on both of my monitors dating back to at least 2-3 weeks ago that can only be fixed by powering down the entire PC. I've reinstalled my (NVIDIA) GPU drivers, rearranged display-port cables and just about anything before finally finding a fix, switching to edge. So far I've gone a week without black screening when with Firefox I'd get around 4 give or take a week (some days getting to 3 alone). I don't know what could cause it but I have noticed it only happens when first starting a video. Mostly YouTube but other video sites seem to have also caused it occasionally, I would just like to know what could be causing this, as I do prefer Firefox vastly and would like to switch back as soon as I can.  </p><p>Will provide anything else as necessary! </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,other,en-US,"",arbfireking
