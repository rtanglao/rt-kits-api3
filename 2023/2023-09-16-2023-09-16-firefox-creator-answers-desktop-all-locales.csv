I have tried various other proxy settings but the same thing happens.  The thing is that I have to keep refreshing the page until it does actually connect and that can take a good few minutes. Sometimes I have to restart the browser.  Why is this happening since the last few updates? </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,other,en-US,1604068;,pete_scott2

I have used Firefox on and off so I don't have a time frame of when this would have started exactly, but I have had some random completely black screens on both of my monitors dating back to at least 2-3 weeks ago that can only be fixed by powering down the entire PC. I've reinstalled my (NVIDIA) GPU drivers, rearranged display-port cables and just about anything before finally finding a fix, switching to edge. So far I've gone a week without black screening when with Firefox I'd get around 4 give or take a week (some days getting to 3 alone). I don't know what could cause it but I have noticed it only happens when first starting a video. Mostly YouTube but other video sites seem to have also caused it occasionally, I would just like to know what could be causing this, as I do prefer Firefox vastly and would like to switch back as soon as I can.  </p><p>Will provide anything else as necessary! </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,other,en-US,"",arbfireking

That's why it's irritating to find duplicate ""Other Bookmarks"" in my Bookmarks Folder. I now have 3 of these folders. They all have exactly the same info in each of them.  There are actually 2 ""Other Bookmarks"" folders in my main Bookmark Folder in addition to the original one under Bookmarks Menu. </p><p>I'd like to have just the original one that's filed under Bookmarks Menu. I'm afraid if I try to delete the extra ones that I'll somehow delete all of them. I've attached images of what I'm seeing. </p><p>Thanks! - Andre'a </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",DreaSpirit
