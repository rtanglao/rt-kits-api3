I regularly use the bookmark bar and organize my bookmarks into folders. However, any changes I make don't seem to stick and get reset after a period of time. This is especially frustrating as I heavily rely on bookmarks to keep my browsing organized. Problem Details </p><p>Here's what typically happens: </p> <ol><li> I add a bookmark to a specific folder or position, either in the general list of bookmarks or on the bookmark toolbar. </li><li> Sometime later, that bookmark leaves its designated position and moves to the bottom of the unsorted list of bookmarks. </li></ol> <p>Devices and Operating Systems </p> <ul><li> MacBook M1 2020 running macOS Monterey </li><li> Dell Alienware 17 r5 running Windows 10 </li></ul> <p>Both devices have the latest version of Firefox installed, and I use Firefox Sync to keep my bookmarks and settings consistent across these devices. Suspicion </p><p>I suspect that this issue occurs when I make a change to bookmarks on one computer and then open Firefox on the other computer. The bookmarks seem to reset, possibly due to some issue with Firefox Sync. </p><p>Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and possible solutions! </p><p>Kind regards, </p>",desktop;bookmarks;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",Karakai
