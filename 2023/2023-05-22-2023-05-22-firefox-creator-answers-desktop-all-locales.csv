Only recently have I spotted the common factor. </p><p>On two Windows 10 computers, sometimes when I copy/paste a link in Firefox, my keyboard input language switches from Canadian Multilingual Standard to US English. On my desktop, I don't even have US English installed as an input method, yet it still switches to it. I've even made registry changes to specifically remove it, to no avail. Disabling the option to switch languages via keyboard shortcut also makes no difference. </p><p>This seems to happen completely randomly. I'll ctrl+c/ctrl+v a link and the language will change. Putting it back to CMD and ctrl+c/ctrl+v again and it won't change. The change only happens when I copy/paste a link from Firefox. Maybe one out of every 15-20 times on the large scale, but sometimes it will happen twice in a row, or not at all for a week. </p><p>Does anyone have any insight on this issue, or how I can fix it permanently?
