It stalls and takes forever to load or it does not load at all.  I am finding that with more sites as time goes on.  Google photos also won't load in a timely manner  BUT of I change to Chrome everything loads quickly.  This didn't use to be a problem but now is, any solutions out there. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jkhaley

All I would get was a black screen, but I could hear the audio. Although some videos, like facebook shorts, played just fine. And I could view videos in other browsers. Tried several things I saw suggested on threads having the same issues, but ultimately I uninstalled firefox and then reinstalled it and it seemed to have fixed the issue.  Hopefully this helps others having the same issue. I tried to suggest it on a few of those threads but they were locked. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1583459;,dogscouts
