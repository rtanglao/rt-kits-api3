However, there is no option to tell Firefox not to do this. I checked my settings and couldn't find anything about this either. My settings also say that my version of Firefox is up to date, so Firefox is not restarting for an update. Is this happening for other people? How do I tell Firefox not to quit without my permission? </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",jezvonek

Už se mi ale po několikáté stalo, že pokud mám otevřené okno prohlížeče, kde mám Panorama Views a otevřu si druhé, a pak to první zavřu, tak se Panorama Views navždy ztratí. V prohlížeči jsem přihlášená, dá se historie Panorama Views někde najít a znovu otevřít? Mám nastaveno, že se všechny panely otevřou po znovuspuštění prohlížeče. A pak bych měla ještě jeden dotaz a to, jestli si nějak mohu otevřít své Panorama Views i na jiném počítači - např. po přihlášení. Děkuji za odpověď Martina K </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,customize,cs,"",martina.k

All I would get was a black screen, but I could hear the audio. Although some videos, like facebook shorts, played just fine. And I could view videos in other browsers. Tried several things I saw suggested on threads having the same issues, but ultimately I uninstalled firefox and then reinstalled it and it seemed to have fixed the issue.  Hopefully this helps others having the same issue. I tried to suggest it on a few of those threads but they were locked. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1583459;,dogscouts
