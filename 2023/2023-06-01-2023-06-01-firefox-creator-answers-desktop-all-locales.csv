I know Mozilla does not monitor the Notes extension actively and the corresponding Github repo is archived (<a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/notes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/notes</a>).  </p><p>Mozilla also notified the users about the decision to discontinue this service: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1328311"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1328311</a>.  </p><p>However, I found the ""Notes add-on"" useful, and kept using it. Finally with a sudden update in late May 2023, I have lost all my past notes. While searching for possible solutions for the data recovery, I came to find the following solution by "" jscher2000"".  </p> <ol><li> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1390845"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1390845</a> </li><li> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1322197#answer-1384732"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1322197#answer-1384732</a>  </li></ol> <p>However, it was reported that though majority of the data was recovered by applying the technique above, lost notes were not among them: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1390845#question-reply"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1390845#question-reply</a> </p><p>For anyone with similar issue I am describing below what worked for me. Following the suggestion by ""jscher2000"" I first generated the ""Old Firefox Data"" folder on my desktop. This is how I did that: From the Firefox browser window, click on <em>Help -&gt; More Troubleshooting Information -&gt; Refresh Firefox </em> and follow the instructions.  </p><p>After creating the ""Old Firefox Data"" folder you will be able to see one, or multiple, ""profile folders"" therein. On my system I was able to see multiple ""profile folders"".  </p><p>Next, type ""about:profiles"" in the URL space of a Firefox browser. I saw only a single profile (the default profile) on my screen that followed. Next, you need to ""create a new profile"" and point the system to one of the ""profile folders"" inside ""Old Firefox Data"" folder. Lastly, hit the ""Launch profile in a new browser"". If you can not see your old notes, try with another profile folder inside ""Old Firefox Data"" folder.  </p><p>This is what worked for me (Mac OS). If there is any better solution please suggest that. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",skbiswas

However, there is no option to tell Firefox not to do this. I checked my settings and couldn't find anything about this either.

Už se mi ale po několikáté stalo, že pokud mám otevřené okno prohlížeče, kde mám Panorama Views a otevřu si druhé, a pak to první zavřu, tak se Panorama Views navždy ztratí. V prohlížeči jsem přihlášená, dá se historie Panorama Views někde najít a znovu otevřít? Mám nastaveno, že se všechny panely otevřou po znovuspuštění prohlížeče. A pak bych měla ještě jeden dotaz a to, jestli si nějak mohu otevřít své Panorama Views i na jiném počítači - např. po přihlášení.
