All I would get was a black screen, but I could hear the audio. Although some videos, like facebook shorts, played just fine. And I could view videos in other browsers. Tried several things I saw suggested on threads having the same issues, but ultimately I uninstalled firefox and then reinstalled it and it seemed to have fixed the issue.  Hopefully this helps others having the same issue. I tried to suggest it on a few of those threads but they were locked. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",dogscouts
