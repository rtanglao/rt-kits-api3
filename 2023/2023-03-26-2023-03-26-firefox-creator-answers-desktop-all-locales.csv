The first thing I log into is Firefox, after that, I log into Outlook 2019 and I use Zoom for Outlook since I have both Taskbars available. Some of it works and some of it doesn't. For example, I cannot change the size of messages I receive and send out. I am not referring to the text size I'm referring to the whole page of Outlook. The Zoom will zoom in or out on other parts of the page in Outlook but not the message section. </p><p>If anyone understands this I would appreciate some help.
