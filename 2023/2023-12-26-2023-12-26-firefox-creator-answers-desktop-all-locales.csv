In my earlier HP laptop with 8 GB ram I could use 10-15 tabs at one time .It would still not lag . It could do web development at the same time I could watch youtube tutorials.  But now I barely open 4-5 tabs the youtube starts freezing up to the extent that I really get frustrated.

In one case, Wells Fargo bill pay does not work (but works fine with MS Edge); in another case, an international money link payment to a vendor in the UK would not go through using Firefox (but did first time with MS Edge). In yet another case, Firefox won't load webpage photos for items for sale on the site <a href=""http://www.telescope.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.telescope.com</a> - the page loads with descriptions but photos would not load (I just tried it and, nada). This remains the case even after my VPN is disconnected.  </p><p>I've used FF for several years now without too much trouble but with this ongoing non-functionality of FF, I'm tempted to migrate to MS Edge or a browser that is supported more widely.  </p><p>Any help or advice?

[Windows 10],"<p>Good evening, Today I tried to install an Firefox extension called fast forward, and was met by this message. (image 1) ""Please update Firefox to install this extension"", it was in the official <a href=""http://extensions.mozzila.org"" rel=""nofollow"">extensions.mozzila.org</a> website. So I clicked the button, and it downloaded a firefox_installer.exe file, I ran it, and now I have two firefox installations, one in version 108 and the other on 121. I would prefer to use 121 starting today, as it is the versions I use in other computers. </p><pre>But the problem, is that now, the firefox with the version 108 has my user data/settings/bookmarks, while the 121 doesn't and when I try to open the profile folder for my 108 version, windows says there is no such directory, (image 2) I went there by hand, and where firefox states there is my profile, are only the profiles of the 121 installation, since then I restarted my pc (shut off and on, not the restart button), and restarted firefox multiple times, as well as cleaned startup cache. Is it possible that firefox is misrepresenting my profile folder position? Is there a way to save my 108 profile data?  </pre> <p>P.S.: I tried using the sync feature and it only downloaded 2 extensions from 8, and didn't download website data. thank you! </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1080;,firefox,download-and-install,pt-BR,1626449;,ymathiasgames
