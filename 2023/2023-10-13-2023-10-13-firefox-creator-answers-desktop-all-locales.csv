When clicked, they don't do anything. Manual ""open this link in a new window"" links work, but windows that are supposed to automatically open in new tabs aren't responding. I have pop-ups turned on for the relevant websites. Here's the list of add-ons I have, but I don't think any of them are likely to interfere with tabs. </p><p>AdNauseam Behind The Overlay Block Site Bypass Paywalls Clean Decentraleyes DownThemAll Ecosia Facebook Container FastForward Firefox Multi-Account Containers Firefox Relay FoxReplace Greasemonkey Indie Wiki Buddy KeePass Tusk Privacy Possum uBlacklist User-Agent Switcher WebP / Avif image converter WhatCampaign Youtube to MP3 </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1180;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",theenforcer

Not sure when this started, possibly when windows updated to Win11(2 weeks ago), but not sure. I think there used to be a setting for opening a search in new tab, but I can not find it. I have ""Add search bar in toolbar"" checked. I use DDG as search engine. I did lookup in FF help but found 10yr old answers. I am sure many things have changed since then. </p><p>Also when searching FF help is there a way to sort by newest first? </p><p>TIA </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",newdino
