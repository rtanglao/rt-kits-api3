This has been an ongoing problem.  Previously once the pages initially loaded, I could go to any site afterwards without issues. </p><p>After an update Firefox now quickly has problems after loading.  Firefox stalls, or when I click on a link, the link does not work.  Task manager will show high usage with just one page opened.  I have removed add-ons.  That did not fix the issue.  I end up closing Firefox and restarting.  I can get it to work for a short period of time, but it ends up stalling again and I have to close it again. </p><p>If I open in private mode there is not a problem with loading pages. </p><p>I just realized there is a 2nd icon on the desktop that shows it was installed on September 28, 2023.  If I click on that icon I get a message to make Firefox my primary browser.  Firefox is already set as my primary browser.  That version of Firefox does not have any of my bookmarks installed.  Out of caution, I have not tested it to see if it works beyond opening it. </p><p>When I click on the properties for each shortcut, The new Firefox shows to be located in My account &gt; App Data &gt; Local &gt; Mozilla Firefox The account I have been using for a couple of years is located in This PC &gt; Local Disk (C:) &gt; Profile Files &gt; Mozilla Firefox </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",HiddenAncientRelic

I suspect an extension interaction, but I've not added any new extensions, and they have all worked OK up until the latest download update.
