Basically it launches a print job. Unfortunately the application can't launch since Firefox says ""User Gesture is Required"". We temporarily added a button for a user gesture to be recorded but ultimately we don't want this button here. Is there any setting where we can bypass this ""User Gesture is Required"" check? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",lecapitainehaddock
