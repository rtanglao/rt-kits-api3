My work involves having to use VPN to their USA head office.  It all works fine.  My location is obviously incorrect showing that my computer is located in the USA in their home city.  I understand that. </p><p>It causes me problems with Google Search because it always show me USA based results, not UK based results.  I need to be able to force Google to show me results from the UK.  No, going to <a href=""http://www.google.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">www.google.co.uk</a> doesn't work, it still shows me the USA biased results. </p><p>To a lesser extent, it causes me problems with Google Maps as it keep on searching the wrong areas and returning the wrong results/directions. </p><p>I understand the VPN is causing the location issue, I am not disputing that.  I am asking how to make Firefox show Google my actual location, please?  I'd much prefer to avoid browser extensions.  I tried changing ""geo.provider.network.url"" in ""about:config"".  <a href=""https://browserleaks.com/geo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://browserleaks.com/geo</a> shows the fixed location, i.e., the location I put in.  However, Google isn't fooled by this and still show me the wrong location in the USA. </p><p>Any way to force Google to show me the correct location, please?  Many thanks. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",me119

It has wasted countless hours for Windows Firefox users that end up with a file that they cannot easily remove. </p><p>Here are some steps you can follow to recreate the issue: </p> <ol><li> Open Firefox and search for <strong>die nanny svg</strong> </li></ol> <ol><li> Click the <strong>Images</strong> button </li></ol> <ol><li> <strong>Right-click</strong> the image at the ""Wikipedia"" link (see attached) and select <strong>Open Image in New Tab</strong>. </li></ol> <ol><li> Go to the new tab and you'll see that URL is a base64 encoding of the above preview. </li></ol> <ol><li> Drag the image to a folder and it should then create the problematic very long file name. </li></ol> <p>Please note that performing that last step (i.e. dragging the image to a folder) works without any issue in Edge and Chrome. That is, it just creates a ""download.png"" file. But in Firefox, it creates this filename: </p><p>data image_png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAARwAAACxCAMAAAAh3_JWAAABsFBMVEX_853_oIQAAADc9fgOKz_I6ffXann_9Z7_+aH_+6L_957i+_7P8f__moL_nIP__qSBl5_a9f3_o4b_85fR8_+pxdEAHDTl__+MRU8NKDsAJjvs4ZGLnJ5wgorgbn7_pokjAABhcXhSX2XYzoUAJDwLIjIAFzH_15T_zZH_u4z47JkIG </p> <ol><li> That long filename cannot be easily deleted. These are the steps to delete it: </li></ol> <ol><li> <strong>Shift-right-click</strong> the file name in Explorer and select <strong>Copy as path</strong>. </li></ol> <ol><li> Open a <strong>Cmd</strong> window (<strong>⊞-R cmd</strong>) </li></ol> <ol><li> Enter del \\?\ and then right-click to paste in the copied path. The result should look something like this: del \\?\""C:\Users\SomeUser\Downloads\DATAIM~1.URL"" </li></ol> <ol><li> Press <strong>Enter</strong> to delete the file. </li></ol> <p>Please change Firefox so that it does not create these long filenames. They are creating unnecessary grief. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;,firefox,other,en-US,1577132;,lesferch

This was working fine until I upgraded ubuntu and firefox.  Now I get port error: port not found.  I use a compiled C program to call the peripheral device and pass variables.  It still works fine from the command line and also if I imbed within a php program and call that program from the terminal.  However, if I call that through firefox browser as in localhost/program.php this no longer works.  I think I have firefox 113 now.  I believe based on the behavior this is not a problem with php or ubuntu but is specific to firefox.  I've tried to change permissions but no luck.   don't see any documentation specific to this issue.
