This requires the browser to navigate to my application in an iFrame from another website, passing along with my site's authentication cookie, so my website can sign the user out.  I have this cookie set to SameSite=none &amp; Secure=true, so it can be transmitted cross-site.  However, Total Cookie Protection, which is the default setting on Firefox, is blocking this cookie, which causes the Single Sign Out feature to fail.  If I lower the setting to just ""Cross-site tracking cookies"", the cookie does get properly transmitted, but I cannot expect all of my users to know to go into their settings to enable this. </p><p>What can I do to allow Single Sign Out from a Front Channel URL to work in the default Firefox settings?

When I exit fullscreen mode, the toolbar reappears but a large grey bar then appears at the top of the window (see screenshot). I've read answers in the knowledge base that suggest that the toolbar always disappears in fullscreen mode, but I am 100% sure that this behaviour did not exist before the recent upgrade (perhaps this behaviour has been around for a while in Windows?). Either way the grey bar is clearly a bug and feels related to the toolbar behaviour.

I can't stand it -- it slows down my workflow and seems like ""change for change's sake"". </p><p>But if you guys are serious that it can't be removed for some reason, then at least PLEASE make the unified extensions thing something that can be expanded horizontally along the toolbar (instead of just being a dropdown list) with preferred / most used extension icons visible in it, so that instead of </p><p>&gt;clicking the unified extensions thing &gt;scrolling down to find my extension &gt;right clicking on the extension &gt;choosing the option I want </p><p>It will just be </p><p>&gt;click on the extension icon in the special unified extension section of the toolbar &gt;the options for the extension pop up and I can choose one JUST LIKE THE OLD WAY THAT WAS EFFICIENT </p><p>I wouldn't even be opposed to an entire Extensions Toolbar with super security or whatever built into it. As long as the icons are still conveniently located and accessible! </p><p>I have a bunch of extensions that I don't need to interact with regularly, like my adblocker, https everywhere, or the thing to make webpages appear in dark mode. But every time I click the unified extensions thing they're right there at the top of the list. My screenshot extension however (for example), which I use constantly, is somewhere hidden near the bottom of the list, so I'm constantly scrolling down awkwardly looking for it. It used to be one button click to take a screenshot, now it's like five or six clicks and takes around 20+ seconds every time. IT'S VERY BAD USABILITY DESIGN. It might ""feel"" cleaner or more organized to put everything in a list, but it's not as functional for the end user (in my opinion). </p><p>Please reconsider your design of this thing and investigate the possibility of keeping certain extensions visible on the toolbar somehow to remain easily accessible to the user. Hopefully I've been able to explain my concerns to you. Anyway, I still love Firefox on the desktop, but if you guys can fix this that would be great. </p>",windows;desktop;customize;firefox-1120;firefox-11201;,firefox,customize,en-US,1577163;1577174;,Mammon
