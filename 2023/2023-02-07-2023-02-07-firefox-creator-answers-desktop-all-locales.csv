As a developer behind some of these websites, we will frequently launch and relaunch some of these sites to test different changes, so we don't usually bother with getting a properly signed certificate for the site.  Developers must add a security exception for accessing the sites, which then prompt for user authentication using client certificates. </p><p>The problem I am encountering is that the ""Remember this decision"" checkbox on the ""User Identification Request"" does not seem to be working properly.  There is one site which makes several connections when the page is first loaded and we have to click ""Ok"" on the ""User Identification Request"" about 10 times before the page fully loads.  Other sites will randomly prompt for the request again when fetching data.  The hostname and port do not change between requests. </p><p>I've tried replicating this behavior with a basic Apache httpd server setup with client authentication, but it doesn't seem to happen for the basic site.  If this is happening due to a server configuration issue, I would like to know what it is that is causing it so that I can fix it.  When using Chrome, this behavior does not happen. </p><p>Thank you! </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1090;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",andrew.roth

In general it will crash every 30 minutes or so but sometimes it can happen rapidly in a row. </p><p>I'm not sure what the problem could be but it sounds like a hardware problem? However I don't seem to be experiencing crashes on Edge or Opera when I tried them but I haven't tested it for too long yet. Does anyone have any advice or insight about this? </p><p>Here are some recent report ID's: </p><p>bp-fa5e703a-fb27-4eb0-8cca-260f10230207 </p><p>bp-7a261e27-ac52-44ae-aca8-45fbc0230207 </p><p>bp-2ac09c72-a33b-415a-a1e1-8e2f30230207 </p><p>bp-eca9bdc5-e0f2-438e-95bf-84bde0230207 </p><p>bp-fb11c5ac-9ae6-468b-bc23-edc460230207 </p>,linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1090;firefox-10901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1564408;,Anionz

I sometimes bunch them into groups so when looking down the long list, I can see the link I want better when more than one are from the same website. </p><p>But my issue is that when I went through the list and found that group of links, I could click onto one to open the page.  In the past before the update I could click on the bookmarks drop down again, and still see the same area of links I had just clicked on. </p><p>Now when the bookmarks drop down closes it defaults to the top of the list and I need to scan down to find the links I was looking at again.  Why?  Yes when I closed the browser off and reopened it the bookmarks list would start at the top again.  But if left opened I could click on the bookmarks tab and it would open to the same link area I clicked onto last. </p><p>Is there a way in settings I can reverse this annoying, unnecessary change. </p><p>A word to the Firefox workers that like changing things for no reason.  I use Firefox because I like the things your browser has that the others don't.  Keep taking the little things away that people like, which you seem to keep doing, then my favourite browser will just become ""The same old s#*@"" like all the others. </p>",desktop;beta;bookmarks;needsinfo;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1564415;1564418;,ShadowAD

Today I got an error message from the malwarebytes app that it had blocked a web page. When I looked at the app protection record I saw multiple instances of it blocking firefox.exe (see attached). The report mentions multiple instances of the app fox.exe being blocked on port 443 with different ip addresses and connection listed as ""outbound"". I am not very knowledgeable about the web, so some help would be great. The report goes back into January although today was the first time I saw the pop up warning.  I only have 2 extensions installed and as far as I know they are legit.
