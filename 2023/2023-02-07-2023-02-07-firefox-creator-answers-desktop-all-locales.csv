Lets assume that this iframe is loaded like this: &lt;script src=""<a href=""https://example.com/wie.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://example.com/wie.js</a>""&gt;&lt;/script&gt; I have already added 'allow-scripts allow-forms allow-modals allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-storage-access-by-user-activation' at sandbox. I also use document.requestStorageAccess() from inside the iframe and I set event listeners for the storage like this: window.addEventListener('storage', onStorageFunc, false);. From the iframe a popup window is presented when user clicks a specific button and the popup opens at lets say at this url ""<a href=""https://paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://paypal.com</a>"". After user navigation on popup, paypal at the end of the flow redirects user to this url ""<a href=""https://example.com/success"" rel=""nofollow"">https://example.com/success</a>"". At this point when user is navigated to /success I add some data to local storage which I expect to trigger the storage event listener and the onStorageFunc to run. This doesn't happen, while in other browsers it works as expected. Since both popup and iframe are under the same url (<a href=""https://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://example.com</a>) and I have used requestStorageAccess, I would expect this to work normally.  Can you please help me to find out what is going wrong here? In the past I had the same problem but it was fixed when I added 'requestStorageAccess' and 'allow-storage-access-by-user-activation'. Now I can see it happening again. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1090;firefox-10901;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",wolfskinn

In general it will crash every 30 minutes or so but sometimes it can happen rapidly in a row. </p><p>I'm not sure what the problem could be but it sounds like a hardware problem? However I don't seem to be experiencing crashes on Edge or Opera when I tried them but I haven't tested it for too long yet.

I sometimes bunch them into groups so when looking down the long list, I can see the link I want better when more than one are from the same website. </p><p>But my issue is that when I went through the list and found that group of links, I could click onto one to open the page.  In the past before the update I could click on the bookmarks drop down again, and still see the same area of links I had just clicked on. </p><p>Now when the bookmarks drop down closes it defaults to the top of the list and I need to scan down to find the links I was looking at again.  Why?  Yes when I closed the browser off and reopened it the bookmarks list would start at the top again.  But if left opened I could click on the bookmarks tab and it would open to the same link area I clicked onto last. </p><p>Is there a way in settings I can reverse this annoying, unnecessary change. </p><p>A word to the Firefox workers that like changing things for no reason.  I use Firefox because I like the things your browser has that the others don't.  Keep taking the little things away that people like, which you seem to keep doing, then my favourite browser will just become ""The same old s#*@"" like all the others. </p>",desktop;beta;bookmarks;needsinfo;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1564415;1564418;,ShadowAD

I am not very knowledgeable about the web, so some help would be great. The report goes back into January although today was the first time I saw the pop up warning.
