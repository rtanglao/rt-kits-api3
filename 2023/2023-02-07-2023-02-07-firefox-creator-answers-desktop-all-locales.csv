The first is <a href=""http://Fidelity.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Fidelity.com</a>. If it will load at all, it takes a near eternity to do so. The second is the web site for my medicare insurance plan - it causes me to be locked out of my on-line account. These issues first occurred on the second to last update when both of these problems first appeared. I almost chalked it up to coincidence. But now that it has happened again (and only those two web sites) with the latest update I installed (ver. 109.1), I know that it is a problem with Firefox. I have enjoyed the privacy and reliability of Firefox for years. But if updates are going to eliminate my access to my most used web sites, then I'll have to find another browser. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1090;firefox-10901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",cadman571

As a developer behind some of these websites, we will frequently launch and relaunch some of these sites to test different changes, so we don't usually bother with getting a properly signed certificate for the site.  Developers must add a security exception for accessing the sites, which then prompt for user authentication using client certificates. </p><p>The problem I am encountering is that the ""Remember this decision"" checkbox on the ""User Identification Request"" does not seem to be working properly.  There is one site which makes several connections when the page is first loaded and we have to click ""Ok"" on the ""User Identification Request"" about 10 times before the page fully loads.  Other sites will randomly prompt for the request again when fetching data.  The hostname and port do not change between requests. </p><p>I've tried replicating this behavior with a basic Apache httpd server setup with client authentication, but it doesn't seem to happen for the basic site.  If this is happening due to a server configuration issue, I would like to know what it is that is causing it so that I can fix it.  When using Chrome, this behavior does not happen. </p><p>Thank you! </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1090;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",andrew.roth
