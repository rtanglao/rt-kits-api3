I go to about 10 websites regularly throughout the day every day. Yet for a few sites, FF refuses to autofill the actual sites I go to. If I type an r, I get Raw Story; if I type C, I get CNN, and so on. But even though I have <strong>never</strong> typed in ""<a href=""http://www.rawstory.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.rawstory.com</a>,"" that's what I get when I type a w even though Wonkette is one of the sites I'm on all day. I also never type in ""<a href=""http://mail.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.google.com</a>"" because I have my email on the bookmarks bar, but that's what I get when I type an m instead of Mediate, another of the daily sites. </p><p>And it doesn't stop with Ctrl + delete because they don't turn up on the drop down list; they automatically populate the search bar, and then hitting delete for any reason just removes it from the bar, not from the list of suggestions. So my question is, how can I get Firefox to stop imposing itself on me when there is a clear pattern by now of what sites I visit all the time? </p><p>Thank you very much, Nandi </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,other,en-US,1559431;1559432;,nandibrown
