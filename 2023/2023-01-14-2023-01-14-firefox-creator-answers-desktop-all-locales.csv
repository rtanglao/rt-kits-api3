I'll call this the ""magnifying zoom"". </p><p>However, Firefox has <strong>2 other types of zooms</strong>. It can zoom only the text (I'll call this ""text zoom""), where the CSS property `font-size` is changed for all text, and it can zoom all elements (I'll call this ""elements zoom""), where images, video tags etc., all HTML elements are increased in size. </p><p>The main difference between these 3 types of zoom I found are that:  </p><pre>- the <strong>magnifier zoom</strong> doesn't change anything about CSS or the page layout, everything stays exactly as it was, the only difference is that the window is magnified, so everything looks bigger. - the <strong>elements zoom does change</strong> the page layout. For example, by increasing the size of HTML elements, it can have the same effect of a media query for a smaller screen size and remove or reorganize column of elements. By changing elements sizes, elements can get reordered around the page. This never happens with the magnifier zoom, where the page remains exactly as it was before, but magnified.  - the <strong>text zoom</strong> only changes text size, although this can also trigger a change to the page layout if HTML elements get too big. </pre> <p>I'm currently using a bluetooth keyboard with a touchpad, when I pinch-in using this bluetooth touchpad, I get an <em>elements zoom</em>, instead of a <em>magnifier zoom</em> like the one of my laptop's touchpad. I believe the reason is that my bluetooth touchpad is being recognized as a mouse, and using Ctrl+mouse wheel gets an <em>elements zoom</em>. </p> <ol><li><ol><li> <strong>Question:</strong> </li></ol> </li></ol> <p>Is there a way to force all pinch in movements or all zooms to be only magnifier zooms? I don't want to change the page layout, I only want to magnify a certain part I can't see properly. Is there a way to pick and choose which kind of zoom I'd like to have? </p><p>I only found [addons][1] that could let me choose between <strong>elements zoom and text zoom</strong>, but there's no option for the <strong>magnifier zoom</strong>. </p><p><br> </p><pre> [1]: <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/zoom-page-we/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/zoom-page-we/</a> </pre>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1080;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",aicelrf2

The crash is immediate, the Firefox window never even gets a chance to open. I restarted my computer, then refreshed Firefox, then uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox, nothing worked.  </p><p>A scan for malware came back negative and there aren't any recent new websites I've visited, new programs I've downloaded, or other obvious correlating events that might hint at an explanation. The only thing I can think of is that my laptop did prompt me to upgrade to Windows 11 yesterday or the day before and I declined, but Firefox worked fine that day.  </p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated! </p><p>Chase </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1559454;1559455;,cbharriman

Updated firefox, updated OS. </p><p>So, I have a firefox tab open. When I set ""Full Screen"" in ""View"" setting, I still have the tabs and url bar shown. I want to be able to remove the tabs, url bar, and mac toolbar from the screen while on a firefox tab. How do I do this? ""Full Screen"" in ""View"" only removes the mac toolbar. If I remember correctly, my windows 10 computer just has to press F11 to go fullscreen and remove the tabs and url bar as well (or is that google chrome?). </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",leonh0807

This time, though, it's not letting me. </p><p>A ""Restore Session"" tab came up that said the following: </p><p>""Sorry. We’re having trouble getting your pages back. </p><p>We are having trouble restoring your last browsing session. Select Restore Session to try again. </p><p>Still not able to restore your session? Sometimes a tab is causing the issue. View previous tabs, remove the checkmark from the tabs you don’t need to recover, and then restore."" </p><p>I usually attempt to restore from the ""History"" dropdown menu at the top of the screen, and it usually works on the first try. But even when it doesn't, this screen appears and gives me the option of clicking on the bright blue ""Restore Session"" button, and that typically does it. This time, though, the blue ""Restore Session"" button is much more muted in color and not responsive to clicks. </p><p>Do you have any ideas? Like I say, I keep a LOT of tabs open, and most of them serve as reminders to take care of something or other, so I really need to reopen all tabs from that previous session so I don't lose those reminders. Thanks! </p><p>RM </p>",desktop;tabs;mac-os-x-1013;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1559453;,ray.h.misra

I go to about 10 websites regularly throughout the day every day. Yet for a few sites, FF refuses to autofill the actual sites I go to. If I type an r, I get Raw Story; if I type C, I get CNN, and so on. But even though I have <strong>never</strong> typed in ""<a href=""http://www.rawstory.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.rawstory.com</a>,"" that's what I get when I type a w even though Wonkette is one of the sites I'm on all day. I also never type in ""<a href=""http://mail.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.google.com</a>"" because I have my email on the bookmarks bar, but that's what I get when I type an m instead of Mediate, another of the daily sites. </p><p>And it doesn't stop with Ctrl + delete because they don't turn up on the drop down list; they automatically populate the search bar, and then hitting delete for any reason just removes it from the bar, not from the list of suggestions. So my question is, how can I get Firefox to stop imposing itself on me when there is a clear pattern by now of what sites I visit all the time? </p><p>Thank you very much, Nandi </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,other,en-US,1559431;1559432;1559438;1559460;,nandibrown
