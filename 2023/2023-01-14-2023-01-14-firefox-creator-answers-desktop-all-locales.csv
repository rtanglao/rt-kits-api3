I'll call this the ""magnifying zoom"". </p><p>However, Firefox has <strong>2 other types of zooms</strong>. It can zoom only the text (I'll call this ""text zoom""), where the CSS property `font-size` is changed for all text, and it can zoom all elements (I'll call this ""elements zoom""), where images, video tags etc., all HTML elements are increased in size. </p><p>The main difference between these 3 types of zoom I found are that:  </p><pre>- the <strong>magnifier zoom</strong> doesn't change anything about CSS or the page layout, everything stays exactly as it was, the only difference is that the window is magnified, so everything looks bigger. - the <strong>elements zoom does change</strong> the page layout. For example, by increasing the size of HTML elements, it can have the same effect of a media query for a smaller screen size and remove or reorganize column of elements. By changing elements sizes, elements can get reordered around the page. This never happens with the magnifier zoom, where the page remains exactly as it was before, but magnified.  - the <strong>text zoom</strong> only changes text size, although this can also trigger a change to the page layout if HTML elements get too big. </pre> <p>I'm currently using a bluetooth keyboard with a touchpad, when I pinch-in using this bluetooth touchpad, I get an <em>elements zoom</em>, instead of a <em>magnifier zoom</em> like the one of my laptop's touchpad. I believe the reason is that my bluetooth touchpad is being recognized as a mouse, and using Ctrl+mouse wheel gets an <em>elements zoom</em>. </p> <ol><li><ol><li> <strong>Question:</strong> </li></ol> </li></ol> <p>Is there a way to force all pinch in movements or all zooms to be only magnifier zooms?

Like I say, I keep a LOT of tabs open, and most of them serve as reminders to take care of something or other, so I really need to reopen all tabs from that previous session so I don't lose those reminders. Thanks! </p><p>RM </p>",desktop;tabs;mac-os-x-1013;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1559453;,ray.h.misra

I go to about 10 websites regularly throughout the day every day. Yet for a few sites, FF refuses to autofill the actual sites I go to. If I type an r, I get Raw Story; if I type C, I get CNN, and so on. But even though I have <strong>never</strong> typed in ""<a href=""http://www.rawstory.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.rawstory.com</a>,"" that's what I get when I type a w even though Wonkette is one of the sites I'm on all day. I also never type in ""<a href=""http://mail.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.google.com</a>"" because I have my email on the bookmarks bar, but that's what I get when I type an m instead of Mediate, another of the daily sites. </p><p>And it doesn't stop with Ctrl + delete because they don't turn up on the drop down list; they automatically populate the search bar, and then hitting delete for any reason just removes it from the bar, not from the list of suggestions. So my question is, how can I get Firefox to stop imposing itself on me when there is a clear pattern by now of what sites I visit all the time? </p><p>Thank you very much, Nandi </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,other,en-US,1559431;1559432;1559438;1559460;,nandibrown
