ALL of my programs were gone and I was left with a raw Win10. 6/12/2023 was last date prior to the disaster. I reinstalled Firefox. Using the ""firefox.exe -p"" I can only find the default profile.  I DO HAVE a full backup done using the Win7 Backup and Restore feature. How do I resurrect my most recent profile? I will need to find the files(s) manually from the b/u. When I did a Full  Restore the bookmarks didn't appear. Where and what files am I looking for?  The attached screen shots from the b/u may be of help.

It seems to be because of security reasons. Could a sticky notes customization tool be built-in natively to Firefox itself to enable sticky notes to be created and pinned on the Default Firefox Home Page? </p>,desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1140;,firefox,customize,en-US,1586084;,PocketRocket

Never had any issue until the new update. When I start up Firefox (not in any full-screen mode) I pan my mouse to the left side of the screen and the taskbar no longer will show....Until i hit F11 to go full-screen and then hit F11 again to get out of it. Then the taskbar shows up as normal. Not sure why, nothing has been changed on my end since the last 4 or so updates and was fine until 114.0.1 </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1586101;,wickedmachine

I am clicking on keep source formatting in Word when I paste text, but the format doesn't carry over from the website I am copying it from.
