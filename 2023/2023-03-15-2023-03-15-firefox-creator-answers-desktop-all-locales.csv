It won't allow you to customize the types of passwords that are generated e.g. length, complexity, excluded characters, etc. This wouldn't be such an issue if there was a way to manually generate a password but there seems to be no tool for this anywhere in the settings and no plans to add this feature. I wouldn't be so frustrated if I didn't actually like and actually use the password manager but I do.
