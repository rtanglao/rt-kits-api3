I normally always had Firefox find an update but ask me to install. I did those. I now have v110.0.1 installed. I did that last week after I stupidly screwed something up to do with permissions on folders. Everything seems okay now, all are fixed (all my other programs work fine now) except that in Firefox History (Ctrl+Shift+H) I can only ever see ""Today"" under the ""History"" category. I can browse, bookmark, etc. just fine. I suppose there is some setting somewhere that I've messed up but I cannot find it. Can you help me such that it shows ""Last x Days"", months older, etc.&nbsp;? BTW I also tried mozillaistoryview.exe and it also only shows ""today"". Nothing in my system has changed for about a week but I browse every day. Thanks. </p><p>BTW I'm on Win10_Pro/64 whichever build/update is current. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,other,en-US,1570639;,darylspitfire1
