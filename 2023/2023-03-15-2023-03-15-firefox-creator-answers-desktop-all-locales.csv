I want to add more tabs (webpage links) to my Firefox Home Page. Firefox Help/FAQ says that I should select the address bar, enter in a website address, and then click on the ""menu button"" which is on the right side of the address bar. It is supposed to look like three dots or three lines. However, my address bar does not show that - or at least I can't find it. The picture provided in the online Firefox FAQ doesn't match what I am seeing on my home page. Please let me know how to get this ""menu button"" to appear.

Cyberark does use Xming aplication brokering.    I logon to linux instance and type firefox and the page will lockup and I can't type anything in the browser.   I have tried different options listed under your support page and ran many search related X11 slowness with firefox and nothing fixes the issue.   Is there a bug with a specific version of Xming when using firefox?    I have tried shutting down any McAfee services and the following options. Uncheck hardware acceleration about:config  gfx.webrender.all set to true,  browser.session.restore_on_demand to false, browser.session.restore_tabs_lazily to false  and the browser does not lock, but once enter the web page it locks up.     </p><p>Example when I use Red Hat Satellite , it locks up and  had to kill the firefox process .  When I add the options above I can get into the web page like satellite, logon etc.  but then it locks.    I need fire fox to work on a cloud instance that does use Xming since that is what CyberArk has.

I normally always had Firefox find an update but ask me to install. I did those. I now have v110.0.1 installed. I did that last week after I stupidly screwed something up to do with permissions on folders. Everything seems okay now, all are fixed (all my other programs work fine now) except that in Firefox History (Ctrl+Shift+H) I can only ever see ""Today"" under the ""History"" category. I can browse, bookmark, etc. just fine. I suppose there is some setting somewhere that I've messed up but I cannot find it. Can you help me such that it shows ""Last x Days"", months older, etc.&nbsp;? BTW I also tried mozillaistoryview.exe and it also only shows ""today"". Nothing in my system has changed for about a week but I browse every day.
