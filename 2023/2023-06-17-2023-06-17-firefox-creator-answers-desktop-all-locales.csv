The prompt for the Master Password does not function as it should but it does on Microsoft Edge.  I've spoken with Last Pass on this and we added it to Edge in order to test the results.  The result was that the Lass Pass icon on Edge remained lit but was not lit on Firefox.  It should re-time itself whenever Last Pass is utilized and I use it for all my log-ins throughout the day...every day!  I do not like Edge and use Firefox exclusively.  I find this situation extremely disconcerting.  I've been asked to enter that Master Password again and again within the 24 hour re-prompt schedule...at times within minutes!  This should not occur.  Please fix this glitch.  It's between you or your developer and Lass Pass.  It has nothing to do with me </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,other,en-US,1585995;,13kuklapolitan13

I know all about the DigiNotar fiasco and how their root cert was left enabled after the NL government took over in order to prevent a bunch more problems. However, I don't understand why that cert is listed in my Servers tab and why it isn't anywhere in my Settings -&gt; Certificates options window. I have used a couple self-signed certs in the past for localhost web server stuff where I got tired of the SSL warning over HTTP on my local domain, but otherwise only have my PGP key and haven't messed with anything otherwise. Should I be worried? This thing happened several years ago and the Root Cert I have is listed as expiring in about a year and a half.  </p><p>Running Windows 11 Pro and Firefox 114.0.1 (64-bit) </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1140;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1585998;,terriblenihilist
