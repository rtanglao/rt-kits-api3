When using Chrome or Edge, clicking on 'Home' brings me to the top of the web page I'm looking at. Very handy.  </p><p>For scrolling long pages, 'PgUp' and 'PgDn' are useful for scrolling sections at time.  </p><p>But in Firefox, none of these are working properly. the 'Home button does nothing at all. I have used 'Fn+Left' and this works sometimes, other times it does nothing.  </p><p>The Page Up and Down keys are hit and miss.
