Plus, that suggestion is basically ""we admit that our product is broken, here's a work-around that a few people may be able to use"". </p><p>And finally: I'm pretty sure that Firefox <em>used</em> to be able to discriminate between subdomains, so the question isn't so much ""how can I get it to work"", as ""why was it taken away in the first place"". </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-1190;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",niall.jackson
