As are the fonts on web sites.  (Among several formatting / display issues after the update.)  After spending over 4 hours researching / adjusting font size in settings, pixels in ""about:config"" and other adjustments, tabs and menus are somewhat readable again.  But most of my websites still DO NOT DISPLAY CORRECTLY!!!!   This is ridiculous!!!  STOP CHANGING USER SETTINGS AT UPDATES!  This is simple incompetence as it's NOT the first time I've experienced this problem with an update.  After using Fifefox for almost 20 years I'm DONE.  This is supposed to be a an easy to use, productivity enhancing, browser.....at least it used to be.  The sites that don't display in Firfox are fine when viewed in Chrome or Edge....meaning the problem<strong> IS WITH THE FIREFOX UPDATE....AGAIN</strong>!   Migrating to Chrome so I can spend my time working on my system rather then repairing Firefox. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",Paladin921
