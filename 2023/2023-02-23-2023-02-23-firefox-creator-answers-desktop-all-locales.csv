I have currently multiple opened tabs, and it's impossible to navigate, to open a new tab, a new window, to interact in any way. When I go to the top left under meny -Firefox - About Firefox - Submit Feedback or Firefox Help, a new tab does open, but I still cannot interact with it. I have to quit and reopen multiple times (third today) for it to work properly. Please help! Many thanks </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1013;,firefox,other,en-US,"",fatimouna

When I change the sync settings in Firefox at the work computer, the corresponding sync settings are also applied to my private devices (Windows PC, Android tablet and phone), meaning my bookmarks, history and everything isn't synced between my private devices. However, I'd like to keep synchronization on for everything on all private devices, just not for the work pc except for passwords and open tabs. Isn't there a way to have <strong>device specific</strong> synchronization settings when logged into the same account? Or is it that whenever I change which items to sync, it gets applied to my Firefox account and therefore is applied to all devices I'm logged in?  Sorry if I worded it weirdly, let me know if there's something hard to understand in my text. Thank you! </p>",desktop;beta;sync;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",maria_99
