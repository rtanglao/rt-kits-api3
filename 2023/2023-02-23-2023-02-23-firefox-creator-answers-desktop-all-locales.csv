I ran the performance profiler, and I found that virtually all of the time was spent in the ""Waiting to transmit the response"" phase, found in the Network tab of the profile, when hovering over a long bar. In many cases, it was taking over 15 seconds, and there wasn't much information at all being sent from the server. </p><p>My question is, what exactly does that phase of the request cover? Could it involve the server not sending data fast enough? A network issue (DNS, proxies, etc.)? The client being low on resources at that moment? </p><p>Also, can someone please provide me a list of possible other areas of the profile, or anywhere else, to check to help me narrow down the cause of slow performance in this specific area? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jmyszka
