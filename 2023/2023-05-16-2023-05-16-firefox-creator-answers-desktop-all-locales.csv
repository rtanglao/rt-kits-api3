The only way really was to make a new password for my accounts. I knew I'd lose access to all my other passwords but that's life. I was able to disconnect and then reconnect with my new password on my Android application and log on to my accounts on another machine, but it's been impossible to log out and start fresh again on my main computer (MacBook Air). As per normal, whenever I open Firefox (I've deinstalled and reinstalled multiple times, as well as deleting cookies) I immediately get the pop-up box asking for my password. It does not accept the new password, which has worked on other connected machines. I figured the only way to get around this would be to log out of my account on my MacBook, but then the only way to do this is by using my password -- which this specific pop-up box will not accept. Is there a way around this? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",morettifc

I forced my laptop to shutdown and after rebooting my laptop as soon as I opened Firefox the window opened but the tab crashed and would not open any website. Firefox suggested I temporary remove the extensions and nothing worked. I uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox and continued to receive the tab crash error messages. I had no choice but uninstall Firefox and very frustrated. I was comfortable using Firefox and was my go to browser. I reluctantly had to download Brave as per my son's suggestion. I am afraid to install Firefox expecting to see the same tab crash error message. What do I do? </p>,desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1580915;1580922;,scottjough

Zkoušel jsem to i na jiném PC kde se to chová stejně a nemohu přijít na to proč. Testováno na Windows 11 a Windows 10. </p><p>Prohlížeč používám tak, že ho na svém účtu spouštím jako jiný uživatel, který má jen práva uživatele, pokud potřebuji něco stáhnout, tak soubor uložím do složky, kam mají všichni uživatelé PC přidělená práva přístupu  a se soubory už dále pracuji pod právy v systému přihlášeného účtu. Nikdy s tím nebyl problém. Posledních několik týdnů mi všechny soubory uložené z Firefoxu nerespektují nastavení oprávnění na složce a ze všech ostatních profilů je k nim přístup blokovaný. Dostane se k nim jen administrátor a to ještě pokud soubor spustí v režimu ""spustit jako správce"", jinak nemá právno čist ani oprávnění na daných souborech. Jedná se nějakou chybu, nebo je to nějaká nová bezpečnostní funkce? Používám tímto způsobem prohlížeč několik let a nikdy jsem se s tímto chováním nesetkal a v podstatě mi to zmemožnuje takto prohlížeč používat.
