Ever since, my Firefox has experienced SIGNIFICANT lag time loading even the most basic of websites.  It feels like Netscape 1.0 slow (yes, I'm that old).  I've disabled 2/3ds of my addons to see if that would help and it hasn't.  I don't know if it's an issue with the Win 11 update (KB5026372), with Firefox or some combination of both, but any help in addressing this issue would be greatly appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1130;firefox-11301;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",brega03

I never never ever want Firefox to restore pages at any time for any reason. </p><p>Background:  I use firefox for work, and I keep 7 separate firefox windows open to the sites I use to do my job.

The only way really was to make a new password for my accounts. I knew I'd lose access to all my other passwords but that's life. I was able to disconnect and then reconnect with my new password on my Android application and log on to my accounts on another machine, but it's been impossible to log out and start fresh again on my main computer (MacBook Air). As per normal, whenever I open Firefox (I've deinstalled and reinstalled multiple times, as well as deleting cookies) I immediately get the pop-up box asking for my password. It does not accept the new password, which has worked on other connected machines. I figured the only way to get around this would be to log out of my account on my MacBook, but then the only way to do this is by using my password -- which this specific pop-up box will not accept.

After I updated to version 113.0.1 today, I see that button shifted back to the right end of the bar.  I do NOT want it there.  Can you fix it so the code will work again?  Is there alternate code or some other means to accomplish the same end? </p><p>The code I've been using is as follows: </p> <pre>@namespace url(""<a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul</a>""); /* only needed once */  #PanelUI-button, #customization-panel-container, #customization-panelWrapper .panel-arrow { -moz-box-ordinal-group: 0 !important;}  /* Panel UI */ #PanelUI-button {background-position: 100% 0, calc(100% - 1px) 0, calc(100% - 2px) 0 !important;} #PanelUI-popup {margin-right:-350px!important;} #PanelUI-popup .panel-arrow {margin-right:340px!important;}  /* #PanelUI-quit  #PanelUI-customize  #PanelUI-help */ #PanelUI-footer #PanelUI-footer-inner {direction:rtl !important;}</pre><br>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1130;,firefox,customize,en-US,1580844;1580862;,earlpjones2

You can add a back door with multiple info requests to the print, or request additional fingers, if I click add this. I am terrified they will get to ALL my empty credit cards since they hacked all my info. Personally I love the fingerprint, and if I lock it, it can ONLY be unlocked with my fingerprint, or additional things I choose. I don't have all my pwds handy, nor could I ever have what all I need. I am CONSTANTLY locked out because I don't recall my pw. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1580811;,cherilm931

I have a disabled extension Classic Theme Restorer installed, but I thought it was already disabled long ago.  In the Customize Toolbar dialog, the unused icons are displayed with text labels.
