You can add a back door with multiple info requests to the print, or request additional fingers, if I click add this. I am terrified they will get to ALL my empty credit cards since they hacked all my info. Personally I love the fingerprint, and if I lock it, it can ONLY be unlocked with my fingerprint, or additional things I choose. I don't have all my pwds handy, nor could I ever have what all I need. I am CONSTANTLY locked out because I don't recall my pw. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1580811;,cherilm931

I had text rather than icons displayed on my toolbar.  Now the text has vanished and I can't find a way to get text OR icons back.  I have a disabled extension Classic Theme Restorer installed, but I thought it was already disabled long ago.  In the Customize Toolbar dialog, the unused icons are displayed with text labels.  When I drag one to the toolbar, it turns invisible like all the rest. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1130;firefox-11301;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",gsknick
