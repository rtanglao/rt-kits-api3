After I updated to version 113.0.1 today, I see that button shifted back to the right end of the bar.  I do NOT want it there.  Can you fix it so the code will work again?  Is there alternate code or some other means to accomplish the same end? </p><p>The code I've been using is as follows: </p><p>@namespace url(""<a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul</a>""); /* only needed once */ </p> <ol><li>PanelUI-button, </li><li>customization-panel-container, </li><li>customization-panelWrapper .panel-arrow { -moz-box-ordinal-group: 0&nbsp;!important;} </li></ol> <p>/* Panel UI */ </p> <ol><li>PanelUI-button {background-position: 100% 0, calc(100% - 1px) 0, calc(100% - 2px) 0&nbsp;!important;} </li><li>PanelUI-popup {margin-right:-350px!important;} </li><li>PanelUI-popup .panel-arrow {margin-right:340px!important;} </li></ol> <p>/* #PanelUI-quit  #PanelUI-customize  #PanelUI-help */ </p> <ol><li>PanelUI-footer #PanelUI-footer-inner {direction:rtl&nbsp;!important;} </li></ol>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1130;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",earlpjones2

You can add a back door with multiple info requests to the print, or request additional fingers, if I click add this. I am terrified they will get to ALL my empty credit cards since they hacked all my info. Personally I love the fingerprint, and if I lock it, it can ONLY be unlocked with my fingerprint, or additional things I choose. I don't have all my pwds handy, nor could I ever have what all I need. I am CONSTANTLY locked out because I don't recall my pw. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1580811;,cherilm931

I had text rather than icons displayed on my toolbar.  Now the text has vanished and I can't find a way to get text OR icons back.  I have a disabled extension Classic Theme Restorer installed, but I thought it was already disabled long ago.  In the Customize Toolbar dialog, the unused icons are displayed with text labels.  When I drag one to the toolbar, it turns invisible like all the rest. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1130;firefox-11301;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",gsknick
