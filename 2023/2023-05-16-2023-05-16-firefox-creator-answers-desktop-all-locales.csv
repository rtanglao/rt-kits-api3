You can add a back door with multiple info requests to the print, or request additional fingers, if I click add this. I am terrified they will get to ALL my empty credit cards since they hacked all my info. Personally I love the fingerprint, and if I lock it, it can ONLY be unlocked with my fingerprint, or additional things I choose. I don't have all my pwds handy, nor could I ever have what all I need. I am CONSTANTLY locked out because I don't recall my pw. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1580811;,cherilm931
