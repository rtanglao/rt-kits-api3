I had text rather than icons displayed on my toolbar.  Now the text has vanished and I can't find a way to get text OR icons back.  I have a disabled extension Classic Theme Restorer installed, but I thought it was already disabled long ago.  In the Customize Toolbar dialog, the unused icons are displayed with text labels.  When I drag one to the toolbar, it turns invisible like all the rest. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1130;firefox-11301;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",gsknick
