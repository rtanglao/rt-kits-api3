But when I want to do this, I have to go to the Toolbar Burger, click, Bookmarks, click, Manage Bookmarks (at the bottom), click, (new window) Organize, click, Add folder, click and then I'm there.  5 (FIVE) clicks to add a Folder.   Possible solution? 1)When clicking on the Bookmark Chevron on the toolbar, place at the top of the list the option to ""Add Folder"", or ""New Folder"".  Bingo done. 2)When clicking on the Bookmark Chevron on the toolbar, place at the top of the list the option to ""Add Folder"" and just make that a shortcut that gets you to the final destination of the current method, thus eliminating 4 clicks.   I hope I don't sound spoiled or needy,...OMG FIVE CLICKS to add a new folder I'm going to die!!! But it really is annoying and costs time when I'm trying to quickly get some things done. Thanks!

The loading time for pages is agonizing, and I have tried the following: </p> <ul><li> Clearing Firefox's cache (which usually fixes the problem for a day or so) </li><li> Resetting Firefox (which usually fixes the problem for a day or two) </li><li> Using all combinations of Performance settings (using/not using recommended settings and using/not using hardware acceleration </li></ul> <p>I am running the same Kaspersky software on this PC as the ones on which Firefox runs well, so I don't think that is the problem (although I'm not an expert tech user, I admit).

Standard, the system window title bar was hidden.  But I wanted access to the ""Move to desktop"" menu and wanted the title in the title bar.  So, in ""Customize toolbar"" I checked ""Title bar"".  The title bar reappeared, but a complete border along the Firefox window became inaccessible, and when clicking in that zone, it effectively clicked in the window behind.  In particular, the complete menu bar is inaccessible, as well as the scroll bar on the left and in the bookmarks sidebar the fold/unfold.  And Mozilla Thunderbird 115.5.0 has the same annoying behaviour.  Even when hovering over some menus in the Mozilla window, you can sometimes see reactions from the window under the Mozilla window.  On older Kubuntu computers (up to 18.04) with older versions of Firefox (up to 113.0.2) and Thunderbird (up to 102.11.0) I do not have that problem.
