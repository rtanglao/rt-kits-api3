I cannot easily play some browser games because they must be full screen and the toolbar popping up continuously interrupts the game. </p><p>To clarify, I do not want the toolbar to always be there; locking the toolbar so that it automatically shows when in full screen is not the solution I am looking for. I want the toolbar to disappear when I am in full screen and not popup when I hover over the top area of the screen.  </p><p>Thank you for any help! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1210;,firefox,customize,en-US,1627160;,hayley.a.echard

I am using Bitwarden to store my passkeys, unfortunately Firefox keeps on calling Windows Security for passkey authentication. </p><p>I have already saved another passkey in Windows' built-in passkey manager (My laptop has a fingerprint reader), but that passkey won't appear as an option for it, so I am asking if it's possible to prevent Firefox from calling Windows Security, and allow Bitwarden to handle the request instead? </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1210;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",NiffirgkcaJ

It's not my internet connection, as other internet applications like Discord, Steam, and Spotify have continued to work while the VPN is active with no issue. This problem only seems to be affecting, and therefore must be the result of, something wrong with Firefox.  </p><p>I tried rebooting my computer, which briefly worked but after a short while, opening new tabs or navigating links on webpages stopped working again fairly quickly. When I try to open a new webpage the loading symbol appears over the tab icon for a split second and then vanishes, the webpage remaining the same; and when trying to open links in a new tab they do not load and the little ""lock"" symbol in the search bar appears crossed out, indicating the browser is not establishing a secure connection. </p><pre>I tried just restarting the app itself, using troubleshooting mode, and clearing my cache as well, but <em>every one</em> hit the same dead end.  </pre> <p>Does anyone have a fix for this? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-11560;firefox-1156;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",adriometer
