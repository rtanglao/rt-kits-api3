There seemed to be no way to get them ordered the same way in the drop-down list for a new tab as I specify under Manage Containers, so I just removed and re-created them one at a time in the order I wanted. Now the Container drop-down list for a new tab appears in the right order. That's on latest Firefox on Ubuntu 22.04. I have Sync turned on for everything, and all the Containers I created in Ubuntu Firefox are shown in Firefox for Windows 10, but they're in a random order. This is extremely annoying, as I have about 25 Containers. When they're ordered I can quickly find the Container I want to use for a new tab, but the randomized order makes it difficult. </p><p>How can I get the Container list in Windows Firefox to be identical to Ubuntu Firefox - both sync'd with my one Mozilla account and both at Firefox v 121.0. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",linux;desktop;sync;firefox-1210;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",JackApplewhite
