Tried to list another item a few days ago, and after entering the details on the first page (Item description and section to list it in) couldn't get beyond that page. The next page appeared not blank but as light grey filled rectangles where the text etc should be. Obviously tried reload. Same over the next day or so. In desperation, used Edge. No problems with that, using the same first page which Ebay had stored for me. Just tried again with Firefox - same fault. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,other,en-US,1617549;,dave271
