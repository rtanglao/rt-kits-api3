I tried synching from my phone but no changes. </p><p>My issue isfor the life of me I cannot find EXACTLY where the command option is located for synching contacts in Google. I went ""Accounts"" management, on the left there are many options.I drilled down and  I cannot find 'synching.' I found my device but nothing around there is there an option for synching. I thought as a last resort it might be a FF matter but so far it doesn't seem to be. </p><p>So where oh where PLEEEASE PRECISELY, EXACTLY in Google is the synching command option if you can tell me.
