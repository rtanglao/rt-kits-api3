At the same time, I have added some webs that I usually use as exceptions, allowing to remember cookies in those. However, I have the following question: if I reject all cookies except for the mandatories ones in a website that I added to my ""remember list"", does that mean that future entrances in that web will be with only essential cookies? </p><p>As an example, if I mark <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bbc.com/</a> as  cookies, and the first time I enter I reject all non-essential cookies, next times I enter in the bbc will I be navigating with only the cookies I accepted on this first entrance? Or allowing a site automatically accepts all cookies? </p><p>Thank you very much on advanced. </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-11;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,cookies,en-US,"",rdemedrano
