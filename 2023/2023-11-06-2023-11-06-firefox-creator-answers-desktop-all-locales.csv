Se for um vídeo em 720p60, por exemplo, o navegador consegue reproduzir as imagens e o áudio suavemente. Se eu tentar reproduzir esses vídeos no Google Chrome ou baixar eles e usar no Media Player Classic (MPC-HC), eles conseguem reproduzir vídeos em 1080p sem problemas. Em todos os casos, são vídeos com codec H264. </p><p>Um detalhe, o Firefox aparenta reproduzir vídeos em 1080p de 24 FPS, mas seu ficar mexendo no mouse sob a página, ou no próprio vídeo, a imagem fica travando até que eu pare de mexer no mouse. </p><p>Eu tentei pesquisar por soluções (a maioria pelo reddit do Firefox), mas não consegui resolver o meu problema. Alguns sugeriram modificações no about:config para mexer nessas coisas: layers.acceleration.force-enabled gfx.direct3d11.use-double-buffering media.gpu-process-decoder layers.gpu-process.enabled </p><p>Em todos os casos, fiz a modificação (uma por vez) e testava no vídeo, se não desse certo, voltava para a configuração padrão de antes. </p><p>Tentei seguir um troubleshooting básico do reddit do Firefox, envolvendo limpar cache, desativar as extensões, atualizar o drive gráfico, manter as configurações de desempenho ativadas nos ""settings"". Nenhum resolveu. Tentei criar um novo ""profile"" do zero, nada instalado ou registrado, apenas copiei e colei uma página contendo um vídeo em 1080p60 para reproduzir e a imagem ficou travando, só o áudio estava normal. </p><p>Muitas pessoas mencionaram o YouTube, eu também testei um vídeo de 1080p60 e o problema persiste, só que eu posso baixar a resolução para 720p60 e ele funciona de boas. Mas em sites fora do Youtube, o vídeo só fica disponível em 1080p60, por exemplo, o que torna a situação um incômodo. Outros mencionaram a questão do codec vp9, por isso eu também deixo claro que até vídeos em H264 o Firefox não está conseguindo reproduzir direito, enquanto que o Chrome e MPC-HC funcionam de boas. </p><p>Usando um laptop com CPU: AMD A4-3310MX APU GPU (integrada): AMD Radeon HD 6480G RAM: 4GB OS: Windows 7 Professional SP1 (64 bits) Firefox 113.0.1 MPC-HC (Nightly, 2.0.0.5) Chrome 109.0.5414.120 </p><p>No espaço de ""Informações técnicas"", tentei colocar informações relacionadas a aba ""about:support"", outra sugestão que deram quando fosse entrar em contato com o suporte. </p><p>Para finalizar, os vídeos que eu fico mencionando envolvem conteúdo explícito, preferi não postar aqui, mas se precisarem de mais informações ou links para testar, já aviso de antemão sobre assunto. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1130;,firefox,fix-problems,pt-BR,"",lucas234

They are both open on the same page and first thing to notice, is when I refresh the private window, cookies in inspector ""flash"" in both windows, indicating that there are changes. After that, I'm interested in two cookies: ""gbuuid"" and ""growthBookVariants"", it seems like they are shared and when I refresh one windows, it's value is ""synced"" to the second window. </p><p>Now this is annoying, as I have to clear those cookies to test if I get a different variant.
