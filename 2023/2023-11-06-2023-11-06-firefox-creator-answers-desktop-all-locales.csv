Now, even though I have gone to about:config and changed browser.backspace_action = 0 to 'true', this no longer works, at least not with my new Windows 11 computer. I tried closing and re-opening Mozilla with the new preference, and again with closing, restarting the computer, and then re-opening Mozilla. Please help if you can. Thank you so much. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1190;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",jozierabyor
