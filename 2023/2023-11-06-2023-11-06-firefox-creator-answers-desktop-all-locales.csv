The problem was the same both times: the app takes several minutes to open and when (if) it does, pages won't load. Any tabs I open remain blank white pages. The first time this happened, the problem fixed itself after a few days. This time I've been unable to use Firefox since the 24 October 2023 update. I've tried updating my OS, uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox, and rebooting several times but nothing has worked. Hope you can help. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",emcgiffin
