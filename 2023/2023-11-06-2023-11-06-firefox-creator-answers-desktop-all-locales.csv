On the left side is a private mode window (notice the missing extensions), on the right side is a normal window. They are both open on the same page and first thing to notice, is when I refresh the private window, cookies in inspector ""flash"" in both windows, indicating that there are changes. After that, I'm interested in two cookies: ""gbuuid"" and ""growthBookVariants"", it seems like they are shared and when I refresh one windows, it's value is ""synced"" to the second window. </p><p>Now this is annoying, as I have to clear those cookies to test if I get a different variant. When a colleague tested it on Windows, it didn't happen so maybe it's something with my settings/extensions? I attached my privacy settings, but when I fiddled with those, nothing seemed to change. </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1190;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1616381;,T.Kallup

Egy új Windows és Linuix telepítés után hiába jelentkezek be és hiába szinkronizálok, mindenképp egy alap firefoxot kapok. A beállításaim, a könyvjelzőim és minden, minden elveszett. Jelenleg még a laptopomon vannak meg a beállítások, mert ott kikapcsoltam a wifit, mielőtt elindítottam a Firefoxot, de ott nem merek fellépni a netre, mert félek, hogy ott is az új, azaz az alapállapothoz szinkronizálja a böngészőt. Eddig nem találtam olyan opciót, hogy mondjuk lementhessem a Firefox állapotát, mert ha rákeresek, akkor is a szinkronizálást ajánlgatja. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1190;,firefox,customize,hu,"",buci62

I've tried updating my OS, uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox, and rebooting several times but nothing has worked. Hope you can help. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",emcgiffin
