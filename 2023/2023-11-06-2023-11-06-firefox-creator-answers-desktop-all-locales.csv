The profile directory is initialized (with 70 or so more files, 16MB or so in total) when Firefox opens the profile for the first time - in my use-case by doing `firefox -P &lt;name&gt;`. I see that this process spawns several sub processes and would like to know which one is responsible for generating the profile files/directories so I can detect when it has completed. </p><p>Alternatively - can you point me at the source code responsible so I can figure it out from there. If, for example,  there is a manifest of profile files/directories to be created I could perhaps use that to verify when the initialization process is complete. </p><p>My system is Linux, but I am looking for  solution that works on any platform. </p><p>Many thanks. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-11540;firefox-1154;,firefox,other,en-US,"",bruce.steedman
