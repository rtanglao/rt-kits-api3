Bookmarks remain viewable in the bookmarks window (Ctrl+Shift+O or Ctrl+B), but do not display in the Bookmarks Toolbar (toggled with Ctrl+Shift+B) at all despite this. Firefox Sync appears to be signed in at about:preferences#sync, but in the hamburger menu, the topmost entry displays the text ""Sync and save data"" with a blank icon to its right. Clicking this icon brings up a menu with the entries ""Sign in to Firefox"" and ""Turn On Syncing..."", which suggests that Firefox Sync is not working correctly. The active theme also gets reset to the Firefox default. </p><p>When the issue presents itself, it is possible to resolve it by going to about:addons -&gt; Themes and switching between custom themes a few times. However, the behavior described should not occur in the first place when Firefox terminates unexpectedly. </p><p>This behavior has occurred on 102.15.1esr as well as previous versions. </p>",linux;desktop;sync;firefox-10215;firefox-102151;,firefox,sync,en-US,1604274;,chrisconner1111

After the restore, I found I could only copy a few of my Bookmarks Toolbar and Other Bookmark links to the corresponding files in the new installation. I was only able to move the Toolbar bookmarks to the proper file because the old Toolbar file appeared on my toolbar, and I could move the bookmarks one by one to the toolbar until all were entered. </p><p>I'm faced with a similar problem with the Other Bookmarks (OB) file. I only have five or six bookmarks in the file, and I need to add about a dozen more. I tried copying and pasting them into the new file in the Bookmarks Manager; the bookmarks copied but would not paste into the file. (I know they copied because I successfully pasted them to a LibreOffice document.) I tried opening one of the copied links; it said it was in the OB file, but it wasn't listed. Why can't I just bulk-copy the bookmarks into the file in the Bookmarks Manager? If that isn't possible </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",crogerblair1
