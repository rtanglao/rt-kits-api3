Sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly. A hack I found that fixes it is just entering/exiting fullscreen, which seems to ""reset"" the video player. I do not know what causes this, it just shows up when I am watching things. I have noticed that it <em>seems</em> to show up when a video cuts from a darker scene to a brighter scene, although this is not consistent. I am confident that Firefox is the issue because I have watched videos extensively in Chrome, where it does not show up. This also persists if I connect an external display and mirror or extend my screen to it.  </p><p>I am using a 2023 Apple MacBook Pro 14"", with the M2 Pro SoC.
