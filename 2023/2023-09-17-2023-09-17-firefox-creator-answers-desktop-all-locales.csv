After the restore, I found I could only copy a few of my Bookmarks Toolbar and Other Bookmark links to the corresponding files in the new installation. I was only able to move the Toolbar bookmarks to the proper file because the old Toolbar file appeared on my toolbar, and I could move the bookmarks one by one to the toolbar until all were entered. </p><p>I'm faced with a similar problem with the Other Bookmarks (OB) file. I only have five or six bookmarks in the file, and I need to add about a dozen more. I tried copying and pasting them into the new file in the Bookmarks Manager; the bookmarks copied but would not paste into the file. (I know they copied because I successfully pasted them to a LibreOffice document.) I tried opening one of the copied links; it said it was in the OB file, but it wasn't listed. Why can't I just bulk-copy the bookmarks into the file in the Bookmarks Manager? If that isn't possible </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",crogerblair1
