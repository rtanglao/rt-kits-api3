I would like if firefox does not automatically switch to opened links from the sidebar (history, bookmark, etc.), when I open them with ctrl? (I know I can hold shift to do that, but I was wondering if there might be a preference in about:config to change the reverse this behaviour for sidebars)  </p><p><br> Thanks, Ibr. </p>",linux;desktop;beta;tabs;firefox-1180;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1604426;,ibrahimasif1234

Sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly. A hack I found that fixes it is just entering/exiting fullscreen, which seems to ""reset"" the video player. I do not know what causes this, it just shows up when I am watching things. I have noticed that it <em>seems</em> to show up when a video cuts from a darker scene to a brighter scene, although this is not consistent. I am confident that Firefox is the issue because I have watched videos extensively in Chrome, where it does not show up.
