The first time I go to a site that requires logging in using a user certificate, it pops up the same dialog 4 times in a row.

I have been downloading these files for work for over a year and they have always load very quick. I would click on the file and the entire photo file would be there instantly.  However, for the past week these file do not download or download very slowly.  I have checked internet speed, which is 310.  I can also switch browsers and have no problem downloading the same files.  So its not my computer and it not the internet, so something has changed with Firefox.  Can you help??  I have used Firefox for over 20 years and don't want to change browsers, but I have to work and this downloading is a problem. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",ralphwruth

I use drag-and-drop to upload images really often and in my previous browser (Opera), after my images have been dropped into Discord for instance, the folder would be hidden behind the browser. Firefox does not do this however and stays focused on my folder which means I have to manually click inside Firefox to continue with my work. I was wondering if there was a way to make Firefox come back into focus after I drop images in the browser. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1150;firefox-11503;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",RoA
