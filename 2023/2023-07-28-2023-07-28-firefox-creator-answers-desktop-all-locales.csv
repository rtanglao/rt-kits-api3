Upon loading a video it works fine, however once I click on the progress bar to skip to a certain point of the video, the video pauses, the progress bar tracker gets set to 0:00, the video starts buffering and I have to click 3-4 additional times on the specific time I want to skip forward to, in order for the video to even continue playing. I have restarted my PC, cleared cache and cookies, re-installed the browser and nothing works. Mind you, when trying to watch videos on either Edge or Chrome, there is no such issue and the progress bar works fine. I really do enjoy Mozilla, but if this keeps up I will have to change browsers it is bugging the hell out of me. </p><p>Looking forward to receiving any help. </p><p>Kind regards, Petar </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1150;firefox-11503;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1593400;1593402;1593404;,mercurrial
