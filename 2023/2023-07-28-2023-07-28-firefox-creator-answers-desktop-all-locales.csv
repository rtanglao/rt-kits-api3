It's only when the command is activated via a keyboard shortcut that it does the bounce back behavior, though; the command works as intended when activated from the Window menu in the menu bar or from Option + green button in the top left of the window. </p><p>The key combo I set up was Shift + Option + Command + Right Arrow, but I've also tried a couple of different key combos and they all did the same bounce back behavior.

I was trying to run a game that used a lot of RAM, so I decided that I would close ALL of my firefox tabs in hope that the game would run smoother with the 5gb that Firefox was using. I didn't think anything of losing the tabs because I had accidentally closed windows in the past using the big red 'x', and an easy ctrl + shift + t always restored the entire window no problem. When I tried to open firefox again within the next 5 minutes, only 3 of the windows restored themselves, I assume using the general &gt; startup &gt; open previous windows and tabs setting. Using Ctrl + Shift + T did nothing to restore them. Please help, as the windows that did reopen were the ones that I cared the least about. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1150;firefox-11503;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1593468;,lucas.gorter
