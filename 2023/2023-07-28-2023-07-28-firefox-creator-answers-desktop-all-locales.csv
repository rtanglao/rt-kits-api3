In most apps that support the Move Window to... commands, this will simply move the window to the desired side of the screen when the key combo is pressed.  </p><p>However, in Firefox the key combo will start the animation as normal but the window will then bounce back to its original location. It's only when the command is activated via a keyboard shortcut that it does the bounce back behavior, though; the command works as intended when activated from the Window menu in the menu bar or from Option + green button in the top left of the window. </p><p>The key combo I set up was Shift + Option + Command + Right Arrow, but I've also tried a couple of different key combos and they all did the same bounce back behavior. I've tried it on machines with different versions of macOS (Sonoma beta and Ventura) with the same result. The bounce back behavior also effects the <strong>Move Window to Left Side of Screen</strong> command. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,other,en-US,"",sevenboards

I was trying to run a game that used a lot of RAM, so I decided that I would close ALL of my firefox tabs in hope that the game would run smoother with the 5gb that Firefox was using. I didn't think anything of losing the tabs because I had accidentally closed windows in the past using the big red 'x', and an easy ctrl + shift + t always restored the entire window no problem. When I tried to open firefox again within the next 5 minutes, only 3 of the windows restored themselves, I assume using the general &gt; startup &gt; open previous windows and tabs setting. Using Ctrl + Shift + T did nothing to restore them.
