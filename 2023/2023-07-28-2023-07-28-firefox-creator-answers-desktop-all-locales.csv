I use drag-and-drop to upload images really often and in my previous browser (Opera), after my images have been dropped into Discord for instance, the folder would be hidden behind the browser. Firefox does not do this however and stays focused on my folder which means I have to manually click inside Firefox to continue with my work. I was wondering if there was a way to make Firefox come back into focus after I drop images in the browser. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1150;firefox-11503;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",RoA
