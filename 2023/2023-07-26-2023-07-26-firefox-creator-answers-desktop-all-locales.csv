He was helping me troubleshoot why Firefox keeps saying it's sending a code to verify my account, but I never receive the code.  He has added the ""accounts"" email to my contacts and I don't know what else to do or try.  Any ideas from the community?  I need my bookmarks after upgrading to Windows 11 and can't imagine trying to recreate them all. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1592824;,brianna.cacchione
