Since those updates my access to online bill pay has been broken. The bank is Regions, I can log on to the account, view balances and such but when going to the Bill pay section things go bad. The ""Payments"" page is basically blank with only the page headers and no other content (see image below). I went to an older version of Firefox on a Linux (Mint) machine and I am able to access this page, but on my three windows machines it does not work. I installed Chrome and at first got an error on that page, but today it worked! Edge also seems to work but I really don't want to use any of these other browsers. </p><p>The bank is blaming Firefox. </p><p>I have used Firefox for years and don't want to switch so I hope what ever you ""updated"" two weeks ago gets fixed soon as not having ready access to bill pay is a real problem. </p><p>I have turned off popup blocking, set to standard tracking protection, shut down virus defense (Bitdefender) and several other settings suggested on this site to no avail. If it makes any differences I have about 4 windows machines that link/share bookmarks and such . </p><p>Please FIX whatever you updated ASAP. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1150;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1592975;1592977;,msaine
