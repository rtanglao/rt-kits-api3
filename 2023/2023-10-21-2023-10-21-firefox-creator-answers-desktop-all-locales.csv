Consultant, I cannot find a spot in the Account Profile section or its related pages to UPDATE my phone number. If your system is doing 2FA, it had to be entered at some point. Since I had that old number for almost 10 years, I don't remember what features Firefox had back then. I'd appreciate it if someone would provide an answer. Previous answers I've read today didn't provide one.  </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",jsb3

All of my tabs are gone, there is no previous restore data, and there is no way for me to recover all of the tabs I previously had. If there is some way to recover my data after this migration it would be greatly appreciated, but if not, this is an incredibly frustrating update with a migration process that seemed unnecessary. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",cristian.i.maldo

It keeps telling me that it's open and to close but nothing happens. I can't close it and it's not actually open. I've rebooted my computer but Thunderbird still insists it's open. What can I do?

This only happens with Firefox.,"<p>Firefox browser had failed repeatedly when trying to display sections within 2 websites. I receive ""Can not load the page"" at Blue Cross and Blue Shield and download freezes the page, site and my computer at a credit card company- requiring end task and complete shut down of computer. This has been occurring for 2 months. I do not have any issue loading these sites or sections via Edge or Chrome. Will this be corrected with the name change? Will there be another browser page that is more reliable? </p><p>If not, you don’t need to change your name on Firefox browser. You can just close it down and I will move to Edge or Chrome. </p><p>None of your Troubleshooting answers on your Support page covers my situation.  I have cleared history, verified settings based on internet articles from others with this issue. Please have someone contact me directly. I’m tired of trying to fix this issue with your browser. </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",ktbeauf
