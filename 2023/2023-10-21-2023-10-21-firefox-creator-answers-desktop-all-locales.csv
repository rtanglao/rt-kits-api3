Well until NS_ERROR_REDIRECT_LOOP stops this shamelessness. Resetting all browser data back, just enables me to enter my credentials again and the same process starts again. I can access this website from the same network from different browsers from different devices and operating systems. </p><p>Currently I encounter this problem on recently installed Arch linux, with basically dwm and firefox, and since I had very rough time with how unpredictable this system were so far, I don't know how much it is browser issue, so I think I should mention it.  </p><p>Thank you in advance. </p>",linux;desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1612700;,bigtriks

Consultant, I cannot find a spot in the Account Profile section or its related pages to UPDATE my phone number. If your system is doing 2FA, it had to be entered at some point. Since I had that old number for almost 10 years, I don't remember what features Firefox had back then. I'd appreciate it if someone would provide an answer. Previous answers I've read today didn't provide one.  </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1612688;,jsb3

All of my tabs are gone, there is no previous restore data, and there is no way for me to recover all of the tabs I previously had. If there is some way to recover my data after this migration it would be greatly appreciated, but if not, this is an incredibly frustrating update with a migration process that seemed unnecessary. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,sync,en-US,1612591;,cristian.i.maldo
