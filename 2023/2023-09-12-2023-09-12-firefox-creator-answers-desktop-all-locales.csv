Gostaria de relatar um problema que venho enfrentando nos últimos dias. Desde aproximadamente o dia 09/09/2023 às vezes experimentava o problema citado (Firefox não está carrega a página do Messager do Facebook), porém, se eu recarregasse a página ela acabava por funcionar. </p><p>Hoje, 11/09/2023, a página não carregou mais. Excluí os cookies do Facebook, tentei em modo privado, em modo seguro, tentei atualizar para a última versão disponível do navegador. Nada disso resolveu o problema. Fiz o teste tentando abrir a página do Messager do Facebook em outro navegador (Google chrome) e abre normalmente. Tentei em uma versão mais antiga do Firefox que ainda mantenho instalada e funciona. </p><p>Então, fica o meu relato de que a versão 115.2.0esr (32-bits) do Firefox - e aparentemente as anteriores próximas a esta versão também - não está carregando a página do Messager do Facebook. </p>",windows-7;desktop;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,pt-BR,"",rrs651-ra
