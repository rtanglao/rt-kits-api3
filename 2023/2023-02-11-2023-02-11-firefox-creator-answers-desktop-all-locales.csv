Now with Firefox 109.0 in OpenMandriva Linux v. 23.90 and 23.01 or with Firefox 109.0.1 tar.bz2 from Mozilla website they are gone. Problem occurs with Ublock Origin and the DeepL Multi-translate addon also. (I use AdBlock Ultimate or Ublock Origin, not both at same time.) </p><p>I do not know if this is something in Firefox or something in OpenMandriva Linux but would like to find out soon if possible. </p><p>The only work around I have is to use an old profile. My best guess is that profile may be from time of v. 103-104 or there about. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1090;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",benbullard79
