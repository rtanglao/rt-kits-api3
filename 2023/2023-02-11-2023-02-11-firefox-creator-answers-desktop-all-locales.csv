I basically want it to print receipts without it showing me the print dialogue so I configured the option <em>print.always_print_silent</em> to true.  However, it results that now my printer doesn't correctly print the receipt and instead prints a bunch of random string characters. It is an 80mm fairly generic printer which I have got configured and working in CUPS. Printing with the print dialogue results in a normal print.  I wonder what I am doing wrong here and if someone can assist me with it. Thanks&nbsp;;) </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1090;,firefox,other,en-US,"",abdulee

I am unable to play contents on Disney+, Amazon Prime Video Netflix and such. I was streaming fine until a few months ago. I have checked my settings and they are all properly set. At the time I am writing this report, the Widevine Content Decryption Module is at Version 4.10.2557.0, updated to its latest release. Obviously DRM content is enabled in settings. Changing the useragent did not solve the problem. I have seen this problem reported before for MacOs users but I could not find anything for linux users. Am I the only one having this problem? I hope someone can help. Thanks </p>",linux;desktop;beta;fix-problems;firefox-1100;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",andrea.tesoniero

Now with Firefox 109.0 in OpenMandriva Linux v. 23.90 and 23.01 or with Firefox 109.0.1 tar.bz2 from Mozilla website they are gone. Problem occurs with Ublock Origin and the DeepL Multi-translate addon also. (I use AdBlock Ultimate or Ublock Origin, not both at same time.) </p><p>I do not know if this is something in Firefox or something in OpenMandriva Linux but would like to find out soon if possible. </p><p>The only work around I have is to use an old profile. My best guess is that profile may be from time of v. 103-104 or there about. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1090;,firefox,customize,en-US,1565075;,benbullard79
