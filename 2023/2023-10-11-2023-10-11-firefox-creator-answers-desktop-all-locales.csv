The Installer work adds it to one of the icons to the bottom tray in windows then when I go to open it I look in task manager and one process is ran but then seems to be terminated right away. But when I reload windows in safe mode I go to open firefox.exe and it works fine except for the fact that there is no internet.  </p><p>Also if this helps when hovering over the icon in the tray it doesn't show like the most recent websites. But it shows in windows safe mode. </p><p>Note I've tried a lot of things. Fully reinstalled firefox; tried to run firefox safe-mode tried to use firefox dev executable reset the base settings for Firefox tried turning off wifi doesn't matter tried making new profile </p><p>So if none of that works can you send me to a place so I can get my history data from my account, this is because I use my phone with Firefox. </p><p>python code i dont know what to do so I just trying everything to make it easier for you to help me, and I thank you. </p><p>import os try: </p><pre>   os.system(""firefox.exe"")    # opens then closes, not window is poped up </pre> <p>except: </p><pre>   # run windows in safe mode    # works but no internet </pre> <p>finally: </p><pre>   # contact support for that glimmer of hope </pre>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1610007;,loganboganfarfignogan
