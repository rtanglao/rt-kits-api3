Já estou utilizando o novo sistema operacional há cerca de 4 meses e o único problema que percebi até o momento ocorreu justamente com o Firefox. </p><p>Quando maximizo a tela, fico preso na aba ativa, sem conseguir clicar para trocar de aba até sair do modo ""tela cheia"". </p><p>Provavelmente a falha é em decorrência do OpenCore-Patcher mas ela só acontece com o Firefox, e mais nenhum outro aplicativo. </p><p>Isso acontece com mais alguém? Sei que meu caso é bem específico mas se alguém puder me dar uma luz pra resolver isso, agradeço bastante. </p><p>Um abraço, </p><p>Carlos </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,fix-problems,pt-BR,"",carlosedgi
