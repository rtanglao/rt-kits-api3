I've looked at the places.sqlite files, and the largest one is 20MB and is in my current default profile, but it is dated today. That makes no sense because I do not have any bookmarks on this older computer, and my new computer doesn't have any either. The bookmarks have also been completely deleted from my iPad, but miraculously are still on my iPhone (evidently I had signed out of Firefox for iPhone at some point so they do exist somewhere.) The thought of trying to rebuild my bookmarks is nauseating. My only thought is to sign out of the browser on all devices, then sign back in and sync on the phone. Would that repopulate the main file with what's on my phone? Any other ideas? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1622004;,cmjross1

When I clicked on the View menu button and selected Toolbars, the setting was somehow changed to Never Show.  I  changed it back to Always Show, but I'm curious how it would change itself to Never Show.  I haven't completed an OS update for several days, and this incident just occurred today.  All day long, my bookmarks were present; I turned off my computer about 5PM.  When I turned it back on about 8PM, the bookmarks were gone.  Help and thank you. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1621937;1621943;,mj_stigliano
