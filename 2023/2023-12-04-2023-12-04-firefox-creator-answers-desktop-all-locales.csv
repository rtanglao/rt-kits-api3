I have wait until that interval has passed before I can retry, otherwise it will repeat the freeze. This happens whenever I turn my VPN on/off or switch to a different VPN server. It happens only with Firefox. Chrome and my email client have no problems whatsoever. I think it's some kind of DNS caching problem within Firefox as the problem doesn't happen if I visit a site that I hadn't visited very recently. There's immediate response if I do that. I have DNS over HTTPS and secure DNS turned off in the settings, so it can't be those. </p><p>Anyone else have this problem? I wish there was some way to clear Firefox's DNS cache other than having to go into about:networking </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1014;firefox-11550;firefox-1155;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",spambait67

At one point when I was syncing them, The bookmarks on my new computer which didn't include The vast majority of them disappeared from both computers for a short time until I restored to a specific different date a few times and luckily have my bookmarks on my old laptop still. </p><p><br> I have tried exporting them as a JSON and as an HTML to put them on my new computer.  I've read the HTML method puts them all in one place as opposed to replacing all of them. Obviously I would prefer the JSON method. However I have tried both with no success. I've also tried moving them into the documents folder both times as recommended. I've tried to restore to date on the new computer.  </p><p>Transferring bookmarks individually would be way too time-consuming as I have a ton of different folders. </p><p>Someone please help me find a solution to do something which should be basic which is transfer all my bookmarks for my old computer to my new computer.  I'm also logged into my Firefox same account on both computers and have tried syncing with no success as well. No matter how many times I do it. I repeated all of these processes many times with small variations. </p><p>Please someone help me get my bookmarks!

When I clicked on the View menu button and selected Toolbars, the setting was somehow changed to Never Show.  I  changed it back to Always Show, but I'm curious how it would change itself to Never Show.  I haven't completed an OS update for several days, and this incident just occurred today.  All day long, my bookmarks were present; I turned off my computer about 5PM.  When I turned it back on about 8PM, the bookmarks were gone.  Help and thank you. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",mj_stigliano
