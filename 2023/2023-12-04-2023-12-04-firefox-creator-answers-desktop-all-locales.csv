It's usually one or two threads which are hogging incredible amounts of memory.  This time I had about 30 tabs open. </p><p>Today I tried Firefox about:memory ""Minimize Memory Usage"" several times, and it was largely ineffective. </p><p>I did a ""create memory dump file"" of one 5+GB bloated thread using task manager, but can't find a way to upload the compressed archive with this report for analysis.  Finding a way to report this issue was quite a challenge.  It seems most help avenues are now missing/moved, and other reports of this type of issue are ""Archived"". </p><p>I tried killing the 2 bloated Firefox threads and checked for tabs which might be missing or malfunctioning.  Everything continued to run normally while more than 10GB of memory was returned to system use.  Leaving these bloated threads overnight doesn't improve anything, in fact I can often get up and find my machine is completely out of memory because Firefox consumed it all.  My smallest machines have 16GB RAM. </p><p>These memory issues aren't new.  I've been reporting them off and on for more than a decade.  They get better for a few months after reporting, then they get bad again in a few more months.  The battle to get memory leaks fixed is continuous while Firefox springs more leaks. </p><p>I'd like to give you the memory image I generated so you'll at least have some real data to look at and analyze for this report. </p><p>The attached task manager snapshot image is a very minor example of this issue.  The numbers keep increasing like there are one or more large memory leaks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1621907;,craigarno

Additionally, this only affects some video content in Firefox, with Edge browser unaffected. In brief, what is happening is that within a couple hours of having the browser open, certain video content stops working, specifically Twitter/X videos just spin, YouTube previews stop working, and videos continually load. Netflix videos continue to work, but hover previews stop functioning. I even check the 'Stats for Nerds' on YT and it shows 0 KB network activity in Firefox. </p><p>I've tried every basic action I can think of: </p> <ul><li> Turning off extensions (only use Ublock and Bitwarden) </li><li> Browser Refresh (x3) </li><li> Reverting from 120.1 to 120.0, and now 199.0.1 </li><li> Clearing the browser cache </li><li> Reinstalling NVidia and Intel Drivers </li><li> Running in Safe Mode </li></ul> <p>Only by doing a refresh or completely closing/opening the app gets videos to function again. This doesn't affect the old laptop or my desktop, which makes me think it's a rogue driver--but then why would Edge function without error over the same period of time? </p><p>Are there any settings to play with in the browser that can help diagnose? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1200;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",madekatsu

I have wait until that interval has passed before I can retry, otherwise it will repeat the freeze. This happens whenever I turn my VPN on/off or switch to a different VPN server. It happens only with Firefox. Chrome and my email client have no problems whatsoever. I think it's some kind of DNS caching problem within Firefox as the problem doesn't happen if I visit a site that I hadn't visited very recently. There's immediate response if I do that. I have DNS over HTTPS and secure DNS turned off in the settings, so it can't be those. </p><p>Anyone else have this problem? I wish there was some way to clear Firefox's DNS cache other than having to go into about:networking </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1014;firefox-11550;firefox-1155;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",spambait67
