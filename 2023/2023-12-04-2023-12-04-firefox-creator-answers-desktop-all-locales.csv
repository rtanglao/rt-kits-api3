Over the years, I have maintained a significant bookmark file for work. I recently purchased a new computer, and my zero bookmarks from the new computer have replaced all of the bookmarks that I had in my old browser. This is a bookmark file that has successfully followed me through multiple computers and even my ios devices. And now it seems to be completely gone. I've looked at the places.sqlite files, and the largest one is 20MB and is in my current default profile, but it is dated today. That makes no sense because I do not have any bookmarks on this older computer, and my new computer doesn't have any either. The bookmarks have also been completely deleted from my iPad, but miraculously are still on my iPhone (evidently I had signed out of Firefox for iPhone at some point so they do exist somewhere.) The thought of trying to rebuild my bookmarks is nauseating. My only thought is to sign out of the browser on all devices, then sign back in and sync on the phone. Would that repopulate the main file with what's on my phone? Any other ideas? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1622004;,cmjross1
