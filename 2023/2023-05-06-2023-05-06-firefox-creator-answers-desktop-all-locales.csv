The Pocket icon no longer appears in the address line and when you add a document to the Pocket using the symbol above the tool bar a Pocket copy is made but sometimes without the pictures from the original website. Also in some cases the pictures are there but if you select all on the Pocket article the pictures to not appear on (for example) a Windows *.doc page when you do a Paste. I mainly use Pocket to produce a copy of the original website without all the extraneous information to allow a detailed analysis of the article.

That is not sustainable, and there are already missing configs that break tier-3 platforms.  This replaces the current setup with one that handles all platforms in one go, although we still keep the internal sequence of GcConfigGen -&gt; fixup_json -&gt; GnMozbuildWriter.  The downside is that because this relies on the upstream webrtc build system supporting cross-compilation, and that it actively rejects some configurations, we need some local hacks to make it work on Linux and Mac, but for now, we have to leave out Windows, which requires more work.  For some reason, that removes some duplicated include directories in the json files, which moves things a little in one moz.build file.  We also remove the mozconfigs we don't use anymore.

Each of these json files is huge, and we actually don't have enough to support all the platforms we're supposed to be supporting. Adding more files is not enticing.  Now that we've made the first step described above work in a single pass on a single machine (as opposed to multiple passes on multiple machines previously), we can actually merge both steps and avoid producing the intermediate json files altogether. This will allow to add more configurations without having to worry about the weight of those files.  And because this all doesn't need to depend on having the first step hooked up in the build system, we make the whole an independent script rather than a build backend.

This approach is desirable since we already have most of the modules transitioned to the non unified system but there are still some that are not yet compatible, but in the long term this will be done by each module owner and can be also tested locally using the build system.  If a module can't be built outside the unified method it's `moz.build` config file needs to have `REQUIRES_UNIFIED_BUILD = False`  To also enable this we need to have a flag from `mozconfig`, like:  ``` ac_add_options --disable-unified-build ```  Differential Revision: <a href=""https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D122328"" rel=""nofollow"">https://phabricator.services.mozilla.com/D122328</a>  3e615329b0a3a5aa2029c68dd84bfd5eb2acaeda: Bug 1725145 - Preparation for the hybrid build env. r=necko-reviewers,firefox-build-system-reviewers,valentin,glandium diff browse Andi-Bogdan Postelnicu &lt;andi@mozilla.com&gt; - Wed, 25 Aug 2021 10:46:17 +0000 - rev 589878 Push 38735 by nbeleuzu@mozilla.com at Wed, 25 Aug 2021 15:39:54 +0000 Bug 1725145 - Preparation for the hybrid build env. r=necko-reviewers,firefox-build-system-reviewers,valentin,glandium  Automatically generated path that adds flag `REQUIRES_UNIFIED_BUILD = True` to `moz.build` when the module governed by the build config file is not buildable outside on the unified environment.

Com a opção ""media.wmf.dxva.d3d11.enabled"" ligada (padrão), o vídeo e o player ficam engasgando, mas as estatísticas do YouTube não mostram nenhum quadro pulado ou qualquer outro problema de reprodução. </p><p>Com a opção ""media.wmf.dxva.d3d11.enabled"" desligada, o vídeo não apresenta falhas de reprodução. Isso resolve o problema, mas o uso de CPU é consideravelmente maior. </p><p>Isso só acontece no Windows. No Linux, tudo roda liso com as configurações padrão. O computador não tem gráficos integrados; a placa de vídeo foi testada com o Ryzen 9 3900X e o 5900X em plataformas B550 e X570, Windows formatado várias vezes. A única outra configuração que eu mudei no about:config foi o ""browser.compactmode.show"" para diminuir o tamanho das abas. </p><p>Eu fiz esse tópico no site da AMD e algumas versões do driver chegaram a mencionar o problema como conhecido e depois solucionado, mas a minha experiência continua a mesma desde o início do tópico. Estou postando aqui também porque não sei se é um problema causado pelos drivers da AMD ou pelo Firefox. <a href=""https://community.amd.com/t5/graphics/6900-xt-stuttering-with-youtube-4k60-videos/td-p/534271"" rel=""nofollow"">https://community.amd.com/t5/graphics/6900-xt-stuttering-with-youtube-4k60-videos/td-p/534271</a> </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,fix-problems,pt-BR,"",tapekeep

But if I spend too many days only in the ""work"" window, I lose the ability to use the ""personal"" window (or vice versa). I can see it and click on it in the ""Window"" menu, but then nothing happens. </p><p>I tried Bookmarking All Tabs to see if I could close Firefox and then re-open the window using the bookmarks, but no functionality appears to be accessible for that window. If I restart Firefox once it will dutifully reopen the ghost window (ie. I can see it in the Windows menu but not access it). Restarting windows again loses the window completely. </p><p>Has anyone else experienced this? Is the only solution just to keep ""checking in"" on the other window, even if I'm only using one of them for a few days?  </p><p>Thanks in advance, K </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,other,en-US,1579115;,KS23

Yes I UDD'd it.  I've done the regular steps you'll suggest.  </p><p>How can I get firefox to play the normal videos from say, facebook, youtube, and all the other basic places?? I've gone so far as to scrub Firefox from Regedit. ALL of firefox has been deleted. GPU has been replaced.  All of the normal suggestions will not work. If you're going to suggest ANYTHING to do with the hamburger menu, please don't waste both of our time.  </p><p>This has to be a windows 10 issue that ONLY affects Firefox. Edge and Chrome will play the video(s). </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,other,en-US,1579107;,JohnnyOyea
