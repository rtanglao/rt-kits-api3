But if I spend too many days only in the ""work"" window, I lose the ability to use the ""personal"" window (or vice versa). I can see it and click on it in the ""Window"" menu, but then nothing happens. </p><p>I tried Bookmarking All Tabs to see if I could close Firefox and then re-open the window using the bookmarks, but no functionality appears to be accessible for that window. If I restart Firefox once it will dutifully reopen the ghost window (ie. I can see it in the Windows menu but not access it). Restarting windows again loses the window completely. </p><p>Has anyone else experienced this? Is the only solution just to keep ""checking in"" on the other window, even if I'm only using one of them for a few days?  </p><p>Thanks in advance, K </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,other,en-US,"",KS23

I've tried all the top-site suggestions,"<p>I've tried to get firefox to play videos on this desktop for a couple years. YEARS. I thought it was the video card so I bought a 3060. Same problem. Yes I UDD'd it.  I've done the regular steps you'll suggest.  </p><p>How can I get firefox to play the normal videos from say, facebook, youtube, and all the other basic places?? I've gone so far as to scrub Firefox from Regedit. ALL of firefox has been deleted. GPU has been replaced.  All of the normal suggestions will not work. If you're going to suggest ANYTHING to do with the hamburger menu, please don't waste both of our time.  </p><p>This has to be a windows 10 issue that ONLY affects Firefox. Edge and Chrome will play the video(s). </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,other,en-US,1579107;,JohnnyOyea
