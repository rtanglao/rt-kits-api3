1412603,2023-05-06 00:19:33 -0700,2023-05-06 00:19:33 -0700,YouTube stuttering with 4K60 videos on AMD RDNA2 GPUs in Windows,"<p>Tested with an AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT. With ""media.wmf.dxva.d3d11.enabled"" set to ""true"" (default), both the video and the player stutter quite badly, but YouTube stats show no frames dropped or any other playback issues. Here's what it looks like: <a href=""https://youtu.be/3pH_W-XCuBA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/3pH_W-XCuBA</a> </p><p>With ""media.wmf.dxva.d3d11.enabled"" set to ""false"" the issue is resolved, but at the cost of higher CPU usage. In my testing, this only happened with the 6900 XT; my previous card (a Vega 56) had no problem using the default settings. The only other setting I changed in about:config was ""browser.compactmode.show"", set to ""true"". This only happens in Windows, no issues whatsoever in Linux. Tests were done with a Ryzen 9 3900X and currently a 5900X on B550 and X570 platforms, NVMe boot drive and 64GB of RAM. The 2021 drivers supplied by Windows Update don't show this behavior, only the newer ones (including the current 23.4.3). </p><p>I posted a topic on the AMD forums last year (<a href=""https://community.amd.com/t5/graphics/6900-xt-stuttering-with-youtube-4k60-videos/td-p/534271"" rel=""nofollow"">https://community.amd.com/t5/graphics/6900-xt-stuttering-with-youtube-4k60-videos/td-p/534271</a>) and some driver releases since then had this problem listed under ""Known Issues"" and later ""Fixed Issues"", but from my end nothing has changed since the first post. I hesitated crossposting here because other applications (VLC, for example) have similar behavior with D3D11 DXVA using this video card, so it might not be a Firefox-specific issue; I apologize if that's the case. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",tapekeep

Com a opção ""media.wmf.dxva.d3d11.enabled"" ligada (padrão), o vídeo e o player ficam engasgando, mas as estatísticas do YouTube não mostram nenhum quadro pulado ou qualquer outro problema de reprodução. </p><p>Com a opção ""media.wmf.dxva.d3d11.enabled"" desligada, o vídeo não apresenta falhas de reprodução. Isso resolve o problema, mas o uso de CPU é consideravelmente maior. </p><p>Isso só acontece no Windows. No Linux, tudo roda liso com as configurações padrão. O computador não tem gráficos integrados; a placa de vídeo foi testada com o Ryzen 9 3900X e o 5900X em plataformas B550 e X570, Windows formatado várias vezes. A única outra configuração que eu mudei no about:config foi o ""browser.compactmode.show"" para diminuir o tamanho das abas. </p><p>Eu fiz esse tópico no site da AMD e algumas versões do driver chegaram a mencionar o problema como conhecido e depois solucionado, mas a minha experiência continua a mesma desde o início do tópico. Estou postando aqui também porque não sei se é um problema causado pelos drivers da AMD ou pelo Firefox. <a href=""https://community.amd.com/t5/graphics/6900-xt-stuttering-with-youtube-4k60-videos/td-p/534271"" rel=""nofollow"">https://community.amd.com/t5/graphics/6900-xt-stuttering-with-youtube-4k60-videos/td-p/534271</a> </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,fix-problems,pt-BR,"",tapekeep

Restarting windows again loses the window completely. </p><p>Has anyone else experienced this?

I've tried all the top-site suggestions,"<p>I've tried to get firefox to play videos on this desktop for a couple years. YEARS. I thought it was the video card so I bought a 3060. Same problem. Yes I UDD'd it.  I've done the regular steps you'll suggest.  </p><p>How can I get firefox to play the normal videos from say, facebook, youtube, and all the other basic places?? I've gone so far as to scrub Firefox from Regedit. ALL of firefox has been deleted. GPU has been replaced.  All of the normal suggestions will not work. If you're going to suggest ANYTHING to do with the hamburger menu, please don't waste both of our time.  </p><p>This has to be a windows 10 issue that ONLY affects Firefox. Edge and Chrome will play the video(s). </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,other,en-US,1579107;,JohnnyOyea
