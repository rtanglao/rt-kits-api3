Mobil se poškodil, musel jsem ho reinstalovat, panely/taby z jeho FF zmizely. (Mimochodem nepředpokládám, že by šly do mobilu nahrát zpátky? Třeba že bych ve FF Syncu přihlásil mobil pod stejným názvem, jako byl předtím, a panely by se nahrály? Spíš se bojím, že by je to ze Syncu smazalo) </p><p>Situace tedy je, že je mám je v počítači v ,,Synchronizovaných panelech"". </p><p>Hledám možnost, jak je nějak zpracovat. Bohužel jich je velké množství na možnost ,,Otevřít vše v panelech"" - FF spadne (v tomhle byla stará Opera mnohem stabilnější). Můžu je otevírat po jednom, jenomže taby nejdou v ,,Synchronizovaných panelech"" zavírat (nebo jakkoliv označovat), takže se časem ztratím v tom, kde jsem skončil. </p><p>Nejsou ty linky třeba v nějakém souboru v profilu FF, ze kterého bych se je pokusil vytáhnout? </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,sync,cs,1573803;1573806;,frohlich.tomas

So if the window ever gets closed and that state saved, I need to revert to a previous session backup. Attempting to restore the window caused ram usage to go up to 30 gigabytes and beyond, at which point I stopped the process out of caution. In contrast reopening the browser with the tabs normally is only about 5 gigabytes. </p><p>I regularly use Firefox with thousands of tabs open. This is usually not an issue but in some cases leads to performance issues like these. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",oSpre
