The articles in Mozilla Support explaining how to backup and migrate my current account , after reading them, just gave me a headache. Can someone explain (in plain english) please, how I can save my passwords, bookmarks and cookies that Firefox has associated with my 8 year old  Win 10 Pro desktop so I can transfer that data to a new Win 11 Pro desktop. Any and all suggestions will greatly be appreciated. Firefox and I have been running together since 2004!

I tried copying the contents of the old profile folder from my old computer into the new profile folder, the one with name ending in 'default user', which I confirmed was the one being used by looking in 'about:profile'. That has worked for me in the past, and it seemed to have worked for other users posting in this form. However, that did not work; Firefox still opened as if it was a fresh installation with none of my bookmarks, etc. Then  I compared the 2 folders and found there were over 900 files in the new folder that were not in the old folder. So I deleted everything in the new profile and pasted the contents of the old profile in so they matched exactly. It still did not work. I welcome suggestions! </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-11;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",drdownes1

Unfortunately, today I had to make the hard decision to remove Firefox and start learning a new browser. Suddenly, each time I load Firefox (which is daily), I find that my menu bar is gone and when I try to move the window between screens, i can no longer click and drag the window at the top of the screen, as it is frozen in place. I have tried exiting the window through the menu exit command, as some have suggested that Firefox should remember that setting. However, it is not remembering that setting. I am constantly having to hit F11 multiple times every day and I have not once, ever gone in and enabled full screen mode. This setting is being forced on me. I constantly keep finding it is back in full screen and have to undo it. Several of my friends have been experiencing the same problem and are equally upset at this major break in what was a flawless system. Nobody understands why this is not a feature which can be freely turned on/off. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",DJVoorman
