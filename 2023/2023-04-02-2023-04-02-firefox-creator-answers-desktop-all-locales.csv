I also tried to remove fullscreen animation, but nothing again. </p><p>How to fix this bug? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",seva839n

I set Firefox as the default browser, but for some reason that setting isn't ""sticking.""  If Edge is installed, I can't find it.  Believe me, I tried, because I wanted to uninstall it if possible. </pre> <p>I'm still getting used to the new Outlook (I won't tell you what version I WAS using...) but this is throwing me for a loop... </p><p>If I do not have Firefox open: When I open a link in Outlook, a new window is opened in Firefox.  This window does not include any toolbars nor are any of my customizations applied (themes, extensions) As a matter of fact, opening the link in this new bare-bones window disables all my extensions and if I want my theme back, I have to remove it from my theme manager and reinstall it, because the option to enable/disable the theme isn't there. </p><p>If I DO have Firefox open: When I open a link in Outlook, I get ""Firefox is already running, but is not responding. The old Firefox process must be closed to open a new window.""  If I close Firefox, I'll get that same bare-bones window and all my extensions and themes are disabled. </p><p>Has anyone seen anything like this before and can you help? </p><p>Thanks a bunch.... </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",demutthaus
