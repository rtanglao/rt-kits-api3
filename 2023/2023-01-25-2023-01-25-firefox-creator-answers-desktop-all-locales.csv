The version is 52.0.2 (yeah, I know - don't start).  The site also needs a specific version of Java (JRE8 - Update 161). I am on Windows 11 (64 bit) and I also have a regular version of Firefox installed (fully updated to 109.0). </p><p>I have successfully installed (multiple times) and I am starting that version of Firefox with it's own shortcut which is configured as </p><p>""C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox Foo\firefox.exe"" -p Foo -no-remote </p><p>In the first session, I go to Tools-&gt;Options-Advanced-Updates and set it to never download updates.  If I now exit and start again, Firefox installs updates and upgrades to a new version namely 60.x.x </p><p>How can I prevent this behavior? </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1090;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1561608;,agupte

Firefox is set as my default browser.  I use a VPN and Google keeps making me fill in captchas before I can do a search and sometimes I have to complete up to 5 captchas asking how many squares have traffic light etc. So in short how do I set up Firefox so it is Firefox that completes the search. </p><p>Sincerely  </p><p>Terry </p>,desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1090;,firefox,other,en-US,1561606;1561607;,terrykp12
