When I search for this issue online, everyone says to use the customize firefox menu to add what I want, but as you can see in the picture - no extensions are listed there, although they are installed and functioning.  Very weird because my other install, which is up to date, has this set as default and it has been forever. I'm bewildered.  Any suggestions? Thanks </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1090;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",chris63084

I don't know how this happened, but I noticed a mysterious Pin It icon on my site early January. I had a Pinterest account (unused), which I deleted, thinking I could get rid of this pesky thing. Now I have no Pinterest account, but 2 Pin It icons. Bizarrely, they only show up on Firefox, not Chrome. (I use Firefox 99% of the time.) Could you please advise me?
