Recently (past 1-2 years?), Firefox has started suggesting the base website when you have bookmarks that include the base domain - and it's really bothersome from a UX perspective. E.g. if i have ""<a href=""http://adobe.com/express"" rel=""nofollow"">adobe.com/express</a>"" or any other adobe bookmarks, the FIRST autocompleted url Firefox gives me is ""<a href=""http://adobe.com"" rel=""nofollow"">adobe.com</a>"" which I DO NOT have as a bookmark. In my Firefox settings I also have Shortcuts and other search suggestions disabled. </p><p>Why is Firefox doing this? </p>",desktop;beta;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1180;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1605137;1605138;1605139;,joeburns

Those behaviours mainly involved triggering some Javascript, including functionality in keyboard-related extensions, such as Tridactyl. Browser-level functionality on the other hand, such as pressing Shift-Escape to open `about:processes`, or pressing Escape to close Search Suggestions when the URL input bar, continue to work as before. </p><p>Upon investigation, I found it is specifically the javascript Keydown event that isn't being registered, while the subsequent Keyup event still is. I used <a href=""https://w3c.github.io/uievents/tools/key-event-viewer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://w3c.github.io/uievents/tools/key-event-viewer.html</a> to test this.  </p><p>I also found that starting Firefox in Troubleshoot Mode (Safe mode) doesn't resolve the issue. On the other hand, creating a new profile does.   </p><p>I've looked at the modified settings in `about:config`; there's a lot, but nothing stands out as being related to keyboard input or javascript.  </p><p>Can someone please help me find what is causing this? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1014;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",fkkd33

This is FF for Windows, and is the most updated version. This issue even occurred just now when typing in <a href=""http://MOZILLA.COM"" rel=""nofollow"">MOZILLA.COM</a>. Everytime one of these pages fails I attempt it with Chrome or Brave, and it works just fine. It does not matter whether they're ventured to through Google links or other links, or whether I type the address in manually. It only happens sometimes, as other times the same page loads just fine. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",cb362271
