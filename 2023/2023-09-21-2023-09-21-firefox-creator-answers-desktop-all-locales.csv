I've tried searching left and right on the internet for a solution and one does work which is installing the newer version of the browser each time myself. But this is ofcourse not a solution in the long run.  </p><p>It tries now to apply the update 118b9 to stable version 118 and it did downloaded just fine and asked me if I wanted to close the program to let it update which always worked. I've tried different DNS to see if that could be the problem, tried a clean default profile to see if that helped, I haven't tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it, due to me losing my passwords and what not. </p><p>I also tried to run the stable version to see if the issue was still there and it is still there, so me using the beta channel isn't the issue here. </p>",desktop;beta;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1180;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",tsvstrife

Recently (past 1-2 years?), Firefox has started suggesting the base website when you have bookmarks that include the base domain - and it's really bothersome from a UX perspective. E.g. if i have ""<a href=""http://adobe.com/express"" rel=""nofollow"">adobe.com/express</a>"" or any other adobe bookmarks, the FIRST autocompleted url Firefox gives me is ""<a href=""http://adobe.com"" rel=""nofollow"">adobe.com</a>"" which I DO NOT have as a bookmark. In my Firefox settings I also have Shortcuts and other search suggestions disabled. </p><p>Why is Firefox doing this? </p>",desktop;beta;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1180;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1605137;1605138;1605139;,joeburns

Those behaviours mainly involved triggering some Javascript, including functionality in keyboard-related extensions, such as Tridactyl. Browser-level functionality on the other hand, such as pressing Shift-Escape to open `about:processes`, or pressing Escape to close Search Suggestions when the URL input bar, continue to work as before. </p><p>Upon investigation, I found it is specifically the javascript Keydown event that isn't being registered, while the subsequent Keyup event still is. I used <a href=""https://w3c.github.io/uievents/tools/key-event-viewer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://w3c.github.io/uievents/tools/key-event-viewer.html</a> to test this.  </p><p>I also found that starting Firefox in Troubleshoot Mode (Safe mode) doesn't resolve the issue. On the other hand, creating a new profile does.   </p><p>I've looked at the modified settings in `about:config`; there's a lot, but nothing stands out as being related to keyboard input or javascript.  </p><p>Can someone please help me find what is causing this? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1014;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",fkkd33
