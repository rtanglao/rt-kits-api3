If FF is running first then VBox may have a hard time starting. Many crash reports automatically submitted by FF Nightly. All SW is up to date. FF doesn't always crash as soon as I try and start it if VB is open and if it is already running it may randomly crash on me.  As you can tell by my wording, it is totally random and frustrating! At times I will have to shut down FF in order to load my VB instance and sometimes it loads fine. And the opposite, if I have VB running sometimes I have to close it in order to get FF to load. The times that everything loads fine then FF usually crashes at some random point. I currently have 16 tabs split across 2 windows (seems to help it stay running) I have most of my extensions turned off. Even when I went down to just 1 default tab it did crash on me.  With my 2 windows and 16 tabs FF task manager shows ~280MB memory, 15% CPU or less after I wait a few minutes for it to all load. Threads vary a lot but seemed to go around 23 out of 80. Windows task manager showed 590MB and 7% CPU. Even with this few tabs it will sometimes get up to 1GB or more of system memory according to windows, but CPU still stays single digits, maybe low teens. It started about the end of Nov when I installed VB. When I have VB and FF running Win task manager shows ~ half my memory free. </p><p>I hope this is all the info U need to help me out. BTW, if I'm reading the crash report right it says I'm getting an oom error? And it looks like its only supposed to happen with low memory, I still have 12GB free. Any JAVA packages should be up to date. </p><p>FF Nightly is kept up to date (usually no more than 2 days) currently 110.0a1 1-3-2023 64b Windows 10 Pro (also kept up to date) as well as all drivers AMD FX 8320 8 Core CPU 24 GB DDR3 and Windows, VB and FF are on my 500GB SSD (~50% used) VBox is Current and up to date 7.0.4r154605 Extension and Expansion packs are current and for this ver VB settings: 12GB Ram - 4 CPU - 80GB Drive (On my SSD) Those settings are half my memory and CPU. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",starsaa

I notice that many others are having the same problem.  I can download everything using the Microsoft Edge browser so I will probably stop using Firefox unless you come up with a fix soon.  This is a major problem! </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",jimelguard-3
