I am on Windows 10 Pro version 22H2 and my laptop built-in camera is a BisonCam NB Pro with driver version 10.0.19041.1741 from Microsoft. When I use the built-in Camera application it works fine. When I use Microsoft Edge it works fine. But when I use Firefox the camera flickers on Google Meet. I have tried turning on camera acceleration in Firefox but it still flickers. If my ambient room light is low the camera doesn't flicker but that is of no use since the image is very dim and not worth using for conference mode. When I turn on the lights the camera flickers. I t appears like firefox cannot handle the bright light. Strange but when I am using Microsoft Edge (the latest version) the camera works fine even in bright light. </p><p>So I am wondering i this is a bug in Firefox or perhaps the built-in camera features are outdated. Using Microsoft Edge with the camera on Google Meet or any other webcam platform and it is PERFECT! The light balance is excellent even in bright light. So why does this happen only in Firefox? I have tried restarting Firefox in troubleshooting mode which disables all plugins and extensions but Firefox still does not work properly with my built-in BisonPro webcam in Google Meet and I get all this annoying flickering in different colors. </p><p>My graphics driver is the latest and using Intel HD Graphics 4000 driver from Intel. </p><p>I've even tried switching off my Kaspersky antivirus but the camera still flickers with firefox. </p><p>So please help or maybe Firefox needs to be fixed or updated? </p><p>Thanks a lot. </p>,desktop;other;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,other,en-US,1557499;,marababol

You say my email isn't valid.","<p>Update your information about Proton Mail from Canton, Geneva.  It was <a href=""http://Protonmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Protonmail.com</a>.  It has been changed to <a href=""http://proton.me"" rel=""nofollow"">proton.me</a>, so my email address is simone.meeker@proton.me, simone@pm.me, or simone.meeker@pm.me.  I like this company because my email is encrypted from the moment it leaves my computer until it reaches its destination.  My problem is that you are telling me that my email address, simone.meeker@proton.me is not valid.  It most certainly is valid and it works in my email.  But signing into Firefox I was told my email isn't valid, and there's nothing but (hopefully) talking with you about it that could change your program's mind.  Please update your program, because very soon <a href=""http://protonmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">protonmail.com</a> won't get my email to me.  The company has changed its name and how it does business.  And I love Firefox because it is much safer and more secure than Gmail was -- they just pulled my account one day along with my contact list. At the time I was president of our community's Arts and Crafts Club with 170 members.  It was very hard to write that month's newsletter. Please fix my problem. </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>Simone Meeker PO Box 2621 (no home mail delivery) Helendale, CA 92342 simone.meeker@pm.me, simone@pm.me, simone.meeker@proton.me. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1014;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,other,en-US,1557500;,simone.meeker

If FF is running first then VBox may have a hard time starting. Many crash reports automatically submitted by FF Nightly. All SW is up to date. FF doesn't always crash as soon as I try and start it if VB is open and if it is already running it may randomly crash on me.  As you can tell by my wording, it is totally random and frustrating! At times I will have to shut down FF in order to load my VB instance and sometimes it loads fine. And the opposite, if I have VB running sometimes I have to close it in order to get FF to load. The times that everything loads fine then FF usually crashes at some random point. I currently have 16 tabs split across 2 windows (seems to help it stay running) I have most of my extensions turned off. Even when I went down to just 1 default tab it did crash on me.  With my 2 windows and 16 tabs FF task manager shows ~280MB memory, 15% CPU or less after I wait a few minutes for it to all load. Threads vary a lot but seemed to go around 23 out of 80. Windows task manager showed 590MB and 7% CPU. Even with this few tabs it will sometimes get up to 1GB or more of system memory according to windows, but CPU still stays single digits, maybe low teens. It started about the end of Nov when I installed VB. When I have VB and FF running Win task manager shows ~ half my memory free. </p><p>I hope this is all the info U need to help me out. BTW, if I'm reading the crash report right it says I'm getting an oom error? And it looks like its only supposed to happen with low memory, I still have 12GB free. Any JAVA packages should be up to date. </p><p>FF Nightly is kept up to date (usually no more than 2 days) currently 110.0a1 1-3-2023 64b Windows 10 Pro (also kept up to date) as well as all drivers AMD FX 8320 8 Core CPU 24 GB DDR3 and Windows, VB and FF are on my 500GB SSD (~50% used) VBox is Current and up to date 7.0.4r154605 Extension and Expansion packs are current and for this ver VB settings: 12GB Ram - 4 CPU - 80GB Drive (On my SSD) Those settings are half my memory and CPU. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1557501;,starsaa
