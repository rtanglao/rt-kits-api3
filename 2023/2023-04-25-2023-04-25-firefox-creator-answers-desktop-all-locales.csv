Now it goes to download and sits there and does not populate to any reminder area.  From trial and error I now have to right click on the downloaded meeting located in the download tab, and this then pulls up a selection of things to do and I have to select 'show in folder'.  I then have to double click on the meeting in the download folder, and this takes me to an apps folder window (stating ""select an app to open this ics file"") where I then need to select Outlook by double clicking on it and it then will go to Outlook and I accept it or confirm it and it then populates into my Calendar.  A lot of work when previously I just double clicked on the download file and it instantly went to Outlook and into my Calendar. Is there a way to revert back to this more simple process or is this the new procedure for FireFox.  Very laborious I must say!&nbsp;:)  Thank you and regards, Gayle </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1120;firefox-11201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",gaylewaldron
