I did this and signed into to sync all my add-ons again. The add-ons installed without issue, however the icons for them are not displayed on the tool bar. I can access them using the jigsaw icon, but this is is less inconvenient that accessing the add-on directly. </p><p>I then reset Firefox in case it was a glitch and signed in again to allow the sync to reinstall the add-ons. This time only the Privacy Badger icon made it onto the toolbar. Again I can access the add-ons using the jigsaw icon. </p><p>I have tried to add the add-ons to the Customise Toolbar setting, but they do not show up in the list of things that can be added. </p><p>Firefox version: 112.0.1 (64 bit) </p><p>I have attached images to show what is happening. Is there anyway I can force the add-on icons onto the toolbar to make them more accessible? </p><p>Thank you </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1120;firefox-11201;,firefox,customize,en-US,1577258;1577273;,russell.seymour

Now it goes to download and sits there and does not populate to any reminder area.  From trial and error I now have to right click on the downloaded meeting located in the download tab, and this then pulls up a selection of things to do and I have to select 'show in folder'.  I then have to double click on the meeting in the download folder, and this takes me to an apps folder window (stating ""select an app to open this ics file"") where I then need to select Outlook by double clicking on it and it then will go to Outlook and I accept it or confirm it and it then populates into my Calendar.  A lot of work when previously I just double clicked on the download file and it instantly went to Outlook and into my Calendar. Is there a way to revert back to this more simple process or is this the new procedure for FireFox.  Very laborious I must say!&nbsp;:)  Thank you and regards, Gayle </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1120;firefox-11201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",gaylewaldron
