This border does not display in Safari or Chrome, just in Firefox. It also occurs in every media player I've tested, including YouTube and Netflix. </p><p>Annoyingly, I can't get this to show up in a screenshot. It seems like Firefox guesses the aspect ratio or resolution wrong when it puts media in fullscreen, and it has the effect of downsizing the actual interactive part of the display. Meaning, I can't move my mouse into the border area to take a screenshot of it. </p><p>I'm on an ARM Macbook running MacOS 13.5, if that matters. </p><p>Is this a bug, and/or is there a way to fix this? </p>",desktop;other;firefox-1150;firefox-11503;,firefox,other,en-US,"",tsedan

I have followed all trouble shooting steps;  1. Restart Computer 2. Open in Trouble shooting mode. 3. Uninstall Firefox. 4 Refresh Firefox. Nothing has worked. I took a screen shot and it is attached. When ever I open a new tab this symbol appears for a few seconds and then changes to the icon of what I am opening, G for google, H for HULU etc. I am worried that it is some type of Malware but none can be found on my system. </p><p>Any ideas or help would be greatly appreciated.

Why is it not designed it automatically save the created password when creating the password? Why and How did it find and save my SSN? I don't understand how the computer messed that up, I created and saved the password then I gave my information including my SSN to finish creating my account. Then the last step to create the account was to download the app and login on my phone. So I go to my Logins and passwords and find the password it saved was my SSN not the random password it created the account with.  </p><p>I don't know what to do, probably have to start over if it cannot be recovered. But I want to complain about about Firefox picking out my SSN. Failing to save the password is one thing, But replacing it with my SSN is wrong. And i do not think I made a mistake here when all I did was click two buttons, create password and save password. they popped up one after the other I clicked them both in seconds from one another. My SSN was not on the page at the time, I created and saved the password and gave my SSN in different steps one before the other. I cannot rationalize how this happened. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",abmgjones
