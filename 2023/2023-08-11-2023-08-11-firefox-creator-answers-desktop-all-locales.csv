We have the latest version of Firefox installed.  We have the latest admx files installed on our Domain Controllers.  In the Policy, I go into the User -&gt; Administrative Templates -&gt; Mozilla -&gt; Search and setup a search engine using Search Engine One.  I then go into Default Search Engine and configure our custom search to be default.  What we find is that the custom search engine never installs, so the custom search engine is not set at the default.  If I manually add the custom search engine using the Search Engine Helper Add-on, I can verify that the custom search settings do indeed work.  With that said, does anyone have thoughts on how to troubleshoot this issue?  First, need to figure out why the custom engine isn't installing at all.  Thanks. </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1160;firefox-11602;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",peterc5

We have site ""A"", and inside it we have embedded site ""B"" via iframe. Site ""B"" contains various items in local storage based on the operation performed. So, in dev tools, we can see those local storage items under site ""B"".  Now when clicking a link in site ""B"", it opens the same site (""B"") in a new tab which will basically read all its local storage items. But when I open dev tools in this new tab, items of local storage is empty. </p><p>I have referred this document <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/total-cookie-protection-and-website-breakage-faq"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/total-cookie-protection-and-website-breakage-faq</a> Based on this, I disabled Enhanced Tracking Protection by clicking the toggle in the shield panel next to the address bar. Now, I can read items of local storage in new tab after disabling this setting. But, in earlier versions of Firefox I was able to access local storage for the above scenario. This got broke due to the Total Cookie Protection feature. </p><p>My doubt is that, we are not trying to access local storage of different host. We are only trying to access localstorage of Site ""B"" in a different tab. May I know if there is a way to fix this other than disabling Enhanced tracking protection&nbsp;? Let us know if any code fix is available as well. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1596906;,gowthamlcs0000

This is how I want it to work. I want to be able to choose what to do with a PDF file every single time. </p><p>However, it's a HUGE problem that if I select ""Open in browser / Open with Firefox"", the window displays a temp file URL (file:///C:/Users/XXX/AppData/Local/Temp/XXX.pdf) instead of the PDF's actual URL. This is not okay!! </p><p>When I choose to open a PDF file in the browser, the PDF's URL should appear in the address bar. I don't care if the file still goes to the temp folder -- the temp download is not my issue. </p><p>When a PDF file is opened in the browser displaying a temp file URL, it's impossible to save the link to your Bookmarks -- you actually have to save the file!!! That is 100% the OPPOSITE of the intended behaviour! You shouldn't be forced to save a file to your computer when you could be saving a link to your Bookmarks! </p><p>The other problem is of course that you can no longer copy or share the URL unless you go back to the first page where you clicked the link. </p><p>Along the same lines, there are three reasons I don't want to set my PDF preferences to ""Open in Firefox"" by default. </p><p>Firstly, I don't want to be forced to view a PDF if I know I just want to save it. Hence preferring to be asked every time. </p><p>Secondly, and more importantly, I want to be able to choose to open the file in Acrobat without having to save it to my computer. </p><p>Thirdly, the setting changes the way Gmail attachments can be opened, where clicking the Download button no longer downloads, but opens in a new tab! A download button shouldn't be treated the same way as a URL link!! When people click download, they expect to open the file in an external app, or to save it -- NOT to open it in a new tab. </p><p>Overall, it's a ridiculous way to set up PDF viewing, and needs to be fixed. I would appreciate suggestions until Firefox improves the way it works with PDFs. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1150;firefox-11501;,firefox,other,en-US,"",julie.dupuis1
