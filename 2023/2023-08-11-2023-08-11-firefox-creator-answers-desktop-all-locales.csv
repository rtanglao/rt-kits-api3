I'm having trouble finding a way to associate *.msg files with the default Outlook application. In earlier versions of Firefox, when opening a msg file, it automatically opened the Outlook application to view the file. Currently, I have to download the file and from the downloaded files open it.  I can't find an option to associate msg files to open automatically in the Outlook application.  </p><p>I can do that with pdf or doc/docx files but I can't do it with msg files. With these files there is no option ""Always open with XXX application"" like with pdf doc. </p><p>Is there any option to add this&nbsp;? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1160;firefox-11602;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",lukasz.solon
