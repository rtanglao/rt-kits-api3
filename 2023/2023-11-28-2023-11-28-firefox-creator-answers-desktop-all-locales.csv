Firefox will not let me access the printer because it doesn't have a trusted certificate. </p><p>So I get a blank page with the message: ""we could not verify the certificate: reason = untrusted"" and doesn't give me any options.  In versions past, I recall an option to connect anyway if I trusted the site. </p><p>If there is a setting that lets me enable the option to continue anyway, where is it?  Alternately, is there an exception list, perhaps by IP address, that will allow the browser to connect?  Perhaps another solution? </p><p>I can't be the only one who is encountering this issue. </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Ed </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1190;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",ed9213
