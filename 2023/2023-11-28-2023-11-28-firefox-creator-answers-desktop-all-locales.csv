Costretto sempre per motivi di obsolescenza ad aggiornare la versione firefox, la nuova versione (119.0.1 64bit) ha i problemi riportati all'oggetto di questa comunicazione. Non funzionano i pop-up ma questo può dipendere da opzioni di protezione che però ho provato a modificare senza successo. Ma soprattutto non funzionano il pulsante ""Salva"" per salvare copie delle pagine web e, ancor più grave per me, non funziona l'opzione PDF per la ""Stampa"". Intendo dire che mentre la finestra di dialogo ""Stampa"" si apre e funziona se chiedo di stampare fisicamente il foglio cartaceo da stampante, essa non funziona se scelgo di stampare con opzione virtuale PDF. Quest'ultimo e le finestre di pop-up sono i problemi più pressanti, condizionano pesantemente la mia attività di navigazione. Avrei uno screenshot per mostrare il problema ma, appunto, NON POSSO annetterlo a questa segnalazione perché se clicco sul pulsante ""Browse"" di questa pagina, atto a quello scopo, il pulsante resta morto, non funziona.
