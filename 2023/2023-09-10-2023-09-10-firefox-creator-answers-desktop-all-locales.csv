But I don't know what the Thing is called -- You see, there's no key to the GUI. </p><p>The Thing: Users paste URLs into a text box. What's the name of that text box? I will look in 'about:config' for that name. Maybe I'll find the solution to the following Problem. </p><p>The Problem: If I paste this... javascript:Math.floor(10*(70000000000/(3*3600)-(192)*125)/(24/1.001)/1000)/10 ...into the text box, ""javascript:"" gets stripped so that the text becomes... Math.floor(10*(70000000000/(3*3600)-(192)*125)/(24/1.001)/1000)/10 ...and FFox responds with ""Hmm. That address doesnâ€™t look right."" </p><p>If I manually add ""javascript:"", I still get the FFox complaint. </p><p>How can I get the correct operation of that text box (whatever it's called)? Also, how can I stop the drop-down behavior. I hate it. </p><p>Thanks, Mark. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1170;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",markfilipak
