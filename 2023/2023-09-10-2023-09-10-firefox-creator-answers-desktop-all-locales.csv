Then the script did its job with the url link received in parameter. I know it wasn't the goal of this extension, but It did the job I wanted. Now, in the snap firefox, I cannot do the same. It seems its because native messaging (<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging</a>) doesn't allow permission to interact with others applications (fix me if I'm wrong).

But I don't know what the Thing is called -- You see, there's no key to the GUI. </p><p>The Thing: Users paste URLs into a text box. What's the name of that text box? I will look in 'about:config' for that name. Maybe I'll find the solution to the following Problem. </p><p>The Problem: If I paste this... javascript:Math.floor(10*(70000000000/(3*3600)-(192)*125)/(24/1.001)/1000)/10 ...into the text box, ""javascript:"" gets stripped so that the text becomes... Math.floor(10*(70000000000/(3*3600)-(192)*125)/(24/1.001)/1000)/10 ...and FFox responds with ""Hmm. That address doesn’t look right."" </p><p>If I manually add ""javascript:"", I still get the FFox complaint. </p><p>How can I get the correct operation of that text box (whatever it's called)? Also, how can I stop the drop-down behavior. I hate it. </p><p>Thanks, Mark. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1170;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1602707;1602741;1602769;,markfilipak
