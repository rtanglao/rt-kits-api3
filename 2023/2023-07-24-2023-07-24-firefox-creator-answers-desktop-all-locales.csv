As said in the title, I can't hear audio on any websites. This is a problem for me as I use services like Google Meet very frequently. It's a real pain for the other people using the website as I can't hear them, so that means they have to use the chat to communicate with me. However, I can hear audio in other apps and sites work perfectly otherwise. </p><p><strong>What have I done so far?</strong> I tried refreshing Firefox via the installer twice. Even then the issue was not fixed. Then I decided to delete the files and reinstall via the installer in hopes of the issue being fixed. Even then it was not fixed. I was almost going to post here when I decided to go into preferences and check. As it turned out, it was set to block audio but allow video for all websites. I changed it to allow video, and it was fixed (at least for yesterday. </p><p><strong>If it was fixed yesterday, what happened today?</strong> I did not change any settings so far.  I checked the configuration which says it does allow audio and video. I have provided some debug information as well as some pictures. I hope it helps you help me. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Marty_McFly
