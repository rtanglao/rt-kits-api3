When I Inspect(Q) the relevant bit of script it shows the correct page for the current week. All other links from the current edition work as expected.  The link works correctly on other days of the week. The IT support at The Times have no idea why this is happening and have simply asked me to do stupid things like clearing all cache and cookies relevant to their site. this has no effect whatsoever! </p><p>How can this happen and have you any help on the subject? </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",beb25hex12

However, I can hear audio in other apps and sites work perfectly otherwise. </p><p><strong>What have I done so far?</strong> I tried refreshing Firefox via the installer twice. Even then the issue was not fixed. Then I decided to delete the files and reinstall via the installer in hopes of the issue being fixed. Even then it was not fixed. I was almost going to post here when I decided to go into preferences and check. As it turned out, it was set to block audio but allow video for all websites. I changed it to allow video, and it was fixed (at least for yesterday. </p><p><strong>If it was fixed yesterday, what happened today?</strong> I did not change any settings so far.
