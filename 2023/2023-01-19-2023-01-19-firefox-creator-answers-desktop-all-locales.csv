I had to download the file to view it- I couldn't just preview it. I'm aware that ""previewing"" or ""opening"" PDFs without choosing to save them actually just saved them to a temp folder locally which the system would delete eventually on its own, and this new change from version 98+ supposedly ""optimizes"" the download process because ""Firefox no longer saves files to a temporary folder because of the downsides to saving files in a location that is hard to discover.""  </p><p>Downsides? What downsides??? </p><p><strong>Removing that feature quite literally does the opposite of optimizing when the average user, and in fact all users, benefit from being able to preview PDFs by keeping them in a temp folder.</strong> If we wanted to download something, we would <strong>choose to save the file where we want it to be</strong>. You're literally presenting ""save file"" and ""open file"" as if they're two different choices, when ""open file"" is really just ""save file, and then we open it for you, and you have to manually delete it yourself later!"". This is objectively a downgrade in every way. There's no optimization here. I realize that me as just one person asking for this will fall on deaf ears, but I have to try. <strong>Please bring back the option to preview files by automatically saving them to a temp folder without me having to set my default download folder for ALL files as a temp folder. </strong> </p><p>Please think about the situation of someone like a teacher who needs to mark 40 students' PDF homework submissions in Canvas, which lets you quickly change between inline previews within the site of each PDF with its grading UI on the side, making it convenient for them to grade. With this change they either have to download 40 PDFs onto their hard drive, or go back to using Chrome, where the PDF.js extension (the very same PDF viewer that's built into Firefox and backed by Mozilla?!) actually will let them preview the temp files, no problem. And I'm not even teaching right now, I'm just a student who fell into this rabbit hole because I wanted to do my homework and all the PDFs are blank boxes in Firefox while they appear just fine on Chrome. </p><p>I really want to be using Firefox full time. I really do! But by taking away this very useful feature, you're literally forcing my hand into using Chrome again. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,customize,en-US,1560423;,trisha.chockie.wong

In the past, I have not had this situation.   I did a number of things on my Mac (restarting the app, restarting the machine, resetting my SMC at restart) and none of them seemed to work.  I had already checked that my OS gave Firefox access to the camera and mic, and Firefox's settings gave access to <a href=""http://doxy.me"" rel=""nofollow"">doxy.me</a>.  After a number of tries, I was finally able to get into the meeting albeit 35 minutes late.   </p><p>As soon as it ended I retried getting in and found that access to the camera and mic were again disabled.   In the Permissions Tab in Page Info, the camera and mic were set to ""Use Default"", which I assumed was to allow access.  I checked the ""Allow"" button for both, reloaded the page and the camera light came on.  I  changed the permissions back to ""Use default""; quit and started up again.  I got the no access message.  I reloaded the page and part, but not all, of the video feed appeared. I checked the Permissions and they were set as I had left them.  Clicking ""Allow"" and reloading the page got the video back.  However, this problem recurs if I quit and restart Firefox.  </p><p>While I was trying to get into my meeting, I tried Chrome and got the camera with a line through it. So, I thought that it might be a MacOS problem.  However, after getting into the meeting on Firefox, I went back and found a similar control in Chrome that toggles camera and mic in the active window.  I reset those, and have not had the access problem since. </p><p>P.S. I notice that Settings has only ""Allow"" and ""Block"" as permission options for the camera and mic, but the permissions tab in Page Info has ""Always Ask"" in addition to ""Allow"" and ""Block"".  In this instance, I was never asked when I chose ""Always Ask"", and the camera did not go on. </p><p>I am also going to post this in the Apple Support Community and with Doxy, as I am not convinced that there is not some OS/application or Doxy communication problem given I had similar situations with Chrome and Firefox.  I DO NOT want to use Chrome (or any other Google product, for that matter), and I have a workaround, but it used to work without the workaround. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1090;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",toad_cheery0q
