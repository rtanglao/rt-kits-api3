If I open another tab to access another web site the same thing happens. If I then open the Edge-Browser to see whether it is a problem of Firefox, just in this moment, the websites in Firefox suddnely all appear!  </p><p>This is not a coincidence. I observed it around 20 times and played around with the time waiting until I opened the Edge browser. I observed it with several kinds of websites (static to web app). </p><p>I don't suspect Windows to annoy Firefox, or should I? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",eugen.staab
