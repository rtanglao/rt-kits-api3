The layout appears distorted, images are misplaced, or certain elements are missing altogether. This issue is not consistent across all websites but seems to affect a specific subset. </p><p>Steps to Reproduce: </p><p>Open the Firefox browser on my Windows 10 machine. Visit the following websites: [List the websites where the issue occurs]. Observe the rendering issues, such as distorted layout, misplaced images, or missing elements. Expected Behavior: I expect the web pages to render correctly get <a href=""https://apkhomie.com/secrets-of-the-dragon-cafe-mod-apk/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://apkhomie.com/secrets-of-the-dragon-cafe-mod-apk/</a>, as they do in other browsers such as Chrome or Edge. </p><p>Additional Information: </p><p>I am using the latest version of Firefox [mention the version number]. I have tried clearing my browser cache and cookies, but the issue persists. I have disabled all extensions and themes, but the problem remains. The issue occurs both in regular browsing mode and in safe mode. The websites in question display correctly in other browsers, ruling out issues with the websites themselves. Can anyone offer insights into why this issue may be occurring and suggest potential solutions? I appreciate any help or guidance in resolving this matter. </p><p>Thank you </p>",desktop;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",jaksonflix
