They say must have cookies active. So I went to my privacy settings and, using Exceptions for Cookies and Site Data, set their website to allow cookies. HOWEVER, at the end of the day, when I clear Firefox history, the exception gets cleared as well. Of what use is the exception list if it gets cleared when I clear all my history? I know I can manually override the cookies problem by checking the shield icon in the address bar, but I don't feel I should have to do that every time I want to sign on to that website (I thought the whole idea of the exceptions list was to avoid having to do that). </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1578093;,goliwagmo

This is the only browser where I have this problem and the problem seems confined to Twitter, although I don't generally post on many other websites. The dialogue box will pop up and I can see the content, but the scroll bar on the right side will not allow me to scroll down to the Tweet button. It's greyed out and simply won't move. I've tried tweaking settings/permissions, etc., to no avail. I'm tired of having to copy the article address to Edge or Chrome to share it, or go to one of those browsers to post in Twitter. It's really become such a problem because I  generally use Firefox and I use Twitter quite often. This has been an ongoing issue for months now and thus far I can find no reason for it and no solution. If anyone can provide some insight, I'd appreciate it. And yes, I've cleared cookies/cache umpteen times. Browser is updated. Windows 10 is updated. It makes no sense to me at all. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1578092;,kentuckywoman2
