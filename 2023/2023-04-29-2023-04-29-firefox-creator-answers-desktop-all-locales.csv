I've tried creating a clean browser profile and logging in, which appeared to work the first time but not after closing and re-opening that browser profile. So it doesn't seem related to any addons or other browser configuration changes I've made. I've also tried logging in on my other laptop running Firefox 112.0.1 and sometimes I can reproduce and sometimes I can't, it's highly unusual and very confusing. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1120;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",nathanielmbeaver
