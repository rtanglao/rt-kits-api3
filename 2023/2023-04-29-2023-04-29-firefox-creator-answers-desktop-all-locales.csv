Normally, it restores my session (and the 4 windows) automatically. But this time, it didn't. I opened Mozilla, but the ""restore previous session"" option didn't generate the previously open windows. </p><p>I've lost hundreds of tabs that I had open... is there any way to restore my previous session? </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1120;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",eugenijuso

The same site worked perfectly today, on the same computer, using Google Chrome. </p><p>Cloudflare is a major CDN and many important commercial sites, like Costco Instacart, have their content delivered by Cloudflare so this is a major issue with Firefox. For the moment there is a work-around, use Chrome instead, but it would be better to have Firefox address issues with Cloudflare. </p>",linux;desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1120;firefox-11201;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",em2jacks

I have two Yubico Security Keys which I use for 2FA. The problem seems to be that Firefox cannot communicate with the USB port, as it doesn't make any difference whether the USB Security Key is plugged in or not, the error returned is always the same and the Security Key does not light up. </p><p>I believe Firefox's WebAuth code must be fine, as it works on Windows, which is why I think it's some kind of permissions problem. Chrome works perfectly with the Security Keys on my computer. </p><p>I've used a number of sites (I've listed a couple below) where you can test your Security Key with Firefox on KDE Neon and the error is always ""UnknownError: The operation failed for an unknown transient reason"": </p><p><a href=""https://www.token2.com/tools/fido2-test/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.token2.com/tools/fido2-test/</a> <a href=""https://demo.yubico.com/webauthn-technical/registration"" rel=""nofollow"">https://demo.yubico.com/webauthn-technical/registration</a> </p><p>I cannot log into Bugzilla with GitHub as my GitHub login uses a Security Key as the second factor. </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",dave353

So it doesn't seem related to any addons or other browser configuration changes I've made. I've also tried logging in on my other laptop running Firefox 112.0.1 and sometimes I can reproduce and sometimes I can't, it's highly unusual and very confusing. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1120;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",nathanielmbeaver
