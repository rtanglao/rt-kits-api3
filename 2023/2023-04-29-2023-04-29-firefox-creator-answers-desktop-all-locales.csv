This is the only browser where I have this problem and the problem seems confined to Twitter, although I don't generally post on many other websites. The dialogue box will pop up and I can see the content, but the scroll bar on the right side will not allow me to scroll down to the Tweet button. It's greyed out and simply won't move. I've tried tweaking settings/permissions, etc., to no avail. I'm tired of having to copy the article address to Edge or Chrome to share it, or go to one of those browsers to post in Twitter. It's really become such a problem because I  generally use Firefox and I use Twitter quite often. This has been an ongoing issue for months now and thus far I can find no reason for it and no solution. If anyone can provide some insight, I'd appreciate it. And yes, I've cleared cookies/cache umpteen times. Browser is updated. Windows 10 is updated.

Twitch works like normal on other devices and in other browsers still. Other sites with videos, live videos, and streaming work like normal still in Firefox so far. Twitch will either not play videos at all, or it will play for several minutes and then stop working. I have followed all the troubleshooting steps Twitch tech support has offered, and it still does not work in Firefox. I have looked at and changed and reset almost every Firefox setting, tried Twitch with and without extensions active, cleared the Firefox startup cache and refreshed Firefox, deleted cache and cookies, restarted Firefox and my entire computer, and Twitch still will not work in Firefox. Twitch worked perfectly normally before this most recent Firefox update. Please, please, please, please resolve this issue right away. I do not know how much longer I can continue to use Firefox if the program will not work for all the web pages I need.
