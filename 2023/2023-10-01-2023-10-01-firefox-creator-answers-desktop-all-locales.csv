After signing in I found that all bookmarks, extensions and passwords have gone and the original 2020 profile they were attached to seems to be missing as well.   I initially installed the Firefox app from the windows store and thought that might have been the problem, so uninstalled it and reinstalled from the mozilla website. That didn't heelp so I went through all the help articles I could find and I still can't figure out how to restore anything. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",plantshateme
