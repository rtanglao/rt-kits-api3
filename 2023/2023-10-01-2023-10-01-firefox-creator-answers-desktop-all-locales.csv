Only some tabs have thumbnails. I have freshly installed firefox on a new PC and I've been using it for another day and nothing changes, I visit these websites constantly and these icons still look like this. It will stay like this or is it some browser error&nbsp;? </p><p>Greetings </p><p>Tom </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",bruno.funkyzeit

After signing in I found that all bookmarks, extensions and passwords have gone and the original 2020 profile they were attached to seems to be missing as well.   I initially installed the Firefox app from the windows store and thought that might have been the problem, so uninstalled it and reinstalled from the mozilla website. That didn't heelp so I went through all the help articles I could find and I still can't figure out how to restore anything. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,sync,en-US,1607389;,plantshateme
