My troubles started when I did a ""Check Disc"", and cleaned up my C drive.  Unfortunately, my extensions were also gone from the toolbar.  I checked my ""Ad-ons and themes"", but they are all there.  Next I tried pinning them, but that didn't work, but in further analyzing, I got a yellow warning, something to-the effect that installing too many shortcuts, could cause problems.  Rats; searching found nothing to even hint of fixing that yellow notification.  Woe is me; seems I create another problem with no fix. The Extension Manager"" panel only shows ""Duckduckgo"".  I then uninstalled an extension by clicking on ""Remove""  Sure enough, it was no longer listed on the ""Ad-ons ...."" panel.  I installed a fresh copy; but though it now shows up in the ""Ad-ons ...."" screen, the ""Extension manager"" still only shows the extension ""Duckduckgo"".  I tried deleting another extension and re-installing it, but ""Extension Manager"" still is not functioning. </p><p>I then tried to restore to an earlier time, but there are no restore points.  Thank you, ""Check Disk"". Restoring via ""Profile"" sounds intriguing, but if whatever changes I made via ""Check Disk"" are permanent, then I will have spent a lot of time laboriously hand copying preferences and whatever, and at 88 years young, my time remaining above ground, is finite, and is valuable to me. </p><p><br> Has anyone come across this weird problem?  P.S. I did spend extensive time in the ""Firefox Help"" pages, but there is nothing in re this weird anomaly.  Short of throwing this computer out of the window, does any one have any ideas other than re-installing FF, which I am wont to to do for reasons enumerate above? Whew!
