I have a long list of webpages that I have been collecting for a couple of years that have text that is invisible unless one uses Ctl-A to select all the text on the page. It's probably over 20 items long. The last one I found is unfortunately all the pages of an ebook that I have to read online using the publisher's ebook app that is not downloadable. It's a medical book with a lot of illustrations and charts.
