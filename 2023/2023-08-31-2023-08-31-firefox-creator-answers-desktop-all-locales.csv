After the installation, I installed some add-ons + imported settings for umatrix and ublock origin + imported my backuped bookmarks. Now, I was checking the cookies settings, because I want to have most of them deleted after closing ff. I realized, that there are cookies from sites, which I didn't visit since the new installation. And no, I don't think that these are third party cookies, which were set during the visit of other sites, because those sites are for sure don't interact with other sites for merchandising reasons etc. The sites are also not to be found in the ""History"". I just installed FF three days ago. I'll deactivate the ""history"", too. </p><p>Does anybody has a clue how it come, that I have such cookies in my list? </p><p>Many thanks </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",MozMi

I am running Arch Linux (6.4.12, default kernel) with Hyprland WM on an  old i7-7700K with a Nvidia GTX980TI. Apart from Firefox the system runs stable. When doing research, or just browsing text based sites, firefox is also very stable, but on some sites like twitch, youtube, or idle games like ""Antimatter Dimensions"" (<a href=""http://ivark.github.io"" rel=""nofollow"">ivark.github.io</a>) the browser (or page) crashes regularly. It also happens in Troubleshoot mode, also after a clean re-install (including deleting /.mozilla in /home) and since various versions over the last couple of month. The latest crash report ID is bp-67ed2673-4ed2-452b-bc63-dc1060230831. I know I'm running a niche system, but I really like my setup and apart from those crashes it's amazing, so I hope you can help and point me in the right direction as to what could cause the crashes.
