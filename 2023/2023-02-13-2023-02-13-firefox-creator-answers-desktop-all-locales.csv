Não sei ao certo o que aconteceu, mas na semana passada, enquanto eu usava o Firefox, o Firefox pediu acesso a pasta de Downloads. Achei estranho, pois eu já fazia downloads antes, então o programa já tinha acesso. Tudo bem, eu permiti. Hoje de manhã, o Firefox passou a não baixar nada, nem mostrar a janela para envio de arquivo. </p><p>Eu uso muito essas duas funcionalidades: baixar e fazer upload. Não acredito que fiz algo que tirasse a permissão do programa. Não baixei nenhum outro programa que mexesse nas configurações do Mac, não mexi nas configurações do Firefox, nem nas configurações do Mac. </p><p>O que pode ter acontecido? Vou procurar algumas soluções na internet, mas gostaria de receber a resposta de vocês primeiramente, para eu não fazer acidentalmente algo que possa piorar. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1090;firefox-10901;,firefox,fix-problems,pt-BR,"",denysveloso
