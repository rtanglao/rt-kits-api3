However, tonight when I tried to log in, a window popped up asking for my fingerprint It identified itself as coming from Firefox. This has not happened before. Is this action true? or a scam? If true, do you know why it has started popping up? (Did I flip a switch in the browser, then forget about it?) I've  attached a screen grab of the window.
