When I click on ""Forgot password"" and give my email address, it says they'll send me an email to reset my password, but the email never comes. </p><p>How can I get my old settings back? </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1090;,firefox,other,en-US,1560150;1560151;,davehallmusic
