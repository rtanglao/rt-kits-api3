Enjoy that nothing happens. </p><p>Expected Result&nbsp;: Happy life at Firefox </p><p>Actual Result: Tedious LOADING </p> <hr> <p>I've been using Firefox Developer Edition for the past two years without problems. From some point on(about 1 week ago), All browser's search functions suddenly don't work. Navigation bar? Not work. Searchig from Bookmark? Not work. Do not use google? Not work even with duckduckgo. with out DNS? Not work even with 142.250.206.206. There is only one website that i can access with Firefox Developer Edition. It is Mozilla's official website At this moments, I curious that ""why isnt work&gt;?"" So i used Developer tools, And then I found something amazing. There was no request or response on the Network tab! (Of course, I pressed Ctrl + R) And then, on second thought, I found that the JS function that should have been small in the lower left of the browser screen was not displayed. Finally, I thought, hmm... My Firefox is broken! So i found the FireFox, and then i uninstall it, and reinstall it! All the External Plugin works, OK then What if FireFox????? Unfortunately, Firefox Developer Edition's problem remained the same. I'm sorry that i couldn't even give you a possible cause of the problem. But i SUFFER for a week! Please resolve the issue..... </p>",desktop;beta;other;windows-10;firefox-1170;,firefox,other,en-US,1600419;,potatokth

However,  - the ads aren't ""in the browser"" window they're right at the top of my screen - There's no options I can find to see any information about where the ad comes from - The ad usually disappears quite fast, preventing me from investigating further I don't imagine it could be being shown by Google because it appears without me opening Google. So it kind of seems like it's probably being done by the browser. But I also struggle to believe that Firefox would be purposefully showing me such invasive advertising. So I'm guessing it's malware. But I don't know. Please help me to understand: - Where does this ad come from? - If it's malware, any ideas how to get rid of it? - If it's Firefox, and they're being shown because of a mistake on my part, how do I turn them off? </p><p>Thanks </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-10214;firefox-102140;,firefox,customize,en-US,1600414;,neildutoit13
