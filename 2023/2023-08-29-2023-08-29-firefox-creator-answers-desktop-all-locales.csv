Google opens, I type whatever I search, the suggestions appear, but hovering on them doesn't turn the cursor into a pointer. The moment I click them, or press enter after typing, Firefox starts freezing. It also happens when I reload some other pages, for what I've seen till now. Looking into Task Manager, its memory usage goes up and up, and anything else that is connected gets cut off (running videos on YT stop, downloads fail, etc.). Tried on Chrome and there is no such issue. </p><p>I didn't install any new extension, nor application in the PC itself, or anything else. I don't think there was even a Windows update (using Windows 11). It simply started doing so from one day to the next, yesterday. I waited to see if it would go back to normal today, going away just like it came, but of course no. Restarting the PC doesn't fix it, troubleshooting mode does nothing, I tried setting accessibility.force_disabled to 1, but still nothing, changed Firefox profile, again nothing. </p><p>Any suggestions before trying to uninstall and reinstall (which would be very bothersome due to extensions and ongoing sessions, with no guarantee that it'd fix anything either)? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Unwanderer

There was no request or response on the Network tab! (Of course, I pressed Ctrl + R) And then, on second thought, I found that the JS function that should have been small in the lower left of the browser screen was not displayed. Finally, I thought, hmm... My Firefox is broken! So i found the FireFox, and then i uninstall it, and reinstall it! All the External Plugin works, OK then What if FireFox????? Unfortunately, Firefox Developer Edition's problem remained the same. I'm sorry that i couldn't even give you a possible cause of the problem. But i SUFFER for a week!

However,  - the ads aren't ""in the browser"" window they're right at the top of my screen - There's no options I can find to see any information about where the ad comes from - The ad usually disappears quite fast, preventing me from investigating further I don't imagine it could be being shown by Google because it appears without me opening Google. So it kind of seems like it's probably being done by the browser. But I also struggle to believe that Firefox would be purposefully showing me such invasive advertising. So I'm guessing it's malware. But I don't know. Please help me to understand: - Where does this ad come from? - If it's malware, any ideas how to get rid of it? - If it's Firefox, and they're being shown because of a mistake on my part, how do I turn them off? </p><p>Thanks </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-10214;firefox-102140;,firefox,customize,en-US,1600414;,neildutoit13
