I donate to Wikipedia and they don't ask such intrusive questions - so why do you? You say that less than 2% of TB users donate - this <strong>PROBABLY </strong>the reason why they don't...! </p><p>And the fact that there is no direct link to ask somebody ask question about this subject, is really frustrating. </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;,firefox,other,en-US,"",minkwa1

The changes I make in about:config don't seem to save, and every time Firefox crashes, it happily reloads my old tabs and windows. </p><p>Your assistance would be greatly appreciated! </p><p>OS: Arch Linux DE: Gnome 44 </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",anonisanon

In order to log into my email, I use the saved log in credentials (which means I do not need to type out the credentials). It allows me to sign in, as expected, except that it asks me to save (again) the credentials, as if I have filled in the credentials manually for the first time.  </p><p>I have Firefox 117.0 on Windows 11 computer.  </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1170;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",praneshbhargava
