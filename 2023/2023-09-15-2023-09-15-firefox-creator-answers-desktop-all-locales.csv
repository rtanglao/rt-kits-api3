Then, I hit ""Enter"". And, then something odd happens. After I hit ""Enter"", the entire Google Search Website freezes for about 5-7 seconds. During the freeze, I cannot interact with the Website in any way. After  5-7 seconds, Google Search Website loads as usual and shows the search results. The delay and the freeze only occurs from time to time.  </p><p>Here are some other details:  </p><p>1) Other browsers do not show this behaviour (Chrome, Edge).  2) Other search engines do show this behaviour (DuckDuckGo). </p><p>What I tried to fix the issue: </p><p>1) Reinstall Firefox. 2) Cleaned Cache, Cookies. Cleared History. </p><p>Extensions Installed: 1) Only Ublock Origin </p><p><br> Can you help fixing the weird delay and freeze? It never happened before </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",theoldfriend12
