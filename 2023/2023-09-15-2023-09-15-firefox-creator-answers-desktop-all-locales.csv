Every time Firefox fails I switch to a Chrome-based browser and the website works properly.  Although not limited to handling of document downloads (banks, credit cards), printing a website's page (File, Print frequently results in a blank page, and/or missing text or images or both, whereas with a Chrome based browser the page prints properly 95% of the time) and possibly to pop-ups (which seem to be blocked without notice).  This has been getting worse for many months.  About 20-30% of the regular websites i visit are marked as ""Chrome only"" because they don't work fully with Firefox.  These tend to be banks, credit card companies, online stores.  I used to complain to companies that their websites don't work with Firefox, but its clear that they don't care, and I now realize that the real problem is that Firefox doesn't care.  One website I spoke to (which wouldn't print in Firefox or Chrome) apologized for not setting the website up properly for printing.  My guess is that many websites never test with Firefox because most of their customers use Chrome based browsers.  For all its flaws, I would rather use Firefox than Chrome-based, but Firefox keeps making it harder to justify that view.  When it comes to just looking at websites, Firefox is usually very good, but beyond basic viewing, Firefox is losing ground to most other browsers.  I know there are no specifics here, and i think it unlikely anybody will take this seriously. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1603875;1603900;,jo84
