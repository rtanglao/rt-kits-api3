It doesn't mute, I mean, the mute button is not on and even if I mute/unmute the video remains silent, it just disappears into thin air. In order to get it back, the only way I found is to pause and restart the video. I deleted the cache, tested private mode, troubleshooting mode, even another (completely new) windows user, but the problem remains. The only thing that comes to my mind I have not yet tried is a portable version of firefox, just in case. I tried to replicate the issue in Chrome (to exclude some issue of the computer), but it worked just fine. </p><p>The problem started on firefox 112 and it's still present now that was updated to 113. </p><p>Funny thing, in the last couple of days, the issue started happening somehow at random and generally a little less frequently. </p><p>Any idea? </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1130;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",emanuele.45

In all cases, the browser refuses to accept any input--automated (password manager), copy and paste, or manually typed by myself and pops up a message saying ""This page is slowing down Firefox. To speed up your browser, stop this page."" This message is followed by a small button saying ""STOP"" and an ""X"" to close the message. I have tried turning off the Enhanced Tracking Protection button in the URL/address bar. I have tried clicking the STOP button in the message. I have tried ignoring the message. And I have tried closing the message by hitting the ""X"" at the end of the message bar. AdBlock Plus and NoScript have been disabled. Nothing works and I am unable to log into my accounts to retrieve and pay bills, balance the checkbook, purchase any B&amp;N items, etc. I would really REALLY appreciate it if someone could figure out what I'm doing wrong or what is going on and fix it: Or send me step by step instructions on how to get around this because FIREFOX is the only browser I trust for accessing sensitive and personal information but I am at a standstill now when it comes to obtaining our bills, etc. Operating system is WIN 11.

The video expands to the top of the screen, but the two side and lower borders do not expand fully and the website underneath can be seen on these sides. I attached a random YouTube video screenshot and a news channel video with dark borders to show what is happening. Again this is on all websites with video and full-screen options, not just YouTube, and this was not happening prior to the recent update 113.0 being installed last night on my computer. I've tried the previous fixes like clearing the cache, etc., and it seems to be a bug in the recent update since this did not happen prior to last night's update installation. I played the same videos in the Chrome browser and the issues are NOT present, and the videos expand to cover the entire screen as normal. Does anyone have a fix or can a fix be requested?

In order to do so, we can relax the expiry check on the server side however we observed that firefox does not pass the expired client side cert to the server for establishing MTLS.
