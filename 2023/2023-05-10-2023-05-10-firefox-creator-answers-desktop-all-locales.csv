I have had zero problems with FF on my old mini.  </p><p>I am operating MacOS 13.3.1 (a), and trying to get Firefox 113.0 to work. It will start, but, after running through the new-install windows, it will not load any pages, such as google, and gets stuck in ""a checking for updates"" loop. Eventually, I have to force quit. I have removed all traces of previous versions from my system, and restarted, then done a clean install of FF, without loading any previous information, files, tabs, etc. Just the bare bones. All antivirus is off.  No plugins other the the Open H264 and Widevine Content Decryption. No extensions. Set on standard privacy.  </p><p>I have done this several times. Working in trouble shooting mode makes little difference. I can sometimes open 3 tabs before everything goes south. </p><p>Safari is working fine.  </p><p>I'm about to give up on Firefox. Any help would be appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",andrew210
