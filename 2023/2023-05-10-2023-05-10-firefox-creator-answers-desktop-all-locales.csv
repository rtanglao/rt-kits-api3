Both browsers use the same identical userChrome.css file. </p><p>I have written a Coldfusion website that has input fields like text boxes, check boxes, select lists etc. The code is on my WIndows 2012 R2 server and the css style sheet used for the CFML site is therefore the same on all clients that access the site. </p><p>However, on the two machines that I use the CFML site on looks different. One has more visually appealing rounded corners on all input fields and the select lists have a grey background, whilst the other has ugly square boxes and all white backgrounds. </p><p>The CFML code has no customization's for things like that - Its the same code used across all clients.  </p><p>I wonder if this is a preference I may have set on one PC and not on the other? Is there a way to compare the settings easily for both machines? </p><p>If not a preference what else might cause the two PCs to render the pages differently? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-102100;firefox-10210_1;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",citizen1138x

We are soon reaching the expiry for most of these client certs stored on the client side and need some extra time to let clients upgrade the certs. In order to do so, we can relax the expiry check on the server side however we observed that firefox does not pass the expired client side cert to the server for establishing MTLS. Can you please help to know if there is any setting on the browser side that can change this behaviour and let the browser pass the expired client side cert? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",harsh_tech

I have had zero problems with FF on my old mini.  </p><p>I am operating MacOS 13.3.1 (a), and trying to get Firefox 113.0 to work. It will start, but, after running through the new-install windows, it will not load any pages, such as google, and gets stuck in ""a checking for updates"" loop. Eventually, I have to force quit. I have removed all traces of previous versions from my system, and restarted, then done a clean install of FF, without loading any previous information, files, tabs, etc. Just the bare bones. All antivirus is off.  No plugins other the the Open H264 and Widevine Content Decryption. No extensions. Set on standard privacy.  </p><p>I have done this several times. Working in trouble shooting mode makes little difference. I can sometimes open 3 tabs before everything goes south. </p><p>Safari is working fine.  </p><p>I'm about to give up on Firefox. Any help would be appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1579737;,andrew210
