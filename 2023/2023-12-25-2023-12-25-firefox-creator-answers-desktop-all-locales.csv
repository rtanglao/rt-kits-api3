It didn't install until now. 2 1/2 days later. Why the long delay?  And why don't you have something show up in the banner or toolbar that designates that an upload to Firefox is happening?  Now, we all have to guess why Firefox is behaving slow and erratic, close and re-open, and check for version. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;needsinfo;firefox-1210;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1626336;,steveaaayyy

I have recently had to unexpectedly factory reset my laptop and I discovered upon doing so that my Mozilla password in my password keeper isn't up to date - I had to reset my password, and as such I'm currently using ""my"" Mozilla account with no bookmarks or history available. However, I am still logged into my Firefox account on my phone, with all my history and bookmarks safely saved on there. Is there any way for me to migrate that information back to my desktop app? Verify my desktop account somehow?? I really don't want to lose all my bookmarks, so any info for how to restore that to my desktop account would be very appreciated. Thank you! </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1210;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",tzamozdra

The annual NORAD Santa Tracker website does not function properly under Firefox. While there are no issues with the 3D rendering itself, the 3D map is squished vertically toward the left side of the page. It appears to be defaulting to a mobile browser view. The only extension I have installed is uBlock Origin, and I turned it off for the NORAD Santa website, and the display issue persists. </p><p>Opening the site under Safari shows the Santa tracker taking up the entire browser window as it should do. </p><p>I'm currently on Mac OS Sonoma using the latest version of Firefox 121.0 </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;website-breakages;firefox-1210;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",wb8979
