Completly. Tried to restore them over my ios firefox but because of the sync feature it had already replaced the saved passwords there too.  What is odd, that I am still logged in on couple of websits but the login data for them is nowhere to be found... Ofc I don't have any backup so I am probaly screwed here. I don't understand how that could happen in the first place... Has someone else experienced this or mabye has any advice how to resolve this? Any help would be appreciated. </p><p>Kind regards Fabian </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1210;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",trefail

Firefox advised that none of my saved data and settings would be lost. Well, my entire profile is gone!!! Thankfully synchronizing worked such that I could recover passwords, history etc. What are NOT recovered are the settings for websites, probably other infos too. </p><p>I have two login-accounts on my system and I have a shared, common profile for both. This was using a public folder with access rights only for those two users. </p><p>I have been using that profile architecture for months. This is now gone!! Those folders do not exist anymore. In its place are entirely new folders, their formats completely unfamiliar to me.
