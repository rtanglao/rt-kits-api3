The annual NORAD Santa Tracker website does not function properly under Firefox. While there are no issues with the 3D rendering itself, the 3D map is squished vertically toward the left side of the page. It appears to be defaulting to a mobile browser view. The only extension I have installed is uBlock Origin, and I turned it off for the NORAD Santa website, and the display issue persists. </p><p>Opening the site under Safari shows the Santa tracker taking up the entire browser window as it should do. </p><p>I'm currently on Mac OS Sonoma using the latest version of Firefox 121.0 </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;website-breakages;firefox-1210;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",wb8979
