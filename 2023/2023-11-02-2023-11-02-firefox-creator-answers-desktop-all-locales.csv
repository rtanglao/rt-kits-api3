I can watch the first short and scroll to the second but trying to scroll past that causes the video to jump back up to the first video.

I can see the first five emails on the list but if I try to scroll further it jumps back up to the first five.  I have tried refreshing Firefox and I have tried using the trouble shooting option under help and the scroll issues still happened in both.  I have this issue on my laptop as well as this desktop and I even installed a different browser and in that browser scrolling works fine in both Youtube and the web based email client.

I have tried all the options recommended over internet in this regard by Mozilla forum and others but nothing had worked for me. Even adding of any third party add-ons also remain defunct in this latest Mozilla Firefox browser.

I click on agree (any button that would let me proceed) and the upgrade took place (without restarting). Along with the upgrade Firefox was also updated to its latest version at the time (119.0). Since then, videos on Twitter play but without sound. On some other websites also none of the videos play. On YouTube, Firefox shows me a message saying ""To play video, you may need to install the required video codecs"" but the videos play fine; I haven't tried other websites but I assume all would have some issues. Google Chrome however doesn't have this issue and all videos play without any issues. </p><p>Note that I have not restarted my computer since the upgrade. I doubt this could be an issue but please let me know if you think this could be the issue. </p><p>I did the followings and restarted Firefox but none have worked so far for Twitter and some other random websites that I come across, but they resolved the issue for YouTube and now YouTube videos play, although I still get that codec message at the top of the tab: </p><p>sudo apt-get install ffmpeg sudo apt install ubuntu-restricted-extras sudo apt install libavcodec-extra </p><p>Someone told me this is because the default Firefox on Ubuntu 22 comes as a snap package and I should install the APT package manually instead so that it works. I prefer not to do this because I have lots of tabs open and have manually changed lots of the settings (including in about:config) that I want to preserve. I would also like to preserve the history of visited websites and keep the current cookies (don't really want to keep entering username/password on the same websites again).

Trouble paying my bill on verizon.com,"<p>Starting in August 2023, paying my Verizon (landline) bill has been a headache. That month I was unable to even log into <a href=""http://verizon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">verizon.com</a> with Firefox.  Curiously, the Opera browser (Blink) fared even worse. Eventually I realized that I could log in and seemingly have full functionality when spoofing as Chrome.  I don't know what they f**ked up, but it must have been bad. </p><p>Since my September bill, I have been able to log in, but the page style is messed-up nearly to the point of non-functionality.  See the images below.  The header and footer of the ""Payment is Due"" page render normally.  The middle section with billing information renders normally for a moment, then <em>something </em>happens...I'm assuming it's a JavaScript event...and the styling is lost. Clicking the Make Payment link then causes what should be a DHTML ""popup"" to instead render at the bottom of the page. The page scrolls down a little, but it's easy to miss the first time around. Knowing this now, I can continue paying my bill, but for non-technical users it's likely a nonstarter.  Previously the payment process worked flawlessly for over two years. </p><p>I am in touch with their ""Executive Customer Service"", which tells me Verizon's web developers cannot duplicate this issue...which I think is a lie.  I can duplicate the problem in Firefox ESR 115.4.0 (Linux) and the latest/last versions for Windows 7, including Waterfox G6.0, most with a very stock configuration (i.e. no LibreWolf). </p><p>Would anybody with a Verizon account please tell me if the bill payment process works normally for you?  I assume my service being a landline makes no difference.  There are several pages before actually sending a payment, and only the first page is relevant to this post. </p><p>I did a little web development years ago, but the current Verizon site is a bloated mess.  I think they even track mouse movements, causing uBlock Origin to SCREAM.  If this issue doesn't resolve on the Verizon side I will eventually solve it myself.  If any non-Verizon customers have troubleshooting suggestions, though, I am open to ideas.  So far I installed the Luminous addon JavaScript event troubleshooter, but haven't had time to learn it. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1615597;,tao101

But I see that most of those problems have been archived, so I cannot add to them. I am currently using the latest version of Firefox 119.0. </p><p>I'm also using Windows 11's feature of Display Scaling to 125%. This zooming is independent of Firefox's page zoom. I have included various screenshots of various configurations of the two scaling/zoom features to show the cropping effect. </p><p>Firefox Screenshot tool of a selected area: - Screenshot #1 - Windows 11 Display Scaling 100% (no zoom) and Firefox page zoom 100% (no zoom), no cropping - Screenshot #2 - Windows 11 Display Scaling 125% only, cropping on right and bottom - Screenshot #3 - Windows 11 Display Scaling 125% and Firefox page zoom 80%, no cropping - Screenshot #4 - Windows 11 Display Scaling 100% (no zoom) and Firefox page zoom 120%, cropping on right and bottom </p><p>Firefox Screenshot tool of full page: - Screenshot #5 - Windows 11 Display Scaling 100% (no zoom) and Firefox page zoom 100% (no zoom), no cropping - Screenshot #6 - Windows 11 Display Scaling 125% only, cropping on right and bottom compared to what I see on the screen - Screenshot #7 - Windows 11 Display Scaling 125% and Firefox page zoom 80%, no cropping - Screenshot #8 - Windows 11 Display Scaling 100% (no zoom) and Firefox page zoom 120%, cropping on right and bottom compared to what I see on the screen - Screenshot #9 - Windows 11 Display Scaling 100% (no zoom) and Firefox page zoom 80%, no cropping but transparent padding added to the right and bottom of the image </p><p>Curiously, I also noticed a difference in the image dimensions of the full page screenshots, whereas there were no dimension differences for the partial/selected area screenshots: - Screenshot #5 - 2560x1307 - Screenshot #6 - 2050x1080 (strange dimensions, i tried again later after various Display Scaling and page zooming and I got 2050x1082) - Screenshot #7 - 2560x1274 (strangely it's almost but not the exact same size of the no zoom) - Screenshot #8 - 2133x1089 (which is exactly 2560x1307 divided by the zoom of 120%) - Screenshot #9 - 3198x1631 (which is almost but not exactly 2560x1307 divided by the zoom of 80%, checking in the Photoshop, the non-padded part of the image does measure 2560x1307) </p><p>Why is this change in dimensions occurring? I would have assumed that when someone zooms in or out this would affect the viewable webpage with some elements shifting around at times, and when they screenshot it, they want what's viewed captured exactly. As such for the full page screenshots, i would have expected them all to have the same width at least, as there is no horizontal scrolling involved only possible changes in the vertical dimension would occur. Or is this all an effect of the zoomed screenshot cropping bug? </p><p>So i guess I have issues with cropping and a potential issue with zoomed-in (and Windows 11 Display Scale enlarged) full page screenshots not being the true viewed dimensions. There's also an issue of image padding when zoomed-out enough. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1190;,firefox,other,en-US,"",icyicecream
