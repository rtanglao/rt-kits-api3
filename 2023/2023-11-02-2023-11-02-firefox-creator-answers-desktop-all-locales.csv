1429741,2023-11-01 21:57:08 -0700,2023-11-01 21:57:08 -0700,Anybody a Verizon customer?  Trouble paying my bill on verizon.com,"<p>Starting in August 2023, paying my Verizon (landline) bill has been a headache. That month I was unable to even log into <a href=""http://verizon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">verizon.com</a> with Firefox.  Curiously, the Opera browser (Blink) fared even worse. Eventually I realized that I could log in and seemingly have full functionality when spoofing as Chrome.  I don't know what they f**ked up, but it must have been bad. </p><p>Since my September bill, I have been able to log in, but the page style is messed-up nearly to the point of non-functionality.  See the images below.  The header and footer of the ""Payment is Due"" page render normally.  The middle section with billing information renders normally for a moment, then <em>something </em>happens...I'm assuming it's a JavaScript event...and the styling is lost. Clicking the Make Payment link then causes what should be a DHTML ""popup"" to instead render at the bottom of the page. The page scrolls down a little, but it's easy to miss the first time around. Knowing this now, I can continue paying my bill, but for non-technical users it's likely a nonstarter.  Previously the payment process worked flawlessly for over two years. </p><p>I am in touch with their ""Executive Customer Service"", which tells me Verizon's web developers cannot duplicate this issue...which I think is a lie.  I can duplicate the problem in Firefox ESR 115.4.0 (Linux) and the latest/last versions for Windows 7, including Waterfox G6.0, most with a very stock configuration (i.e. no LibreWolf). </p><p>Would anybody with a Verizon account please tell me if the bill payment process works normally for you?  I assume my service being a landline makes no difference.  There are several pages before actually sending a payment, and only the first page is relevant to this post. </p><p>I did a little web development years ago, but the current Verizon site is a bloated mess.  I think they even track mouse movements, causing uBlock Origin to SCREAM.  If this issue doesn't resolve on the Verizon side I will eventually solve it myself.  If any non-Verizon customers have troubleshooting suggestions, though, I am open to ideas.  So far I installed the Luminous addon JavaScript event troubleshooter, but haven't had time to learn it. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",tao101

But I see that most of those problems have been archived, so I cannot add to them. I am currently using the latest version of Firefox 119.0. </p><p>I'm also using Windows 11's feature of Display Scaling to 125%. This zooming is independent of Firefox's page zoom. I have included various screenshots of various configurations of the two scaling/zoom features to show the cropping effect. </p><p>Firefox Screenshot tool of a selected area: - Screenshot #1 - Windows 11 Display Scaling 100% (no zoom) and Firefox page zoom 100% (no zoom), no cropping - Screenshot #2 - Windows 11 Display Scaling 125% only, cropping on right and bottom - Screenshot #3 - Windows 11 Display Scaling 125% and Firefox page zoom 80%, no cropping - Screenshot #4 - Windows 11 Display Scaling 100% (no zoom) and Firefox page zoom 120%, cropping on right and bottom </p><p>Firefox Screenshot tool of full page: - Screenshot #5 - Windows 11 Display Scaling 100% (no zoom) and Firefox page zoom 100% (no zoom), no cropping - Screenshot #6 - Windows 11 Display Scaling 125% only, cropping on right and bottom compared to what I see on the screen - Screenshot #7 - Windows 11 Display Scaling 125% and Firefox page zoom 80%, no cropping - Screenshot #8 - Windows 11 Display Scaling 100% (no zoom) and Firefox page zoom 120%, cropping on right and bottom compared to what I see on the screen - Screenshot #9 - Windows 11 Display Scaling 100% (no zoom) and Firefox page zoom 80%, no cropping but transparent padding added to the right and bottom of the image </p><p>Curiously, I also noticed a difference in the image dimensions of the full page screenshots, whereas there were no dimension differences for the partial/selected area screenshots: - Screenshot #5 - 2560x1307 - Screenshot #6 - 2050x1080 (strange dimensions, i tried again later after various Display Scaling and page zooming and I got 2050x1082) - Screenshot #7 - 2560x1274 (strangely it's almost but not the exact same size of the no zoom) - Screenshot #8 - 2133x1089 (which is exactly 2560x1307 divided by the zoom of 120%) - Screenshot #9 - 3198x1631 (which is almost but not exactly 2560x1307 divided by the zoom of 80%, checking in the Photoshop, the non-padded part of the image does measure 2560x1307) </p><p>Why is this change in dimensions occurring? I would have assumed that when someone zooms in or out this would affect the viewable webpage with some elements shifting around at times, and when they screenshot it, they want what's viewed captured exactly. As such for the full page screenshots, i would have expected them all to have the same width at least, as there is no horizontal scrolling involved only possible changes in the vertical dimension would occur. Or is this all an effect of the zoomed screenshot cropping bug? </p><p>So i guess I have issues with cropping and a potential issue with zoomed-in (and Windows 11 Display Scale enlarged) full page screenshots not being the true viewed dimensions. There's also an issue of image padding when zoomed-out enough. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1190;,firefox,other,en-US,"",icyicecream
