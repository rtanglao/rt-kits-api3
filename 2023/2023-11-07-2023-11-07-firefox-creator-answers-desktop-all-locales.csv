In Rundeck for example you can ""follow"" the output of playbooks that are running so you can dynamically see the log as it is written. The autoscrolling in this field has stopped working. When manually scrolling in the field, more messages appear but the autoscrolling is no longer functional. I have also seen it on other places, though I don't have remember good examples to add, so I don't believe it is Rundeck causing the issue--we also haven't updated rundeck recently in our environment, so it shouldn't have changed since before 119.0 was released.
