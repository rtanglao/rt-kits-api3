I used to type ""g"" in order to go to <a href=""http://github.com"" rel=""nofollow"">github.com</a>, but now it leads me to <a href=""http://git.net-core.org"" rel=""nofollow"">git.net-core.org</a> first. I have to finish typing the ""l"" or manually navigate to it in the address bar, and it breaks the workflow. I don't want to remove <a href=""http://git.net"" rel=""nofollow"">git.net</a>-core from my history as I also need to visit it occasionally, but I want autocomplete to prioritize <a href=""http://github.com"" rel=""nofollow"">github.com</a> over it. How would I go about accomplishing this? </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1190;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",jackiecrazyhi

When I say ""hang"", I mean that the entire tab becomes unresponsive to my clicks, I can't refresh the page, I couldn't change the address bar to a different link (it would allow me to manipulate the address bar, but the browser wouldn't reflect on that change, instead just going to the link I had clicked before the hang after the 10 second delay) and my mouse just stays as one sprite/disappears all together (when on the tab). </p><p>I find that this isn't a full browser issue as I can easily just start another tab and try there, but this issue is prevalent in that it randomly hangs any one tab I'm using for 10 seconds, and it's not just with Google. </p><p>I've identified that it isn't an extension issue or a different tab being used (tested in troubleshoot mode),  nor an accessibility issue (as far as I know). I've disabled both my firewall and antivirus temporarily and it still occurred. </p><p>It's gotten in the way of a lot of work and I haven't been able to find anything regarding this exact problem on the support site. I've been dealing with it since my first installation of firefox (a few months ago). </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1190;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",MrInsertName
