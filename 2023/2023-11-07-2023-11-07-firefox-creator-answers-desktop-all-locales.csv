I had previously set Firefox to prompt me for updates because they could disrupt my work on the old Mac. It worked fine up to 118 point something. Up to my ears recently in urgent other stuff, I deferred the prompt for 119. Then, frazzled, I just closed several 119 prompts. Today, after helping my wife use her account on the M2, I found in my Dock's active apps area an icon for something like Updater something-or-other.

No Chrome eu consigo alterar para qualquer valor, mesmo que a impressão saia cortada, porém ao que percebi o Firefox me limita para que a impressão não fuja do papel. O problema surge em alguns casos que preciso que a impressão ""fuja"" da tela, por exemplo um fornecedor me envia um boleto em PDF, porém este PDF já está feito em uma escala reduzida, algo em torno de 70%. No Chrome eu aumento a escala para 120% e o boleto fica do tamanho normal. porém no Firefox eu não consigo deixar maior que ~70%, mesmo colocando a opção para valores altos como 200%. já experimentei configurações de margens diversas mas nada me permite imprimir de forma correta. </p><p>Estou anexando alguns prints exemplificando a situação </p>",desktop;customize;windows-81;firefox-11540;firefox-1154;,firefox,customize,pt-BR,"",vitor41197

I have to finish typing the ""l"" or manually navigate to it in the address bar, and it breaks the workflow.

When I say ""hang"", I mean that the entire tab becomes unresponsive to my clicks, I can't refresh the page, I couldn't change the address bar to a different link (it would allow me to manipulate the address bar, but the browser wouldn't reflect on that change, instead just going to the link I had clicked before the hang after the 10 second delay) and my mouse just stays as one sprite/disappears all together (when on the tab). </p><p>I find that this isn't a full browser issue as I can easily just start another tab and try there, but this issue is prevalent in that it randomly hangs any one tab I'm using for 10 seconds, and it's not just with Google. </p><p>I've identified that it isn't an extension issue or a different tab being used (tested in troubleshoot mode),  nor an accessibility issue (as far as I know). I've disabled both my firewall and antivirus temporarily and it still occurred. </p><p>It's gotten in the way of a lot of work and I haven't been able to find anything regarding this exact problem on the support site.
