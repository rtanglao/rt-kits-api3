For context, I'm using a computer given to me by my college because my personal laptop gave up the ghost a while ago. It has a lot of security programs installed on it and I am obviously not allowed to mess with those at all, as my account doesn't have the permissions. Here are some of the problems I've been having: </p> <ul><li> always signed out of my firefox account on relaunch (no options enabled that would cause this) </li><li> always logged out of specific websites on relaunch (primarily noticed with discord) </li><li> addon windows never load </li><li> addons don't work, even when enabled, and after uninstall and reinstalling </li></ul> <p>I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox also, but nothing seemed to fix these problems. The only thing that stopped happening was being signed out of my Firefox account on relaunch but I have no idea what was causing it or what stopped it. </p><p>Now, in an attempt to fix the problems I was having with addons, I refreshed my Firefox. So far I haven't done anything to it other than sign into my Firefox account. Upon trying to reinstall my addons, I got errors like this: ""An unexpected error occurred during installation.""  and ""UBlock Origin could not be installed because Firefox cannot modify the needed file."" For reference, here's all the addons I had installed before I refreshed: Tranquility Reader, HTTPS Everywhere, Better TTV, Shinigami Eyes, UBlock Origin, Windscribe, Enhancer for Youtube, Dark Reader, and Bitwarden. I tried installing UBlock Origin, Enhancer for Youtube, and Bitwarden, and got the exact same errors every time. I'm really lost on what to do. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,customize,en-US,1568428;1568431;1568434;1568436;,elisha312

It works when logging in to Firefox, but when used in the change password area it tells me the password is not correct. I am at a loss what to try next. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1568422;1568441;,olivermartin410
