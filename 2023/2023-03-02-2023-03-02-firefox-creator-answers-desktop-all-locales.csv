After doing this, I logged out and attempted to log back in. </p><p>Strangely, the log in page appeared more as a ""create account"" page, that is to say, it asked for an email, my full name, and to create a password.  </p><p>I called support while still sitting on the page, we reasoned that if I tired to ""create account"" with my existing email that I was using, logically, i would get an error saying that I already had an account using that email, so I continued and to my surprise--I logged in. </p><p>However, I cannot view any of my personal information, nor the items I had saved in my cart or any type of payment information. </p><p>Mind you, I had an conflict with the Feb update to Firefox and Walmart which was similar except that I can see the image of a cart on the cart and purchase history page, at that time there were no images, but it seemed to sort itself out over a couple of hours. </p><p>As with that error, I logged into Walmart with Chrome, using the new password and am able to view all my information. I can also log into the ap with my new password, and view all my information. I simply can't log into it with Firefox and see anything, it's almost as if did create a new accoiunt, except that I can log in with the new password and view all my information in Chrome and the ap on myh phone. </p><p>To sum it up, I changed the password in Firefox, the new password works in all three cases except in Firefox I cannot view my personal information. </p><p>I do not have a screenshot of the page when I first tried to log back in with Firefox, though it was odd and somewhat unexpected.d The only way to change my password now is in Chrome, or the ap, so I cannot say if that screen would appear again or not or what would happen. </p><p>Nevertheless, I understand that <a href=""http://Walmart.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Walmart.com</a> has become a ""known issue"" for a lot of people. I contacted, supposedly, their IT support and was told that it would probably fix itself, more or less. </p><p>Still, I thought to post this just in case. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,other,en-US,"",springheel

For context, I'm using a computer given to me by my college because my personal laptop gave up the ghost a while ago. It has a lot of security programs installed on it and I am obviously not allowed to mess with those at all, as my account doesn't have the permissions. Here are some of the problems I've been having: </p> <ul><li> always signed out of my firefox account on relaunch (no options enabled that would cause this) </li><li> always logged out of specific websites on relaunch (primarily noticed with discord) </li><li> addon windows never load </li><li> addons don't work, even when enabled, and after uninstall and reinstalling </li></ul> <p>I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox also, but nothing seemed to fix these problems. The only thing that stopped happening was being signed out of my Firefox account on relaunch but I have no idea what was causing it or what stopped it. </p><p>Now, in an attempt to fix the problems I was having with addons, I refreshed my Firefox. So far I haven't done anything to it other than sign into my Firefox account. Upon trying to reinstall my addons, I got errors like this: ""An unexpected error occurred during installation.""  and ""UBlock Origin could not be installed because Firefox cannot modify the needed file."" For reference, here's all the addons I had installed before I refreshed: Tranquility Reader, HTTPS Everywhere, Better TTV, Shinigami Eyes, UBlock Origin, Windscribe, Enhancer for Youtube, Dark Reader, and Bitwarden. I tried installing UBlock Origin, Enhancer for Youtube, and Bitwarden, and got the exact same errors every time. I'm really lost on what to do. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,customize,en-US,1568428;1568431;1568434;1568436;,elisha312
