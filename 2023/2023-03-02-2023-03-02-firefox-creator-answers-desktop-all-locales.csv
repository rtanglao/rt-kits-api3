When I go to the change password area of my profile, I type in my existing password, and the new one, and then it says ""Incorrect Password"" every time. I know that I am typing it correctly, and I have even used the exact same password to login to this very device, and my mobile device, to double and triple check I have it right. It works when logging in to Firefox, but when used in the change password area it tells me the password is not correct. I am at a loss what to try next. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",olivermartin410
