The account had an add-on with over 1,000 downloads. Is there any way to recover my previous account using the email associated with it? I am curious as to why Firefox doesn't offer email-based account recovery. </p>",desktop;sync;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1100;,firefox,sync,en-US,1568421;,davenguyen179

When I go to the change password area of my profile, I type in my existing password, and the new one, and then it says ""Incorrect Password"" every time. I know that I am typing it correctly, and I have even used the exact same password to login to this very device, and my mobile device, to double and triple check I have it right. It works when logging in to Firefox, but when used in the change password area it tells me the password is not correct. I am at a loss what to try next. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1568422;,olivermartin410
