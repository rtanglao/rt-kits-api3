It was late so I didn't comb my history for the tabs. I do however, transfer all the tabs I had open on my phone to my PC. about 60-ish tabs (I have a problem yes). </p><p>Then today my house has a power outage, shutting off my PC and when i turn it on i see... no 'restore previous session' button to use. After having a cry, I combed my search history and restored all of yesterday's tabs, which was thankfully easy to do because i only had to comb through yesterday's search history. The ""Restore Previous Session"" tool seems broken to me. </p><p>But to comb through all my history for my previous session's tabs, I have to use the 'Manage History' window. I have some problems with this. -  the history list Columns and Sorting are too basic i.e. It has no ""when tab closed"" tag, so i can't clearly see all the tabs that closed at once. - No way to separate which device's search history, my phone's history is mixed in with my PC's, making it super messy. - I can't highlight and open multiple tabs at once, making reopening dozens of tabs very tedious. </p><p>- Firefox can 'sync' my tabs and history, but i would like to be able to have both devices have the EXACT same tabs open, like 2 devices accessing the same browser terminal. If it were this way, my tabs would never be out of my sight and both devices would have to be messed with to really lose the session. Can this be done? </p><p>Something has clearly gone wrong for my computer to be shut down and for the 'Restore previous Session' button not be available. I am a uni student and i am worried i may lose dozens of important research tabs at once - multiple times - because of what looks like a technical issue with no elegant work around. </p><p>Please help me out. At the very least please tell me how I can see WHEN my tabs closed so I can IDENTIFY them at an easy glance. </p><p>Sorry for the long note, losing around 50 tabs, twice, shook me to my core. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",kalidann

After reinstalling Windows, I installed Firefox on my new system and attempted to retrieve my saved pages. While browsing through the settings, I discovered a backup recovery button in the bookmarks section and assumed it would restore my previous session in Firefox. Unfortunately, this action deleted all my saved bookmarks and set them to the default settings. </p><p>I am extremely disappointed and upset about losing all of my bookmarks, and I am hoping that you can assist me in recovering them. Additionally, I have been unable to locate any method of restoring my saved pages, and I would appreciate your advice on this matter as well. </p><p>Please let me know if there is anything that I can do to retrieve my lost bookmarks and recover my saved pages. Thank you in advance for your assistance. </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>Pavlo </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1568494;1568510;,riabenko.p

After doing this, I logged out and attempted to log back in. </p><p>Strangely, the log in page appeared more as a ""create account"" page, that is to say, it asked for an email, my full name, and to create a password.  </p><p>I called support while still sitting on the page, we reasoned that if I tired to ""create account"" with my existing email that I was using, logically, i would get an error saying that I already had an account using that email, so I continued and to my surprise--I logged in. </p><p>However, I cannot view any of my personal information, nor the items I had saved in my cart or any type of payment information. </p><p>Mind you, I had an conflict with the Feb update to Firefox and Walmart which was similar except that I can see the image of a cart on the cart and purchase history page, at that time there were no images, but it seemed to sort itself out over a couple of hours. </p><p>As with that error, I logged into Walmart with Chrome, using the new password and am able to view all my information. I can also log into the ap with my new password, and view all my information. I simply can't log into it with Firefox and see anything, it's almost as if did create a new accoiunt, except that I can log in with the new password and view all my information in Chrome and the ap on myh phone. </p><p>To sum it up, I changed the password in Firefox, the new password works in all three cases except in Firefox I cannot view my personal information. </p><p>I do not have a screenshot of the page when I first tried to log back in with Firefox, though it was odd and somewhat unexpected.d The only way to change my password now is in Chrome, or the ap, so I cannot say if that screen would appear again or not or what would happen. </p><p>Nevertheless, I understand that <a href=""http://Walmart.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Walmart.com</a> has become a ""known issue"" for a lot of people. I contacted, supposedly, their IT support and was told that it would probably fix itself, more or less. </p><p>Still, I thought to post this just in case. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,other,en-US,1568491;,springheel
