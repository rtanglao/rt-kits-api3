I would like an EASY way to see the name of the Firefox profile somewhere on the screen.  The attached image shows a theme I created which shows the name of the profile on the menu bar.  I forgot exactly how I did it, but it involved typing this in a Word document, taking a screenshot and turning it into a jpeg, crop the image, upload it as a theme, then test it.  Repeated several times until I got it to work. </p><p>I don't need or want fancy graphics here.  I just need the name of the Firefox profile to appear somewhere in the window.  In my fantasy world, there would be an option to include this name in the window Title bar. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",dan400man1

This is a very similar question to <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1408631"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1408631</a> </p><p>I have a significant number of Linux workstations (mix of Fedora 37, Redhat 6.10 extended support, Redhat 7) each with Firefox installed.  Most of the Firefox versions are 78.5 with a few 60.3, 68.12, 78.4. </p><p>I need to distribute a custom root CA cert to the Firefox cert store.  I can't find a good answer to how to do this. A pointer to the steps would be really appreciated. </p><p>This will need to be automated (puppet, ansible, salt or similar). Do I just copy the cert to some central location on each workstation and that effectively makes it consulted by every user account's Firefox on that machine? Or do I need to copy to a file specific to each user?  Or both? </p><p>Many thanks </p><p>Will. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",ocarina-anchovy-04
