This is a very similar question to <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1408631"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1408631</a> </p><p>I have a significant number of Linux workstations (mix of Fedora 37, Redhat 6.10 extended support, Redhat 7) each with Firefox installed.  Most of the Firefox versions are 78.5 with a few 60.3, 68.12, 78.4. </p><p>I need to distribute a custom root CA cert to the Firefox cert store.  I can't find a good answer to how to do this. A pointer to the steps would be really appreciated. </p><p>This will need to be automated (puppet, ansible, salt or similar). Do I just copy the cert to some central location on each workstation and that effectively makes it consulted by every user account's Firefox on that machine? Or do I need to copy to a file specific to each user?  Or both? </p><p>Many thanks </p><p>Will. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",ocarina-anchovy-04
