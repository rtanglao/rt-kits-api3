I use DuckDuckGo as my home page and new tab page.  It is annoying to have to click on the search field that I want to use.  Using the address bar puts a slight strain on my neck. </p><p>One excuse from SeanaMuigean in the aforementioned article (1334131) is that all of the other search engines are doing it.  My guess is that they do this because it allows the browser to track one's searches.  If Firefox is doing this it seems like a very large issue. </p><p>I have set awesomebar to False and that seemed to work for a while but no longer.
