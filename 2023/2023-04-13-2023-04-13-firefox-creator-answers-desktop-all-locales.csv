I get in both cases a ""failed to load Javascript"" error messages, failing to load the ""chunk 5016797"" in mail, and the ""chunk 917352"" in calendar. Refreshing the tabs, restarting FF, restarting the computer, restarting FF in troubleshooting mode (no extensions) as suggested in an existing thread on this topic, updating FF and updating Windows (still Win8.1, though), didn't help. I access normally both mail and calendar in Chrome, but want to keep and use FF as my main browser. Can you help fixing this JS issue&nbsp;?

I'm  not sure why or whats causing it, but my YouTube never loads fast, or hardly at all. Usually the video only loads/buffers till about 1 min into any given video. Mind you this is only on 720p or 1080p HD. I never go any higher and my internet speed is ~400Mbps down and ~22Mbps up. I've already tried the following: </p><p>1. Disable Hardware Acceleration 2. Clear Cache and Cookies 3. Refresh Firefox 4. Check HTML 5 Video Player 5. Made sure Firefox was updated </p><p>I do use some extensions like: - Dark Reader - Privacy Badger - uBlock Origin - Bitwarden (Shouldn't affect) - Honey (Isn't turned on for YouTube) - Enhancer for YouTube (New, so it does not affect load) </p><p>Any Suggestions? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1120;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1575277;,barbrow.caleb
