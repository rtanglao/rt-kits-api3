Websites ask to accept cookies every time Firefox is restarted, which makes them basically useless. I have to use phone authentication each time I want to check gmail on my desktop because the site acts as if it had never seen me before. </p><p>Firefox's safe mode is the same. I ran the antivirus on the whole system and it found nothing. Windows clock works fine. Other Firefox functions seem to behave like normal. Other browsers are unaffected. </p><p>I filed a bug report and I'm thinking about trying the last extended support version to see if it still happens. I backed up the whole profile and I would like to keep all my data, including the cookies. </p><p>So, what can I do to try and get this fixed fast, and possibly keep my cookies, too? Thank you very much! </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-10;,firefox,cookies,en-US,"",dslayer

I currently use Firefox Developer Edition, but it has some problem: At random times, a background process starts and begins to use an absurd amount of CPU. I have a really good CPU and this issue still occurs when I start my laptop without even unlocking it yet. </p><p>I'm thinking it has something to do with an update service, but I already tried disabling automatic updates and updated to the last version. I even deleted all add-ons, but it didn't help at all. </p><p>There is a strange folder in the installation folder named ""tobedeleted"", which gets automatically created. I don't think it is some virus because viruses would've aimed for Firefox and not the Developer Edition, which is a completely separate install. I didn't have this problem about 2 versions of Developer Edition earlier so I don't think it's my system config or antivirus/firewall. </p><p>The issue is very strange and annoying, I've tried reinstalling, deleting and removing leftover folders on the whole disk but the issue still persists. I even did a Firefox Refresh multiple times, but nothing seems to work. </p><p>I would be very thankful if this problem gets solved and I'd love to help you guys analyze the situation because I really like the Developer Edition. I have a lot of experience with programming and computers in general so I could do some debugging. </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p><p>Greetings, </p><p>Rein (rdeboer2004@gmail.com) </p>",desktop;beta;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1130;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",rdeboer2004

Clear Cache and Cookies 3. Refresh Firefox 4. Check HTML 5 Video Player 5. Made sure Firefox was updated </p><p>I do use some extensions like: - Dark Reader - Privacy Badger - uBlock Origin - Bitwarden (Shouldn't affect) - Honey (Isn't turned on for YouTube) - Enhancer for YouTube (New, so it does not affect load) </p><p>Any Suggestions? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1120;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1575277;,barbrow.caleb
