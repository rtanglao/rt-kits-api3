This only happens when I open Chrome. FireFox hasn't become unresponsive like the system resources are being used up and like it has frozen but it is just all of the tabs I want to view have the dot flipping back and forth trying to load the websites. My only way to fix this is to reboot my PC and open FireFox but not open Chrome at all and then FireFox works fine and loads everything quickly as expected but as soon as I open Chrome (which works fine even if FireFox is open) this issue starts. It doesn't fix it is I completed force close Chrome either and it will only work again if I reboot the PC. This has only just started happening over the past few days though so I am wondering if some sort of updat has occurred which has broken things as previously I could use both broswers no problem. </p>,desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",FoxyFox00

Such as Yandex reverse image search for example.  </p><p>Why does firefox behave like that and how to disable it? </p><p>To investigate the issue her is a sample clipboard event handler that can take image from clipboard: <a href=""https://pastebin.com/KNKfPGcy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pastebin.com/KNKfPGcy</a> </p><p>If HEAD request gets 403 response then this clipboard code will cause the following to be posted instead of image:  &lt;Error&gt;<code>AccessDenied</code>&lt;Message&gt;Access Denied&lt;/Message&gt;&lt;RequestId&gt;6HRMZAKJPFCNZ6QS&lt;/RequestId&gt;&lt;HostId&gt;ANuZElpxuSerm5iGttCRay/SCAaDuc3Qv1WPxJGHQRJqsGISjyxxG68EFtw9xHDdgnmqtuAZqsg=&lt;/HostId&gt;&lt;/Error&gt; </p><p>This situation can happen for example when I open image on new tab and then the server removes image or link gets expired and then I want to copy this image. It causes annoyance where when I want to paste it to some other web site I first have to paste it in MS Paint and then select all and copy in MS paint to finally get image that I can freely paste everywhere. </p><p>Seems like this is some deliberately made user hostile behavior in Firefox.  How can I disable it? And besides, isn't it a privacy concern when every time I click Copy Image server is notified? I mean someone else should not know that I am about to copy their image. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1170;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",wybqogzigoxruxdhnp
