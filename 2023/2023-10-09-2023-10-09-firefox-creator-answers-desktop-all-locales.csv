Specifically, just searching things takes 5-10 seconds to fully load the page. Opening a YouTube video has me sitting there for 15-60 seconds just watching the loading thing just spin and spin (once the video starts, I can load 4K60fps+ video perfectly fine), I can't even consistently access my bank account website because it's so incredibly slow. Most general websites take 10+ seconds to just load when they normally wouldn't. My internet is 400 down/10 up, in case you were wondering. </p><p>I've contacted PIA's support over the course of many many months, multiple times, and they are about as helpful as a cockroach you find upside down in the middle of your floor. I've tried messing with every setting on the app and have narrowed it down to the split tunnel feature of the app. Telling this to PIA support does nothing, they just go ""glad you found what the issue is"" without helping me fix it. I don't want my <strong>entire</strong> computer under the VPN, which is why split tunnel (and reverse split tunnel) is important to me. I specifically have Firefox (and Firefox Dev) as set to bypass the VPN, and that's how I get the aforementioned issues. </p><p>The reason I feel like this is a Firefox-specific issue is that this only happens with Firefox. (and Firefox Dev) I've tried Chrome, Edge, even (<em>shudder</em>) Opera GX, put them as bypass on the PIA app, and have no issues loading anything. Searches are instant, YT videos don't even load, they just start playing immediately, there are no issues. </p><p>Note that when I set Firefox to <em>use</em> the VPN instead of bypass it, it loads perfectly fine, just a bit slower than normal since the VPN server is in a different country, but it's still much faster than if it was bypassing it. I'm not sure what else to try at this point, I've been slowly using Chrome more and more solely so I don't have to wait so long for every web page to load, and I hate that. I would love for any ideas to be bounced around on what to do, cause I can't find anyone else with this specific issue, nor PIA support being any help. Any ideas would be greatly, greatly appreciated, I've been dealing with this issue for years now. </p>",desktop;beta;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1190;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Dorraj

It doesn't fix it is I completed force close Chrome either and it will only work again if I reboot the PC. This has only just started happening over the past few days though so I am wondering if some sort of updat has occurred which has broken things as previously I could use both broswers no problem. </p>,desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",FoxyFox00

I put its location in one of my files in drive D. I did not know that the profile makes that folder for itself. When I wanted to delete the profile, I clicked the delete all files option to delete the profile files. But it deleted all the files in that folder. I used many software to recover the folder, but it seems that Firefox destroyed the files after deleting them. It was not possible to recover. All my files are damaged. I wanted to ask, do you have a way to solve this problem? Is it possible to recover deleted profile files and information without damage? My files were so important that they were deleted at the same time as the profile was deleted. A lot of photos, videos and audio. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,other,en-US,"",mry.hejazi12

When I right click image and then choose Copy Image it makes HEAD request to server. And then based on that result seems decide how to copy this image. For example if server responds with 403 to this head request I can still paste copied image to MS paint for example. But I can not paste such images to websites. Such as Yandex reverse image search for example.  </p><p>Why does firefox behave like that and how to disable it? </p><p>To investigate the issue her is a sample clipboard event handler that can take image from clipboard: <a href=""https://pastebin.com/KNKfPGcy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pastebin.com/KNKfPGcy</a> </p><p>If HEAD request gets 403 response then this clipboard code will cause the following to be posted instead of image:  &lt;Error&gt;<code>AccessDenied</code>&lt;Message&gt;Access Denied&lt;/Message&gt;&lt;RequestId&gt;6HRMZAKJPFCNZ6QS&lt;/RequestId&gt;&lt;HostId&gt;ANuZElpxuSerm5iGttCRay/SCAaDuc3Qv1WPxJGHQRJqsGISjyxxG68EFtw9xHDdgnmqtuAZqsg=&lt;/HostId&gt;&lt;/Error&gt; </p><p>This situation can happen for example when I open image on new tab and then the server removes image or link gets expired and then I want to copy this image. It causes annoyance where when I want to paste it to some other web site I first have to paste it in MS Paint and then select all and copy in MS paint to finally get image that I can freely paste everywhere. </p><p>Seems like this is some deliberately made user hostile behavior in Firefox.  How can I disable it? And besides, isn't it a privacy concern when every time I click Copy Image server is notified? I mean someone else should not know that I am about to copy their image. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1170;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",wybqogzigoxruxdhnp
