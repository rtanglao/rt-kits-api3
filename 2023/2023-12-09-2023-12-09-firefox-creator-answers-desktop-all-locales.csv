I am writing to bring to your attention an issue I have encountered with CSS styling on Mozilla Firefox. </p><p>I have implemented the following CSS properties on my website to achieve a zoom effect:  body { </p><pre>    zoom: 70%; </pre> <p>} but it is not supported by Firefox. </p><p>I tried this approach:  body{ </p><pre> transform: scale(0.7);  transform-origin: 0 0; </pre> <p>} </p><p>While this approach is supported by Firefox, I am experiencing an unexpected behavior. Instead of a smooth zoom effect, the entire website is zoomed out, and the content is shifted to the left, leaving the right side blank with a white space. </p><p>I have attached a screenshot for your reference. </p><p>I have tried various alternatives, including using the zoom property, but it seems that Firefox does not support it. I am seeking assistance in resolving this issue and ensuring a consistent and smooth zoom effect across different browsers, including Firefox. </p><p>Your guidance and support in resolving this matter would be greatly appreciated. If there are any workarounds or best practices to achieve a zoom effect without causing layout distortions, I would be eager to learn about them. </p><p>Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to your response. </p><p>Best regards, </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",syedalishah8498

Your new browser requires me to log into a facebook account I closed 10 years ago.

So, I no longer want this new upgraded Firefox account.  I want to have my old Firefox account as a default on my desktop.  Right now it's an icon at the bottom of the screen, and I can only use it to open one thing at a time.  Please give me back my old Firefox browser.  I'll struggle with Facebook to get my password to work on my VangiePangie account.  I have access to the VangiePangie account right now, because it was never logged out in my old Firefox browser and is in my Bookmarks.  But if I am forced to log out, or if Facebook does a security check, I won't have access ever again.   Please help me with this.
