Instead of a smooth zoom effect, the entire website is zoomed out, and the content is shifted to the left, leaving the right side blank with a white space. </p><p>I have attached a screenshot for your reference. </p><p>I have tried various alternatives, including using the zoom property, but it seems that Firefox does not support it. I am seeking assistance in resolving this issue and ensuring a consistent and smooth zoom effect across different browsers, including Firefox. </p><p>Your guidance and support in resolving this matter would be greatly appreciated. If there are any workarounds or best practices to achieve a zoom effect without causing layout distortions, I would be eager to learn about them. </p><p>Thank you for your time and assistance.
