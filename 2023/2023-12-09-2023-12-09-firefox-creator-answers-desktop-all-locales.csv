My only issue is that it is extremely cumbersome, with 3 full rotations of the wheel required for a 2x zoom. Is there any way to increase the amount per tick it zooms in by? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",jsbmeyers

Your new browser requires me to log into a facebook account I closed 10 years ago.  My password for my current account named, ""VangiePangie"", now opens a closed account named ""Evangeline Custis"".  I no longer have access to my VangiePangie account with any password.  So, I no longer want this new upgraded Firefox account.  I want to have my old Firefox account as a default on my desktop.  Right now it's an icon at the bottom of the screen, and I can only use it to open one thing at a time.  Please give me back my old Firefox browser.  I'll struggle with Facebook to get my password to work on my VangiePangie account.  I have access to the VangiePangie account right now, because it was never logged out in my old Firefox browser and is in my Bookmarks.  But if I am forced to log out, or if Facebook does a security check, I won't have access ever again.   Please help me with this.  Below is my VangiePangie Profile pic. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,other,en-US,"",angiecustis

At the prompt I enter those, exit Firefox and start Firefox again. When I go to the branch and this time I do not get the username and password prompt and have free access. However, when I do shift-refresh the prompt shows. Apparently Firefox does save something that it shouldn't. Is it a BUG??? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",pieter.vanvliet

I thought it would be as easy as the last time where I'd go click the Restore Session button but it isn't there so I spend two hours looking for solutions and found nothing. I don't know how this happened nor do I understand how this could happen in the first place, my Firefox hasn't crashed in months and I had already closed and re-opened it several time today. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1623077;,raiderleader2004

This has happened several times in the past but after 2 or 3 days it suddenly will start working again!!!  It's been over a week this time and no resolution yet!  Note following LARGE ROTATING X is:  ""The media could not be loaded, either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported."" Same note as in the past but eventually disappears and video works just fine.  The video is a live shot of the Abbey Studio's Crosswalk (ie, the one shown on the cover of a Beetles Album years ago). </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1200;,firefox,other,en-US,1623074;,pfg13

When I bought a new top end PC about a year ago I've started noticing that I have problems with browsing the internet. At first I ignored it, but the problem persisted to this day and now it started driving me nuts. </p><p>When I open a random new website, or a website I haven't visited in a while I get the error message ""Hmm. Weâ€™re having trouble finding that site.""  </p><p>Then I have to refresh the page up to 10+ times, which is incredibly annoying, before it loads properly. </p><p>- my internet connection is stable, as I don't have this problem on my old PC (Windows 7, PC connected to internet with cable directly to modem) - I do not seem to have this issue with the Edge browser on new PC that came with Windows 10. I have not tried using Chrome or any other browsers - I use a Asus RT-AX55 Router, the connection to new PC is with cable. - I  do not use any VPN </p><p>Some people have suggested that this could be an issue with the router's settings, but then why is the issue not present when using Edge? </p><p>Please help and advise what could I possibly do, because I have zero clue whatsoever... </p><p>Thank you kindly! </p><p>With respect, </p><p>-Jerry S. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",Jerry
