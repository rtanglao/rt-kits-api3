When I bought a new top end PC about a year ago I've started noticing that I have problems with browsing the internet. At first I ignored it, but the problem persisted to this day and now it started driving me nuts. </p><p>When I open a random new website, or a website I haven't visited in a while I get the error message ""Hmm. Weâ€™re having trouble finding that site.""  </p><p>Then I have to refresh the page up to 10+ times, which is incredibly annoying, before it loads properly. </p><p>- my internet connection is stable, as I don't have this problem on my old PC (Windows 7, PC connected to internet with cable directly to modem) - I do not seem to have this issue with the Edge browser on new PC that came with Windows 10. I have not tried using Chrome or any other browsers - I use a Asus RT-AX55 Router, the connection to new PC is with cable. - I  do not use any VPN </p><p>Some people have suggested that this could be an issue with the router's settings, but then why is the issue not present when using Edge? </p><p>Please help and advise what could I possibly do, because I have zero clue whatsoever... </p><p>Thank you kindly! </p><p>With respect, </p><p>-Jerry S. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",Jerry
