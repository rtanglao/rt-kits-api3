Specifically - DNS-over-HTTPS,"<p>Hello everyone! </p><p>My use case is that I have pi-hole at home, so I want DNS requests go through it (DoH disabled, DNS reqs go as assigned by DHCP, actually it goes to DoH then). But when I am away from home (i.e. office) I want to have DoH enabled for privacy reasons. </p><p>Is there a way of modifying settings based on location? I guess the simplest way would be to do it with a script that checks my IP - if it's my home IP then disable DoH, otherwise enable. But I don't know how to make it work. </p><p>Can you share any experience in such task? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1090;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",kr.71120

Inutile dire che tutti i tentavi fatti modificando le impostazioni, estensioni e add on di Firefox non hanno avuto esito Un altro sito di banking on line su cui opero invece, funziona perfettamente; anche l'app Android BancoPosta funziona correttamente e la uso correntemente per effettuare quelle operazioni che non posso fare dal pc di casa. </p><p>Faccio questa segnalazione con la speranza di vedere presto risolto il problema descritto o, in alternativa, di avere le informazioni necessarie per ovviare al problema. </p><p>Per ulteriori info o contatto diretto:  ferruccio@anche.no </p><p>Grazie </p><p>ferruccio </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1090;,firefox,website-breakages,it,1561232;,f.gagliardoni

It's annoying that new tabs get created in that small window, because I have to move them manually to another window and resize that. I'd like to be spared the clicks and drags to get that done, or always needing to remember to move the focus to another Firefox window after doing something with the calendar. </p><p>Is there a way to accomplish the following: 1. When I've got a Firefox window open that I don't want new tabs in 2. And I open a link from outside Firefox (say, from a mail in Thunderbird or from my IDE) 3. A new tab doesn't get created in the window from 1. 4. Even if that window has the focus. 5. Instead, the URL gets opened in either a new tab in another Firefox window or a new Firefox window </p><p>I'm fine with a stable add-on, if that's what it takes to do this. </p><p>Any ideas greatly appreciated! </p>",linux;desktop;tabs;firefox-1090;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",sversbk
