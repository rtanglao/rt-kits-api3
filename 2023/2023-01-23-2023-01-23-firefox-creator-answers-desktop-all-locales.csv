I had the same issue a few months ago and it was fixed by turning off hardware acceleration, but that isn't working this time. Have tried: - Reinstalling firefox - In troubleshooting mode - problem is still there - Getting rid of all extensions and themes - Restarting computer - Turning off hardware acceleration </p><p>The only other change is my ESET Antivirus ran out on friday and I only updated it today - could there be something in that that's causing the crash? Don't know what else to try, but I need to save to PDF a lot for work and really don't want to have to switch to Chrome. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1090;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1561205;,emdoubtfire

It's been a week and firefox is still syncing, none of my bookmarks, add-ons, history or top sites on the new tab are showing up.  Thankfully, it appears that most of my passwords have been synced. </p><p>I've read some other threads for tips and can confirm that I don't have this account logged in to other devices and I don't have a vpn or proxy running.  I am able to obtain the sync logs but I have no idea how to read it. </p><p>How can I make the bookmarks, add-ons, history and top sites sync faster? </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1090;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",tsubasa9455

Now your ridiculous download previous version page is very much less than helpful as just keeps trying to get you to load newest (crap/buggy) version. Uninstalled firefox and computer works well again. I've used firefox for long time, but will change to something else if cant access a download for previous version that allows better operation while wait for a perhaps better working newer version. Learned lesson with windows updates over the years, not gonna use your current version of firefox. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1090;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1561189;,nwalker40
