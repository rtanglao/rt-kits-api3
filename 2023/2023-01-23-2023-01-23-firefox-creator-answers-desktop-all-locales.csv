Firefox runs in WS#2, several terminal sessions in WS#1). </p><p>In a terminal window, when I right-click a web URL I get an action menu including an entry ""Open Link"".  Recently the behavior resulting when I select that menu item has changed. </p><p>Prior, Desired Behavior:  My current workspace switches to that containing Firefox, Firefox receives focus and  the URL is opened in a new tab. </p><p>New, Undesired Behavior:  Firefox is moved from its workspace to my current workspace and the URL is opened in a new tab.  I must return Firefox to its ""assigned"" workspace. </p><p>Experimenting suggests the behavior change is due to something in the profile used by Firefox though I'm unable to identify it. </p><p>Other browsers (brave, chrome, firefox from <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a> rather than from the fedora package repo) do not exhibit the new behavior.  Firefox on other systems (some Fedora/mate/compiz, others varying) do not exhibit the new behavior. </p><p>Firefox (from Fedora repos) with all addons (only 7) disabled continues to exhibit the new behavior. </p><p>A new Firefox update today (to 109.0) continues to exhibit the new, undesired behavior. </p><p>As noted above, Firefox from <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a>, does not exhibit the new, undesired behavior.  But that is with a new profile.  If it is started with the profile of the Fedora Firefox, it DOES exhibit the undesired behavior. </p><p>Can someone suggest a setting or profile change to restore the old, desired behavior? </p><p>Tnx, Jon </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1090;,firefox,other,en-US,"",JonLab

It's annoying that new tabs get created in that small window, because I have to move them manually to another window and resize that. I'd like to be spared the clicks and drags to get that done, or always needing to remember to move the focus to another Firefox window after doing something with the calendar. </p><p>Is there a way to accomplish the following: 1. When I've got a Firefox window open that I don't want new tabs in 2. And I open a link from outside Firefox (say, from a mail in Thunderbird or from my IDE) 3. A new tab doesn't get created in the window from 1. 4. Even if that window has the focus. 5. Instead, the URL gets opened in either a new tab in another Firefox window or a new Firefox window </p><p>I'm fine with a stable add-on, if that's what it takes to do this. </p><p>Any ideas greatly appreciated! </p>",linux;desktop;tabs;needsinfo;firefox-1090;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1561280;1561292;1561340;1561347;1561352;,sversbk
