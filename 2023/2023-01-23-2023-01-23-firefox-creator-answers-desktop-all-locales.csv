All i need for now, is a Sync of my configuration (bookmarks and Passwords Manager).

Now your ridiculous download previous version page is very much less than helpful as just keeps trying to get you to load newest (crap/buggy) version. Uninstalled firefox and computer works well again. I've used firefox for long time, but will change to something else if cant access a download for previous version that allows better operation while wait for a perhaps better working newer version. Learned lesson with windows updates over the years, not gonna use your current version of firefox. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1090;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1561189;,nwalker40
