All i need for now, is a Sync of my configuration (bookmarks and Passwords Manager). Firefox should have app in Openstore for Ubuntu touch phones  as its opensource and promotes security. </p><p><br> Regards </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1090;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",mo.ameen

Now your ridiculous download previous version page is very much less than helpful as just keeps trying to get you to load newest (crap/buggy) version. Uninstalled firefox and computer works well again. I've used firefox for long time, but will change to something else if cant access a download for previous version that allows better operation while wait for a perhaps better working newer version. Learned lesson with windows updates over the years, not gonna use your current version of firefox. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1090;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1561189;,nwalker40
