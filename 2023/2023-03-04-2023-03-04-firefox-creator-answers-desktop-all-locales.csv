When I open Firefox it automatically opens. Today, all I get is a white blank page. I have tried turning off all extensions - that did not work.

Then i got a notification saying Firefox is using an unusual amount of your battery in the background. It says Firefox is using 78% of the battery in the background this much drainage from one app can harm the battery. It's suggestion is to kill the background process of Firefox or uninstall it and use another browser. </p><p>I have tried to figure out how to stop it but can't I have found it before in msconfig but its not there. I looked in the start-up process it is not there. I looked in the running apps i found it but it will not let me kill its process it tells me Firefox is a necessary Windows operating system application. I know that is not true. I have read where other people are having this same issue that started with Firefox 109 . </p><p>My Firefox is running 110.0.1 I need to get this to stop running in the background. can anyone please help me figure this out? </p><p>Thank You </p>,desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Mr.Bobcat
