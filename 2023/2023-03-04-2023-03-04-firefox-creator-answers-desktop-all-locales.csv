Recently I was thinking of going back to Firefox for a bit since some extensions I wanted was working on Firefox again so I reinstalled it. After opening Firefox the whole UI is a mess with words having too much spacing between each other everywhere including Google searches, Firefox settings etc. Mozilla's webpage itself and YouTube didn't seem to be broken but that's about the only one sI've seen that is not broken. Haven't really used the browser because of this issue so not sure what other sites don't have the issue. Not sure how to better describe this so I'm attaching a few images, thanks to anyone who's willing to help me with this. </p><p>For a few things I've tried, it was trying to start in safe mode, removing the ~/.mozilla folder and reinstalling firefox. Other than that not sure what to try so any help would be appreciated. </p><p>OS: Arch Linux Firefox version: 110.0.1 </p><p>It's a laptop so it has Intel Integrated graphics along with a GTX 1660Ti Mobile as the dedicated GPU.

Not only that. if I run ookla speed test through this version of the browser its no where near the speed I pay for,  upload is near 789 and download 10.

Then i got a notification saying Firefox is using an unusual amount of your battery in the background. It says Firefox is using 78% of the battery in the background this much drainage from one app can harm the battery. It's suggestion is to kill the background process of Firefox or uninstall it and use another browser. </p><p>I have tried to figure out how to stop it but can't I have found it before in msconfig but its not there. I looked in the start-up process it is not there. I looked in the running apps i found it but it will not let me kill its process it tells me Firefox is a necessary Windows operating system application. I know that is not true. I have read where other people are having this same issue that started with Firefox 109 . </p><p>My Firefox is running 110.0.1 I need to get this to stop running in the background. can anyone please help me figure this out? </p><p>Thank You </p>,desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,other,en-US,1568814;,Mr.Bobcat
