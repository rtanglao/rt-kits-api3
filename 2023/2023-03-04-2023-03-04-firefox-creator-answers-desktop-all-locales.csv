Clean Install Windows 10, 32 gb memory, 1 tb m2 ssd on a ROG Mb 2070 video card </p><p>Since the last update Firefox is slow, it hangs - gives the stupid error code 'this is embarrassing', if you walk away from the terminal to do other work and come back the window freezes, mouse moves everywhere but clicking does nothing. This is more than frustrating because have to re open all the windows waiting. and for you guys information the only thing running is adblock as far as an extension is concerned.  Not only that. if I run ookla speed test through this version of the browser its no where near the speed I pay for,  upload is near 789 and download 10.  If I keep Firefox running and open an Edge page and run the same speed test from edge I get 805 and 39.88 </p><p>What gives, why the heck are you so much slower and why are your updates so often and then causing the thing to hang...&nbsp;?  I am frustrated to the point of now switching out of Firefox, remember Netscape? well you all are fast meeting the same goals .  unreliable and slow. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",michaepr

Then i got a notification saying Firefox is using an unusual amount of your battery in the background. It says Firefox is using 78% of the battery in the background this much drainage from one app can harm the battery. It's suggestion is to kill the background process of Firefox or uninstall it and use another browser. </p><p>I have tried to figure out how to stop it but can't I have found it before in msconfig but its not there. I looked in the start-up process it is not there. I looked in the running apps i found it but it will not let me kill its process it tells me Firefox is a necessary Windows operating system application. I know that is not true. I have read where other people are having this same issue that started with Firefox 109 . </p><p>My Firefox is running 110.0.1 I need to get this to stop running in the background. can anyone please help me figure this out? </p><p>Thank You </p>,desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,other,en-US,1568814;,Mr.Bobcat
