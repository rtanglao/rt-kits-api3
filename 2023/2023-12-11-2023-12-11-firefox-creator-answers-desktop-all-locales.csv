I have over thirteen thousand bookmarks and I have used some extensions to delete the duplicates. However, that has left many empty folders and worse where my Bookmarks have been removed from these folders. </p><p>With Chromium browsers, we can simply search for a Bookmark folder by typing it's name. It will show itself in the search results along with Chrome bookmarks. However, that's not the case with FF. Instead, FF allows us to create TAGS. When I search for a known Bookmark Folder (I can see it in the Bookmark Tree) it won't show up. </p><p>it's almost 2024 and I find it surprising that Mozilla hasn't yet incorporated searching for Bookmark Folders. At the same time, I am also (not) surprised that Google hasn't implemented TAGS like in Firefox. Unfortunately, neither browser is ideal for searching bookmarks including folders. </p><p>Perhaps I'm missing something and there's a feature in the About:config that allows us to search for Bookmark folders. </p>",desktop;tips;windows-11;,firefox,tips,en-US,1623557;1623580;,ofqvuiozkmkrrcvzit
