Within days of each other, both Firefox browsers on the two computers began crashing whenever we tried to use them. There has been no error message. Nothing we have done has helped, though we have only tried to fix it on the desktop. We have uninstalled it and reinstalled it on the desktop. We have refreshed the reinstalled version. We have opened it in Troubleshoot mode and it still crashed within 15 seconds.
