At that time, two profiles were created automatically under the Profiles folder:  xxxxxxx.default, and xxxxxxx.default-<strong>esr</strong>. The first profile, the one without the ""esr"" suffix was never used - I don't even know how to switch into it. </p><p>The non-esr profile folder had always contained only 6 files totaling about 70 KB.  The contents never changed - until a few days ago. </p><p>A few days ago I noticed the non-esr profile folder was modified. It now contains 28 files totaling 125 MB. 26 of the 28 files were modified on the same day (May 23rd), at 2 different time points. That folder and contents haven't changed since then. </p><p>I continue to use FF using the esr profile without apparent problems, but I would really like to know how/why the non-esr profile got modified suddenly. Any ideas, anybody? </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1011;firefox-7815;firefox-78150;,firefox,other,en-US,"",JohnTake
