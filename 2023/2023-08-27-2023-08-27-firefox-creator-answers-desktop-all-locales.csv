And try to edit some random web-page element by css rules editor. Add new rules and write&nbsp;: </p><p>background: linear-gradient(to left, ) </p><p>so looking not bad, but at this moment starts issue, if you type between ""to left,"" and ending scope "")"", for example space from keyboard, editor will initiate autocomplete. and insert first word from autocomplete, but you was just type ""space"" button. Its not correct behavior!  Correct: after type ""space"" - no autocomplete or no autocomplete dialog. But if press ctrl+space - its initiate autocomplete. Another correct:  after type any buttons on keyboard - its initiate autocomplete dialog, but correct dialog, that only show some variants, but not auto-paste that! This feature very well working in Chromium Browser, and Google Chrome. And it's not annoying.. </p><p>This issue do imposible very important thing: editing css in live on page from css Rule editor! </p><p>Maybe I have not found some settings, but how to fix this auto-past text? Or please add this to bug-log and fix it ASAP. </p><p>(on attached screenshot -  text after ""space"" button pressed, its autocomplete and AUTO-PAST text aliceblue  ) </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,other,en-US,"",owixon

Firefox has been doing that for too long now. Get your act together. Too many updates. Too many times you delete everything. The hassle getting it all back, should not be needed &amp; you refuse to sort it. Why do I think that?

What I'm lost about is how do I create a folder in my toolbar, and not see the website in the menu?

The folder I created still exist though. </p><p>Then I tried to create a folder and put it in the Toolbar. In the drop down menu I left specific websites. </p><p>When I closed the browser everything was gone from the folders and the drop down menu. </p><p>All I need it to create folders in the Toolbar area.  Leave ""non-duplicated"" sites in the drop down menu.
