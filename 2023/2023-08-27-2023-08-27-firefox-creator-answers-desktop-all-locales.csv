What I'm lost about is how do I create a folder in my toolbar, and not see the website in the menu? I have tried to put a saved site in a toolbar folder, then delete it from the drop-down menu, but once it is deleted the toolbar folder is empty. The folder I created still exist though. </p><p>Then I tried to create a folder and put it in the Toolbar. In the drop down menu I left specific websites. </p><p>When I closed the browser everything was gone from the folders and the drop down menu. </p><p>All I need it to create folders in the Toolbar area.  Leave ""non-duplicated"" sites in the drop down menu. I just don't need to loose everything again, I spent hours doing this, I'm thankful I was able to do a recovery, except it was the last date I used days ago. </p><p>Again, this is what I need, not how yours is. </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",cgregurek

This only happens with the one PC. On the other it works fine. Is there a setting messed up? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1160;,firefox,other,en-US,"",RealGomer
