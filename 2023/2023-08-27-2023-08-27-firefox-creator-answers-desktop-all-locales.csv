And try to edit some random web-page element by css rules editor. Add new rules and write&nbsp;: </p><p>background: linear-gradient(to left, ) </p><p>so looking not bad, but at this moment starts issue, if you type between ""to left,"" and ending scope "")"", for example space from keyboard, editor will initiate autocomplete. and insert first word from autocomplete, but you was just type ""space"" button. Its not correct behavior!  Correct: after type ""space"" - no autocomplete or no autocomplete dialog. But if press ctrl+space - its initiate autocomplete. Another correct:  after type any buttons on keyboard - its initiate autocomplete dialog, but correct dialog, that only show some variants, but not auto-paste that! This feature very well working in Chromium Browser, and Google Chrome. And it's not annoying.. </p><p>This issue do imposible very important thing: editing css in live on page from css Rule editor! </p><p>Maybe I have not found some settings, but how to fix this auto-past text? Or please add this to bug-log and fix it ASAP. </p><p>(on attached screenshot -  text after ""space"" button pressed, its autocomplete and AUTO-PAST text aliceblue  ) </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,other,en-US,"",owixon
