Its not correct behavior!  Correct: after type ""space"" - no autocomplete or no autocomplete dialog. But if press ctrl+space - its initiate autocomplete. Another correct:  after type any buttons on keyboard - its initiate autocomplete dialog, but correct dialog, that only show some variants, but not auto-paste that! This feature very well working in Chromium Browser, and Google Chrome. And it's not annoying.. </p><p>This issue do imposible very important thing: editing css in live on page from css Rule editor! </p><p>Maybe I have not found some settings, but how to fix this auto-past text?
