BUT then you took away so much that now I have to have extensions to do what I want. But every time I go to look at an extension, I see a warning that Firefox does not monitor it for safety or security.  So basic - Firefox is no longer safe and I cannot have a good experience unless I take a risk? Why can't Firefox have its own extensions?? How can I determine that an extension is safe before it is too late? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",fryque
