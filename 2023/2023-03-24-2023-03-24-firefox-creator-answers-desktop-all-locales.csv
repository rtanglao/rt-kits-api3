In Chrome/Chromium, it is possible to forcefully ""trust"" an insecure (HTTP) domain name and temporarily allow it access to webcam, microphone, etc. It does not appear to be possible in Firefox. I've searched the about:config and even tried editing the configuration files directly to try and whitelist my test domain. I am not able to setup SSL or TLS on the server it is hosted on, and I need to be able to access the page on other devices. It does seem to allowlist ""localhost"" since I guess it's trusted by default. If there is any way to temporarily or permanently allowlist an HTTP website, I will be able to use my website on Firefox instead of Chromium, which would be much preferred. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1572133;,ambermaturegaming

BUT then you took away so much that now I have to have extensions to do what I want. But every time I go to look at an extension, I see a warning that Firefox does not monitor it for safety or security.  So basic - Firefox is no longer safe and I cannot have a good experience unless I take a risk? Why can't Firefox have its own extensions?? How can I determine that an extension is safe before it is too late? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",fryque
