Everything should be running in the same instance of Firefox as each Window was opened with the ""New WIndow"" command in the ""File"" dropdown menu. When I let MS WIndows update run I usually have only 2-4 windows restored.  When only Firefox updates, all windows are properly restored. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,other,en-US,"",wannabowl
