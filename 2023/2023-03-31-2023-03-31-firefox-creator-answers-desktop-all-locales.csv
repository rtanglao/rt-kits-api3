Since moving in we've had a few hiccups with the internet and initially narrowed it down to google searches.  </p><p>The graphs below are my internet activity with a couple tabs open and a stream to just get a consistent graph for pre-googling and then post-googling, the connection hitching continues until i close and reopen firefox which obviously is inconvenient. (I've been making do with bing in the meantime and it is really beyond parody how bad it actually really is.) </p><p>On a whim today I tried googling something in chrome to see if it'd do the same thing and it doesn't, which is great because this went from just a bizarre isp issue to a potential bug which can hopefully be fixed. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",veromorte

Everything should be running in the same instance of Firefox as each Window was opened with the ""New WIndow"" command in the ""File"" dropdown menu. When I let MS WIndows update run I usually have only 2-4 windows restored.  When only Firefox updates, all windows are properly restored. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,other,en-US,"",wannabowl
