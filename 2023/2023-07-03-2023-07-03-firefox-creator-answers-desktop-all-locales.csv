I login and it shows login confirmed but I look in the top right corner where you access your account and it shows that it's disconnected. On top of that, I backed up all of my tabs, favorites and passwords but I don't have the ability to import it from the back up. I'm only given the options to import from another browser. Any help in this matter is greatly appreciated. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",SGTDRE
