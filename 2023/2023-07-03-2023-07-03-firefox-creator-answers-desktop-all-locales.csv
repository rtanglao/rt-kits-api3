It seems right and quick on Chrome ,but unresponsive and flashing at FF.  </p><pre> My code looks like this (minified): </pre> <p>``` $video.src = ""/test.mp4""; $video.play(); var context = $canvas.getContext(""2d""); function render() { </p><pre> context.drawImage(video, 0, 0);  requestAnimationFrame(render); </pre> <p>} render(); ``` </p><pre> I think this might be the most classical way to render videos to canvas2d, and it runs well on Chrome.   After that, I've justified `gfx.canvas.accelerated` to `true` but nothing changed.  Is there any way for FF to be better on this way? </pre>",desktop;beta;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1150;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",bylx666
