The somewhere along the line it was moved to the bottom. </p><p>Some good guys realized that's a problem for some of us and came up with code to put into a .css file.  That was in 2017/18 </p><p>The code has worked until last week ~2023/05/15. </p><p>Now the find bar is firmly planted at the bottom of the page...very awkward place for me.  Makes edge look like something to consider as their find bar is still at the top. </p><p>I've check the code and no problems...I say it appears firefox is no long allowing this customization code to be used. </p><p>I've checked the knowledge base and the same articles from 2017/18 are still there...and the solution no longer work. </p><p>Does anyone have any suggestions?  I hate traversing from the top to the bottom to do my work.  The find bar at the top really made it convient and easier to do my job. </p><p>thanks for any help. </p>,desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11301;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",joenkats
