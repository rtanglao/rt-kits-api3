Hoy he instalado firefox despues de formatear el PC y no me funcionan la mayoria de los videos de las paginas web, como twitch, algunos videos de Youtube, los de Facebook, etc. Ya he limpiado el historial, no tengo plugins ni nada puestos y no tengo nada que bloquee los videos. Estoy casi seguro que es un tema de plugins de firefox que no funcionan bien, hay alguna solución real? Porque hay mucha gente que pregunta esto pero a nadie le dan una respuesta que funcione de verdad </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11301;,firefox,other,es,"",driknightmare
