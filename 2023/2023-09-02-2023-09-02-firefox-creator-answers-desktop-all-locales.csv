They said I needed to restart Firefox, which I did. Unfortunately, I accidentally clicked on it twice, opening two instances, and then closed one without allowing either one to finish loading first. The one I didn't close only had one tab, so I went to Recently Closed Tabs to see about restoring my previous session, but it was empty. I also found all of the tabs in my Simple Tab Groups extension were gone so I couldn't restore it from there. My bookmarks still remain. I followed instructions I found to use the .jsonlz4 files, but they also only had the one tab. As suggested in another support page, I also searched for index.dat files, but found none relating to Firefox. Should I have any hope of recovery, or do I need to start over from scratch? Please help. Thanks, Geoffrey </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-11;firefox-1170;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",geoear

It's been working fine on Firefox for quite a long time, but when I tried it again today for some reason it wouldn't work. I double checked my proxy settings, changed some of them and I tried switching to Google's DNS too but again, nothing. Using this DNS to bypass website bans works on my phone and on Windows using other browsers, so I was hoping there would be a way to fix this issue. </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1170;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",aijec
