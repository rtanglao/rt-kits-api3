Is there any effective way to solve this problem in Wordpress?

Cleared browser cache and data. Despite these efforts, the problem persists, and I am unable to play WhatsApp Web videos on Firefox. This issue is particularly inconvenient, and I rely on WhatsApp Web for communication. </p><p>I kindly request your assistance in resolving this matter as soon as possible.
