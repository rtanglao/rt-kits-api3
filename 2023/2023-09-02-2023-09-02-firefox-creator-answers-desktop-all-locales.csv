It's been working fine on Firefox for quite a long time, but when I tried it again today for some reason it wouldn't work. I double checked my proxy settings, changed some of them and I tried switching to Google's DNS too but again, nothing. Using this DNS to bypass website bans works on my phone and on Windows using other browsers, so I was hoping there would be a way to fix this issue. </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1170;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",aijec
