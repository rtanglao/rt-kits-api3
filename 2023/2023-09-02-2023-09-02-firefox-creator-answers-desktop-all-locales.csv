If I then try the external link again with the new window that was opened the first time it will open a new tab and display the link. Up till now it has been working fine and I've made no changes to Firefox for a while, though I do see that my Firefox was updated at about 2am on August 30, two days ago, from version 116.0.3 to 117.0. </p><p>I'm running MacOS 13.5.1 Ventura. I did just update that from MacOS 13.5 Ventura. Unfortunately I only noticed this after that update and do recall this Firefox problem occurring before I looked closely enough to know what was happening (that feeling you get when you feel like something is different but you don't quite know what) so I don't know if it only began after the MacOS update. </p><p>I did play around with: </p><pre><strong>browser.link.open_newwindow</strong> , <strong>browser.link.open_newwindow.override.external</strong> , and <strong>browser.link.open_newwindow.restriction</strong> </pre> <p>settings to see if they might make a difference but nothing fixed the problem. But I restricted myself to settings that seemed likely and haven't checked out every possible combination. </p><p>If I wasn't brain dead just now I'd try to give more info but just can't. Sorry. Thanks for your help. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1170;,firefox,other,en-US,"",zhoravdb

1422824,2023-09-01 21:03:55 -0700,2023-09-01 21:03:55 -0700,Lost Tabs and No Recently Closed Tabs,"<p>Hi, I recently tried to update my video driver, and afterward I was unable to login to Forge of Empires. They said I needed to restart Firefox, which I did. Unfortunately, I accidentally clicked on it twice, opening two instances, and then closed one without allowing either one to finish loading first. The one I didn't close only had one tab, so I went to Recently Closed Tabs to see about restoring my previous session, but it was empty. I also found all of the tabs in my Simple Tab Groups extension were gone so I couldn't restore it from there. My bookmarks still remain. I followed instructions I found to use the .jsonlz4 files, but they also only had the one tab. As suggested in another support page, I also searched for index.dat files, but found none relating to Firefox. Should I have any hope of recovery, or do I need to start over from scratch? Please help. Thanks, Geoffrey </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-11;firefox-1170;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",geoear

It's been working fine on Firefox for quite a long time, but when I tried it again today for some reason it wouldn't work. I double checked my proxy settings, changed some of them and I tried switching to Google's DNS too but again, nothing. Using this DNS to bypass website bans works on my phone and on Windows using other browsers, so I was hoping there would be a way to fix this issue. </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1170;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",aijec
