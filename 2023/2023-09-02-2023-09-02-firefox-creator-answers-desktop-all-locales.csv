If I open Firefox, all my history is gone. If I rename the .corrupt file to places.sqlite my history comes back. I want to know why it gets corrupted? It happens when Firefox closes and it doesn't matter if there's a power cut, closing with X , or Exit, Firefox restarts and I have to rename the places.sqlite.corrupt file again. This has been happening for almost two years now. My computer stays on 24/7 and I may restart it once every 2-3 months, but sometimes you have to restart it many times a day because of issues and it's a pain in the behind to rename the places.sqlite.corrupt every single time. Any ideas?! Could an add-on be affecting it? I don't have a lot of them. Just basic AdBlocks. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",exclusive01

I did just update that from MacOS 13.5 Ventura.

But I restricted myself to settings that seemed likely and haven't checked out every possible combination. </p><p>If I wasn't brain dead just now I'd try to give more info but just can't. Sorry.

They said I needed to restart Firefox, which I did. Unfortunately, I accidentally clicked on it twice, opening two instances, and then closed one without allowing either one to finish loading first. The one I didn't close only had one tab, so I went to Recently Closed Tabs to see about restoring my previous session, but it was empty. I also found all of the tabs in my Simple Tab Groups extension were gone so I couldn't restore it from there. My bookmarks still remain. I followed instructions I found to use the .jsonlz4 files, but they also only had the one tab. As suggested in another support page, I also searched for index.dat files, but found none relating to Firefox. Should I have any hope of recovery, or do I need to start over from scratch?
