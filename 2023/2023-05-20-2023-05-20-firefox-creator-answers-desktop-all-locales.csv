However, after my login there is nothing there. I have the suspicion that Firefox thinks I just deleted all my bookmarks and it updated to Firefox Sync accordingly not with an empty space. I still have the data on my android phone which hasnt done a synchronization yet. Any help you guys can give me? Took quite some time to get all my setup arranged. </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p><p>Best, Seb </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;,firefox,sync,en-US,1581581;,sebastian.hecko

I am accustomed to seeing all of my bookmark folders when I select the arrows at the end of my bookmarks toolbar. In Firefox I don't see that. I can see those folders under the bookmarks toolbar in the bookmark manager, but I would love to just be able to click on the arrows on the end of the bookmarks toolbar and have them drop down just like they did in Chrome. Do I have it all wrong? Do I always have to have my bookmark manager open to be able to bounce from bookmark to bookmark? Thanks in advance for any help. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11301;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1581571;,ktothe2nd1
