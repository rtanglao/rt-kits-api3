But on all my machines running 113 it's being rendered as 0.566667 which is rounded down to 0. I also noticed that my separators between the tabs seem to be thinner. </p><p>Before I try to counter it by setting my css to use 2px which is interpreted as 1.7 and rounded down to 1, can you please tell me WHAT is going on? Thanks. </p><p>P.S. My userchrome.css include much more than this, hence why it looks strange on a default profile, but the effects are still visible. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1130;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",Funtime60
