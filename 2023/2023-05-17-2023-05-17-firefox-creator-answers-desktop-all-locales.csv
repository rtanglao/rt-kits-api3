Additionally I am using LibreOffice right now with 5 open/active documents and creating a powerpoint presentation in Impress, and even that is only using 720mB.  Why is FF using so much?

I have been facing this problem of frequent crashes for the past few months. By crash, I mean not Firefox alone, but the entire system. I use several apps and run several processes that require great compute resources, often simultaneously. I have narrowed the cause of frequent system crashes to Firefox alone; the system rarely crashes when I use other resource-heavy apps. Due to this, I have to restart my system several times a day. </p><p>Before this problem arose, I would use multiple tabs (including YouTube, often 10+, close to 20) and multiple windows (2+). Such usage very rarely caused crashes, which is why it is surprising that Firefox now causes the entire system to simply hang sometimes with as low as 3-4 tabs. </p><p>I have disabled Hardware Acceleration, refreshed Firefox, even tried disabling WebGL. I also tested it after removing all add-ons, but it still didn't help (I use only 2 add-ons: a simple wide-spectrum ad-blocker and an EPUB reader). Even in troubleshoot mode, Firefox will cause my system to heat up, although it takes some more effort to crash in this case. I use one of the standard themes, so it could not have been the problem. </p><p>Many people report Firefox crashes, but in my case, Firefox causes my entire system to crash. How do I fix this issue?
