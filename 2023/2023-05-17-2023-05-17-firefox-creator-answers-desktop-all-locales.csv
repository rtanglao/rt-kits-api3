I tried to updated to it the last version to solve. It did not work. So I tried to restore it. which should work as I dont think its problems has to do with cookies or saved personal info. It did not work as well.  So here some of the problems: </p><p>1-  My firefox's home page is suppose to show my most visted sites. But it shows only empty/blank space. (image ) 2- I cant add any extension to my toolbar. They simply dont appear when I try to edit it. 3- I cant remove/edit any favorites (changes are not applied). 4- Some extension are just not working. for no reason. Betterttv for example.  (Tried to reinstall, reset permission. ). they were working normally before. 5- autofill are not working. Does not show the options.  </p><p>All this does not make any sense to me. As I've tried to solve restoring the firefox. Only cookies, passwords and personal info should have being kept and I dont think they are the cause of all this.  I dont wanna to fully clean reinstall it as there are many logins, passwords and other info saved that I dont even remember. In additon it does not make any sense to me at all. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11301;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",fernando100zxy
