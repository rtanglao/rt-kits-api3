I don't like Bing. I go into settings, and change my default search engine to Google. But, the moment I search for something it shows that its Bing in the top left corner of the page. I can't get rid of it. Please help! I really don't like Bing! It has never fully helped me find what I'm looking for, or been thorough when searching for what something means. Can you please help me remove Bing from Firefox Browser? I sent 2 images showing what I mean. The first shows me wanting to use google to search for a word. And, in the second is what happens after I do that. You can clearly see Microsoft Bing in the top left corner. Thank You for any and all of your help &amp; time! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11301;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Tobinator

If I am NOT on the internet using Firefox (Which is for internet use), why is it still running?  This slows my system down while I am working with graphics programs.  It should do an update check when I use it on the net (As a non-invasive background process) and not interfere with my work. </p><p>2).  When I am online playing my game (Wizard 101), IF I have Firefox running in the background, I get lots, I mean LOTS of lag time and freezing screens.  If I don't activate Firefox, then there is no lag or freezing screens. </p><p>Before you say I need to check my computer; sorry but THAT is NOT the problem.  I have been using the same computer and the ONLY change is the ""5 Million"" tiny updates of Firefox. </p><p>So how do I fix these issues...or do I dump Firefox (And all things Mozilla) and find another browser program?  Is it wrong to expect better from you guys?? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11301;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",vanshipley
