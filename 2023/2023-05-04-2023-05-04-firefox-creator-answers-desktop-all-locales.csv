It uses a ""pinterest style"" layout to have a column grid of objects with variable heights, and the print styles avoid breaking these items over the page barrier. (In fact, there are two grids on the page, one after the other). The website looks and works fine on screen, and both screen and print work great on Chromium browsers. But on Firefox, using ctrl+P or developer tools' print view causes the page to hang and the tab to ultimately crash. </p><p>I know it has something to do with handling the grid layout CSS as the print preview worked fine until I made the change from a traditional row-grid to a column-grid. </p><p>The site creates a variable amount of content based on user options at the top of the page. If the content generated is quite small (avoiding a page break?), the print preview works fine. In the link below, I've included some GET variables to guarantee a long amount of content to reliably reproduce the issue. </p><p><a href=""https://acejon.co.uk/starfinder/?apl=6&amp;playershipcount=2&amp;difficulty=-2&amp;minships=5&amp;maxships=5"" rel=""nofollow"">The site</a> in question. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",jb44

Among the suggestions there is one that is the true identifier I need to use the others are mis-typos that I probably have typed in error some time in the past. </p><p>I want to clean-up that list to keep just the true identifier. How do I do that&nbsp;? </p><p>When I go to Settings &gt; Passwords I only see the true login identifier. The other items in the list of suggestions do not appear.
