In Firefox email writing, the font size in the subject line is larger than the font size in the email text which is set to normal which is too small. I would like to set the text font to be the same as the subject font but the next largest size for the text is large which is too big. Why are the subject and text content fonts different? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,other,en-US,"",David_Dundas

Among the suggestions there is one that is the true identifier I need to use the others are mis-typos that I probably have typed in error some time in the past. </p><p>I want to clean-up that list to keep just the true identifier. How do I do that&nbsp;? </p><p>When I go to Settings &gt; Passwords I only see the true login identifier. The other items in the list of suggestions do not appear. So it seems that it is not there that I must do the cleaning-up … </p><p>[I am appending an example with a list of login identifiers that Firefox suggests (the correct identifier is the last in the list) and the information that is stored in Passwords (only the true identifier is listed).] </p><p>Many thanks. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",nuno_ferreira
