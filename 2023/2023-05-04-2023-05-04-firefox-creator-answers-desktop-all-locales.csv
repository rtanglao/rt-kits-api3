Among the suggestions there is one that is the true identifier I need to use the others are mis-typos that I probably have typed in error some time in the past. </p><p>I want to clean-up that list to keep just the true identifier. How do I do that&nbsp;? </p><p>When I go to Settings &gt; Passwords I only see the true login identifier. The other items in the list of suggestions do not appear. So it seems that it is not there that I must do the cleaning-up â€¦ </p><p>[I am appending an example with a list of login identifiers that Firefox suggests (the correct identifier is the last in the list) and the information that is stored in Passwords (only the true identifier is listed).] </p><p>Many thanks. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",nuno_ferreira

When I restart a new Firefox session, it immediately accesses webpages and accounts and automatically logs you in, without ever confirming the Primary Password.  </p><p>Even when FF does ask you for the Primary Password, if you click on x and ignore the request, FF happily goes on and logs in to all secure sites without prompting a password.  </p><p>This is a serious security problem! If I shutdown a laptop or quit out of Firefox, I don't want someone else to be able to power up the computer, launch the browser and have automatic access to all of my accounts, email, etc. </p><p>Thanks for looking into this and fixing it. Keep up the good work. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1578752;1578759;,lincolnhu
