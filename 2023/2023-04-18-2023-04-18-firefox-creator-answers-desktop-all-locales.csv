It started to worry me now, because when I just lost it, I decided to try out microsoft edge, but now I'm not satisfied with the microsoft policy and I'm trying to switch to linux, where your browser works best.  I am very concerned that all accounts be centralized under one mail, perhaps this is a bit of unhealthy perfectionism. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,1576113;,kvasha.personal
