When I click ""Print"", Firefox tries to generate a printable copy, but fails - it just shows ""about:blank"", which isn't helpful. </p><p>However.  Firefox seems to be perfectly capable of GENERATING .PDF files, because the same web-based program allows me to email these documents.  If I pretend to email the document, it generates a .PDF copy of the document, and I can then open &amp; print that .PDF file from within the program / within Firefox, using Firefox's default viewer.  No downloads, no nonsense.  It also allows me to view a consolidated set of documents as a .PDF file with no issues. </p><p>So the issue appears to be a ""print preview"" problem? </p><p>I can open &amp; print a .PDF in Firefox.  I can generate &amp; print a .PDF in Firefox.  The Firefox .PDF viewer seems to work as expected. </p><p>I have tried to set Adobe Acrobat as my default viewer.  When I click ""Print"", Firefox does the ""about:blank"" thing... but Acrobat pops up over the top with a beautiful printable .PDF copy of the document.  Strange?  But I can't just click ""Print"" within Firefox and print my document, because that's apparently in the too hard basket. </p><p>I've attached a few images here - I'm not sure if they're helpful or not - but I've tried troubleshooting this as much as I can. </p><p>Things that have NOT helped, so far: - going into about:config &amp; playing with both Print &amp; .PDF related settings in there - bargaining with the program - general .PDF Viewer related troubleshooting solutions found on Firefox Support - turning it off &amp; then back on again - uninstalling &amp; reinstalling Firefox - ""using Microsoft Edge instead"", as per the program developer's recommendations (yikes) - using a different printer - using another different printer - using a third, also different printer - staring soullessly at the screen - trying to use different extensions for .PDF handling &amp; generation - reverting everything to original settings just in case I'd totally hoofed things up </p><p>I am at my wits end with this darn thing hahaha, so I'm hoping someone here has the answer I'm desperately seeking&nbsp;:) </p><p>Thank you in advance! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",EnterAValidUsername

This is extremely annoying. </p><p>Is this part of resisting fingerprinting? This is some unusual behavior that I haven't seen Firefox do before ever. </p><p>I can provide a little video if my explanation wasn't clear. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1120;firefox-11201;,firefox,other,en-US,1576121;,mackerelsalmon

By using the <strong>Network Console</strong>, we can analyse the time durations and other characteristics of each and every such requests and responses. </p><p>However, as per my knowledge, it is not mentioned how these durations are calculated. Below are some of the resources I referred to: </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/network_monitor/request_list/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Network request list</a>  </li><li> <a href=""https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/network_monitor/request_details/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Network request details</a>  </li></ul> <p>When I tried to correlate Network Console timestamps with the generated network traffic collected using Wireshark, they are misaligned. Nevertheless, when I write my own application and log timestamps before and after it utilises a system calls (socket(), connect(), send(), read() etc) they are well aligned. </p><p>I want to know: </p> <ol><li> How time durations are calculated in Firefox  </li><li> Why ""started dateTime""+""blocked dateTime""+""dns dateTime""+""connect dateTime""+""ssl dateTime"" <em>in the HAR file</em> &gt; ""request send dateTime"" <em>in Wireshark</em>?

It started to worry me now, because when I just lost it, I decided to try out microsoft edge, but now I'm not satisfied with the microsoft policy and I'm trying to switch to linux, where your browser works best.  I am very concerned that all accounts be centralized under one mail, perhaps this is a bit of unhealthy perfectionism. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,1576113;,kvasha.personal
