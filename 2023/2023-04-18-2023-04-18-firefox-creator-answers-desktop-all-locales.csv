This is extremely annoying. </p><p>Is this part of resisting fingerprinting? This is some unusual behavior that I haven't seen Firefox do before ever. </p><p>I can provide a little video if my explanation wasn't clear. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1120;firefox-11201;,firefox,other,en-US,1576121;,mackerelsalmon

By using the <strong>Network Console</strong>, we can analyse the time durations and other characteristics of each and every such requests and responses. </p><p>However, as per my knowledge, it is not mentioned how these durations are calculated. Below are some of the resources I referred to: </p> <ul><li> <a href=""https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/network_monitor/request_list/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Network request list</a>  </li><li> <a href=""https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/network_monitor/request_details/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Network request details</a>  </li></ul> <p>When I tried to correlate Network Console timestamps with the generated network traffic collected using Wireshark, they are misaligned. Nevertheless, when I write my own application and log timestamps before and after it utilises a system calls (socket(), connect(), send(), read() etc) they are well aligned. </p><p>I want to know: </p> <ol><li> How time durations are calculated in Firefox  </li><li> Why ""started dateTime""+""blocked dateTime""+""dns dateTime""+""connect dateTime""+""ssl dateTime"" <em>in the HAR file</em> &gt; ""request send dateTime"" <em>in Wireshark</em>?

It started to worry me now, because when I just lost it, I decided to try out microsoft edge, but now I'm not satisfied with the microsoft policy and I'm trying to switch to linux, where your browser works best.  I am very concerned that all accounts be centralized under one mail, perhaps this is a bit of unhealthy perfectionism. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,1576113;,kvasha.personal
