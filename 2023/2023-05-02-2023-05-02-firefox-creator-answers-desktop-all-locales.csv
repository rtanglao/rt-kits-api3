Firefox is the default program to view an html file, so running gio open &lt;file&gt;.htm should either launch firefox and display the file, or if firefox is already running, it should open the file in a new tab in the running copy of firefox.  This works fine on the host supported by me.  However on the AWS host, the first file will launch firefox and display, but subsequent files, launched from the same xterm, result in ""Firefox is running but not responding..."".   I have searched and found suggestions about the profiles, so I created a new profile file that is identical to the one that works apart form the names.  I found suggestions related to .parentlock, so I tried removing that.  That resulted in a new browser being launched and a new .parentlock file being created, so that didn't help.  Both hosts are running the same version of firefox, installed using rpm updates.  I have tried the MOZ_DBUS_REMOTE and MOZ_NO_REMOTE environment variables, but they didn't help either.  I looked in about:config at the various ..newwindow.. options, and those are the same between the two hosts.  I did notice that opening a new tab in the browser in AWS takes longer, but I don't know if that is relevant.  Any suggestions for how to have the currently running copy of firefox display multiple local html files would be appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",dpr205browersc

(I would also like to know how to teach Firefox to behave that way, for various letters of the alphabet.) </p><p>It seems that, if I make full use of the deletion options available via Ctrl-Shift-Del, Firefox deletes those oft-used URLs along with everything else.

Lately, after the latest  update to 112.0.2 the double-clicking center mouse button sends me ANYWHERE but where I want to go, TWICE today it sent me to the account sign-in page of my news website. It's not working properly and it's extremely annoying and frustrating to have to SCROLL DOWN TO THE LINK AGAIN and try it again, only to have it repeat the same action.  </p><p>On another note, this convoluted sign-in process, sending me to YET ANOTHER SITE just to SIGN-IN is total bullshit. If my login and pw aren't enough, then I don't want to be here; enough of this double-bloody- pain-in-the-ass authentication via a bloody email. When I login, I want IN, not being sent all over hell's half acre and taking MINUTES to get in instead of the seconds it used to take; FIX IT! Yea, I'm just a little pissed off with all of these 'innovations' which do nothing but piss people off. You're getting worse than GOOGLE!! I want an answer from an FF OFFICIAL, and not a bunch of gobbldey-gook crap trying to explain away  'new features.' Quit changing things and pissing people off!! it took me over 10 MINUTES just to get here; that's far too long. </p>",mobile;tabs;,firefox,basic-browsing-firefox,en-US,"",trennor
