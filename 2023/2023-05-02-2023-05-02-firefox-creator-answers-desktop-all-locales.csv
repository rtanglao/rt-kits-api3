That is to say, ctrl+T does not work, same for clicking the + button near the tabs or hitting the ""new tab"" from the drop down list. However, any of the action mentioned above works as expected when it is in a normal window. </p><p>I do not have any extension related with tab management, and I really cannot figure out why this is happening, so I was always expecting the next update will fix this issue. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-11;firefox-1120;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1578442;,18971099076

One week ago Microsoft Tech was on my computer and when finished had deleted apps including Firefox. When this happened my bookmarks (website pages) disappeared.

I exclusively use Firefox and Duck Duck Go. Help!! Help!! </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1578445;,rjmails
