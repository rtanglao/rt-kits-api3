However, with version 114 I have noticed two issues with Facebook. 1.) When trying to open messages in Facebook I get ""Couldn't load chats"" (see attached screen shot) 2.) When trying to do a ""Search Facebook"" on any of my friends in Facebook I get ""This page isn't available right now"" but if I search on some place I haven't been before like a company, new outlet etc etc it brings up their info just fine. These two issues DO NOT happen with using Safari or Chrome. Hope someone can help as I want to keep using Firefox and Facebook.
