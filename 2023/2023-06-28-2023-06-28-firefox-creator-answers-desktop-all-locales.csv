I've made sure it's none of my plugins and uninstalled any appearance related ones just to make sure but I think it somehow made the problem worse, the same problem is occurring with drop-down menus and it is so annoying, if ANYONE has any solutions please tell me!!! </p>",desktop;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",gremlinlordowo

As such I have been told to open a new issue. </p><p>M1, Mac OS 13.4.1 - I am an experienced audio engineer so I know my way around multi channel audio config on Mac. </p><p>Audio was working fine from Firefox with a default setup. I had a need to alter some system sound settings for multi channel audio, unrelated to Firefox. When I reverted those settings. Firefox was sending audio to the non default audio channels on my sound card. </p><p>Safari, Chrome, Mac OS and Spotify were obeying the reverted config and sending the audio out the main outs. Only Firefox, for some reason was sending audio to channel 3&amp;4. I could tell because I was getting a level on those channels. I have tried the following: </p> <ul><li> Rebooted </li><li> ""refreshed"" Firefox </li><li> Used AppCleaner to completely remove all Firefox and my sound card apps, drivers and preferences </li><li> Cleared cache </li><li> Triple checked all my factory config </li><li> Retested Chrome, Safari etc... all good with audio coming out the main out stereo channel </li></ul> <p>Firefox still sending audio to  1 &amp; 2 (3 &amp; 4 as the crow flies, and as the system sees them) since 1 &amp; 2 are actually ""Main out"" </p><p>The audio is being routed. I just can't for the life of me figure out why Firefox is selecting the wrong channels. It used to work, and now it's stuck this way. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,other,en-US,1587569;,old.square.eyes

However, I realized that Youtube sometimes slows down a video and messes up/distorts the audio while it's playing. I have never had this issue before on my old computer. These slow downs would occur in intervals of around a couple days to maybe a week at most. I have no idea what's going on and a quick Google search doesn't give me my exact issue. I've tried changing browser.sessionstore.interval to a different value but it didn't help.
