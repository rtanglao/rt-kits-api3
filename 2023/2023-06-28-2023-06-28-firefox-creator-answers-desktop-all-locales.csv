I have tried AutoFill and, while it works fine for... well.. filling out forms... I cannot get it to work for what I need. Basically, I want to insert things like '¯\_(ツ)_/¯' rather than having to go to a page, select that, copy it, go back and paste it... or, worse yet ... remember and type that over and over again. </p>",linux;desktop;tips;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",rebeltaz1

However, I realized that Youtube sometimes slows down a video and messes up/distorts the audio while it's playing. I have never had this issue before on my old computer. These slow downs would occur in intervals of around a couple days to maybe a week at most. I have no idea what's going on and a quick Google search doesn't give me my exact issue. I've tried changing browser.sessionstore.interval to a different value but it didn't help. Does anybody know what's going on? </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",marcpaul.ja
