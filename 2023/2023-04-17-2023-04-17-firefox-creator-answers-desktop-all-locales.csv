I know that is an existing setting but i have that turned off in all the places i can find. This has only started happening recently and the only thing that shows up in my history are my bookmarked tabs- like it shows each bookmarked tab as if i have gone and clicked each tab in my history and literally nothing else. I have been on my pc throughout the day and have searched many things yet upon closing all tabs &amp; windows everything is deleted. I know this sounds like the opposite of an issue but i rely on my history a lot to help me go back to sites &amp; helpful infomation. </p>,desktop;cookies;windows-10;firefox-1120;,firefox,cookies,en-US,"",mooshall200
