However, when I open a Firefox window in private mode, when I click the Firefox icon on the Windows taskbar, it does NOT show the open private Firefox window. I also can't see a preview of the private window when I click the Mozilla taskbar icon, but I can see a preview of the non-private window. This means that when I minimize the private browsing window, I can't get it back again since it is no longer accessible.  </p><p>I'm attaching two pictures. The first one shows that the Firefox icon on the taskbar does not show a window open even though you can see that the private browser window IS open.  </p><p>The second picture shows that when I click on the Firefox icon, it only shows a preview of the non-private browser window. It does not show a preview of the private browser window.  </p><p>Any suggestions? This is a big issue for me as I always work in private mode in Firefox. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,other,en-US,"",c1800985
