1411011,2023-04-16 22:51:36 -0700,2023-04-16 22:51:36 -0700,after the most recent update the tabs are not shown anymore,"<p>yesterday I updated firexfox to its latest version. </p><p>after that, the tabs aren't showing properly anymore. </p><p>as I use my computer for work and leisure I usually keep a few separate tabs open, and up until yesterday, when I clicked, or hovered, over the firexfox icon in the taskbar, it would show me a preview of the individual tabs I had open, then to see the windows open in each tab I needed to click on the relevant tab. </p><p>since the update yesterday though, when I click, or hover, over the firexfox icon, insted of the tabs, it shows me ALL the window open, in what is now a chaotic and disorganised mess. the tabs are still separate in reality, if I minimase a tab, I can see the other tab open on the screen, but I now don't have access to them anymore as I should normally by the firefox icon, as it only show ALL the window open regardless of tab. </p><p>this is an incredibly disturbing problem, expecially when I have to use firefox for my studies and I have serveral research papers and resources open at once, and divived in tabs for ease of navigation. </p><p>while I still can access to the individual tabs through 'alt+tab' and scrolling with three fingers on the mousepad, this is still a massive issue that only arised with the update done yesterday. </p><p>is there any way to fix this? </p><p>thank you kindly in advance. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1120;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",sara.dicaprio
