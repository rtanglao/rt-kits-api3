The screen is blank, and you can see the spinning wheel in the tab window above the toolbar.  Usually, if I click to stop it, then hit the refresh button, it will finally load the tab. Why can't they all just load, for while they don't, FF will still run up nearly all my RAM, maybe trying to load takes more juice. I don't know, but it's not supposed to be doing this.

However, there's one feature in Chromium that I can't do without: the task manager. In Chromium, I'm able to stop a tab's process, but the tab still remains open, displaying an error. Even if I refresh the tab, the tab's process restarts as if the tab was just refreshed, without any crashes. I'm aware that Firefox also has a task manager, but when I stop a tab's process using Firefox's task manager, the tab closes as well. Is there a method to forcefully stop a tab's process without having to close the entire tab? Perhaps there's an add-on that can help with this? I typically have a large number of tabs open — more than my PC can handle — so this feature is essential for me. </p>",linux;desktop;tabs;firefox-950;firefox-9501;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1599141;1599160;,shkiper.d1000

Users can create public links and share them with others, who do not need to be logged in to view and download files from these links.

In this situation, the download fails after a few seconds, and I observe an error labeled ""NS_BINDING_ABORTED"" in the network tab of the browser's developer tools. </p><p>What's particularly interesting is that when the download fails, and I click the ""retry"" button, the download is successful.  </p><p>This issue does not manifest when: </p><p>1. Users are accessing public links locally. 2. The user initiating the download is also the owner of the shared link. 3.

But I only thought of doing this a fair way down the track of trying to rearrange the layouts.   (MY MISTAKE) </p><p>But I realised that at least not too long down that rabbit hole. </p><p>So that WINDOW is set to 133% zoom. But just now I tried to zoom out of another tab on that window and realised that the zoom on the other tabs is changed too.  &nbsp;:( </p><p>Am I missing any tricks? I know I could move THOSE tabs to a whole new window and that's that. But in the bigger picture I just want to check. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",teeny_weeny
