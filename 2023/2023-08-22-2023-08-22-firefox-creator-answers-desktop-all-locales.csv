I have about 36 windows of firefox open and some of those can have a LOT of tabs on/in them. </p><p>I have recently ""evolved"" to using a computer monitor.   Before then it was an old flat screen TV - 1336 x 768 resolution (there about). </p><p>Now I have a 1080p monitor and things are different. </p><p>I use Node-Red (dashboards) and they took a beating with the new size. </p><p>I've set THOSE tabs to 133% magnification - and yes that isn't the correct size to emulate the TV.   But I only thought of doing this a fair way down the track of trying to rearrange the layouts.   (MY MISTAKE) </p><p>But I realised that at least not too long down that rabbit hole. </p><p>So that WINDOW is set to 133% zoom. But just now I tried to zoom out of another tab on that window and realised that the zoom on the other tabs is changed too.  &nbsp;:( </p><p>Am I missing any tricks? I know I could move THOSE tabs to a whole new window and that's that. But in the bigger picture I just want to check. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",teeny_weeny

Your tab just crashed.,"<p>Hello, I'm a newbie currently struggling to get a Ruby on Rails project going on Firefox specifically, it loads and works fine on Brave. I am using an HP Envy Laptop with dualboot, Windows and Pop_OS! Everything is up to date, and when I try to access localhost:3000 I get ""Gah. Your tab just crashed."" everytime. It does seem to receive the HTML package just fine, it just refuses to load (it has loaded it for less than 1ms once, once I disabled Content Tracking randomly). Not sure what the issue could be, there's nothing on the Inspect's console or anywhere, but I did get this crash report from Firefox itself I think: </p><p><a href=""https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/f8d5322a-bfd9-4021-8341-5e0450230822"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/f8d5322a-bfd9-4021-8341-5e0450230822</a> </p><p>Any idea what could it be?
