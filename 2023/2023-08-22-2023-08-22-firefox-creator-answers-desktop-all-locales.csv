Your tab just crashed.,"<p>Hello, I'm a newbie currently struggling to get a Ruby on Rails project going on Firefox specifically, it loads and works fine on Brave. I am using an HP Envy Laptop with dualboot, Windows and Pop_OS! Everything is up to date, and when I try to access localhost:3000 I get ""Gah. Your tab just crashed."" everytime. It does seem to receive the HTML package just fine, it just refuses to load (it has loaded it for less than 1ms once, once I disabled Content Tracking randomly). Not sure what the issue could be, there's nothing on the Inspect's console or anywhere, but I did get this crash report from Firefox itself I think: </p><p><a href=""https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/f8d5322a-bfd9-4021-8341-5e0450230822"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/f8d5322a-bfd9-4021-8341-5e0450230822</a> </p><p>Any idea what could it be? It only happens in Firefox and I tried reinstalling it, no extensions installed at all, cleared cache and cookies... </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",caferinograal
