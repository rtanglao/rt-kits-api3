The proof that Firefox is able to display these files is ascertained by way of setting Windows file associations to Firefox itself, and turning off automatic downloads within Firefox, which presents the user with an Open or Save dialog. However, selecting Open does indeed obey the Windows prerogative declared in the file association index, however, <em>the file was still downloaded</em> as an entirely superfluous action, and <em>and then</em> opened by Firefox, from the default ""download"" directory. This behavior can be repeated in some instances even with images, when right clicking on the image, and selecting ""open in new tab"", where by the image will be downloaded by that new tab instead of being rendered. </p><p>What is the proper methodology to navigate the problem space of this unwanted behavior? The success condition would be Firefox <em>not downloading the file at all</em> and opening it like it is able to do in other instances. </p><p>PS: I realize <em>all content is actually downloaded</em> <strong>anyway</strong>, otherwise it wouldn't be possible to render it. However, this is done in the defined cache folder. I would like this behavior to extend to all files. Excluding, of course, executable binaries, as I understand that design decision is made for security reasons and to allow malware scanners to function properly. </p><p>Thank you in advance. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1160;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",cronyx

I know you and your team make recovery possible in an slew of ways, and I really don't know if I set any of those up. I thought I might of, but I am still picking up the pieces from this reset.  I know I should have been more proactive about recovery and really thought I was, and I am really kicking myself for not being more explicit/diligent.  </p><p>I am happy to go through any verification process. I know you have policies for a reason, but I can't just give up on so much important information. There is a years worth of memories during a time, where memories and identity are shifting.

I'm aware that Firefox also has a task manager, but when I stop a tab's process using Firefox's task manager, the tab closes as well. Is there a method to forcefully stop a tab's process without having to close the entire tab? Perhaps there's an add-on that can help with this?
