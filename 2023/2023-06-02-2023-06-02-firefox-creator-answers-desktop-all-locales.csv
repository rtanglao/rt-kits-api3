With Firefox as the auto fill provider or a 3rd part tool password program like Biwarden. For a while this worked like a charm but what happens is this  username and password fields come up on a webpage. At the bottom I see firefoxes prompt and Bitwardens prompt to select a username. I can do this in both but when I click on the username nothing happens. I have uninstalled both and reinstalled made each a provider etc... This does not happen with Chrome  </p><p>This feature and this feature alone has me thinking of just leaving Firefox  first the revamp with mobile. Got used to it, now this, sorry but this is a deal breaker. </p><p>I am using a OnePlus n10 5g on Metro.
