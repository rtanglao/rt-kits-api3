I am writing to inform you of a critical security breach that has occurred in my Mozilla Firefox password manager and to request immediate action to improve your security protocols. I have been a loyal user of Mozilla Firefox for years and have trusted your organization with my sensitive data. However, I am extremely concerned about the recent incident and its potential implications for me and other users. </p> <ul><li><ul><li>Incident Description:** </li></ul> </li></ul> <p>On the 2nd of june 2023 I noticed a series of unauthorized transactions on my various online accounts. Upon further investigation, I discovered that my password manager, which is integrated into my Mozilla Firefox browser, had been compromised. It appears that an unknown third party gained access to my stored passwords and subsequently used them to access my accounts. </p> <ul><li><ul><li>Impact:** </li></ul> </li></ul> <p>This security breach has had a significant impact on my personal and financial information. I have had to spend considerable time and effort in contacting my banks, credit card companies, and other online service providers to report the unauthorized transactions and secure my accounts. Moreover, I am concerned about the long-term consequences of this breach, as my sensitive information may be misused, leading to identity theft or other malicious activities. </p> <ul><li><ul><li>Request for Security Improvement:** </li></ul> </li></ul> <p>In light of this incident, I would like to request that the Mozilla Data Protection Team take immediate steps to improve the security protocols for the Firefox password manager. This may include: </p><p>1. Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing stored passwords, which would require users to verify their identity through an additional method, such as a one-time code sent via SMS or email. 2. Conducting regular security audits of the password manager infrastructure to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers. 3. Providing users with the option to enable password encryption, ensuring that even if the password manager is compromised, the stored passwords remain unreadable without the correct decryption key. 4. Enhancing user education and awareness about potential security risks and best practices for securing their password manager and other sensitive data. </p> <ul><li><ul><li>Next Steps:** </li></ul> </li></ul> <p>Please acknowledge receipt of this email and provide an update on the actions that the Mozilla Data Protection Team plans to take in response to this incident. Additionally, I would appreciate any guidance on further steps I should take to protect myself and minimize the impact of this security breach. </p><p>I understand that no security system is foolproof, but I believe that it is essential for Mozilla to take this incident seriously and make every effort to ensure that its users can continue to trust the Firefox password manager with their sensitive data. </p><p>I have already filed a complaint with the Romanian police, and they launched an investigation. </p><p>Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon. </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>Baciu Darius-Alexandru Dariusbaciu166@gmail.com 0787403967 </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1583613;,user85406548667003962025318517328605591467

With Firefox as the auto fill provider or a 3rd part tool password program like Biwarden. For a while this worked like a charm but what happens is this  username and password fields come up on a webpage. At the bottom I see firefoxes prompt and Bitwardens prompt to select a username. I can do this in both but when I click on the username nothing happens. I have uninstalled both and reinstalled made each a provider etc... This does not happen with Chrome  </p><p>This feature and this feature alone has me thinking of just leaving Firefox  first the revamp with mobile.
