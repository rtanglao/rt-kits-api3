A code comes up that one uses with one's phone. I connected with it, but I couldn't finish setting up the 2FA. Here's the problem: My Samsung Note 20 Ultra has fingerprint scanning on the screen. Since I bought it, I tried using the fingerprint feature, but it is a beast to get my prints scanned and then it can hardly ever scan my print successfully. So I gave up using fingerprints altogether. So I scan your code, and it wants me to do the whole fingerprinting thing with my phone in order to set it up. It doesn't give me the option to use the security that I did choose to use with my phone. Please advise how I can get 2FA without doing all of this. Thanks.

I did not sniff in the restore constraints yet... What a mess&nbsp;! Looking at the frequency the Firefox's upgrade arrives, it would be advisable to automatically  preserve the user's parameters.

I am writing to inform you of a critical security breach that has occurred in my Mozilla Firefox password manager and to request immediate action to improve your security protocols. I have been a loyal user of Mozilla Firefox for years and have trusted your organization with my sensitive data. However, I am extremely concerned about the recent incident and its potential implications for me and other users. </p> <ul><li><ul><li>Incident Description:** </li></ul> </li></ul> <p>On the 2nd of june 2023 I noticed a series of unauthorized transactions on my various online accounts. Upon further investigation, I discovered that my password manager, which is integrated into my Mozilla Firefox browser, had been compromised. It appears that an unknown third party gained access to my stored passwords and subsequently used them to access my accounts. </p> <ul><li><ul><li>Impact:** </li></ul> </li></ul> <p>This security breach has had a significant impact on my personal and financial information. I have had to spend considerable time and effort in contacting my banks, credit card companies, and other online service providers to report the unauthorized transactions and secure my accounts. Moreover, I am concerned about the long-term consequences of this breach, as my sensitive information may be misused, leading to identity theft or other malicious activities. </p> <ul><li><ul><li>Request for Security Improvement:** </li></ul> </li></ul> <p>In light of this incident, I would like to request that the Mozilla Data Protection Team take immediate steps to improve the security protocols for the Firefox password manager. This may include: </p><p>1. Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for accessing stored passwords, which would require users to verify their identity through an additional method, such as a one-time code sent via SMS or email. 2. Conducting regular security audits of the password manager infrastructure to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers. 3. Providing users with the option to enable password encryption, ensuring that even if the password manager is compromised, the stored passwords remain unreadable without the correct decryption key. 4. Enhancing user education and awareness about potential security risks and best practices for securing their password manager and other sensitive data. </p> <ul><li><ul><li>Next Steps:** </li></ul> </li></ul> <p>Please acknowledge receipt of this email and provide an update on the actions that the Mozilla Data Protection Team plans to take in response to this incident. Additionally, I would appreciate any guidance on further steps I should take to protect myself and minimize the impact of this security breach. </p><p>I understand that no security system is foolproof, but I believe that it is essential for Mozilla to take this incident seriously and make every effort to ensure that its users can continue to trust the Firefox password manager with their sensitive data. </p><p>I have already filed a complaint with the Romanian police, and they launched an investigation. </p><p>Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon. </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>Baciu Darius-Alexandru Dariusbaciu166@gmail.com 0787403967 </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1583613;,user85406548667003962025318517328605591467
