When I downloaded Firefox on a new computer, I signed in using my gmail account email and password.  I created many passwords and bookmarks.  I wanted to sync my phone and laptop to this account but I already had an account on my laptop.  My new computer all of a sudden notified my that my log in was disconnected.  I signed back in to my account and now it is only showing my bookmarks and passwords that were on my laptop and not my new computer.  I only want the things I have added to my new computer and not what was on the laptop.  How to I retrieve the bookmarks and passwords that I had set up prior to Firefox disconnecting me? </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",treysnyder27
