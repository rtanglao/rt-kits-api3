Now my extensions in the toolbar have vanished, and I can't figure out how to pin them back. I read online instructions and saw a couple of videos, and they basically suggest that I click on ""customize toolbar"", then drag the addons onto the bar. Except that in my screen, my addons don't show up in the selections, so I can't drag them up. The addons are installed, and the weird thing is that I have ONE addon on the toolbar, but if I unpin it, it also doesn't show up in the possible selections (I had to press undo to keep it).

Certain different chromium based modern windows browsers have different experimental flag settings that let you choose different background settings instead of all or none like firefox seems to do. I'm enclosing a couple screenshot's of what I'm referring to when I'm using the microsoft edge chromium based browser for your reference. In the attached image while using firefox while viewing the msnbc webpage, currently the displayed colors are totally out of balance. Thanks in advance for any suggestions and help that gets provided to me. David </p>",desktop;beta;tips;windows-11;firefox-1130;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",davy49

Although I use ONE Mozilla account, I was able to get automatic sign on for TWO different systems. This meant that I was not automatically logged into the other account as long as I was on the appropriate device. </p><p><strong>After Update</strong>: Auto-login is only working on my main system's Firefox (without new update). I now have to re-log into my production YT account manually. The reason I can identify this was after the update is because I now have an ""old Firefox data"" folder on my desktop, aswell as all my extensions being re-installed. </p><p><strong>Considerations/Clarifications</strong> - I do <em>not </em>mean auto-fill passwords. I mean that my account is already ready to go when I access the YT site. - I use a few security extensions. I understand that these may have an impact on my browser's ability to save passwords. However, for the past 7 years, this has never been a problem given similar extensions. </p><pre>    - Extension List: Privacy Badger, Adblock, Adblock plus, Adblock for YT, DuckDuckGo privacy essentials,  Facebook container, and Decentraleyes. </pre> <p>Any help is appreciated. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",alendrik18
