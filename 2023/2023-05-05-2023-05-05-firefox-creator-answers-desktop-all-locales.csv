Although I use ONE Mozilla account, I was able to get automatic sign on for TWO different systems. This meant that I was not automatically logged into the other account as long as I was on the appropriate device. </p><p><strong>After Update</strong>: Auto-login is only working on my main system's Firefox (without new update). I now have to re-log into my production YT account manually. The reason I can identify this was after the update is because I now have an ""old Firefox data"" folder on my desktop, aswell as all my extensions being re-installed. </p><p><strong>Considerations/Clarifications</strong> - I do <em>not </em>mean auto-fill passwords. I mean that my account is already ready to go when I access the YT site. - I use a few security extensions. I understand that these may have an impact on my browser's ability to save passwords. However, for the past 7 years, this has never been a problem given similar extensions. </p><pre>    - Extension List: Privacy Badger, Adblock, Adblock plus, Adblock for YT, DuckDuckGo privacy essentials,  Facebook container, and Decentraleyes. </pre> <p>Any help is appreciated. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",alendrik18

I think it could be a javascript issue. </p><p>The easiest place to see this is the ""new Gist"" page on <a href=""http://gist.github.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gist.github.com</a>. The filename field (uses javascript) renders the backtick on top of the following character. The code field (not javascript) renders it correctly. See the screenshot. </p><p>My input source is English (US) and I have dead keys disabled. I have the same issue on different machines running Ubuntu, but not on Firefox on a machine running macos. I don't have the problem in other browsers on the Ubuntu machines. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",linux;desktop;beta;website-breakages;firefox-1130;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1578947;1578950;1578954;,twharrop

But sometimes I'm forced to use Safari because the page I'm looking at doesn't lay out properly. There's text on top of text, etc. But things lay out fine on Safari. I don't want to give up Firefox but I need to be able to read the page. Is there a fix for this? </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,other,en-US,1578907;1578922;,literarypen
