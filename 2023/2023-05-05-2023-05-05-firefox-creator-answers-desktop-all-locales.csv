But sometimes I'm forced to use Safari because the page I'm looking at doesn't lay out properly. There's text on top of text, etc. But things lay out fine on Safari. I don't want to give up Firefox but I need to be able to read the page. Is there a fix for this? </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,other,en-US,1578907;,literarypen
