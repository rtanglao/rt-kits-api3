I MUST USE CCLEANER THAT USES THE QUESTION - THIS IS TAKING TOO LONG, DO YOU WANT TO FORCE  CLOSE? (BECAUSE CCLEANER NEEDS TO CLOSE FIREFOX TO CLEAN COOKIES) AND THEN THAT WAY IS THE ONLY WAY TO HAVE ALL MY TABS BACK. BUT THERE ARE TIMES THAT TABS GET CLOSE SUDDENLY AND I LOOSE ALL MY TABS. </p><pre>THIS MEANS THAT THE WAY FIREFOX CLOSES THE TABS IS FAR FROM GOOD, AND THEY CAUSE TO CLOSE ALL TABS, OR THEY JUST HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO DO IT RIGHT. </pre> <p>DO YOU KNOW ANY WAY TO CONTACT MOZILLA OR FIREFOX TO REPORT THE PROBLEM? IT IS A SHAME THAT A BROWSER DOES NOT OFFER FREE TECH SUPPORT- AND I CANNOT EVEN TELL THEM!! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1170;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ldubcovsky
