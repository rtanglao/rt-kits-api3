Some websites creates a little popup window in the top right corner of my browser ""Log into your Google account"" and I cannot figure how to make this PERMANENTLY stop doing it. I just click the ""X"" to avoid doing so, but I wish to have this stop happening before uninstalling my Firefox browser completely. I'm here only because I have lost patience with that feature and lost patience trying to figure out how to stop it. Please, help, anyone. Thank you.  </p><p>(image attached) </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1601856;,hap317

Es la mejor extension para firefox para bajar video que he usado, ya que en determinados videos (los que se van bajando a trocitos) los va almacenando temporalmente y al terminar los une en un solo .mp4. Pero desde hace un par de meses, SOLO veo ""CONVERT"" donde antes ponia ""DOWNLOAD"". Al dar en ""CONVERT"" me dice que instale un modulo ""FVD_Downloader_Module_1.0.8.msi"", pero aun instalandole me sigue apareciendo ""CONVERT"" y no puedo descargar el video. Necesito saber como volver a poder descargar esos videos que se van descargando a trocitos con extension .M4s como por ejemplo el: <a href=""https://www.rtve.es/play/videos/lazos-de-sangre/mecano/6940737/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.rtve.es/play/videos/lazos-de-sangre/mecano/6940737/</a> O sea, que vuelva a aparecer ""Download"" en vez de ""Convert"" en todos los videos.
