I have just recently switched to firefox and in the few days that I have been using the browser it keeps crashing on me with the reasoning of my profile being corrupted. I will attach an image of the error message below (Unfortunately it is in German, but it roughly translates to: ""The use of a older Firefox-Version can lead to corrupt bookmarks and chronics of the Firefox-Profile. Protect this information, by making a new profile for this installation of Firefox."") What I tried to fix this issue: - Restaring Firefox (Message persists) - Reinstalling Firefox - Reinstalling Firefox after deleting all files </p><p>Both firefox reinstallations were with the newest version. The profile that I made for Firefox was made just a few days ago, so I am very confused how this can already be so corrupted. I hope there is something I can do to fix this, I am really enjoying this browser. (；′⌒`) Greetings, Leonie </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",leonie.deporta

Even when I go to <a href=""http://Google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Google.com</a> it will still reroute to Bing.  I searched the forums for solutions and none worked.  I couldn't even get into Add-ons and Themes.  I would just get a blank page.   </p><p><br> Resolution: Finally I decided the best way to deal with this is to delete and re-install Firefox.  I saved my Bookmarks first.  Then I went to install/uninstall and went to uninstall Firefox, but it gave me another option when I hit it to Refresh Firefox.  I chose that option and it reset Firefox to all default/original settings.  I didn't even have to import Bookmarks as it kept them and 2 of the Add-ons that I use were optioned to reinstall.  The only thing I ended up doing was adding the Menu Bar back on and adding a home page button under Customize Toolbar. </p><p>Hope this helps others. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",unitedjoe1

I know this may be a Microsoft issue or question but I'm having trouble in finding a reasonable way to contact them for help.  My question is, my computer runs slow, and so I thought I would clean up my files by using the Microsoft disk clean up procedure. I did so. But, my specific question is what is a good number to have when the it says a given number of disk space can be cleaned up? For example, I believe when I first tried to clean the disk it said 5.1 GB of disk space could be cleaned. When I ran the disk clean process and it completed it then said 66 KB of disk space could be cleaned. So how much disk space did I gain or get cleaned up? And, if I can only clean up 66 KB of disk space is that indicative of not really needing to clean the disk any farther? Hopefully some one can help. While this may be a Microsoft issue, I believe the Firefox contributors have enough computer knowledge to help answer my question. At least that is my hope. Thank you. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1150;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1598693;,sciencemagic
