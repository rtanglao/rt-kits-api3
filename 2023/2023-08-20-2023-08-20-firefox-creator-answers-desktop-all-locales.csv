I know this may be a Microsoft issue or question but I'm having trouble in finding a reasonable way to contact them for help.  My question is, my computer runs slow, and so I thought I would clean up my files by using the Microsoft disk clean up procedure. I did so. But, my specific question is what is a good number to have when the it says a given number of disk space can be cleaned up? For example, I believe when I first tried to clean the disk it said 5.1 GB of disk space could be cleaned. When I ran the disk clean process and it completed it then said 66 KB of disk space could be cleaned. So how much disk space did I gain or get cleaned up? And, if I can only clean up 66 KB of disk space is that indicative of not really needing to clean the disk any farther? Hopefully some one can help. While this may be a Microsoft issue, I believe the Firefox contributors have enough computer knowledge to help answer my question. At least that is my hope. Thank you. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1150;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",sciencemagic

Could someone please walk me through how to do this without messing up the old version and it's original profile?  It's really important that I'm able to keep that old version exactly as it is.
