Please Delete My Account.,"<p>Yesterday, using the Firefox app on my iPhone, I changed the primary email address of my Firefox account and entered the confirmation code that I received. Then I entered a secondary email address in my Firefox account and confirmed it, too. Next I successfully enabled two factor authentication for my Firefox account and created backup authentication codes, also. Everything seemed to work fine. But when I opened the iOS Firefox app later that night, I saw a small warning triangle in the lower right hand corner of the browser. When I clicked on it, I saw a message that said “Enter your password to connect “. But after configuring everything on my Firefox account in the iOS Firefox app, I hadn’t signed out. So it seemed strange that I was being told that I needed to sign in, again. When I clicked on that message, a screen appeared that said, “Sync and Save Data - Sign In with Your Camera - On your computer open Firefox and go to <a href=""http://firefox.com/pair”"" rel=""nofollow"">firefox.com/pair”</a>. Under that message, there were two buttons, one that read “Ready to Scan” and another that read “Use Email Instead”. Since I’m exclusively using an iPhone, I didn’t have a computer to use so that I could scan the QR code. So I clicked on “Use Email Instead”, thinking that I’d be able to sign in that way. But instead of a normal sign in screen, I was shown one that said “Set your password - Account no longer exists. Recreate it?” That message was prominently displayed in a red box over my old email address (?). What is that doing there, I thought to myself. At the bottom of the screen, I was instructed to “Choose what to sync” with check boxes beside the words “Bookmarks - History - Open Tabs - Passwords”. And under that was a final click box that read “Create account”. This has taken up way too much of my time tonight. I’ve tried everything, but I can’t get my Firefox account to work properly. I’ve even tried to delete it numerous times. But each time I got the error message that my password was incorrect. So then I reset my password. But again when I tried to delete my account, I got an error message saying that my password was incorrect. And so on and so on and so on. I give up. I’ll just go back to using Safari. I never had this many problems when I used it. Since your system won’t let me delete my account, please do it for me. The email addresses that I’ve tried to use to get my Firefox account to work correctly are jonathan.t.davis@gmail.com and web.services@skiff.com and my.web.accounts@icloud.con. I hope that you’ll delete my account soon. I don’t like leaving stray accounts open across the internet. In my experience, sooner or later there’s a network breach at some organization and my email addresses and other information are divulged. Thank you, Jonathan Davis </p><p>P.S. It’s late and I’m tired, but I wanted to tell you, don’t be fooled by the last screenshot. I’ve supposedly successfully deleted my account several times. But when I try to create a new account using any of the email addresses above, your somehow magically resurrects my “deleted” account over and over again. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jonathan.t.davis

I have just recently switched to firefox and in the few days that I have been using the browser it keeps crashing on me with the reasoning of my profile being corrupted. I will attach an image of the error message below (Unfortunately it is in German, but it roughly translates to: ""The use of a older Firefox-Version can lead to corrupt bookmarks and chronics of the Firefox-Profile. Protect this information, by making a new profile for this installation of Firefox."") What I tried to fix this issue: - Restaring Firefox (Message persists) - Reinstalling Firefox - Reinstalling Firefox after deleting all files </p><p>Both firefox reinstallations were with the newest version. The profile that I made for Firefox was made just a few days ago, so I am very confused how this can already be so corrupted. I hope there is something I can do to fix this, I am really enjoying this browser. (；′⌒`) Greetings, Leonie </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",leonie.deporta

I couldn't even get into Add-ons and Themes.  I would just get a blank page.   </p><p><br> Resolution: Finally I decided the best way to deal with this is to delete and re-install Firefox.  I saved my Bookmarks first.  Then I went to install/uninstall and went to uninstall Firefox, but it gave me another option when I hit it to Refresh Firefox.  I chose that option and it reset Firefox to all default/original settings.  I didn't even have to import Bookmarks as it kept them and 2 of the Add-ons that I use were optioned to reinstall.  The only thing I ended up doing was adding the Menu Bar back on and adding a home page button under Customize Toolbar. </p><p>Hope this helps others. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",unitedjoe1

I know this may be a Microsoft issue or question but I'm having trouble in finding a reasonable way to contact them for help.  My question is, my computer runs slow, and so I thought I would clean up my files by using the Microsoft disk clean up procedure. I did so. But, my specific question is what is a good number to have when the it says a given number of disk space can be cleaned up? For example, I believe when I first tried to clean the disk it said 5.1 GB of disk space could be cleaned. When I ran the disk clean process and it completed it then said 66 KB of disk space could be cleaned. So how much disk space did I gain or get cleaned up? And, if I can only clean up 66 KB of disk space is that indicative of not really needing to clean the disk any farther? Hopefully some one can help. While this may be a Microsoft issue, I believe the Firefox contributors have enough computer knowledge to help answer my question. At least that is my hope.
