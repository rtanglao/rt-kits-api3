Wanted to check and see if any new options have become available since then. My preferred method of bookmarking new pages is to drag them into nested folders for ease of organization and finding them later. However, the bookmark menus are extremely sensitive to cursor placement and close VERY quickly if you accidentally go outside the boundaries. Is there a way to slow that down so it's less fussy? Thank you. Running Windows 10 and FF 114.0.1 64 bit. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1140;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",jehully33
