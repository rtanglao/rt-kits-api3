Manager truncates it to a simple dot com which brings up a ""403 - Forbidden: Access is denied."" error message.  I have a bookmark that takes me to the correct login page, but Manager doesn't recognize it and won't suggest a login for it. For example: this page url is ""<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/new/desktop/form"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/new/desktop/form</a>"" PassManager would truncate this to ""<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org</a>"" If I try to submit a new password, in the manager, it tells me there is already a site EVEN IF I HAVE DELETED THAT FAULTY SITE. This is a real problem and it happens on more than one site which makes the manager a limited feature. Unfortunately that makes my preference in using a Mozilla product (rather than Roboform etc) a distinct liability.  Please give this some thought, thank you. </p><p>I would also like to see the manager remember the answers to secondary security questions on some websites login pages, if that were possible. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,other,en-US,"",GomerF

This feature is very useful for sharing lists of URL's with a study group, for example.  However, the URL appears in the 'Name' field as well as the 'Location' field and this is sometimes unhelpful.  </p><p>Is there a way I can format the text file with 'Name', 'Tags' and 'Location' fields separated, so that the list can be copied and pasted correctly.

I use Firefox 102.12.0esr (64 bit) on my Macbook and I would like to download the names and phones of the chats I’ve joined on Whatsapp.  </p><p>It can be done by hand and by taking screenshots (of course), but if there are dozens of contacts it is a problem.&nbsp;:(  </p><p>On the net I've found that with a Chrome extension you can do it (I assume) easily, but -if possible- I'd like to avoid Chrome which I really don't like. ... but if there are no alternatives .... I’ll make a virtue of necessity!  </p><p>So I ask if anyone knows and has already done this with Firefox.  I specify that I haven't found anything suitable in the list of FF extensions (I use an almost ""clean"" FF, ie I only have three or four add-ons).  </p><p><strong>Off-thread comment</strong> Despite assuming that FF is still one of the most widespread and popular browsers - updates of even the most important extensions and add-ons always lag behind FF updates or even this items aren’t updated at all. I fear that this aspect will lead to a progressive shift from FF to Chrome and obviously this is a pity (even if I'm not a compulsive user of extensions!!). Don’t you agree? (Sorry for this complaint!) </p><p>Looking forward to your suggestions about my request.

Wanted to check and see if any new options have become available since then. My preferred method of bookmarking new pages is to drag them into nested folders for ease of organization and finding them later. However, the bookmark menus are extremely sensitive to cursor placement and close VERY quickly if you accidentally go outside the boundaries. Is there a way to slow that down so it's less fussy?
