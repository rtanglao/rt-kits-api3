But lately, it isn't usable for me. Seemingly happened out of nowhere within the past few weeks.  </p><p>I tried all the troubleshooting steps in the guides on your support forum, but nothing worked. So I tried the following: </p><p>1. Uninstalled Firefox using Windows Uninstaller 2. Deleted every single Mozilla folder from within the user profile to the program files folders, local roaming folders, etc. - EVERYTHING.  3. Went into the Windows Registry and also deleted Mozilla folders within the local machine and current user folders. 4. Rebooted computer 5. Went to <a href=""http://Getfirefox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Getfirefox.com</a> and reinstalled Firefox.  6. Logged into a brand spanking new Firefox installation </p><p>Still SLOW as molasses. Frustrating. I can't work. It is literally 4x slower than any other browser now. I use Firefox for 90% of my web stuff, the other browsers 10% of the time for testing. But as it goes now, I cannot use Firefox anymore after decades of using it.  </p><p>Anything else I can try? Maybe I missed something when I scrubbed it and reinstalled? Why suddenly is it this slow? Any ideas?  </p><p>I will try next to log into a different Windows profile I guess and see if that improves it. Maybe my Windows profile is jacked up, although, I thought removing all Mozilla folders from within my Windows profile would be enough, so I am not so sure that will fix it. I will try though. </p><p>Any help you can provide would be much appreciated.  </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Mark </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1598042;,markob17
