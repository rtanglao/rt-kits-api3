So I tried the following: </p><p>1. Uninstalled Firefox using Windows Uninstaller 2.

Went to <a href=""http://Getfirefox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Getfirefox.com</a> and reinstalled Firefox.  6. Logged into a brand spanking new Firefox installation </p><p>Still SLOW as molasses. Frustrating. I can't work. It is literally 4x slower than any other browser now. I use Firefox for 90% of my web stuff, the other browsers 10% of the time for testing. But as it goes now, I cannot use Firefox anymore after decades of using it.  </p><p>Anything else I can try? Maybe I missed something when I scrubbed it and reinstalled? Why suddenly is it this slow? Any ideas?  </p><p>I will try next to log into a different Windows profile I guess and see if that improves it. Maybe my Windows profile is jacked up, although, I thought removing all Mozilla folders from within my Windows profile would be enough, so I am not so sure that will fix it.
