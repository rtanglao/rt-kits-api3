Considering this, I can tranquilly say there is no bug or problem with my account as I thought. It's a pity that Firefox no longer support Gravatar integration, and even if I use an old version I will face the same ""issue"" because the Gravatar integration was a online feature linked to the Firefox account, not to the browser itself. </p><p>Info source: <a href=""https://github.com/mozilla/fxa/issues/15665"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mozilla/fxa/issues/15665</a> </p><p>- - - </p><p>Admins can now archive and close this thread, I only ask to keep it online to help who may need this information in the future.

If the user never places a check mark in Remember this decision the Alert will not popup. I have looked thru the forums and looked over the interwebs to see if anyone else mentions this issue but have found nothing. </p><p>Why does this Alert message popup, how can we get rid of this popup message? Is it a setting in Firefox somewhere? I don't know what has changed between 93.x and 115.1.x so I am unsure what to check or setting to try to eliminate this popup.

But lately, it isn't usable for me. Seemingly happened out of nowhere within the past few weeks.  </p><p>I tried all the troubleshooting steps in the guides on your support forum, but nothing worked. So I tried the following: </p><p>1. Uninstalled Firefox using Windows Uninstaller 2. Deleted every single Mozilla folder from within the user profile to the program files folders, local roaming folders, etc. - EVERYTHING.  3. Went into the Windows Registry and also deleted Mozilla folders within the local machine and current user folders. 4. Rebooted computer 5. Went to <a href=""http://Getfirefox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Getfirefox.com</a> and reinstalled Firefox.  6. Logged into a brand spanking new Firefox installation </p><p>Still SLOW as molasses. Frustrating. I can't work. It is literally 4x slower than any other browser now. I use Firefox for 90% of my web stuff, the other browsers 10% of the time for testing. But as it goes now, I cannot use Firefox anymore after decades of using it.  </p><p>Anything else I can try? Maybe I missed something when I scrubbed it and reinstalled? Why suddenly is it this slow? Any ideas?  </p><p>I will try next to log into a different Windows profile I guess and see if that improves it. Maybe my Windows profile is jacked up, although, I thought removing all Mozilla folders from within my Windows profile would be enough, so I am not so sure that will fix it. I will try though. </p><p>Any help you can provide would be much appreciated.  </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Mark </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1598042;1598057;,markob17
