I unlock my system and feel some kind of slowness in Firefox. When I switch from the currently open tab in Firefox, the new tab is highlighted in the tab bar, but the content part of the window is frozen. If I quickly open htop, I can see that the main Firefox process is suddenly using about 130% of my CPU. The only solution I have found is to quickly open htop after unlocking the system, send a SIGKILL to the main Firefox process and reopen it. This way the freezing, slowing problem is nowhere to be seen. </p><p>I am running Debian 12 with Firefox 115.4.0esr (64-bit).
