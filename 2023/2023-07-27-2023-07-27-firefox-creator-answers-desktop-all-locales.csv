After a Win Update a couple of months ago (when Edge went all AI-Bing), the Firefox icon had disappeared from the taskbar.  I can open FF from the start menu or the desktop shortcut, and I can pin FF to the taskbar from either, by dragging or right-clicking, but as soon as I close FF, the icon is removed from the taskbar.  This doesn't happen with Edge, MS365 or WMP, or with HP's scanner software icon.  The icons remain on the taskbar, but FF is removed automatically when it is closed.  What am I doing wrong? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,other,en-US,"",dadinmenston
