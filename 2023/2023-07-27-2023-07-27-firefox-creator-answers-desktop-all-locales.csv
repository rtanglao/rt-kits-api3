Once video is loaded and playing, If I pause it then unpause it they take a good 3-4 seconds to continue.","<p>Recently, my FireFox has been acting a bit strange when it comes to playing videos. I am using a site called Udemy to watch a video course I'm taking, however, the videos don't seem to play for either a long time, or until I tab into YouTube and play a video there. </p><p>This issue is not only with Udemy however, as the YouTube videos also take longer than normal to start playing; It's not only at the start of the video either (whilst waiting for the video to fully load), It's all the time, between every pause I have to wait around 3-4 seconds before It actually start playing. </p><p>The issue is clearly something to do with videos but I find it very strange that playing a YouTube video forces my Udemy video to load.  </p><p>It's been a real struggle trying to get todays course day done, since every time I pause the video I end up having to wait a while or go to YouTube and play a video to make it continue. </p><p>I've gone through all the basic troubleshooting recommended for video issues on here and other places: Turn of hardware encoding, lower security levels, enabling autoplay etc etc; absolutely no luck. I've tried disabling extensions one by one, disabling themes, running FireFox in troubleshoot mode, clearing all data/history/cookies/cache, making sure DRM-controlled content is enabled as well as trying it disabled. You name it, I feel like I've tried it at this point... Any suggestions are highly appreciated! </p><p>Another thing to add is Chrome isn't having this issue, neither is Safari. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1150;firefox-11503;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",cyfai

I have never seen any browser that actually does this, and I have never found any way to get Firefox to do it. Quite a few sites don't work correctly if I set strong cookie protection. I don't want to disable this, but I would like to allow a cookie to be set if I think that particular cookie is acceptable to me. In particular one bank that I use has it web site spread across multiple domains and as a result its ""remember me"" login option doesn't work with third party cookies disabled: I presume that this is because it tries to set a cookie on a domain which is also owned by that bank but is different from the domain of the login page. </p><p>Allowing third party cookies per-site would not be enough because many sites use third party scripts which try to set their own cookies to track users across different sites. IMHO this breaches the GDPR, but the regulators aren't willing to do anything about it. </p><p>I can see what cookies have been set using the Cookie Quick Manager extension, but that only tells me after the event, and then only if I look. It isn't practical to look after every interaction. </p><p>Can we please have an option (preferably per-site or per-container) which allows a user to intercept each attempt to set a cookie and decide whether to allow it. </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1593333;,rparkins
