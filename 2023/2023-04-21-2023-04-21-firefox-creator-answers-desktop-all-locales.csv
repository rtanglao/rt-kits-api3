I've tried downloading the .xpi and .zip and uploading those to the ""Install Add-on From File"" option in the themes section of about:addons, but it says it couldn't be installed because it's corrupt. Any help would be greatly appreciated </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1120;firefox-11201;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",altizer16
