This seems small but on a taskbar we can differentiate the instances faster. </p><p>Why is that the best option for managing profiles in Firefox is the <a href=""https://github.com/null-dev/firefox-profile-switcher"" rel=""nofollow"">Firefox Profile Switcher</a>, a third-party tool supported by a community member? </p><p>Will this ever be addressed? Firefox is better than the others in so many things but, for example, even Safari implemented Profiles now. </p><p>To be clear: containers are NOT the same thing as profiles and profiles still have an usage. For example, my work profile has no syncs, different extensions and stricter configurations than my personal profile and this cannot be done with containers. </p><p>Thank you! </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1190;,firefox,customize,en-US,1616783;,paulorafael62

The picture keeps ""jumping"" fast up and down in a very bothering way. This doesn't happen when the video is NOT live. I run the latest version of LINUX MINT. What can I do to fix it? The only way I found to stop the issue is to take down the resolution of the live video to its minimum which gives me a disastrous picture but stops the ""jumping"". I guess you might say there is something wrong with my GPU. The point is that my PC is brand new with an AMD 5600G, new MB, 16Gb of RAM and 500w of PSU. BUT more than anything  I have to say that everything WORKS FINE with CHROME. I like FIREFOX I have been using it literally for decades now. (I'm 75). Is there a solution?

I have attached a screenshot there is not much there because my husband deleted all data but imagine my surprise after 1.5 hours to see all the web sites i visited listed the cookies too an zero storage?
