Inside Manage Cookies and Data my Storage is blank nothing is showing and yet the sites I visited are listed as well as the cookies. I have cleared everything hoping to start over would resolve this. My husband has a separate profile on our desktop computer with Windows 10 We have the same setting and yet he is not experiencing this at all. At the end of a session which is usually 1.5 hours I delete the sites that are taking up storage in the MB numbers but for the last 3 days the sites are listed again as are the cookies but under storage nothing? I have attached a screenshot there is not much there because my husband deleted all data but imagine my surprise after 1.5 hours to see all the web sites i visited listed the cookies too an zero storage? I tried to troubleshoot this but could not find anything about it on the Internet.  I sincerely hope you can resolve the issue. And yes I have most recent version of FF Thank you in advance. Sincerely, Jamie Dorfman </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jamie.dorfman

After that, I booted up the PC, everything worked completely fine and I was able to listen to Youtube / Twitch / Spotify etc. through Firefox. </p><p>This morning I boot up the PC, everything still works perfectly and I have audio coming from all other sources EXCEPT for Firefox. I have browsed every forum already but can not find anything that relates to me. I can't set my output device, since Firefox doesn't show up in the volume mixer. The tabs aren't muted. I have restarted Audiosrv and Windows Explorer several times. I have re-installed Firefox twice. I have tried booting it in safemode. All of the above hasn't resulted in a single second of audio. I am at a loss. </p><p>Kind regards, Siem Hoefnagels </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",siem5512

I really don't want to go through the process of fixing and reuploading them, I'd apprecate you looking into this and hopefully fixing it with a simple update.

First things first, I was welcomed with a ""Thank you for installing AdBlock"" page. Which wouldn't be all that odd if I didn't use Ublock Origin instead. I removed the extension, ready to move on, but then I noticed all my bookmarks in the toolbar were gone! The ones saved to other bookmarks are still there, but the ones on my toolbar are deleted and not hidden. While I was investigating that, I found that my history looks weird? It's a bunch of pages on Nexus Mods that I visited a month ago or so but haven't visited recently.  </p><p>Only my three devices, PC, phone, and Steam deck are logged in, but I'm worried my account has been compromised.
