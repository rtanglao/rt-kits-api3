This seems small but on a taskbar we can differentiate the instances faster. </p><p>Why is that the best option for managing profiles in Firefox is the <a href=""https://github.com/null-dev/firefox-profile-switcher"" rel=""nofollow"">Firefox Profile Switcher</a>, a third-party tool supported by a community member? </p><p>Will this ever be addressed? Firefox is better than the others in so many things but, for example, even Safari implemented Profiles now. </p><p>To be clear: containers are NOT the same thing as profiles and profiles still have an usage. For example, my work profile has no syncs, different extensions and stricter configurations than my personal profile and this cannot be done with containers. </p><p>Thank you! </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1190;,firefox,customize,en-US,1616783;,paulorafael62

The picture keeps ""jumping"" fast up and down in a very bothering way. This doesn't happen when the video is NOT live. I run the latest version of LINUX MINT. What can I do to fix it? The only way I found to stop the issue is to take down the resolution of the live video to its minimum which gives me a disastrous picture but stops the ""jumping"". I guess you might say there is something wrong with my GPU. The point is that my PC is brand new with an AMD 5600G, new MB, 16Gb of RAM and 500w of PSU. BUT more than anything  I have to say that everything WORKS FINE with CHROME. I like FIREFOX I have been using it literally for decades now. (I'm 75). Is there a solution? Looking forward to hearing from you. Thanks in advance. François. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,other,en-US,1616788;,rassfranc

Inside Manage Cookies and Data my Storage is blank nothing is showing and yet the sites I visited are listed as well as the cookies. I have cleared everything hoping to start over would resolve this. My husband has a separate profile on our desktop computer with Windows 10 We have the same setting and yet he is not experiencing this at all. At the end of a session which is usually 1.5 hours I delete the sites that are taking up storage in the MB numbers but for the last 3 days the sites are listed again as are the cookies but under storage nothing? I have attached a screenshot there is not much there because my husband deleted all data but imagine my surprise after 1.5 hours to see all the web sites i visited listed the cookies too an zero storage? I tried to troubleshoot this but could not find anything about it on the Internet.  I sincerely hope you can resolve the issue. And yes I have most recent version of FF Thank you in advance.

After that, I booted up the PC, everything worked completely fine and I was able to listen to Youtube / Twitch / Spotify etc. through Firefox. </p><p>This morning I boot up the PC, everything still works perfectly and I have audio coming from all other sources EXCEPT for Firefox. I have browsed every forum already but can not find anything that relates to me. I can't set my output device, since Firefox doesn't show up in the volume mixer. The tabs aren't muted. I have restarted Audiosrv and Windows Explorer several times. I have re-installed Firefox twice. I have tried booting it in safemode. All of the above hasn't resulted in a single second of audio. I am at a loss. </p><p>Kind regards, Siem Hoefnagels </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",siem5512
