First things first, I was welcomed with a ""Thank you for installing AdBlock"" page. Which wouldn't be all that odd if I didn't use Ublock Origin instead. I removed the extension, ready to move on, but then I noticed all my bookmarks in the toolbar were gone! The ones saved to other bookmarks are still there, but the ones on my toolbar are deleted and not hidden. While I was investigating that, I found that my history looks weird? It's a bunch of pages on Nexus Mods that I visited a month ago or so but haven't visited recently.  </p><p>Only my three devices, PC, phone, and Steam deck are logged in, but I'm worried my account has been compromised. I've changed my password and am trying to get two-factor authentication up. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1190;,firefox,other,en-US,1616744;,Mia_bionerd_manateelover_awfulartist
