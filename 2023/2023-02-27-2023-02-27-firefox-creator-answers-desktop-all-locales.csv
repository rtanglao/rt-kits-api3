To do this, I need to import my passwords from Chrome to Firefox, and have them sync between the Firefoxes on all 3 of my devices, but it's not working. I have tried the following: </p><p>Method 1: I installed Chrome on my new Linux machine. Checked and made sure it had synced my passwords by logging into a website using Chrome. Then, on Firefox, I pressed alt to enable the toolbar, then File-&gt;Import from another browser. The pop-up says ""No programs that contain bookmarks, history, or password data could be found.""  </p><p>Method 2: Chrome seems to have a feature to export the passwords to csv. So I exported the passwords from Chrome to a csv on Linux. To be thorough (because I am having trouble getting this to work), I used <a href=""http://accounts.firefox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">accounts.firefox.com</a> to sign out the Firefox on my android phone and chromebook, then (on the phone) I deleted my browsing data, uninstalled firefox, and rebooted the phone. Back on Linux, I did about:config, then set signon.management.page.fileImport.enabled to true, then did about:logins then menu-&gt;""import from a file"", selected the csv that I just exported from Chrome, and clicked Import. Import Complete, 332 logins added, 1 not added because it was missing a password. Logins successfully imported, hooray! For testing purposes, I create a unique new password entry, <a href=""http://foo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://foo.com</a> username ""a"" password ""b"". Then I go to about:preferences, make sure that syncing is on and I'm currently syncing logins and passwords, and press ""sync now"". Log in to my phone, install Firefox from the play store, start it up, sign in using my email and password (it says ""syncing""), go to logins and passwords, click ""saved logins"". The only one listed is for <a href=""http://foo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">foo.com</a>, the fake one I created to test the syncing, but I expected to see all 333 there.  </p><p>How do I get this to work? </p>",linux;desktop;sync;firefox-1100;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",jbayes

This includes Wells Fargo, Citibank, Synchronicity, and Fidelity. I don't need help reading what a secure connection failure notice means. I've read it ad there is no help for how to solve it, except to contact the website owner. Since this effects all financial sites I've tried, I don't see how the sites could be the problem or it would be a massive problem and I would be able to find solutions via google search. </p><p>The problem is about 1 to 2 weeks old.  </p><p>I have cleared my browser cookies and cache, as much as i hate to do that, because all my saved other site log-ins are wiped. But I've done it. I'm on the latest version of Firefox. I've turned off my Norton Firewall.  </p><p>I also cannot connect via Chrome, or Edge. Edge just loaded a second authentication page for Wells Fargo asking my to verify my identity, but the page is blank except for the page name and the company logo. Same thing just happened in the Firefox browser. I can't verify my identity because the page doesn't contain the method to verify. It's blank. </p><p>I've also tried requiring SSL in Firefox for all sites.  </p><p>I'm not finding anything on the web about Norton security creating this problem recently either. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1100;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1567868;,mhemhauser65

I just recently upgraded my O.S. to Catalina. I did this primarily because my old firefox would no longer update. I did the upgrade to Catalina then downloaded ""new"" firefox. I have both ""versions"" of firefox available. the old one with all my bookmarks etc. and the new one with nothing. I hit move bookmarks on the new version but the only options were from chrome or safari. How can I move over the bookmarks to the new one.

Now there is a pause of nearly half a minute between each sheet when printing multi-page PDF files.  This is not a problem with the URLs (the files are local), and not a general printer problem since the same files print fine with Adobe Reader.  I'm not sure what has changed (size of some cache?), but any way of going back to the previous smooth printing would be very much appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1100;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",map65
