I just recently upgraded my O.S. to Catalina. I did this primarily because my old firefox would no longer update. I did the upgrade to Catalina then downloaded ""new"" firefox. I have both ""versions"" of firefox available. the old one with all my bookmarks etc. and the new one with nothing. I hit move bookmarks on the new version but the only options were from chrome or safari. How can I move over the bookmarks to the new one. Thanks </p>",desktop;bookmarks;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-10280;firefox-1028;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",ricko388

I have some folders with multiple addresses on my ""Bookmarks Toolbar"" to check out some sites and accounts daily (Figure 1). Each folder contains more than one page (Figure 2) of bookmarks and I scroll down to open 10-12 addresses each time (Figure 2/3). </p><p>Before the update, there wasn't any problem and when I came back to the folder I could continue from my latest position (on that folder), the positions of the folders reset when I close firefox, but now after some seconds it jumps to the top of the folder and each time I have to scroll down and open some links very fast and while I try to open as much link as l can, it jumps to the top of the folder,  It waste my time and energy. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1567822;,Shpd

Now there is a pause of nearly half a minute between each sheet when printing multi-page PDF files.  This is not a problem with the URLs (the files are local), and not a general printer problem since the same files print fine with Adobe Reader.  I'm not sure what has changed (size of some cache?), but any way of going back to the previous smooth printing would be very much appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1100;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",map65
