On it, with the trading view tools, I draw the charts to get an idea where the price is and might go next.

Even when I logged in the platform away  from home.  No, when I switched to a new laptop with Windows 11, the chart drawings are not being saved reliably, sometimes the drawinmgs stay saved, sometimes not.  Support people on that trading exchange, and on other platforms, connects the saving of the drawings to cache files on the laptop, but does not offer precise direction how to solve the issue.  I am looking for some advice to find the solution?  Is it not saved because of Windows 11?  Is it not saved because of the use of a different laptop on the same IP?  (Pls note, that I knew that I will have to redo the drawings on the charts with the laptop.)  Is it because of the setting of capacity of cache?  Thank you for your guidance and help.

After the most recent Windows update, the first thing that happened was that a message from McAfee (to which I subscribe) popped up.  It was a very good 'Come-on,"" so I clicked it. It took me through doing some scans, then pitched a product that I didn't want to purchase so I closed that window.  That resulted in a new, Firefox window opening, pitching the same product again.  I now don't remember if I closed that pitch window and opened a new Firefox one before trying to restore previous session or if I tried the restore directly from that window but whichever I did, the only window that got restored was that latest McAfee pitch!  Is there any way to get back the old stored Firefox pages from before the system update and my opening that McAfee window?

I have tried all workaround, uninstalled add-ons etc.  </p><p>Was there a sudden change? This will affact my day to day work if meets no longer works.  </p><p>Any information please help </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-109;firefox-7815;firefox-78150;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1617188;,noeler81

Also columns in graphs don't line up.  I'm guessing I set up something incorrectly in Firefox browser settings, but I have no idea what. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,other,en-US,1617186;,maczenith
