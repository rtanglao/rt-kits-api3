It's weird but it seems that at random times some websites will refuse to fully load or even start loading, it appears that the app is just hanging. This is usually fixed after several refreshes. Oddly enough, even on a fresh install, if I attempt to load up the same website while in private browsing, it loads right away, again this is consistent even on a fresh install, the attached image was an attempt to load youtube after signing in on a fresh install without add-ons, I tried loading up youtube in private and it worked right away. Chrome wasn't presenting this problem on my computer for years. Any ideas?  My computer specs are high enough where they shouldn't matter. I'm running an AMD GPU (7900 XTX) but I haven't found any know issues regarding these, to even discard that, I disabled hardware acceleration, but the issue persisted. Running up to date windows 10, installing latest version of firefox. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",gabevt

Youtube says ""YouTube videos are available in many formats and qualities. But, some browsers do not support newer video formats or quality options. This restriction means these browsers may only have one or two video formats to choose from. We recommend upgrading your browser or operating system for the best viewing experience."" This has only happened now and it only happens with Firefox, as when watching videos with Safari 1080p video is available. I am using the latest version of Firefox on a Mac mini with the latest Mac OS installed. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",xenonaut10

I am an old person and have had some memory difficulties in recent years so some of the pages I'd kept open on the taskbar icon had been there for as much as two or more years, but they always came back.  After the most recent Windows update, the first thing that happened was that a message from McAfee (to which I subscribe) popped up.  It was a very good 'Come-on,"" so I clicked it. It took me through doing some scans, then pitched a product that I didn't want to purchase so I closed that window.  That resulted in a new, Firefox window opening, pitching the same product again.  I now don't remember if I closed that pitch window and opened a new Firefox one before trying to restore previous session or if I tried the restore directly from that window but whichever I did, the only window that got restored was that latest McAfee pitch!  Is there any way to get back the old stored Firefox pages from before the system update and my opening that McAfee window? Thank you very much. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,other,en-US,"",smostroff
