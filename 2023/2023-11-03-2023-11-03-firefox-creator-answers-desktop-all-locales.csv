I have had this setup for years with no problems until a couple of months ago.  When I do searches for things and then try clicking on the ""Clickable"" links, I always get a blank page and the string for the website address(s) always begin with something similar to this; ""<a href=""https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p="" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&amp;&amp;p=</a>""; please see image attached. This happens rather I try opening one or many sites/pages for comparison. Below are the steps I have tried &amp; the reasons I believe that the ""clickable"" links are the problem. </p><p>I type in the Bing bar my search topic. Bing will give me a bunch of links related to my search.  If I find the one I want or several I want to check out, I'll click on the 'clickable' link(s) for the page(s).  Bing will automatically open the link(s) in a new tab(s). *I do have my browser set to stay on the page that I am currently working on*. But even if I go to those pages right away, I still always get a blank page. </p><p>I'll use searching for 'IRS help' for my search example:  I have tried several ways to get the links to open &amp; they are as follows:  </p><p>1) Type in the site address myself in the new Tab and use my keyboards 'Enter' key to go to it:  -- This works of course -- But seeing as some address are very long this is not always helpful </p><p>2) Click on the 'Clickable' link for IRS's site: -- Bing will open a new tab itself, but will show a blank page with the link issue listed above when I go to it -- Doesn't work, Blank Page  </p><p>3) Highlight the 'Clickable' link, right click it and select 'Open link in new tab' option: -- Again Bing opens the new tab, Blank page and link issue -- Even selected to open it in a new window and I get the same thing </p><p>4) Highlight/copy the 'Clickable' link, I open a new tab myself, then I right click to 'Paste' link and hit enter: -- Doesn't work, blank page </p><p>5) Highlight/copy the 'Clickable' link, I open a new tab myself, then I right click to 'Paste &amp; Go"" link: -- Doesn't work, blank page </p><p>6) I copy the 'Non-clickable' written out address(i.e. <a href=""http://IRS.gov/help"" rel=""nofollow"">IRS.gov/help</a> for example), Paste it in a new tab that I open and the choose one of these options: -- ""Paste &amp; Go' or 'Paste' and use my keyboards 'Enter' key. -- Both work, no problem -- But when your in a rush, this too can be time consuming. </p><p>Please advise. Is there something I am missing or may have done wrong? I have had Firefox and Bing for a very long time like I said and I truly hate having to use the other browsers, etc. but I need to be able to get things done in a crunch some days and so this is driving me crazy. </p><p>I hope it's just the links and that they can be fixed,  Red </p>",desktop;other;windows-8;firefox-1150;,firefox,other,en-US,1615865;,Hill32905

Again, ONLY happens with Firefox </p><p>But... if the laptop is using the internal screen, it does not happen. So somewhow, perhaps, Firefox with DRM is going out to check the monitor to be sure it will display HDCP and that is when it blanks until FF is sure this will work, and the screen returns. </p><p>I am 99% sure of all this after updating video drivers, dock firmware, etc, etc, etc. </p><p>Can you help? I'd appreiate solving this one. </p><p>~Bob </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-11540;firefox-1154;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1615820;,in4m8n
