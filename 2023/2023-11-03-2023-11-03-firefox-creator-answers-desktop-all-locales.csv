I'm sorry if this has been asked before. I couldn't find it and I'd like to make my point. </p><p>I didn't like the design of Firefox when they first started this design with so much space wasted for tabs and toolbar. Every time I open Firefox it feels odd with gigantic empty spaces if I come from Chrome/Vivaldi which are thoughtfully compact. </p><p><strong>I have 14"" laptop and Firefox makes the UX very less intuitive.</strong> </p><p>As of now, I'm using the workaround for compact mode that was posted in this forum numerous times. It says (not supported) beside compact mode which makes me feel like that this feature is going to be removed completely in the future. That's the tipping point where I will stop using Firefox completely. </p><p>So, coming to the question - wait - Subject is the question... </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1190;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",mani.ganala

It has taken me a LONG LONG time to track this down. Here is what I know. </p> <ul><li> This only happens in Firefox, not Edge for example. </li><li> With DRM off, or Wildivine off, no blank or black screen. FF will not play videos at Hulu or MAX in those cases, but also does not ""disconnect"" the signal to the external monitor. </li><li> This is 100% repeatable. </li></ul> <p>Now I dont want to muddy the waters so someone can point fingers at the issue being somewhere else such as firmware, drivers, etc., but I also want to share as much as I have found. </p><p>I am using a Lenovo laptop (my only PC) through a Lenovo Ultradock to an external Dell Hi Res monitor. The issue happens with either DP or HDMI connections. Cables are new, high speed and high quality and have been swapped out several times. Again, ONLY happens with Firefox </p><p>But... if the laptop is using the internal screen, it does not happen. So somewhow, perhaps, Firefox with DRM is going out to check the monitor to be sure it will display HDCP and that is when it blanks until FF is sure this will work, and the screen returns. </p><p>I am 99% sure of all this after updating video drivers, dock firmware, etc, etc, etc. </p><p>Can you help? I'd appreiate solving this one. </p><p>~Bob </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-11540;firefox-1154;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",in4m8n
