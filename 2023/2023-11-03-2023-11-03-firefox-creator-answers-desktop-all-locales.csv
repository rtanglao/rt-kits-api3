However, if firefox cant talk to websites its obviously useless, so im stumped. </p><p>I have deleted every single folder on my computer firefox uses, including cleaning the registry of its things aswell, so it has to be downloading that script from some server, but i havent been able to figure out from where. I assume its attached to my firefox account because, where else could it be getting the script from? </p><p>When i was installing the user.js script, i had no clue it would be so damn hard to get rid of. Thank fuck i have a backup of my profile. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1190;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",NastyFlytrap

I can’t place any of my extensions on the menu bar anymore. I formatted to switch to Windows 11 23H2 cleanly. My firefox (now mozilla) account, which I had previously synchronized, installed the extensions randomly and my video download manager, which was on the menu bar before, remained in a menu called extensions. I can’t put my extension back on the menu bar from this menu. Installed extensions that shouldn’t appear on the menu bar take up space and I can’t remove them. The address writing section also covers 3/4 of the menu bar and creates a disgusting image. Only your natural function keys can be added and removed. Nothing can be added or removed to the area called menu overflow. Moreover, this area is only visible on the customization screen. So I don’t understand what it does either. I have been using Firefox for almost 20 years and I want this problem to be solved quickly. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1190;,firefox,customize,tr,"",yajeyakilis

It has taken me a LONG LONG time to track this down. Here is what I know. </p> <ul><li> This only happens in Firefox, not Edge for example. </li><li> With DRM off, or Wildivine off, no blank or black screen. FF will not play videos at Hulu or MAX in those cases, but also does not ""disconnect"" the signal to the external monitor. </li><li> This is 100% repeatable. </li></ul> <p>Now I dont want to muddy the waters so someone can point fingers at the issue being somewhere else such as firmware, drivers, etc., but I also want to share as much as I have found. </p><p>I am using a Lenovo laptop (my only PC) through a Lenovo Ultradock to an external Dell Hi Res monitor. The issue happens with either DP or HDMI connections. Cables are new, high speed and high quality and have been swapped out several times. Again, ONLY happens with Firefox </p><p>But... if the laptop is using the internal screen, it does not happen. So somewhow, perhaps, Firefox with DRM is going out to check the monitor to be sure it will display HDCP and that is when it blanks until FF is sure this will work, and the screen returns. </p><p>I am 99% sure of all this after updating video drivers, dock firmware, etc, etc, etc. </p><p>Can you help? I'd appreiate solving this one. </p><p>~Bob </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-11540;firefox-1154;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",in4m8n
