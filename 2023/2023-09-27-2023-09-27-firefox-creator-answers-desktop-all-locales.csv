While I greatly value Mozilla's commitment to innovation, I've found this new feature to be somewhat disruptive to my user experience.  </p><p>I speak different languages and therefore use websites in multiple languages and having this prompt appear multiple times is a bit annoying. I can’t imagine being the only user with this issue. It’s very irritating. </p><p>I didn't find a way to disable this feature in the settings. Is there another way? I know I can modify it by adding languages that I don't want to have translated but I'd like to disable it entirely.

This is a problem because the only time I drag and drop text onto a Firefox windows is a password from my password manager. If I slightly miss the text box, it interprets the password as a URL and tries to go to it. This (a) Does a DNS lookup of the password. As there usually won't be a valid extension, I expect this only gets as far as my router, but it's still not ideal. (b) The page I was on has now gone, replaced with the ""Couldn't connect to server"" page, so I need to start again. Usually this is just a login page, which isn't a massive issue, but if it's a registration page I lose all the data I'd entered on that page, and even if it is just a login page, some badly implemented sites can lose information if you step out of the workflow. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",madanra
