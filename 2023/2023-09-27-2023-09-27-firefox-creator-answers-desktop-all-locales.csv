I come here for a question, maybe a confirmation (I'm gonna try to be as short as possible ). </p><p>I'm using for years infamous Aris-t2 customCSS. I'm about to ""jump"" from FF v88 on my desktop to V115.0.3esr. I tested everything on my laptop, and set everything on the customCSS so it looks like my actual V88. It's almost identical, but one thing is bugging me: the scrollbar.  </p><p>Scrollbar on FF115 isn't the same anymore than in V88 as you can see on the screenshot I posted (test scrbr for V115, scrbr2 for V88). The clean one with ""3lines grab button"" I actually use is less ""eye catchy"" than the new one. I've made some researches, and apparently, starting FF V97 about 2 years ago, scrollbar has been change to use W10 ""flat like"" one, and at FF106+, every older code was apparently removed.  I tried to changed a few things in about:config, like ""widget.non-native-theme.enabled"" or multiple commands about scrollbar, nothing changed.  </p><p>So I just wanted to know if someone could confirm me that the old scroll bar I use is now impossible to get back, or if there's a command I miss that could do the thing. </p><p>Thanks, have a nice day ^^ </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,1606449;,Icyderg

This is a problem because the only time I drag and drop text onto a Firefox windows is a password from my password manager. If I slightly miss the text box, it interprets the password as a URL and tries to go to it. This (a) Does a DNS lookup of the password. As there usually won't be a valid extension, I expect this only gets as far as my router, but it's still not ideal. (b) The page I was on has now gone, replaced with the ""Couldn't connect to server"" page, so I need to start again. Usually this is just a login page, which isn't a massive issue, but if it's a registration page I lose all the data I'd entered on that page, and even if it is just a login page, some badly implemented sites can lose information if you step out of the workflow. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",madanra
