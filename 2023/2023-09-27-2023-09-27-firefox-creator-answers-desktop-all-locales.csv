For example... </p><p>{ </p><pre> ""*"": {    ""blocked_install_message"": ""Custom error message."",    ""install_sources"": [""<a href=""https://yourwebsite.com/*"" rel=""nofollow"">https://yourwebsite.com/*</a>""],    ""installation_mode"": ""blocked"",    ""allowed_types"": [""extension""]  },  ""uBlock0@raymondhill.net"": {    ""installation_mode"": ""force_installed"",    ""install_url"": ""<a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/latest/ublock-origin/latest.xpi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/latest/ublock-origin/latest.xpi</a>""  },  ""https-everywhere@eff.org"": {    ""installation_mode"": ""allowed""  } </pre> <p>} </p><p>The problem with this method is that if I am installing an extension, and I overwrite what already exists in Software\Policies\Mozilla\Firefox\ExtensionSettings then all of those other settings get removed. So even if I am a non-malicious actor and just make a mistake with my installer I can easily delete every other extension's settings. Instead what I have to do is during install I have to read the current value of Software\Policies\Mozilla\Firefox\ExtensionSettings and then insert my extension's settings into the JSON blob. </p><p>So the examples that Firefox and Chrome provides do of course work, however they do not make very much sense to me. Why would it be formatted this way since all of those are additional key/value pairs and that is exactly what the registry excels at storing. So why put all of those into a single key/value instead of breaking them into multiple? </p><p>Additionally breaking them a part into multiple key/value pairs does work! So if instead of the example above I were to split them into multiple key value pairs it works just fine! </p><p>Software\Policies\Mozilla\Firefox\ExtensionSettings </p><pre>   uBlock0@raymondhill.net        ""installation_mode"": ""force_installed"",        ""install_url"": ""<a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/latest/ublock-origin/latest.xpi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/latest/ublock-origin/latest.xpi</a>"" </pre> <p>So knowing that this way with multiple key/value pairs works why am I bothering to ask this question at all instead of just doing it the way that makes sense to me? Well the issue is that by breaking it up into multiple key value pairs it actually overrides the other method and makes it so that all those registry settings are ignored. So it doesn't delete them but it still leaves me with nearly the exact same problem. </p><p>While I believe ""my"" way is superior because it uses the registry in a more common sense route, if that is not what the majority of extension developers do then it doesn't matter and I should be conforming to the other way. </p><p>As I am typing this question up I did realize just how hard/annoying it is to properly format and make it clear and digestible what the multi key/value format of the registry would look like instead of being a JSON string. So perhaps that is the reason why all the documentation puts it all as one JSON string? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",perihwk+firefox

I can not purchase or use bits despite Twitch having a stored payment method on file that I have confirmed has sufficient funds, I can not subscribe or gift subscriptions despite Twitch having that same sufficiently funded payment method on file, I can not redeem or earn channel points, I can not send or receive Twitch Whispers (a form of DM), I can not follow or unfollow channels, and I am convinced that if I was to log out, I would not be able to log back in. I can chat in stream chat, and I can watch streams, that's all I can do. But I enjoy using the other features that are currently blocked, I am over 18, and I am the only person that uses this computer, so there should be no parental controls problems either. Yesterday, I restarted my browser, which did NOT alert me that it had updated, and all of this functionality was broken. Roughly 6 months ago I was having the exact same issues, but I was able to fix it by disabling many of the anti-tracking protections on my browser (had to disable them universally except for blocking cryptominers, not just with the shield icon). However, now, even with those settings unchanged, roughly 75% of the features of the website <a href=""http://Twitch.tv"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitch.tv</a> are nonfunctional. I have included a cropped screenshot of me attempting to redeem something using channel points, the purple box is the button, and the spinner icon stays there for over a minute with nothing happening, which is not how that is supposed to work. </p><p>I enjoy watching streams and interacting with people on <a href=""http://Twitch.tv"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitch.tv</a>, and I wish to continue doing so in the way I am accustomed to. However, it would appear that Firefox has other plans.

When I open a window to a bank or other sensitive site ESET Antivirus Banking and Payment Protection automatically opens a new Protected window. The password manager then fills in the login details for the site or offers a choice from a listbox if I have more than one login for that site without me having to provide a password for the password manager. Clicking on ""View Saved Logins""  from the listbox opens the password manager Search Logins window also without me having to enter a Primary Password.  I can now view Usernames AND Passwords without having to enter any Primary Password.  This appears to be an out of date copy of the passwords in a unprotected file since it is missing a few recently created entries. When using an standard Firefox browser window everything seems to work as expected with the Primary Password being required to activate the Pasword Manager and the recently created entries are present. One other point which may be relevant is that when viewing the same username/password in both the valid and the duplicate versions the window addresses are identical. This suggests to me that the Password Manager keeps the username/password data and a list of that data as separate enties and that what I have is actually one set of data with two seperate lists of the data. This makes me nervous about trying to delete anything from the unprotected list in case I am deleting  the original data. This state of affairs may have come about when I was setting up Firefox Sync and inadvertantly Sync-ed Password Manager with Primary Password turned off. I have since turned off Sync but with no effect on th problem.  Is there any way of deleting this apparent additional password list? The alternative seems to be to just uninstall Firefox and ESET Antivirus and re-install and hope that all the data is cleared out in the process and the re-import a password file. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1180;,firefox,other,en-US,"",mike2000

I come here for a question, maybe a confirmation (I'm gonna try to be as short as possible ). </p><p>I'm using for years infamous Aris-t2 customCSS. I'm about to ""jump"" from FF v88 on my desktop to V115.0.3esr. I tested everything on my laptop, and set everything on the customCSS so it looks like my actual V88. It's almost identical, but one thing is bugging me: the scrollbar.  </p><p>Scrollbar on FF115 isn't the same anymore than in V88 as you can see on the screenshot I posted (test scrbr for V115, scrbr2 for V88). The clean one with ""3lines grab button"" I actually use is less ""eye catchy"" than the new one. I've made some researches, and apparently, starting FF V97 about 2 years ago, scrollbar has been change to use W10 ""flat like"" one, and at FF106+, every older code was apparently removed.  I tried to changed a few things in about:config, like ""widget.non-native-theme.enabled"" or multiple commands about scrollbar, nothing changed.  </p><p>So I just wanted to know if someone could confirm me that the old scroll bar I use is now impossible to get back, or if there's a command I miss that could do the thing. </p><p>Thanks, have a nice day ^^ </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,1606449;1606498;1606512;,Icyderg

This is a problem because the only time I drag and drop text onto a Firefox windows is a password from my password manager. If I slightly miss the text box, it interprets the password as a URL and tries to go to it. This (a) Does a DNS lookup of the password. As there usually won't be a valid extension, I expect this only gets as far as my router, but it's still not ideal. (b) The page I was on has now gone, replaced with the ""Couldn't connect to server"" page, so I need to start again. Usually this is just a login page, which isn't a massive issue, but if it's a registration page I lose all the data I'd entered on that page, and even if it is just a login page, some badly implemented sites can lose information if you step out of the workflow. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",madanra
