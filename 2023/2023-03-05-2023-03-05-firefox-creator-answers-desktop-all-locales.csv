New bug?,"<p>Ever since the last Firefox update on Feb 28, 2023, my open tabs are no longer being restored when I re-open Firefox after closing it down.  After doing some searches on the issue, I checked my ""Settings page, Privacy &amp; Security panel, History section"" and it still shows ""Remember history"".   (This is on a laptop running Windows 10.)  This is a huge inconvenience for me.  Is this a bug or is there some way for me to fix it?

Sometimes it freezes; sometimes the aspect ratio of the video gets badly-stretched or the video takes over the entire window that Youtube or Vimeo is running in.     Sometimes the Youtube or Vimeo player is missing a control such as the volume control or icon to ""like"" the video, etc.   If I copy and paste the URL from Firefox into Chrome, there are no problems at all.    If I use Chrome exclusively  to visit those websites there are no problems.  This is strictly a Firefox problem.  I have many other video-playing apps on my PC such as Adobe Premiere Pro, VLC, Windows Media Player, etc, and none of them are having problems.
