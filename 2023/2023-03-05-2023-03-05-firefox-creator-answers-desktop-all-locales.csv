I actually suspect it's not fixable, but I was wondering if anyone understood it. </p><p>Firefox is a supported browser on the university network, but the connection drops anywhere between immediately after loading the previous tabs to half an hour later. Mostly somewhere in between. I don't *think* this is happening with Chrome, but I only use Chrome if I have to. </p><p>Google Calendar will have a wee note at the bottom saying it is disconnected; no other windows say anything, they just won't refresh/allow me to search. What's interesting to me is that Facebook Messenger will work. Nothing else will be working and I can continue a conversation that loads both ways in that tab. </p><p>The add-ons I have are: </p> <ul><li>Duckduck Go Privacy Essentials </li><li>Facebook Container </li><li>Google Scholar Button </li><li>Privacy Possum </li><li>Social Fixer for Facebook </li><li>uBlock Origin </li><li>View Image </li></ul> <p>Any ideas? It can be infuriating when I'm searching for (academic articles). I haven't seen that it's particularly linked to how many tabs I've opened/buttons I have interacted with or anything. </p><p>Cheers </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",hroovitnir

Sometimes it freezes; sometimes the aspect ratio of the video gets badly-stretched or the video takes over the entire window that Youtube or Vimeo is running in.     Sometimes the Youtube or Vimeo player is missing a control such as the volume control or icon to ""like"" the video, etc.   If I copy and paste the URL from Firefox into Chrome, there are no problems at all.    If I use Chrome exclusively  to visit those websites there are no problems.  This is strictly a Firefox problem.  I have many other video-playing apps on my PC such as Adobe Premiere Pro, VLC, Windows Media Player, etc, and none of them are having problems.    I've done several updates of Firefox with no relief. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,other,en-US,"",plnelson
