For example, when I use WORDLE, its color coding is not used and all I get is black and white letters so no feedback.  The wording on the color override implies that it only applies to links.  If it does not apply only to links, it is not a real option. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,customize,en-US,1567249;1567264;,moserlarry
