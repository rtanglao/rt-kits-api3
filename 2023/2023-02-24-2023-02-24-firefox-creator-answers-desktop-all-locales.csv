However, when I try to search for anything using my copy of Firefox, I get a 503 error message as photographed below. I would assume this was a problem with the server, not my copy of Firefox, except that I get the requested results: </p> <ul><li> On other browsers </li><li> On copies of Firefox on other computers </li><li> When I go into Private Browing on my copy of Firefox </li><li> When I hard-refresh the page (Shift + Refresh) on my own regular Firefox </li></ul> <p>For reference, I have left an image of how the website should look below as well. This is quite annoying as I need to use this for my college work and Firefox is my browser of choice, plus I have noticed similar issues when accessing other databases (E.g.: NCBI). I have tried disabling/deleting all my extensions, refreshing Firefox to default, clearing my cache and cookies, and going so far as to completely uninstall Firefox and delete its files on my computer and re-download it, and nothing seems to be working. I am at my wits end and would appreciate any help anyone can give. Thank you. </p><p>This is the website in question: <a href=""https://www.uniprot.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.uniprot.org/</a> </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1100;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",colmmryan
