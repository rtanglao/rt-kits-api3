It would not update so, following Firefox support page advice I un-installed it and re-installed it. Now I cannot open any links in Outlook emails. I have changed the default to other browsers and cannot open links in any of them. I get the message ""This operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this computer. Please contact your system administrator"". I have found various references to this issue indicating that it is caused by leaving Firefox as default before uninstalling. It would have been helpful to know this first. I have tried all other solutions other than a registry edit which I am understandably nervous of. So now it appears that I have a permanently broken system thanks to Firefox forcing an update which I was happy to live without. I am on Windows 7 and yes, I know it is old and out of support for many things nowadays but the fact is it meets my needs and I had no reason to change.  I have reset the default browser and uninstalled Firefox again but it is still broken. I tried a Microsoft fix which, without warning, forced me to upgrade to Microsoft Edge so my system which was just fine yesterday is apparently never going to be the same again. Can anyone tell me how to fix this? </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",coopern1
