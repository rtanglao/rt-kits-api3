So now it appears that I have a permanently broken system thanks to Firefox forcing an update which I was happy to live without.

Works fine, but when logging in on my Windows/desktop Lenovo Ideapad C-230 with ringerprint-reader (Goodix) I did not get this possibility. When I experience problems in Firefox I try the same in Chrome and Edge, and with those readers the fingerprint authentication worked! So we can conclude that it's something with Firefox in this instance. I have also tried in Troubleshooting-mode with no positive result. I use WIndows 11 Home 22H2 and Firefox 110.0 (64). </p><p>Hoping for some useful feedback. </p><p>Regards Øyvind </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1100;,firefox,other,en-US,"",kjell20n40
