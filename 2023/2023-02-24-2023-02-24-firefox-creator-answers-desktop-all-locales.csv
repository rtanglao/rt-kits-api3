Despite numerous updates,  for well over a year  it has been auto scrolling when on facebook and I have tried every fix it to no avail (I'm highly computer literate and to me, this is now nuts). Note. My android mobile has never done it. I am at the end of my tether and am now looking at moving to another browser due to the frustration. I've gone through all the forums and note there are hundreds (if not thousands) of people with the same problem. Why can you not fix this and is there a fix?  I don't want to, but I will move to another browser if I cannot get a satisfactory answer.
