For instance, when using Microsoft 365 I get text boxes instead of ICONs, and online spreadsheets will not display colors.  On my banking and insurance sites, selections do not show.  Example, when I make a section and a dot should appear in the circle, nothing shows.  There are issues like this with most websites.  Even on this page, when I check E-mail me, nothing happens.  Not sure how I can get replays. </p><p>Thank You Greg Lamb </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1150;,firefox,other,en-US,"",greglamb

I always been a user with Fire Fox for a long time and only now I noticed it doesn't feel or work the way it used to! Its like what happeend to Opera to me when the longer I keep using it, more problems would come making it slower or crash often. Some sites might not open properly until I wait later then it opens!  </p><p>Im using the current version and I always keep it up to date! So Im not exactly sure what could the problem really be? I just want to report speed and freezing issues. Sometimes Fire Fox would just stop working and freeze for a few seconds from time to time. I uninstalled it already and switched to Chrome and Edge for the time being.  </p><p>I haven't tried cleaning up the browser entirely as I do not want to erase all the cookies but maybe just this once to correct speed issues? Not sure what can solve the freezing and sites not opening. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",philyutuber2022
