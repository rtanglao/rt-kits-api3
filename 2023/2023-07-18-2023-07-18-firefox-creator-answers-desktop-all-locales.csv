I always been a user with Fire Fox for a long time and only now I noticed it doesn't feel or work the way it used to! Its like what happeend to Opera to me when the longer I keep using it, more problems would come making it slower or crash often. Some sites might not open properly until I wait later then it opens!  </p><p>Im using the current version and I always keep it up to date! So Im not exactly sure what could the problem really be? I just want to report speed and freezing issues. Sometimes Fire Fox would just stop working and freeze for a few seconds from time to time. I uninstalled it already and switched to Chrome and Edge for the time being.  </p><p>I haven't tried cleaning up the browser entirely as I do not want to erase all the cookies but maybe just this once to correct speed issues? Not sure what can solve the freezing and sites not opening. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",philyutuber2022

It disappears when you hover over it and changes to the right bottom of the screen. It appears when i'm trying to watch videos on sites when i'm in full screen and refuses to go away. I've tried the chrome folder solution posted here and it doesn't work. I've tried many other solutions online and they don't work either.  </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1372339"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1372339</a> </p><p>A few of the things that were supposed to be labeled as they were in the solution were not available on my new version of FF but I found the correct folder to post the chrome folder in regardless. The box to open the profile folder was further down and labeled differently than in the instructions posted from a year or more ago here.  </p><pre>I'm using a fresh install of windows 11 and the latest version of Fire Fox 115.0.2 64bit </pre> <p>Thank you in advance. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1150;firefox-11502;,firefox,other,en-US,1591218;1591220;,brandongbaxter

I got it before and had to redo some stuff the way I like it. I have heard others complain about these problems and now youtube is all messed up. Where I have my tabs there is some discoloration and the tabs are missing a lot of sites I had in them, I guess my computer did the latest update. How can I go back to FF 56.0? </p>",windows-7;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-560;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1591205;1591208;1591209;1591210;,neo-3
