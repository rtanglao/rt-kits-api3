I found a very useful and effective app that did remove all those duplicated Folders and Bookmarks, however, it (or I) managed to put them completely out of order.  That's the context of for this question-as-suggestion.  I'm rebuilding my bookmarks.html now, using NotePad++ to edit and restore it to its previous state (Bookmarks Menu / folders / sub-folders / bookmarks).  I check my work, as I continue to rebuild this bookmarks.html, by re-Importing it.  The problem is that re-Importing the file merely*appends* it to the current contents, rather than replacing them.  Here's the workaround I found to initialize my Firefox bookmarks configuration.  In your Firefox Profiles folder (e.g.)  C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\blahblah.default-release  delete:  </p><pre>- places.sqlite and  - content-prefs.sqlite  </pre> <p>and also delete all contents in the /bookmarksbackup folder.  By doing this, now when you ""Import bookmarks from HTML..."", it will contain only what was in your source file. I have the current version of Firefox as of this date, 115.0.2 (64-bit).

I believe OWA changed a policy, and Firefox requires an update. </p><p>I downloaded Chrome v112 for Fedora Linux.  (I am using Fedora 36 KDE.)
