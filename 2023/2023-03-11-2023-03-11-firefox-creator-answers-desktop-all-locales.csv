My internet speed for download should be 500 mbps. This is what I get with Chrome and Edge, but with Firefox I get 300 to 400 mbps. I tried running Firefox in troubleshooting mode and got the same result. Also tried changing the network settings (proxy or no proxy; Enable DNS on and off, etc), but no luck. Please help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jayholt5

I open a photo file to begin the upload process to Ancestry but my monitor goes grey, I cannot use the cursor or click on anything. A big blue circle goes around slowly so my only way out is Esc and it says Firefox is not responding and asks if I want to close the program which I do. I have retried uploading several times and each time it fails. I did a disk cleanup, a system clean up, cleared history, cache and cookies, troubleshooters; all of things+ that are recommended to fix the problem. Command prompt isn't something I use but if I have to, I will. I need get a fix for the not responding issue, otherwise I have to put my family tree on hold indefinitely. Thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",lewyes

Task manager does not show any changes with CPU/Memory/Disk/Network under Firefox's process when these ping spikes happen, but the issue goes away immediately every time after closing out Firefox. </p><p>The webpage and what you are doing on that webpage does not matter (like streaming YouTube), it even happens after visiting <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a>.

However, a couple of days ago Yahoo stopped working this way: I can open emails, but I can't delete emails, send an email, open settings, etc.  Yahoo mail works on my Android phone.  It works on my Surface with Chrome.  And it works with Firefox on my PC.  Apparently there is a bad relationship between Yahoo mail and Firefox on my Surface.  Can anyone suggest a diagnosis and a fix?  Thanks </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,other,en-US,"",hostba

It shows up at outlook's on-line site and in my mail folders.  However, in my outlook mail it has no inbox folder listed for him.  Most importantly, I don't know how to get his outlook account to include an inbox folder under his outlook acct. name in his outlook folders list and he can't receive e-mail.  Please help.  Thought it would be easy even for an elderly person wanting to be able to receive e-mail but it has proven to be complicated to setup even for me.  Any guidance will certainly be appreciated.  When he tries to open any of his outlook folders it takes him to a list of my Firefox accts.??? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,other,en-US,1569952;,drkessinger
