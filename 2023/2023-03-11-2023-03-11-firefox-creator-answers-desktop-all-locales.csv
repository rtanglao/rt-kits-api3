It shows up at outlook's on-line site and in my mail folders.  However, in my outlook mail it has no inbox folder listed for him.  Most importantly, I don't know how to get his outlook account to include an inbox folder under his outlook acct. name in his outlook folders list and he can't receive e-mail.  Please help.  Thought it would be easy even for an elderly person wanting to be able to receive e-mail but it has proven to be complicated to setup even for me.  Any guidance will certainly be appreciated.  When he tries to open any of his outlook folders it takes him to a list of my Firefox accts.??? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,other,en-US,1569952;,drkessinger
