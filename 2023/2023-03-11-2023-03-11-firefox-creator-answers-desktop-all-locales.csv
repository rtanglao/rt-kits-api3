Task manager does not show any changes with CPU/Memory/Disk/Network under Firefox's process when these ping spikes happen, but the issue goes away immediately every time after closing out Firefox. </p><p>The webpage and what you are doing on that webpage does not matter (like streaming YouTube), it even happens after visiting <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a>. However, I'll rarely get lucky and this issue won't occur while Firefox is open. </p><p>Issue does not occur with other browsers. If there is any additional info that I should provide please let me know. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1100;,firefox,other,en-US,"",y

However, a couple of days ago Yahoo stopped working this way: I can open emails, but I can't delete emails, send an email, open settings, etc.  Yahoo mail works on my Android phone.  It works on my Surface with Chrome.  And it works with Firefox on my PC.  Apparently there is a bad relationship between Yahoo mail and Firefox on my Surface.  Can anyone suggest a diagnosis and a fix?  Thanks </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,other,en-US,"",hostba

It shows up at outlook's on-line site and in my mail folders.  However, in my outlook mail it has no inbox folder listed for him.  Most importantly, I don't know how to get his outlook account to include an inbox folder under his outlook acct. name in his outlook folders list and he can't receive e-mail.  Please help.  Thought it would be easy even for an elderly person wanting to be able to receive e-mail but it has proven to be complicated to setup even for me.  Any guidance will certainly be appreciated.  When he tries to open any of his outlook folders it takes him to a list of my Firefox accts.??? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,other,en-US,1569952;,drkessinger

I need to change it. Right now my options are to delete my firefox account entirely, or keep it connected and let myself continue to be hacked now that my email has been compromised.  </p><p>Where do I go to change it? It's not under settings like the help articles say. There is no option to change it. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1569953;,mskity333
