It's a closed environment with no access to the Internet when it's in use. </p><p>The environment is launched from AWS and consists of an Ubuntu 18 desktop and a Ubuntu Server running Apache.  The desktop is able to successfully load the website, but with a cert error that the certificate isn't trusted. </p><p>When the Ubuntu Desktop launches, it has a fresh install of Firefox, and therefore all the directories in the users home folder are not yet setup for Firefox, including the database where the root CAs are stored. </p><p>I'm am able to add the Root CA certificate into the Firefox cert database AFTER the machine fully boots and I run Firefox for the first time. I'm using the 'certutil' package to do this.  After I load Firefox, then add the root CA certificate using certutil, I'm able to load the website without error. </p><p>I need to add this certificate to the database with the startup shell script for the machine. </p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.  Here's the commands I'm using: </p> <ol><li>copy the CA cert into firefox </li></ol> <p>export ffcerts=`ls /home/testuser/.mozilla/firefox/ | grep default-release` sudo certutil -A -n ""testcert"" -t ""TC,,"" -i /home/testuser/certificates/testcertCA.pem -d sql:/home/testuser/.mozilla/firefox/$ffcerts </p><p>These commands work perfectly after Firefox is run for the first time.  I've even tried adding 'Firefox' (with several different switches) into my startup script without success. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;needsinfo;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1571568;1571569;1571571;1571572;,goriest-02-stacker

It caused PhotoEphemeris in difficult position on login issues as I could not login successfully.  </p><p>I tried on different browser named Google, PhotoEphemeris will be able to login.  </p><p>I may suspect new Firefox version 111.0 is the culprit for PhotoEphemeris login issue.  If you roll back to 110 or previous version, PhotoEphemeris will work well including login.
