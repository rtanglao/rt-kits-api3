Some glyphs do not show correctly. In particular U+2A75, which is double equals.  I am using Ubuntu, and I have installed Unifont. In the image, I have opened Firefox on the right and Chromium on the left, the URL is  <a href=""https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2A75"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+2A75</a> Chromium is displaying the page correctly, Firefox is not. However, in both cases, the character is correctly displayed in the text in the Tab header after the favicon. browser.display.use_document_fonts is set to 1 I have read the Support page on editing fonts. Inspecting the element as suggested in the 'Editing Fonts' page, (see 2nd image uploaded), I see - in the source pane on the left, the character is correctly displayed (as in the tab text) - the Font being used to display the character in the rendered HTML is 'Source Sans Pro', which probably does not have the glyph for U+2A75. - the Font supplied by the website (presumably it does have the glyph) is list as a font, but I can't find a way to have it display the element. </p><p>I have tried to change the font family for the selected element in the Rules pane, but that does not work.  </p><p>I have tried a variety of other changes in about:config but nothing seems to work. </p><p>I have two thoughts - the Font family for some Unicode ranges may be set for security reasons, and so U+2A75 is forced to some other Font - the fallback mechanism is not working to select a font when the glyph is not in the first family. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1210;,firefox,customize,en-US,1626282;1626286;,rnhainsworth

It doesn't seem to come up on any pages not selling something.  I contacted eBay and they state it is not theirs and to contact Mozilla Firefox.

The keyboard shortcuts do not work anymore, either, and you cannot get a new window to open by switching to another app and back via the keyboard (Cmd+Tab).
