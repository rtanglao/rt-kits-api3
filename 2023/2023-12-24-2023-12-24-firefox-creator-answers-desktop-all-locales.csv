Even after I clear the most recent history or remove the most immediate cookies, this feature would still work e.g. after I restart my PC or just restart the browser. It would restore all the tabs I was using previously including the most recent tab I was on before the browser closed or restarted. However, this morning, I tried to clear my immediate browsing history as I usually do and the browser froze while I was in the process of clearing this immediate history (continuously displaying the pop-up window/interface for clearing history and not allowing me to do much else on the browser - I couldn't even click anything on the tab I was on, nor could I navigate to another tab and/or open a new tab; and only the close button, and maximize window button, and minimize window buttons were responding). After waiting for a while for it to start working again, I got frustrated and I closed the browser.  </p><p>I then opened the browser again, but this time, it didn't restore the previous browsing session and didn't even take me to the last tab I was on.  </p><p>What could have happened this time around? It has not behaved like that for this whole year.  </p><p>NB: I have not done anything to the browser after opening it! I am still on the same page it landed on when I opened it (just in case). </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1626190;,troymargetsy
