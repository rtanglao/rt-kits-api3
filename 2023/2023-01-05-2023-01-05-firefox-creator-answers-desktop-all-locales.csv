MY SETTINGS ARE NOT BEING SAVED. THERE IS NO SAVE BUTTON BECAUSE YOU REMOVED IT. I MAKE A SETTING, COME OUT OF THE PAGE AND IT IMMEDIATELY REMOVES MY SETTINGS. YOU NEED TO FIX THIS BECAUSE NOTHING IS WORKING BECAUSE IT CONTINOUSLY GOES BACK TO DEFAULT. IF YOU DO NOT FIX THIS ASAP I AM SHUTTING YOU DOWN AND GOING TO BING AS MY BROWSER </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-8;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",gailanne1

Work computer can probably boot back into Win11 if I try and it's on 22.04LTS. Home laptop was Win 10 but I'm not sure it is able to boot to that. Anyhow: </p><p>I had a great workflow with containers and handling a few different accounts and there are probably 100+ unique strong passwords saved in my firefox sync. Now I get to linux, get things set up ... and now I have to start over with everything. Most accounts, I'm totally OK to just ""Forgot Password"" because then it's a great chance to get a newer, longer, meaner passwd and review if I can turn on 2FA, etc. But there are sites that are slipping through the cracks; sites that are a little broken about recovery.  </p><p>On an aside, I do have the windows filesystem and poked around Users/me/AppData/Roaming/blahblah/profile/files. There are json files with encrypted usernames and some sqlite DBs. Is there a mechanism for merging the ""old"" AppData into ubuntu's ~/snap/firefox/profile ?  </p><p>Or is there a means to get user/pass out of those files? I'll see if I can get logged into the work computer tomorrow since I see there's an export option, which is a good backup plan if there isn't a way to import. </p><p>Thanks!

Little bit concerning, I reset it. Things are going good. It asks me for my 2fa. I enter it. Incorrect. I try it again. Incorrect. Third time. Incorrect. I make sure both my devices' time is correct. They are. I try a separate device. Same issue. I go grab my USB with my backup codes. I put them in.

Now, I have access to my personal email, I remember my Firefox account password, but the only problem I have is that I need 2-Step Verification. I want to clarify a couple of points: On the phone that was stolen, all the information was written in a notes app (one-time codes and master key), there is no way to recover it without help. In advance, I thank you and I sincerely hope you can help me to recover access to my account. /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Mi problema es el siguiente: </p><p>Yo era usuario activo de Firefox, una vez (por motivos de seguridad) activé la verificación en dos pasos con Google Authenticator (GRAVE ERROR), después de ésto, perdí mi móvil, y con él, el acceso a mi aplicación autenticadora. Ahora bien, tengo acceso a mi correo personal, recuerdo la contraseña de mi cuenta de Firefox, pero el único problema que tengo es que necesito la verificación en dos pasos. Quiero aclarar un par de puntos: En el móvil que me robaron, iba toda la información escrita en una app de notas (códigos de un solo uso y clave maestra), no hay manera de recuperarla sin ayuda. De antemano, agradezco y espero de corazón puedan apoyarme a recuperar el acceso a mi cuenta. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,privacy-and-security,es,"",irjosgutierrez
