I have had Dashlane (password keeper) working fine with Firefox for years. The Dashlane extensions work with Chrome, but I can't seem to get them to work with Frefox. The Chrome search engines choices are limited; ones that I never use with Firefox. Is there something in the Chromebook environment that limits firefox capabilities? (Am I looking for something that just is not possible?) Is there a work around?  (Any Linux tricks?) I also have asked the same question of Dashlane,  but have not heard back yet. My imperfect solution is use Chrome when it is a known website, and the password is recorded with Dashlane, and to use Firefox for new searches, where the choice of search engines is better. </p><p>Has anyone developed a search engine where there are no ""sponsored"" results.

It's intermittent, but the most frequent failures are searches using either the address field or the dedicated search field - much of the time I just get a blank page, and at first it looks like it might be trying to load something, but after awhile the ""X"" abort icon changes to the reload icon, signaling that it thinks it is loaded or has given up. Success or failure seems to come in waves or phases, not completely random - immediately retrying will usually not work. If I can get to the Google home page by typing ""<a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a>"" directly (which has a much better batting average than searching in the address/search fields, although not always), I can search directly on the Google page without trouble for some mysterious reason (perhaps that fills the page using AJAX rather than reloading - I'm not sure). But then clicking on one of the results might not work, because that initially goes to a Google URL before redirecting to the requested page. I've resorted to extracting the page location from that redirection URL just to bypass Google. </p><p>Other Google services have problems, too. YouTube's home page usually loads outlines of videos, but sometimes it fails to fill in thumbnails and other details or does so VERY slowly. Occasionally even reCaptcha will fail to load when I'm trying to log into some site that uses it. And even when something appears to fully load and function (e.g. a couple Google Sheets I use daily), often the ""stop loading this page"" X and hourglass on the tab will remain, indicating that it thinks something is still loading (in that case, it seems to never time out - I either click the X or ignore it). All these types of failures started at the same time, so they seem to have a common cause. </p><p>I have not noticed any problems with sources that are not owned by Google. And Chrome and Edge have no problems at all. So apparently it's specifically Firefox and Google that are not getting along. I'm running Firefox 108.0.1 (in PortableApps, although located on my hard drive) on Windows 11. </p><p>These failures happen even if I start Firefox in troubleshooting mode (which proves it's not caused by an add-on) or open Google in a private window so that there are no cookies involved. Since Chrome works, I also tried using the User-Agent Switcher add-on to pretend I'm Chrome, but that also has no effect. I expected to see tons of other complaints about this on the web, but there have been surprisingly few, and the only suggestion that seemed relevant (and effective for some people) was to set ""security.tls.enable_0rtt_data"" to false, but that has not made any noticeable difference in my case. </p><p>I waited through a couple Firefox updates, hoping it would just get well, but I've lost patience.

Now, I have access to my personal email, I remember my Firefox account password, but the only problem I have is that I need 2-Step Verification. I want to clarify a couple of points: On the phone that was stolen, all the information was written in a notes app (one-time codes and master key), there is no way to recover it without help. In advance, I thank you and I sincerely hope you can help me to recover access to my account. /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// Mi problema es el siguiente: </p><p>Yo era usuario activo de Firefox, una vez (por motivos de seguridad) activé la verificación en dos pasos con Google Authenticator (GRAVE ERROR), después de ésto, perdí mi móvil, y con él, el acceso a mi aplicación autenticadora.

Quiero aclarar un par de puntos: En el móvil que me robaron, iba toda la información escrita en una app de notas (códigos de un solo uso y clave maestra), no hay manera de recuperarla sin ayuda.
