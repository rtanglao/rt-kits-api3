Now I'm on a new Windows 11 machine, I installed Firefox (release 111.0.1), and this ability is gone. Why? </p><p>Another, admittedly small, change.  On my Windows 10 machine there was a Google icon in the blank space to the left of the space where you enter the url.  It was handy for situations where you wished to start a new search using a window that was already open.  A workaround of course is to add a Google icon to the line below that, where I have all my other often used sites (the bank, etc.), but why would this have changed? </p><p>I assume I was at 111.0.1 in Windows 10 but I have no way to check that out.  I was always getting automatic updates in my Windows 10 machine. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-11;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",tcluster

I'm trying to reinstall everything but have run into a problem - i had many passwords saved under a few different emails, and none of them have saved over past the reset. I have memory issues, and cannot remember: 1. if I ever made a Firefox account, 2. what any of my passwords were initially (I relied heavily on the saving feature) and 3. how I even worked multiple emails. My default browser is not Firefox (Windows computer), but I haven't used Edge in so long that any synced over passwords there are either outdated or for things I dont use anymore.  </p><p>Is there anything I can do to re-add all my lost passwords, or do I just need to go through every website and app and manually reset the passwords? </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",one.threesevenths

Can we set website displays to have simple, black on white backgrounds? Sometimes, you can highlight lettering, but only by hovering over it (if you can even find it) and sliding the cursor across the lettering. </p><p>I am unable to copy a Southwest Airlines website that shows a flight booking for BWI-VPS on April 7 at 6:25am-9:30AM with this dark blue background and very faint lettering to display the times of day of the flights. If you look carefully, you can these times faintly, then hover over and slide the cursor across the times, which will be revealed in white. This is very difficult viewing on such an important site. </p><p>Maybe this type of display is the way the website was designed, but if there is a FireFox setting to change the site to black lettering on white background, please tell me how to do this. </p><p>Thank you! </p><p>Robert </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,other,en-US,1573970;,chezmich
