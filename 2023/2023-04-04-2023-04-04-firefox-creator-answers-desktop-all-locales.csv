Luckily I can assign an extension shortcut to it and it works great. However every-time I reload Firefox, that extension shortcut is reset so I need to assign it again. How do I stop that? </p><p>I'd prefer if the issue was dealt generally, but if specifics are needed it's about Stylus 1.5.30 on Firefox 111.0.1. </p><p>Thank you kindly for your assistance </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",DynV
