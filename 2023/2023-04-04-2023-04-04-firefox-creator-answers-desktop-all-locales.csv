An Apple security window opened up saying my machine was compromised, and I had to uninstall Firefox.  Further attempts to install a later version were rebuffed by MAC OS because  Firefox was not installed through ""The App Store"". </p><p>There was something about changing my security settings on my Mac to allow Firefox, but I could not find any options specifically relevant to Firefox.  I really want to recover the use of Mozilla applications as they are used in routine browser searches, and are my secure web buffer. </p><p>Thanks                        Thomas Booker     <a href=""http://booker.tl"" rel=""nofollow"">booker.tl</a>@gmail.com </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",booker.tl

I'm not sure that this is related. </p><p>I cleared Firefox's saved print settings in about:support; ran Firefox in Troubleshoot Mode; ran it with a new blank profile; reset my profile; uninstalled/reinstalled Firefox twice; cleared startup cache again; and rebooted several times. I also installed Firefox Developer Edition 112.0.b9, which shows the same printing failure.
