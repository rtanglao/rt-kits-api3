I know normally, this would be a certificate issue on the website's side, but in this case, I don't believe it is.  The issue being is I can access the site using Firefox on both my phone and other computers just fine.  It just appears to be my desktop having the issue. </p><p>Are there any recommendations for fixing this issue?  I've attempted clearing browser history, doing fully clean installs of Firefox, other browsers, shutting off my VPN, and DNS flush. </p><p>To note: this is a SSO site for logging into Opera products - in my case GameMaker Studio 2.  I was, at least, able to login a few weeks ago.  I'm using Windows 11, currently fully updated as of writing this.  I'm using NordVPN, but so are other systems that allow me to sign in. </p><p><a href=""https://id.gamemaker.io/account/opera_sso"" rel=""nofollow"">https://id.gamemaker.io/account/opera_sso</a> (redirects to <a href=""http://auth.opera.com"" rel=""nofollow"">auth.opera.com</a>) </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1613224;,dpeterssk

For some reason when doing the same in firefox the video does not reach to fill the entire screen and instead only occupies the middle. I tried screenshotting to illustrate this behavior but the screenshot was restricted to this middle zone as well. It seems like somehow firefox is shrinking the display size when no other browser exhibits the same behavior. </p><p>It also seems like if I want I can drag the video window around in fullscreen moving the whole video player around my display. I shouldn't have to drag the thing around to get the video to play right. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,other,en-US,1613243;,theawesomepandapig
