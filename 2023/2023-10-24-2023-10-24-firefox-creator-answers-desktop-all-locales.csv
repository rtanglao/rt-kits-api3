I have a web-site that is deployed on IIS 10 and IIS 10 is on WIndows Server 2019. My web-site uses windows authentification under the hood. It works normally about 2 minutes and after that requests aren't sent to web-server(IIS 10). And web-server logs 401.2 error. I guess that browser and web-server loses connection, but I don't know why. If we speak about other browsers like Edge, Chrome etc they work normally. May be is it neccessary to configure Mozilla or web-server(IIS 10) specifically? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",dolmatovich.nikita

For some reason when doing the same in firefox the video does not reach to fill the entire screen and instead only occupies the middle.

It seems like somehow firefox is shrinking the display size when no other browser exhibits the same behavior. </p><p>It also seems like if I want I can drag the video window around in fullscreen moving the whole video player around my display.
