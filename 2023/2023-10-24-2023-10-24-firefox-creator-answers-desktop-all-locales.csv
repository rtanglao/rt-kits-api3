I think it usually happens when my laptop uses the dedicated GPU (but I'd say that not exclusively). </p><p>I tried checking with Troubleshoot Mode to see if it happened too and unfortunately Firefox was also freezing randomly sometimes.  </p><p>This is not something caused by a corrupted installation as using another user profile solves the problem. There's also no logs at about:crash. When it happens, the only thing I can do is kill the process. It's not like everything freezes but when certain website keeps loading I notice that the mouse icon does not get updated when hovering buttons and if I go to another tab and search or try to load another website, it simply does not work, it takes some seconds and then I just see a spinning wheel (from Firefox itself, not the website) </p><p>Could it be caused by any about:config changes? I mean I have changed a lot of things there following Arkenfox's user.js but had no trouble until some weeks ago. I'll try disabling privacy.resistFingerprinting.
