I was now able to figure out that Firefox seems to be the cause of the problem.  Whenever I close Firefox (and thus move to another program), I'm unable to open any other app for a couple of seconds. Task Manager shows three Firefox background processes that only show upon closing it. Only when they disappear, the apps I clicked on finally open. I've tried reinstalling and cleaning Firefox, but nothing changed. </p><p>As said, I'm on Windows 11 with a i5-13600k and Firefox is installed on an SSD. I couldn't really find any information on this problem. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1170;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1601446;,Mangoman25

This happens either when switching from one Firefox window to another or when switching from another app into Firefox. </p><p>Happening on Firefox 117.0 64-bit, Windows 11 Insiders Build. As far as I have tested, doesn't occur when using other browsers like Edge. </p><p>Any help would be enormously appreciated. </p>",desktop;graphics;windows-11;firefox-1170;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1601438;,alceballosa

I had this problem on my old PC last year, and now this year as well on my new PC. </p><p>After signing into DirecTV, and then going to watch sports games or whatever, when I click on the game to watch, it then asks me to select a provider.  So I select a provider and I get caught in a stupid loop and the idiotic Firefox keeps asking me time and again to select a provider.  How many freaking times do I have to select a provider? </p><p>After that, it won't even let me start over and try again, because when I try to sign in to DirecTV, I then get the following infuriating error every time: </p><pre>    You don't have permission to access ""<a href=""http://www.directv.com/directv-login/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.directv.com/directv-login/</a>"" on this server. </pre> <pre>    Reference #18.4fcda17.1693705236.1ee3ae9c  </pre> <p>What the heck!  DirecTV IS my TV providerâ€”has been for something like 10 years.  And where does Firefox get off telling me I can't sign in to my TV provider?  Who made them God? </p><p>I can sign in to DirecTV on Google Chrome, and probably on Maxthon, though I don't have that browser loaded yet on my new PC.  Is the solution for this infuriating and incredibly asinine problem to can Firefox and only use Chrome?  Why does this keep happening year after year after freaking year?   </p><p>I have used Firefox for years, but I'm about done with it now.  This is the last straw if I can't get this fixed. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1170;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1601449;,texasandlouisiana
