I recently created a new profile for Firefox (for work purposes) and set it as the default profile, because I'm trying to get off Chrome entirely. The preexisting no-longer-default profile contained all my ""personal"" data - bookmarks, extensions, etc. Continued using both profiles for about a week with no issues. Last night my MacBook updated and when I reopened Firefox, the new default profile was fine, but when I went into about:profiles and launched the secondary profile in a new browser, it was completely empty - no history, no bookmarks, no extensions, nothing. That's at least a year's worth of data completely gone. I've looked through support articles and past folks' questions and am just completely lost as to how to restore it or what went wrong. If it's not possible to restore that data, how can I at least prevent this from happening again? I've very much lost trust in Firefox profiles because of this. Help please? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",kaydeefalls

Non ne ho più la possibilità, perché dalla cronologia non mi si accendono le opzioni ""finestre chiuse di recente"" né ""riapri tutte le finestre"". Il tutto é successo ieri, a seguito di un'improvvisa chiusura di firefox mentre stavo lavorando. Al riavvio di firefox mi è comparsa la scritta ""firefox si avvierà dopo l'installazione degli aggiornamenti"", ma anche dopo aver atteso non succedeva niente. Ho cliccato di nuovo sull'icona firefox per avviarlo, e mi è comparsa la scritta ""firefox è già avviato, ma non risponde"".

Ho bisogno, per lavoro e non, di avere sempre tutte le sessioni, memorizzate ormai da 3 anni. So che non si dovrebbe, perché ogni sessione comprende più di 30 schede, ma ho un SSD e la velocità del PC me lo permette. Ogni sessione è ""tematica"" e comprende schede in successione cronologica, velocizzando le mie ricerche. È possibile ripristinare intere sessioni a partire da una data specifica? Per esempio quella di ieri... contrariamente, attraverso ""visualizza cronologia"" potrei accedere alle schede, ma una alla volta, e questo è imossibile per me.
