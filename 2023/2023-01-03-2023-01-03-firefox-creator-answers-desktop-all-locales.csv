I believe this has caused me to fail some computer assessments in some remote work opportunities, so I'd like to find a fix for it. </p><p>In Chrome my speedtests come out much faster overall than on Firefox, the latter upload speed being zero (0). </p><p>My details: Laptop, Dell Lattitude 6420 Windows 10 Chrome Version 108.0.5359.125 (Official Build) (64-bit) Firefox 108.0.1 64-bit </p><p>I have attempted the following: - refreshing the browser - disabled http 2/3; I tried both, then alternating - no change (re-enabled) - changed: This just made the speedtest unable to find a server (all re-enabled) </p><pre> security.tls.version.fallback-limit - from 4 to 1  security.tls.version.max - from 4 to 1  security.tls.version.min - from 3 to 1 </pre> <p>- restarted Firefox in SafeMode - produces an error message (see screenshot) </p><p>I am at a loss for what to do next. I have a website portal that only works correctly on Firefox.  But the work I need to do on it does not pass assessments at those speeds. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1080;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mbrasseau

It didn't seem to have been resolved.  It has been a while since Windows 11 came out. Has there been any resolution to this issue? Please help me fix it. Most of my activities are on Microsoft 365, and I prefer to use Firefox as my browser. But if this is ongoing I will need to abandon this browser in order to access my work. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,other,en-US,"",kelenne
