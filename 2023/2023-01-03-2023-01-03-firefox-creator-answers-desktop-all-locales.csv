An annoying problem is that whenever I click web links in external programs such as Microsoft Teams, Outlook etc Firefox always opens it in a new window instead of a new tab like Brave did. Also the window it opens does not have my extensions enabled, indicating that it is some form of incognito or web view window or something? These are my settings. </p><p>How can I solve this issue? </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",Gusti.Fishbein

In version 85, support in Mozilla Firefox for Flash was discontinued as far as i know, so this may have some connection with the problem. The freezes  happen (occasionally) when i try to open some of the menus, such as history, help, view, edit, file, etc.  </p><p>The issue gets fixed when hardware acceleration is disabled, so this may have something to do with a lack of Firefox compatibility in its newest versions with the video driver. Unfortunately, the browser becomes too slow and laggy when HA is disabled, so this is not a working solution for me. </p><p>Using older video drivers also does not help, the issue occurs only with Firefox Browser versions after 84. I do not have such issues with other browsers. </p><p>Config: </p><p>Windows 7 64 bit Video card Nvidia GT 750 Titanium </p><p>The problem occurs with Firefox Browser - all versions after 84, plus with all drivers for the video card </p><p>I never get the same problem with the same hardware on Win 10 (it is a dual boot computer with Win7 and Win10 OS).
