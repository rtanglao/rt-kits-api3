Then I tried again, and the NYA downloading process ran, but nothing appeared on my computer and the download progress arrow showed no activity.

On every other device using Firefox and signed in to the same Firefox account, Windows or macOS, the first ten or so bookmarks are where they should be, the rest are not only randomly ordered but retain bookmarks that were deleted on the curated Firefox machine. Signing in and out of the accounts on any of the machines does exactly nothing, simultaneously signing out and in on all the machines(recommended on some posts about this topic) is physically impossible given that the machines are in different physical locations. I was hoping to switch to Firefox from another browser that does not have this particular problem, but apparently that is not to be.
