I was watching a video the other day on <a href=""http://Archive.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Archive.org</a> and the name <em>Kevin Farley</em> was mentioned; spoken, no subtitles/annotations. I paused watching the video and did a Google search on my Firefox. I typed in the word ""Kevin"" and the first suggestion was Kevin Farley. How is this possible? That can't be the first suggestion unless the video player on <a href=""http://Archive.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Archive.org</a> and Google are communicating with each other. Anyone can think of several Kevins who are actors such as Kevin Farley, but more well-known than this brother of Chris Farley who, for that matter, was very well known. I don't believe that there are hidden microphones inside my computer or anything like that, but â€“ in all seriousness: how the heck does this thing work? Is Google listening to me? And if it is, that means Firefox is allowing it to listen to the stream of audio through my sound card. (At least the <em>line out</em>. Maybe I should try and see whether the <em>line in</em> and <em>mic in</em> are doing the same and play a vocal sample from an external source/device saying ""Kevin Farley"" or speaking those words through a plugged-in microphone and see how Google responds to that.) </p><p>On Firefox's settings (privacy) <strong>I have not allowed any site to use my microphone</strong>, speakers or camera. On my <em>sound device's settings</em> videos, music and everything I do audiowise is going through ""microphone"", although I'm plugged in on the rear panel of my PC only to line in and line out i.e. when I'm playing music on WinAmp, it shows that a signal is going through the microphone as it is going through my output. (If I try to disable the microphone, then I can't capture any signal i.e. I'm unable to record sound off a video clip or from my external audio gadgets.) </p><p>Not quite sure whether this is a problem with Google, Mozilla or my PC's sound card <em>or</em> with all of them, but it still is an interesting issue. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Baking_soda

I am a SQL Server specialist, and know virtually nothing about web servers, browsers etc. I need to access the AZURE Portal in a private window to give access to a legacy login. I am now getting the firefox enable  HTML5 Storage (Local and Session) in a private window before I can continue. I can get in fine in chrome without doing anything at all. What do I need to do in words of one syllable, such as go to the 3 bars, find this option, change this to that etc.  Apologies, but any developer technical words about the web, or browsers will make my eyes to glaze over! It was all working up to about 1 week ago - new version with new options?
