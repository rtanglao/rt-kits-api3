If I click on 'Other bookmarks' it appears to the right but is not pinned and doesn't seem pinnable. How do I get it back to displaying in the left side panel all the time as before? Clicking on 'Bookmarks Toolbar' or 'Bookmarks Menu' doesn't bring it up.  I don't see any other options in the side panel nor do I see anything relevant under 'Bookmarks' in the top ribbon menu......?

Also, I started the browser in error recovery mode and then printing does not work either. </p><p>All under Windows 11 Home (22H2 / 22621.2283 with Windows Feature Experience Pack 1000.22662.1000.0) with Firefox 117.0.1 (64-bit) - but I have had the problem for some time, i.e. even with older Firefox versions. </p><p>On my 2nd computer with Windows 11 Pro (22H2 / 22621.2134 with Windows Feature Experience Pack 1000.22659.1000.0) and with Firefox 117.0 (64-bit) I do not have this printing problem. </p><p>I have observed one more difference between the two computers: If I click on the icon of the printer queue in the systray, the Explorer with the path ""...\WINDOWS\System32"" is opened on the problem computer. On the 2nd computer, the printer queue opens, which can also be opened via the Windows settings. That windows settings also works on the problem computer - but not the ""click on icon in systray""-way. </p><p>I also restored the legacy print dialog (<a href=""http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/restore-legacy-print-dialog-windows-11/"" rel=""nofollow"">www.winhelponline.com/blog/restore-legacy-print-dialog-windows-11/</a>). This has also not solved the problem and therefore I have built this back again to the newer print dialog. </p><p>Please can someone help?  </p><p>At the moment, I always have to use the Edge browser when I want to print something from a website - which is fortunately rare, but it's annoying, especially if you want to print the invoice or order confirmation when shopping online before the session has expired. </p><p>Many thanks in advance! </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,other,en-US,"",st.steinkuehler

I was watching a video the other day on <a href=""http://Archive.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Archive.org</a> and the name <em>Kevin Farley</em> was mentioned; spoken, no subtitles/annotations.

That can't be the first suggestion unless the video player on <a href=""http://Archive.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Archive.org</a> and Google are communicating with each other. Anyone can think of several Kevins who are actors such as Kevin Farley, but more well-known than this brother of Chris Farley who, for that matter, was very well known. I don't believe that there are hidden microphones inside my computer or anything like that, but – in all seriousness: how the heck does this thing work? Is Google listening to me? And if it is, that means Firefox is allowing it to listen to the stream of audio through my sound card. (At least the <em>line out</em>. Maybe I should try and see whether the <em>line in</em> and <em>mic in</em> are doing the same and play a vocal sample from an external source/device saying ""Kevin Farley"" or speaking those words through a plugged-in microphone and see how Google responds to that.) </p><p>On Firefox's settings (privacy) <strong>I have not allowed any site to use my microphone</strong>, speakers or camera. On my <em>sound device's settings</em> videos, music and everything I do audiowise is going through ""microphone"", although I'm plugged in on the rear panel of my PC only to line in and line out i.e. when I'm playing music on WinAmp, it shows that a signal is going through the microphone as it is going through my output. (If I try to disable the microphone, then I can't capture any signal i.e. I'm unable to record sound off a video clip or from my external audio gadgets.) </p><p>Not quite sure whether this is a problem with Google, Mozilla or my PC's sound card <em>or</em> with all of them, but it still is an interesting issue. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Baking_soda
