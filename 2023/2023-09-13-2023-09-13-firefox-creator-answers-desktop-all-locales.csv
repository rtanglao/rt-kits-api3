This week the Messenger/Chat feature stopped working. I click the icon and it opens but nothing appears in the box, it just hangs. There is an option to open in its own window, but that also is blank -  no past messages, no contact names, no ability to start new message. When I log onto Facebook in Edge, Messenger works fine in Facebook. </p><p>I've tried everything I found on the internet for this issue - updated and refreshed Firefox, cleared history/cache/cookies/site data, uninstalled and reinstalled Messenger, refreshed Facebook to initial settings, used Firefox in troubleshooting mode, reset everything, turned off browser, turned off my computer, used shift key to reload tab - nothing has worked. There are some instructions about stuck cookies, but I didn't understand them so I didn't try that one thing. I've gone into every menu I can find to try to figure out this issue, which isn't the end of the world, but I would appreciate some other ideas for what is suddenly causing this. Because now I have to redo all of my settings and preferences and logins and the problem still isn't fixed. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",mlcamilli

I was watching a video the other day on <a href=""http://Archive.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Archive.org</a> and the name <em>Kevin Farley</em> was mentioned; spoken, no subtitles/annotations. I paused watching the video and did a Google search on my Firefox. I typed in the word ""Kevin"" and the first suggestion was Kevin Farley. How is this possible? That can't be the first suggestion unless the video player on <a href=""http://Archive.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Archive.org</a> and Google are communicating with each other. Anyone can think of several Kevins who are actors such as Kevin Farley, but more well-known than this brother of Chris Farley who, for that matter, was very well known. I don't believe that there are hidden microphones inside my computer or anything like that, but – in all seriousness: how the heck does this thing work? Is Google listening to me? And if it is, that means Firefox is allowing it to listen to the stream of audio through my sound card. (At least the <em>line out</em>. Maybe I should try and see whether the <em>line in</em> and <em>mic in</em> are doing the same and play a vocal sample from an external source/device saying ""Kevin Farley"" or speaking those words through a plugged-in microphone and see how Google responds to that.) </p><p>On Firefox's settings (privacy) <strong>I have not allowed any site to use my microphone</strong>, speakers or camera. On my <em>sound device's settings</em> videos, music and everything I do audiowise is going through ""microphone"", although I'm plugged in on the rear panel of my PC only to line in and line out i.e. when I'm playing music on WinAmp, it shows that a signal is going through the microphone as it is going through my output. (If I try to disable the microphone, then I can't capture any signal i.e. I'm unable to record sound off a video clip or from my external audio gadgets.) </p><p>Not quite sure whether this is a problem with Google, Mozilla or my PC's sound card <em>or</em> with all of them, but it still is an interesting issue. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Baking_soda
