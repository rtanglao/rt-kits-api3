I am a SQL Server specialist, and know virtually nothing about web servers, browsers etc. I need to access the AZURE Portal in a private window to give access to a legacy login. I am now getting the firefox enable  HTML5 Storage (Local and Session) in a private window before I can continue. I can get in fine in chrome without doing anything at all. What do I need to do in words of one syllable, such as go to the 3 bars, find this option, change this to that etc.  Apologies, but any developer technical words about the web, or browsers will make my eyes to glaze over! It was all working up to about 1 week ago - new version with new options? Thanks, Clive </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1170;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1603206;,f1baron
