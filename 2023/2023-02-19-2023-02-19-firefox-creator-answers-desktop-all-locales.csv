When i installed it, i turned on the option 'Open previous windows and tabs'. </p><p>Then, once I opened up some kind of offline documentations from Libre Office or Latex, which opened in Firefox. You know, the one where there is no tab appeared, and it just seems like a single pop-up window. I closed it without thinking. </p><p>Long enough, i forgot about that and opened up Firefox only to be met with that docs again. Okay, i closed it. But Firefox always started in this kind of pop-up window style ever since (attached). Changing the preference, even deleting the profile doesn't seem to do a thing. </p><p>Any recommendation to return Firefox to its original set? </p><p>For information: OS: EndeavourOS with Linux 5.15.94 DE: Xfce 4.18 with Xfwm 4.18 Version: Latest, Firefox 110, installed from Arch Linux repository </p>",linux;desktop;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",mardijker

I know it's a weird habit (lol), but at least it logs me out of all <em>recent</em> browsing while keeping my sessions with <em>older</em> websites active (typically these <em>older</em> websites include stuff that I use frequently like Outlook, Google/Youtube, Twitter &amp; other social media, Spotify, and a few other sites). </p><p>The other reason I do this is that I like my ""recent history"" to be ordered the way I like, so I can use it kind of like a ""bookmark list"". </p><p><strong>The problem:</strong> Since about 4 days ago, each time I ""delete history"", ALL my accounts are signed out. Note that I don't have the option to delete cookies upon closing checked, and whenever I close Firefox without deleting history the sessions appear to be active. </p><p>I think 3 or 4 days ago there was a Firefox update? I remember at the time I was shown the extra tab with the release notes, but I didn't pay much attention. However when I noticed the issue, which was the day after, I assumed it was a new feature of the update that caused all these websites not to recognise my browser and thus ask me to log in again. </p><p>So just before going to bed, I tried 1) clearing my history for the day as I usually do, except 2) instead of closing directly after, I would go to the sites I want to remain logged in (in this case I just did Outlook, Youtube, Twitter, Facebook, Tiktok and Spotify), log into my accounts, and then close the browser. </p><p>So the following day, it worked ""as usual""... almost... that is because when I deleted my history of the day, it logged me out of everything again. But in the ""recent history"" list, it showed the updated list (with the websites I re-logged into the day before). </p><p>So I can't guess what is happening, other that something is messing with my cookies each time I delete history. I even went to check manually to see if I still had the session cookies stored in Firefox and it appears to be the case. </p><p>Yesterday I also tried logging into a Google, waiting a few hours, and only deleting the history of the past hour, but the same thing happens, I instantly get logged out. </p><p>Additional info: when I ""delete history"" I only check the first five options (those under <strong>history</strong>) and not the lower two (under <strong>data</strong>). </p><p>Thanks for your help, and sorry for my English&nbsp;! </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1100;bug1816279;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1566469;,Mooray

I don't know what causes it to appear, but it always appears after some sort of input. When it appears, nothing can make it go away and the Firefox window won't snap to the side of the screen. It does get fixed if I close and reopen Firefox, but of course this loses all of my tabs. I've tried several solutions to fix this, but it keeps happening no matter what I've tried. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jamesclugston

I work on machine A, and run applications remotely using ssh -X on the other machines.  Today I discovered that when I start Firefox on newly-upgraded machine B, it's actually starting the older version that's on machine A.  This seems obviously wrong, and is certainly not what I want to happen.  I want to run the newer Firefox that's on B, and have it display on A. </p><p>Longer details:  A runs OpenSUSE Leap 15.0.  B runs Leap 15.4.  I start an xterm on B  with the command "" ""ssh -X -l me B"", and programs other than Firefox I run from that xterm display on A's monitors, as expected.  However, when I try to run Firefox (by typing ""firefox &amp;"" on the command line, what actually runs is the older version of Firefox that is on A, just as if I'd started it with the same command on one of A's terminals. </p><p>Is this a known behavior, and if so, is there a way to work around it?  Or am I just doing something really stupid? </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-600;,firefox,other,en-US,1566455;,jamesqf
