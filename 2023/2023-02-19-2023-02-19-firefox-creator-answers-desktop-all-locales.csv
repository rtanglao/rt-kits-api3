After Firefox updated to version 110 it now beeps after each word, phrase or sentence I dictate.  Dragon NaturallySpeaking has settings where you can turn this on and off, and I have it turned off but it still beeps.  Wondering if there are any fixes or if I can go to a previous version.  Thanks! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",injured_cowboy

It worked before so I contacted the add-on maker and after the last contact he called me a troll and blocked me. But still the problem happens when a story has photos I use to be able to click on the View icon and the photos would open in a new tab now nothing happens. I am using Firefox 88.0b9 (64-bit) because I do not like the changes the newer versions have and this version works well and has opened the photos before this problem started. I have added a grab of a story with photos to show the View icon. I understand I am cheating by using the Bypass but if I subscribed to all the sites I visit I would go bankrupt.  Any help greatly appreciated. </p>,desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",phillstroud
