I know it's a weird habit (lol), but at least it logs me out of all <em>recent</em> browsing while keeping my sessions with <em>older</em> websites active (typically these <em>older</em> websites include stuff that I use frequently like Outlook, Google/Youtube, Twitter &amp; other social media, Spotify, and a few other sites). </p><p>The other reason I do this is that I like my ""recent history"" to be ordered the way I like, so I can use it kind of like a ""bookmark list"". </p><p><strong>The problem:</strong> Since about 4 days ago, each time I ""delete history"", ALL my accounts are signed out. Note that I don't have the option to delete cookies upon closing checked, and whenever I close Firefox without deleting history the sessions appear to be active. </p><p>I think 3 or 4 days ago there was a Firefox update? I remember at the time I was shown the extra tab with the release notes, but I didn't pay much attention. However when I noticed the issue, which was the day after, I assumed it was a new feature of the update that caused all these websites not to recognise my browser and thus ask me to log in again. </p><p>So just before going to bed, I tried 1) clearing my history for the day as I usually do, except 2) instead of closing directly after, I would go to the sites I want to remain logged in (in this case I just did Outlook, Youtube, Twitter, Facebook, Tiktok and Spotify), log into my accounts, and then close the browser. </p><p>So the following day, it worked ""as usual""... almost... that is because when I deleted my history of the day, it logged me out of everything again. But in the ""recent history"" list, it showed the updated list (with the websites I re-logged into the day before). </p><p>So I can't guess what is happening, other that something is messing with my cookies each time I delete history. I even went to check manually to see if I still had the session cookies stored in Firefox and it appears to be the case. </p><p>Yesterday I also tried logging into a Google, waiting a few hours, and only deleting the history of the past hour, but the same thing happens, I instantly get logged out. </p><p>Additional info: when I ""delete history"" I only check the first five options (those under <strong>history</strong>) and not the lower two (under <strong>data</strong>). </p><p>Thanks for your help, and sorry for my English&nbsp;! </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1100;bug1816279;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1566469;,Mooray

After Firefox updated to version 110 it now beeps after each word, phrase or sentence I dictate.  Dragon NaturallySpeaking has settings where you can turn this on and off, and I have it turned off but it still beeps.  Wondering if there are any fixes or if I can go to a previous version.

It worked before so I contacted the add-on maker and after the last contact he called me a troll and blocked me. But still the problem happens when a story has photos I use to be able to click on the View icon and the photos would open in a new tab now nothing happens. I am using Firefox 88.0b9 (64-bit) because I do not like the changes the newer versions have and this version works well and has opened the photos before this problem started. I have added a grab of a story with photos to show the View icon. I understand I am cheating by using the Bypass but if I subscribed to all the sites I visit I would go bankrupt.  Any help greatly appreciated. </p>,desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-880;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",phillstroud
