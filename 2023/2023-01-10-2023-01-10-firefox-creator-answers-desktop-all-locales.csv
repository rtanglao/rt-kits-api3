In a profile I regularity use I unchecked the Title Bar checkbox in the Customize Toolbar screen, but then FF crashed and I can't get that profile opened again. I can still open other profiles (because I still use the old-fashioned profile manager and don't need to go into about:profiles), but when I open that particular profile, after some hangups, I only get FF in the taskbar, but no screen opens so I can't change the setting back again. </p><p>Is there a file in the profile folder I can edit or something like that to enable the Title Bar option again to see if that profile wants to open normally again?  </p><p>In case that's not possible I can copy that particular profile into a new profile, but then I will undoubtedly also copy the title bar setting, which I don't want. So can I copy the profile except for the one file with that setting and use the file from the new profile instead? What file would that than be? </p><p>I hope someone can help me out.

Within the last three weeks two sites <a href=""http://Menards.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Menards.com</a> &amp; <a href=""http://aarp.org"" rel=""nofollow"">aarp.org</a> have become blocked by security rules: Menards by Incapsula &amp; AARP by Imperva. All other websites I currently visit work fine as did these before. I've cleared cache and cookies and ""forget these websites"" in history. This solves the problem for the first page on <a href=""http://Menards.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Menards.com</a> but any link-click and the problem returns. This also cleared the AARP website but I cannot log in to my account there nor access some of the other clickable links. I can access these websites fine on other computers on this network using Firefox. This computer will access those two sites using the portable chrome browser but not the installed Tor browser. This computer will not access these sites using a VPN or with AVG disabled. I've toggled a few DNS and HTTP settings with no effects. For a year, the only thing I noticed different from this computers and the others is that this one continues to allow Java to be updated whereas the others are unable to download its update. Could that be the problem? Why these are the only two websites that seem to be affected is the baffling part. Menards has thanked me but has not gotten back and AARP wants me to reinstall my operating system.
