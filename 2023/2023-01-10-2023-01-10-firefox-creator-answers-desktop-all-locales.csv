I've included screenshots that show how the site looks in firefox and how it looks in edge/chrome. As you can see from the pictures, the issue is with the navbar items. This happens on other websites as well, though not all of them. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",mikifox

Within the last three weeks two sites <a href=""http://Menards.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Menards.com</a> &amp; <a href=""http://aarp.org"" rel=""nofollow"">aarp.org</a> have become blocked by security rules: Menards by Incapsula &amp; AARP by Imperva. All other websites I currently visit work fine as did these before. I've cleared cache and cookies and ""forget these websites"" in history. This solves the problem for the first page on <a href=""http://Menards.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Menards.com</a> but any link-click and the problem returns. This also cleared the AARP website but I cannot log in to my account there nor access some of the other clickable links. I can access these websites fine on other computers on this network using Firefox. This computer will access those two sites using the portable chrome browser but not the installed Tor browser. This computer will not access these sites using a VPN or with AVG disabled. I've toggled a few DNS and HTTP settings with no effects. For a year, the only thing I noticed different from this computers and the others is that this one continues to allow Java to be updated whereas the others are unable to download its update. Could that be the problem? Why these are the only two websites that seem to be affected is the baffling part. Menards has thanked me but has not gotten back and AARP wants me to reinstall my operating system. Thanks for any help you may suggest. </p>",windows-7;desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1080;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1558591;1558601;,gvzabramski
