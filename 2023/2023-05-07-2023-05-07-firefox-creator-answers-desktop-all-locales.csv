The box is fake and typing automatically goes to the address bar.  I changed the setting in about:preferences#search to ""Add search bar in toolbar."" That resulted in adding a 2"" search bar to the right of the address bar with a TINY font.  VERY difficult to see.  </p><p>Next in about:config, I switched this to false: ""browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.improvesearch.handoffToAwesomebar "".  But, that didn't fix it.   </p><p>An article on <a href=""http://askvg.com"" rel=""nofollow"">askvg.com</a> said to do the above, but to do it in FF's NIGHTLY.  To get the search box to function in the center of the page, will I have to install Firefox Nightly alongside my normal Firefox Release and fix it there? Then will it sync over to my regular FF and fix it?    Or, is there another way? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1120;firefox-11201;,firefox,customize,en-US,1579258;,xxq107a

I can't ask an intelligent question because I can't describe what I want. I have two Firefox images on the bottom of my computer screen. When I click on one of them, the eight websites that I go to most frequently appear in the center of the computer screen. However, when I click on any of them, nothing happens. If I click on the other Firefox image, there are seven websites displayed and only one is a frequently visited site. How can I activate the first site where my frequently viewed sites are found. Or, how can I edit the second site to populate it with sites I visit? On the second Firefox site, there is a item on the top tool bar, or whatever it is called, that is titled ""Most Visited"". It displays three sites, but multiple times for each. How can I edit that listing to include several sites I frequent? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,other,en-US,1579262;,willog
