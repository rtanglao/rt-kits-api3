I have moved it, closed it, but it restarts back on secondary monitor. After I move it to primary monitor, if I open another browser window it opens on the primary. I have renamed the xulstore.json file(so it creates a new one) but that did not help. It was working fine before the 109.0 update. I also have chrome installed and it works fine the way it should, so I'm thinking it is a Firefox 109.0 problem. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1090;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jstrunk1
