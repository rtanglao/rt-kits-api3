I have a kind of weird problem, Firefox won't let me tweet links....... tweet button is grated out and popup says Save or Delete Tweet. I assumed it was a Twitter problem since it happened with both my accounts, but when i try with Chrome, links post and work (tweets). I tried Firefox Safe Mode, and Refreshing Firefox, plus ran numerous antivirus scans, none repaired the problem. Big FF fan, have always used it and i donate every year to the Mozilla Foundation and would rather not have to use Chrome. Needless to say, after using FF so long i have many Bookmarks and Passwords saved.

If there is a problem, than one of the first things to consider is to run Firefox without the Addons. What seems to be happening is that with each new version of Firefox, there is the possibility that one of the Addons will become problematic. The Addon called ""Firefox Color"" would hang up the Firefox Browser when it was first opened. I have the Bar on top set to certain shade of Blue, and the Browser would start with the wrong color and takes several minutes for the right color to appear. Meanwhile the browser would be hung up and non functional. I would wait several minutes and could not browse. Firefox was waiting for something to initiate and became nonfunctional during that period. After several minutes I would shut Firefox and reopen, and get that ANNOYING MESSAGE... Firefox is still open. So I am trying again and again to get the Firefox to enable, and finally the Bar on top changes to the selected shade of Blue and is working again. So what did I do? I disabled ""Firefox Color"". So I no longer have that problem. </p>",windows-7;desktop;beta;fix-problems;firefox-1100;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Pete12345

I'm running LXLE Linux, a Debian derivative. </p><p>I ran  </p><p>sudo apt-get update </p><p>to update my sources, and then ran </p><p>sudo apt-get upgrade </p><p>to execute the system upgrade. </p><p>After I upgraded, I started Firefox, and all my history over 6 months, my passwords, and my profile settings were obliterated to a stock Firefox install. </p><p>How do I access my old information?  I have lost passwords.  I cannot access business information or email.  I have tried searching for profiles using about:profiles, but I have only one - the default.  I have also searched in the .mozilla/firefox folder in my home directory, and I find profiles.ini in that folder.  However, there are only two profiles, and I tried setting Default=1 for each of them and then starting Firefox, but with no different result.  The new installation of Firefox launches. </p><p>In my /home/deadpool/snap folder, I have firefox, and multiple versions, or so it seems.  I have this: </p><p>deadpool@deadpool-pc:~/snap/firefox$ ls 2263  2277  common  current deadpool@deadpool-pc:~/snap/firefox$ ls -lah total 20K drwxr-xr-x  5 deadpool deadpool 4.0K Jan 31 12:29 . drwx------ 10 deadpool deadpool 4.0K Jul 31  2022 .. drwxr-xr-x  4 deadpool deadpool 4.0K Jan 10  2020 2263 drwxr-xr-x  4 deadpool deadpool 4.0K Jan 31 12:29 2277 drwxr-xr-x  4 deadpool deadpool 4.0K Jan 10  2020 common lrwxrwxrwx  1 deadpool deadpool    4 Jan 31 12:29 current -&gt; 2277 deadpool@deadpool-pc:~/snap/firefox$  </p><p>It looks like there is a symlink for current to the 2077.  I would hypothesize that if I set the symlink to 2263, I would see my old firefox install.  Is that correct?  I don't want to break my install or lose data.
