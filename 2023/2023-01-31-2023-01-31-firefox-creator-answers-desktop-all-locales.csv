Not only does it integrate with the native dictionary, it also automatically detects and switches languages as you type.  Right-clicking on an unfamiliar word brings up the ""look up"" option which fins the word in the dictionary.  It's furthermore smart enough to detect misspelled words which are correct words in another language.  I don't know how apple achieved this, it's remarkable. </p><p>Anyway, Firefox displaces this functionality on the mac with their own dictionary, which although good, is not as good as the native spell checking and dictionary. </p><p>Is there a way to enable the native dictionary for Firefox on the Mac? </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1014;firefox-1090;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",fchickencs

However, when I provide my email, regardless of account, loading the prompt for my password takes a very long time, ~1-2 minutes. The page just spins infinitely, doesn't show any considerable usage in firefox's task manager, and doesn't give any errors in the process. The problem doesn't happen in another web browser, such as chrome. What's strange is that, AFAIK, the only two processes affected are the google login, and amazon checkout. I can hit the checkout button on amazon, but the page will simply load eternally. If I look at amazon through other means, such as my phone, I can see that the order I just checked out HAS been created and paid for, but firefox is caught on something and never loads the order complete page. Other logins and loading processes are not affected. Some (I have been trying to fix this for days and cannot remember all) of the troubleshooting steps I've taken are- -Manually removing all extensions -Disabling Window's Defender's browser protection -Running Firefox in safe mode -Completely refreshing firefox, wiping all settings, cookies, cache, and logins -Disabling tracking protection (although the indicator shield shows no activity on google's sites) -Double checking the cross-site cookie protocol (I've had the automatic five-exception set up, and have never been prompted about it before -Given the nature of the sites with issues (google, youtube, and amazon) I even checked for evidence of the Trojan mentioned here to no avail: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/websites-show-spinning-wheel-never-finish-load"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/websites-show-spinning-wheel-never-finish-load</a> </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",rileyflack123

If there is a problem, than one of the first things to consider is to run Firefox without the Addons. What seems to be happening is that with each new version of Firefox, there is the possibility that one of the Addons will become problematic. The Addon called ""Firefox Color"" would hang up the Firefox Browser when it was first opened. I have the Bar on top set to certain shade of Blue, and the Browser would start with the wrong color and takes several minutes for the right color to appear. Meanwhile the browser would be hung up and non functional. I would wait several minutes and could not browse. Firefox was waiting for something to initiate and became nonfunctional during that period. After several minutes I would shut Firefox and reopen, and get that ANNOYING MESSAGE... Firefox is still open. So I am trying again and again to get the Firefox to enable, and finally the Bar on top changes to the selected shade of Blue and is working again. So what did I do? I disabled ""Firefox Color"". So I no longer have that problem. </p>",windows-7;desktop;beta;fix-problems;firefox-1100;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Pete12345

I have lost passwords.  I cannot access business information or email.  I have tried searching for profiles using about:profiles, but I have only one - the default.  I have also searched in the .mozilla/firefox folder in my home directory, and I find profiles.ini in that folder.  However, there are only two profiles, and I tried setting Default=1 for each of them and then starting Firefox, but with no different result.
