I wanted to have a sidebar showing the websites bookmarked in my toolbar. In researching how to do this, it said I needed to use the menu button at the top left of the address bar to do this. The only thing is I have no menu button! Can you please tell me how to add the menu botton to my address bar so I can use the options it affords. I have added a screenshot of this Firefox window so you can see there is no menu button here. </p><p>I would very much appreciate it if you would get back to me as soon as possible so I can make Firefox more workable for me. </p><p>Thanks in advance for the help! </p><p>pennyand </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1120;firefox-11202;,firefox,customize,en-US,1580696;,pennyand

When online and searching for a site, I choose only https//: sites.  However, I am getting an unsecure warning when  I click on them.
