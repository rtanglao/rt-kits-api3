I tried to sign out of all the ""outside sites"" that want to log on, but there are sites that I need to log on to and have done this in the past. I usually go to these sites because they are important to my transacting business, accessing my bank, places I pay my bills, etc. If I want to get to these and order or pay a bill, I have to unblock each one of them??? How do I do that?  If a credit company wants to contact me, they cannot do this even if we have contacted  each other previously?  Really? </p><p>How do I undo this already-marked system and get out of it? As you can guess, I am old and not up with the times.
