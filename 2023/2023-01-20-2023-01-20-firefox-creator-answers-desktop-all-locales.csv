But it is getting to the point where almost every new order for a product I place with a new company fails because their website only works properly with Chrome. I'm not being negative here--this is my actual experience. And LastPass works better with Chrome than with Firefox, although I can't remember specifics at the moment. </p><p>I wonder if there is a specific reason for this general increase in problems, such as due to how I've customized my Firefox, or perhaps that Firefox is adhering too closely to browser standards, or something else. I don't even know if this vague but real problem is caused by me somehow, or is endemic to Firefox. </p><p>So, I'm posting this just in case someone else has encountered the same problems. </p><p>There is no particular error message to report. It's just that an increasing number of website forms are quietly failing to log me in, or to accept an order, or something similar. Just quiet failures that don't happen when I try the same thing in Chrome. </p><p>Important: I don't have ANY problems with Firefox with websites and apps that I myself have created. All Firefox languages--HTML, CSS, JavaScript--work perfectly for me. </p><p>I'd appreciate any feedback from others, as I really, really want to keep Firefox as my regular browser. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1080;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1560626;1560628;,David536
