I'm sure I'm using the correct password because I can log in using a different browser. I don't save passwords in Firefox. I enter them manually or use a password manager. As I said, I'm certain I'm using a valid password. I've cleared the cookies and all of the items under History on the Settings page. When I close Firefox, nothing is saved. When I contact NYT customer service, I was informed that they've had a lot of requests for assistance from Firefox users, and nothing was out of order with those users' NYT login; the problem was with Firefox. </p><p>Please advise. </p>",desktop;windows-10;firefox-970;firefox-9702;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",kenr2

I tried to sign out of all the ""outside sites"" that want to log on, but there are sites that I need to log on to and have done this in the past. I usually go to these sites because they are important to my transacting business, accessing my bank, places I pay my bills, etc. If I want to get to these and order or pay a bill, I have to unblock each one of them??? How do I do that?  If a credit company wants to contact me, they cannot do this even if we have contacted  each other previously?  Really? </p><p>How do I undo this already-marked system and get out of it? As you can guess, I am old and not up with the times.
