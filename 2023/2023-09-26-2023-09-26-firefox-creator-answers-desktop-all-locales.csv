Now, most of the Walgreens web site still works but the two menu options that need to display my personal prescription details fail with the display ""Sorry, an unexpected error occurred. Please try again later."" I initially thought that a Walgreens update might be in progress so just waited. Walgreens support gave me the same answer that there was probably web site maintenance in progress. After 4 days of the same problem and answer, I ported enough information to login in to Walgreens with the Microsoft Edge browser and access to my prescription information worked without a problem. I believe this problem with Firefox started around the time I updated to 117.0.1 but I might not have this perfectly correct. I was just notified to update to 118.0 and did so. Firefox access still fails and Edge access still works. Thanks for any help you can provide. Windows 10 </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1180;,firefox,other,en-US,1606300;,TrainClaude
