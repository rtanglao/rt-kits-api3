It works reliably for &gt;12months in all applications and under all circumstances except in Firefox where some key events are skipped non-deterministically. My test case is: </p><p>in a text field, emit `&lt;ctrl down&gt;a&lt;ctrl up&gt;<del>123456789987654321&lt;left&gt;...&lt;left&gt;` with 9 times `&lt;left&gt;`. Sometimes a 9 is missing and sometimes the cursor is further to the right than expected. </del></p><p>This happens every 8th try or so, which is too frequent to not break the user experience. </p><p>What I have tried: - multiple PCs (2 with this issue and 1 without) - Troubleshoot Mode - `window.onkeydown=(e)=&gt;console.log(e)` (events are missing) </p><p>Since I've only ever seen repeated characters/keys disappear and never when writing manually, I would guess there is some kind of event cleanup algorithm kicking in. (the events are emitted without any delays) </p><p>I would really like to fix this issue because Firefox is my favorite browser.
