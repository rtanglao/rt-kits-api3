So I downloaded Firefox ESR.

And I can't launch my old firefox in order to export the data to an html file.  So what can I do?

A quick refresh on the page seemed to help and it hasn't happened since.   </p><p>However, in going to open a new video, everything on the page loads BUT the actual video player.  I've cleared everything I could, disabled the ublock extension I had to stop ads, and also disabled the hardware accelerator that was suggested in an article I found. </p><p>Despite all this, the page does not finish loading yet it acts as if it has.  I've added a screenshot. </p><p>No issues using Chrome. </p><p>Thanks for any help and suggestions! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1160;,firefox,other,en-US,1594899;,whoward92

This isn't particularly convenient for how I tend to use multiple tabs and windows, and I would like to find a way to change the priority so that a recently closed tab would be reopened before a recently closed window. Alternatively, if there's a separate command that will only reopen recently closed tabs, that would be useful instead. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1160;,firefox,customize,en-US,1594902;1594919;1594938;,avirubinoff
