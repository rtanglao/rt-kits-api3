If I go to the audio options in windows while the audio is playing the bar moves as it something playing, but I cant hear anything. This only happens with instagram audio message and some random videos. Netflix, youtube, soundcloud, everything else works well, if I use chrome i'm able to hear everything with no problem, but I dont know whats happening with firefox. Ive already tried the entire audio troubleshoot, nothing works, don't know what else I can do </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,other,en-US,"",n.caros90

You can have an update happen within a few days of each other.  At least that's what appears to me.  I don't update apps unless I really need to.  But this constant reminder to update is so annoying!  So I'm forced to update, even though I'm not experiencing any issues with Firefox. </p><p>That being said, yesterday, I finally decided to update Firefox.  Says there is a 109.x.x update.  Fine.  I updated.  This morning, I get another update reminder.  This time it's for 110.0.1.  Turns out, this ""latest"" update was release Feb 28.  So my question is, if I updated Firefox on March 7, why did it <strong>NOT</strong> update to the ""<strong>latest</strong>"" version of 110.0.1?  Instead it, just updated to the second latest. </p><p>It seems that Firefox browser, and Firefox devs aren't very savvy, in getting the browser to update to the ""latest"" version. Like most apps would. With Firefox, it appears you have to update the version right after the current version your using. Which in my case, is still an older version of the browser.  So after it updated to a newer older version.  Then it was able to update to next update after that.  Which I'm guessing is 110.0.1. With other apps, you don't have to download ALL the updates <strong>one at a time</strong>, to get to the latest version.  You just update to the latest version, and ALL previous and current updates happen at once.  That's smarter and more efficient. </p><p>This seems to track of how <strong>not</strong> very intelligent Firefox is.  At the very least, make the option to <strong>NOT GET REMINDERS TO UPDATE</strong>.  Give users the option to update when they want to, <strong>without</strong> getting annoying notifications.  AND/OR when users finally do decide to update, that they would <strong>UPDATE TO THE LATEST</strong> version.  And not have to do multiple updates just to get to the latest update. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1013;firefox-1090;firefox-10901;,firefox,other,en-US,"",bguss72
