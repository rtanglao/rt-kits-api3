When I went to view manage history to look, I found that there are only history tabs for Today, Yesterday, and Last 7 days. There is no more all history and I can't find anything older than 7 days ago. I looked at my privacy preferences and it's still set for Firefox to remember all history. Entering troubleshoot mode did nothing to fix the issue, either. How can I make it so Firefox remembers history older than 7 days? Why did it stop? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1608946;,pamjunk23
