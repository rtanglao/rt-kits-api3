I am writing to express my concerns and seek assistance with some persistent performance issues I have been experiencing while using Mozilla Firefox. </p><p>Over the past few weeks, I have noticed a significant decline in the performance of Mozilla Firefox, specifically in terms of webpage loading times and the functionality of multimedia content, such as videos. Many websites that used to load quickly now take an unusually long time to open, and, in some cases, they do not load at all. Additionally, when attempting to stream videos, I encounter frequent buffering and playback issues, which have not been a problem when using alternative web browsers. </p><p>I have been a loyal user of Mozilla Firefox for many years and greatly appreciate the browser's commitment to privacy and security. However, the recent performance issues I have encountered are affecting my productivity and overall browsing experience. I have attempted to troubleshoot these issues on my own by clearing my browser cache, disabling extensions, and updating Firefox to the latest version. Despite these efforts, the problems persist. </p><p>I am writing to request your assistance in resolving these issues and restoring the smooth and efficient performance of Mozilla Firefox on my system. I rely on this browser for various online activities, including work-related tasks and research, and the current situation is hindering my ability to do so effectively. </p><p>To help diagnose and address these problems, I have included some relevant information about my system below: </p><pre>   Operating System: Windows 11    Mozilla Firefox Version: Latest    Internet Connection: 50mbps of fiber optic connection </pre> <p>I kindly request that your support team investigate the issues I have described and provide guidance on how to resolve them. If any additional information or diagnostics are needed from my end, please do not hesitate to let me know, and I will gladly cooperate in any way possible. </p><p>I value Mozilla Firefox as a browser and hope to continue using it as my preferred choice. Your prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated. Please respond to this letter at your earliest convenience, either by email or through any other preferred method of communication. </p><p>Thank you for your time and assistance in addressing these performance issues. I look forward to your prompt response and resolution of the problems I am encountering. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",shahzebjadoon31.sj

Granted, not all of the videos would show up, and I don't know if that is a Youtube problem or a Firefox problem, but most of the videos would be there. Now, after going back less than a year in the archive, the scrolling just kind of peters out. Firefox becomes unresponsive to any key press or mouse click, and all I can do is quit the program. What has changed? Has Firefox gotten even worse at memory management? it was always a total pig with memory, but has it reached the point where it just plain malfunctions and can't recover? If that is the case, then Firefox devs had better get their spit together and work on optimization. I really don't want to have to start using Edge, thank you, no. I only use Edge to view PDFs. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1153;firefox-11531;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1609012;,kurtfaasse
