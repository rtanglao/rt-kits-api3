The laptop is an Asus which has been reliable with that connection until a few months ago. The browser is Version 111.0.1 with automatic updates, using Duck-duck Go as the search engine.  It finds the Bank's webpage without difficulty (as it does with everything else).  What is supposed to happen then is the Bank's webpage offers a question regarding acceptance of using their cookies.  However this question frequently does not appear thus, the webpage will not respond.  This is usually the case during the working day, yet it seems to be satisfactory during the evening. An alternative laptop using Firefox &amp; Duck-duck Go does receive the Cookies question and subsequent access at all times. </p><p>I have discussed this situation with the Bank IT staff but their reply is that their system is working correctly and to try Google Chrome instead. That does work OK but I am not keen to use it for various reasons.   </p><p>All suggestions that will hopefully resolve this snag will be gratefully received. </p><p>Kind regards, Tim </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,other,en-US,"",timsimpson320

It is running on 13.2.1 (22D68), which I think is Ventura.  A couple of days ago I noticed that while I can still download any attachment to the browser from gmail or hotmail, I can no longer drag and drop to my desktop. I have tried the download/drag and drop to my desktop capability on Safari from both gmail and hotmail, and it works fine.  This seems to be a Firefox issue. Can you please tell me what I need to do to fix this issue?  Thank you so much!  Firefox is the best!  James H. </p>",mac-os;desktop;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1574093;,jameshewitt
