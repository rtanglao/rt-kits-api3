Junk mail also behaves normally. I tried clearly cache, deleting cookies, turning off blockers, restarting, made sure it was whitelisted. Just started doing this a couple of days ago. Looks like it may be rearranging the emails with every refresh, but it happens fast so I'm not certain. Can't click on an email or delete or even logout on that page, but can get to junk mail which works normally. An internet search revealed plenty of other Firefox users with the same issue.

It is running on 13.2.1 (22D68), which I think is Ventura.  A couple of days ago I noticed that while I can still download any attachment to the browser from gmail or hotmail, I can no longer drag and drop to my desktop. I have tried the download/drag and drop to my desktop capability on Safari from both gmail and hotmail, and it works fine.  This seems to be a Firefox issue. Can you please tell me what I need to do to fix this issue?  Thank you so much!  Firefox is the best!  James H. </p>",mac-os;desktop;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1574093;,jameshewitt
