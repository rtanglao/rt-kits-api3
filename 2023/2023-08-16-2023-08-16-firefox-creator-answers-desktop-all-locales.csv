Some emails (seems to be only one sender) do not indicate there is an attachment (and there isn't) but when viewed on webmail the PDF attachment is there and opens fine. The email source data indicates an attachment is somewhere. If the same email is forwarded from my phone the attachment is indicated to be there and is viewable OK. An email with a PDF attachment, from a completely different source a few days earlier had no problems and this issue seems to have been there for at least 2 years.  Attached are two screenshots of the bottom of the faulty emails and the good email showing the attachment pane, it's there on the good email but not on the faulty one. There doesn't seem to be any way of turning the attachment pane off if there is an attachment there. There is also an image of the Firefox email list that indicates an attachment on the good forwarded email but missing on the faulty one. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",AlnDav
