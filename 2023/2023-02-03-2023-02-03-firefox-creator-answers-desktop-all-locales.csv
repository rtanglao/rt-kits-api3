The app does not crash or close, but the window disappears. I have restarted my computer, updated my computer, and reinstalled Firefox after deleting the files in application support. None of these fixed my issue. I can keep the window open for more than a couple seconds if am able to click on Finder in the menu bar before the window disappears, however, after leaving the Finder menu the app disappears after a couple seconds.  </p><p>Any ideas on how to solve this issue? </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",davie255
