Why are there no passwords etc? Aren't they automatically drawn from my usual (existing) account?  </p><p>The laptop runs Win 10.

I can't change my Flickr cover photo because the pop up window is too huge, can't view a complete google doc because the thing is enormous, etc. The issue is that I MUST have the ability to set text in firefox to larger and I do so via the view - zoom in and zoom text only options. I have to have this ability because I have a visual disability. I do not have this issue using chrome but I detest chrome and want to keep using firefox, but entire portions of windows are cut off when they open up and I can't access them by zooming out either. The only thing that changes is the text gets so small that it is totally unreadable. This is a HUGE problem for me. I will NOT change my default windows setting to try and fix a firefox issue because that then screws up my window sizes for games, programs etc for my other software that I also use daily. So I won't be changing what works for 20 programs via windows settings to make ONE browser work better. This is a firefox problem, and firefox needs to fix it. I have tried multiple solutions cited online and nothing is working. If firefox is trying to get rid of it's users with visual disabilities, this is the way to go. Here is an image link that shows the issue on flickr. The pop up should be completely visible and should have a scroll portion to resize the selected image in the lower portion of that circle, but it gets totally cut off and there is no scrollbar to move down, nor doe trying to resize or zoom out on these pop ups help, nothing changes.  <a href=""https://gyazo.com/11dc090e7209c13a3e4cff37246aa6b5"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gyazo.com/11dc090e7209c13a3e4cff37246aa6b5</a> this is how it should properly look / work, pic taken on chrome browser  <a href=""https://gyazo.com/0689a605b7a60857c9c15b9c9fec4a07"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gyazo.com/0689a605b7a60857c9c15b9c9fec4a07</a> </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",myhaybug
