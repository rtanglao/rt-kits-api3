After logging in for about 4 hours, I signed out, read long enough <strong>to select the ""delete all data"" checkmark</strong>, and shutdown their computer. </p><p>This evening, I have realized my account has hundreds of bookmarks unrelated to my account. After some confirmation I now know this information is from the laptop I synced from, and all this data was synced in some 5 hours. </p><p>Is there a way I can backup my sync data to the morning before this happened? And if I deleted my friends data, can they recover their bookmarks/browser info another way? (they wouldn't  have synced to my data since I deleted only mine after I logged out). </p><p>Sincerely, a panicked firefox user. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,sync,en-US,1604739;,cathconfusion
