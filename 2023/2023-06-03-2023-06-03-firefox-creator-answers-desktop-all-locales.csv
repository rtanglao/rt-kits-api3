I do not want to search for a known url or I would select it from the drop down list. I want to search the word “cat”. I have to enter a blank space to search a single term but this is super annoying when your trying to quickly find content.  </p><p>How can I adjust this so when I type a word, it will only search that word when I hit enter rather than jump to a saved url.  </p><p>Thanks Dave </p>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",daveadema

The one thing I have a had time with and having to ""type manually"" is when I select and element in Dev Tools related to CSS. When an element is highlighted and I click the + sign, it does not present the exact CSS code. See screenshot. </p><p>In Firebug, I could click that and the + sign and that same exact code would appear on the right. But it does not. It's some modified version and I always have to update the code. </p><p>If there something? Also, in Firebug, I could right click that element at the bottom and copy it. I cannot do that. It doesn't allow me to copy it. </p><p>This is really slowing me down and I don't like to use a lot of add-ons in the browsers. Thanks in advance. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",thecre8tivediva
