The situation is as follows. I open a lot of tabs (I have to have hundreds of open tabs sometimes). Then at some moment I delete all history for all time. In old times, if I switch to whatever tab after clearing all history, the left arrow in my Firefox window was greyed out. If I right-clicked on that left arrow, I saw nothing, and if I pressed Alt + left arrow on my keyboard, nothing would happen. All those things were logical, because I had my history cleared. However, in the recent years this behavior has changed. In most tabs I still see the old behavior. Sometimes, however, I switch to some tab and I see that the left arrow is not greyed out; if I right-click on it, I see a list of several pages I visited earlier. In a similar way, if I press Alt + left arrow on my keyboard, I can go through pages in that list. I.e., the history for that particular tab (or several tabs, out of many) seems to persist when I clear all of my history. Any comments much appreciated. I get a vague impression that maybe those tabs were ""sleeping"" somehow when I cleared my history, and now they ""wake up"" with their part of the whole history still remaining in place. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1020;,firefox,other,en-US,"",maksym.kozub1

I upgraded it to 112.0.2 via Help-About, but saw the same issue. </p><p>That is, starting Fx, opening a ""private browsing window"" and visit some site, say a search engine, then closing the private window and finally the first Fx window. (At the time I also see some spikes in CPU usage from the firewall software etc.) </p><p>Since I can’t have it like this, computer almost stalling for 30 sec, after closing Fx, and to see if there would be any update later to solve this issue, I uninstalled Fx 112.0.2 (I have complete backups of Fx profiles), and, just as a test, reinstalled Fx using the prior version of setup that I had, Fx 110.0. </p><p>Of course this meant a clean profile, not what any user wants to see (missing bookmarks is almost minor compared to all settings, incl. in add-ons, gathered over time. So I used the profile manager to change to my previously used default profile. After a restart I was greeted with a prompt that this couldn’t be done (since it may corrupt bookmarks(?) etc.) and I was left with the only options to abort (cancel) or create a new profile. Oh, great. I had not even used the newer ver. (Fx 112) to change or create anything, but I assume Mozilla could have something between the different versions. </p><p>So, I uninstalled Fx 110.0 (and of course in the process of creating a new profile/resetting settings it had reverted to ""download updates in background"", and I had to change that setting back, and stopped what was pending, during my tests trying to move it to my old profile). I installed Fx again, using the setup file for 112.0.1 and did a direct upgrade to 112.0.2, and pointed it to my old default profile, which had been used with 110.0.1 and during the first upgrade to 112.0.1. </p><p>Fx is working with my profile again, but it takes a very long time to close and (perhaps together with other software) consumes a lot of CPU, almost stalling the PC.
