I get my extensions, but I have to pin them every time I switch devices. Is this expected behavior, or is there a setting I'm missing somewhere? (And if it is - why?) </p><p>Thanks for any help! </p>",linux;desktop;sync;firefox-1190;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",Stray6678

The symptoms are that FF will just go catatonic (spinning circle, Not Responding Header). When this happens the hard drive light is on solid. Eventually (10s of seconds to several minutes) FF will return to operation. Any idea of what is happening and how to fix this? </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Steve_Sr.
