The site is dynamic, by which I mean different content is sent to the browser depending on any of a collection of conditions. In reviewing the results after adding the scripts, there was an issue of script duplication but there was also a difference in how the results were being evaluated: 1: using view page and/or frame source in the browser and  2: using the page inspector from within the browser. </p><p>The sources showed one instance of each script - but the inspector showed duplication. ALSO, surprising to me, while the inspector showed the frames structure, it also showed the full page content of the main frame's web page in the noframes section of the overall container page. In other words, the noframes section included the doc-type and head section of the main frame's page. This seems confusing because the webserver does not deliver the doc-type and head section of the noframes section's content. </p><p>My question is what are the differences in the way that the browser and the inspector access page files? In this case, the sources of both the overall container page and the frame only source of the main content frame both seem good, no duplication; however, the inspector shows both possible instances of the scripts. </p><p>Probably could have asked more clearly - sorry lol - and thanks </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1190;,firefox,other,en-US,"",hav
