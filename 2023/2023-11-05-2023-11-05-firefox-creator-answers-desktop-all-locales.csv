Usually the problem goes away. This is stated as a problem with their security certificate. However, my tablet, also running Firefox (119.0.1) has no problem accessing my account. What is really the problem?  I am running Windows 7 on my ancient lap-top (yes, I know it is way outdated, but I'm attached to it and rely on the security software I'm paying for) The tablet is running Android 8.1.0 and is my last resort for internet. Would really like to fix this. </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",robertsk65

I am able to browse to these sites just fine. However, while navigating through said sites, sometimes links will not open. They do open in MS Edge and Google Chrome. One example is on the Kreg Tool website - <a href=""https://www.kregtool.com/shop/workspace/bench-system-components/universal-bench-base-with-standard-height-legs/BENCH-BASE-STANDARD.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.kregtool.com/shop/workspace/bench-system-components/universal-bench-base-with-standard-height-legs/BENCH-BASE-STANDARD.html</a> - I am not able to select the bench size from the drop down list. Firefox goes into a loop then I have to refresh to get out of the loop. Hopefully someone can explain this or provide a workaround. </p><p>Thanks much. </p><p>Dwane </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1190;,firefox,other,en-US,"",dwane37837

The symptoms are that FF will just go catatonic (spinning circle, Not Responding Header). When this happens the hard drive light is on solid. Eventually (10s of seconds to several minutes) FF will return to operation. Any idea of what is happening and how to fix this? </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Steve_Sr.
