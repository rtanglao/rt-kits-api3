The first problem I found was the directory .cache, full of kinds of things that change daily and don't belong in a backup. I eliminated this directory from the backups, halving their size. So far so good. But the incremental backups are still huge, even on days where I've barely used the system at all. </p><p>The next biggest questionable directory is .mozilla/firefox/05malccw.default-release and in particular .mozilla/firefox/05malccw.default-release/storage  </p><p>$ du -sh .mozilla/firefox/05malccw.default-release/storage 2.2G	.mozilla/firefox/05malccw.default-release/storage </p><p>It's pretty clear what program creates this and regularly changes it contents. Examining the files suggests that most or all of them are useless in a data-recovery type situation. But I'm not sure. </p><p>What's in this directory? Will the path change when I update to a new version of firefox, using normal ubuntu tools? Is there an rsync pattern I can use to identify all possible directories with this function, so as to teach my backup script to ignore not only the current directory, but the one I'll get when I next update firefox? </p><p>Are there other directories created/populated by firefox that shouldn't be in backups, besides .mozilla/firefox/05malccw.default-release/ and .cache/mozilla&nbsp;? </p><p>Note that I'm on an ubuntu derivative, using the packages from the distro repositories; it's more than possible that paths are determines at build time, by the people who configure and build those packages. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",DinoNerd

Previously it worked like a charm, but my bank updated its security and it hasn't worked since. However if I perform the same operation on Google Chrome it works. I have a similar experience on a few other web sites.  Is there something in my Firefox settings preventing this from happening?

The site is dynamic, by which I mean different content is sent to the browser depending on any of a collection of conditions. In reviewing the results after adding the scripts, there was an issue of script duplication but there was also a difference in how the results were being evaluated: 1: using view page and/or frame source in the browser and  2: using the page inspector from within the browser. </p><p>The sources showed one instance of each script - but the inspector showed duplication. ALSO, surprising to me, while the inspector showed the frames structure, it also showed the full page content of the main frame's web page in the noframes section of the overall container page. In other words, the noframes section included the doc-type and head section of the main frame's page. This seems confusing because the webserver does not deliver the doc-type and head section of the noframes section's content. </p><p>My question is what are the differences in the way that the browser and the inspector access page files? In this case, the sources of both the overall container page and the frame only source of the main content frame both seem good, no duplication; however, the inspector shows both possible instances of the scripts. </p><p>Probably could have asked more clearly - sorry lol - and thanks </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1190;,firefox,other,en-US,"",hav
