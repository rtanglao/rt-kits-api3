I decided to restart it. After that bookmark toolbar was gone. Then I restarted it agian. Most sites loaded fine. But some logged out, others do not at all! e.g. I had to sign in on YouTube. <a href=""http://web.whatsapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">web.whatsapp.com</a> does not work anymore (more on that later) When I tried to load this site and ask question I get this error: Local storage and cookies are required (well other sites are using them?!) I am writing this on my Chromium. The issue with whatsapp is complicated. <a href=""http://web.whatsapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">web.whatsapp.com</a> is stuck in a window (see images). I cleared site data and cookies but still no help here. I can open the page in incognito mode without a problem (of course not logged in). I restarted FF multiple times before and after clearing cache. I can't even open the inspector here: sometimes it opens a blank window (see image below) sometimes it does not open anything. Safe mode has the same issues. </p><p>I am wondering, what is wrong with my profile. I do not want to lose my bookmarks, history and all the open tabs. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;ubuntu-2204;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1597203;1597204;1597206;,sarentasciyan

Ho scoperto che questo problema è condiviso da MOLTI utenti. In pratica, si tratta di uno scroll-down automatico: mentre si naviga, per lo più Facebook, improvvisamente il testo scorrre in basso per pagine e pagine e si è costretti a risalire, ma inesorabilmente Firefox riprende a scorrere in basso, creandosi una specie di gara a chi è più testardo fra l'utilizzatore e il navigatore. Questa cosa avviene molto spesso. A volte si risolve chiudendo tutte le schede aperte e poi il browser e poi riaprendolo. Ma dopo un po' il problema si ripropone. Vedo che ultimamente ci sono stati molti aggiornamenti: se non vi siete accorti di questo problema tanto diffuso e TANTO fastidioso, ve lo segnalo. </p><p>I've got a VERY annoying problem with Firefox (PC version, OS Windows 11). I have discovered that this problem is shared by MANY users. Basically, it is an automatic scroll-down: while you are browsing, mostly on Facebook, suddenly the text scrolls down through pages and pages and you are forced to scroll back up; but inexorably Firefox starts scrolling down again, creating a kind of race to see who is more stubborn between the user and the browser. This happens very often. Sometimes it is solved by closing all open tabs and then the browser and then reopening it. But after a while the problem recurs. I see that there have been a lot of updates lately: if you have not noticed this widespread and VERY annoying problem, I am pointing it out to you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;needsinfo;windows-11;firefox-1160;firefox-11602;,firefox,fix-problems,it,1597089;,lionspqr
