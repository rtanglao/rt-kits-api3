The browser changes the color of the photos itself because when you download the photo back to a computer and compare it with original one in the photo viewer, the difference is noticeable. After some research, I found advice to use the gfx.color_management.mode set to 0, it helped, but the photos after upload looks over-saturated, but only in Mozilla. In other words, the photos after upload looks over-saturated in Mozilla (the way the browser displays them) but the browser does not change the color of the photo itself as it was before, because there are no any difference if compare with originals after download to a pc. I attached an example, but did changes in the third photo on purpose just for reference, because as I said earlier, the colors of this photo are displayed normally in all other programs except Mozzila, I just wanted to show how it looks in Mozzila. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mudrickij
