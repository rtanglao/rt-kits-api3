I can still interact with the page itself, but whether using the mouse or keyboard shortcuts, changing, opening, or closing tabs, or even typing in the navigation bar, won't do anything until I resize the window again. I haven't been able to figure out any pattern to when this state triggers, but after it does, it doesn't clear up without closing and reopening the browser. I have recorded a video showing this behavior but I am unable to upload it here, and still images would not properly convey the issue. </p>",linux;desktop;tabs;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1614266;,rubegoldbergguy

Shop disney used to save all my details at the checkout process where you put your name/address &amp; telephone number in, but it's no longer happening it's all wiped out every time I shop now. </p><p>I've shop disney about this and they say clear your cache or try another browser or see your browser setting to save details.  the only details i can see I can save with firefox is, my credit card details or logging. I replied back to shop Disney that i'm sure personal details like my name and address etc in the fields are already filled out at checkout, eahc time i'm logged in and this is something to do with their website not my browsers? </p><p>But can I please check on that please with firefox, just to be clear again it's not th issue with saving loggin details, it's the fact the fields on the boxes' where you input your full name, telephone number and adrdess as never automatically filled out.  I'm sure there has to be a box on shop disney you click that save save my details for next time, but there isn't. they think it's my browser. but as i can't see a box to tick in the settings privacy tab, that says save personal details on websites for checkout to pay, I don't know what to do. I also enclose screen shot of the type of box that you possibly know you have to fill in upon buying an item on line, this is the box that is always clear now of all my personal data, how do I get it to keep my info saved on the shop disney website so that it won't keep wiping it out each time I log out of shop disney account please? </p><p>Kind Regards Miss Tracy Fletcher e-mail me at traymicra@aol.com </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1190;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",traymicra
