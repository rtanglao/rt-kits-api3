The keyboard focus does not seem to cause an immediate close like the mouse does (as above). </p><p>As an aside, Chromium suffers the same now </p><p>It is something mouse related it seems and with how it all works with TWM    - which is old, but as said, there was not a problem previously so whats changed in this version of Firefox browser to introduce this 'bug'. </p><p>Peace and best wishes to all Habs </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1151;firefox-11510;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1596402;,habsbc

It keeps telling me to activate my virus software but it is already running and I have done scans to try to verify my system but all seems well. I have also booted my system from a virus recovery CD (created on a separate system) and scanned my hard disks, again all was clean. I have attached a screenshot of two of the messages for you to see. I have installed Chrome to try and see what is happening but, although it does not issue and messages, it seems to have problems too? Microsoft Edge seems to work OK but I hate it. Please help? </p><p>Kind regards, Chris Griffin </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-11;firefox-1160;firefox-11602;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",griffinster

The database is the U.S., School Yearbooks, 1900-2016.
