The database is the U.S., School Yearbooks, 1900-2016. All of the other image databases on Ancestry download without issue, and I am able to download the Yearbook images using Edge, so this appears to be a Firefox issue, especially as it began immediately following the most recent update. </p><p>The Yearbook images do differ from the others in that you are given an option to download two images as a zip file, or just a single image, but neither option results in the Save As dialogue appearing, and the images do not download anywhere. </p><p>This is a very strange issue, but maybe someone familiar with the most recent update could have some insight as to what has been changed that might have this impact. </p><p>Windows 11 Version 22H2 (OS Build 22621.2134), if that makes any difference. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1160;firefox-11602;,firefox,other,en-US,"",geoear

Porém, há uns dias, o site do TJSP (e-Saj), passou a trabalhar com um certo ""delay"": ao entrar na pesquisa de processo, após digitar o número, o site demora a retornar e entrar no processo desejado. Está acontecendo no firefox e depois, ao testar, verifiquei o mesmo problema no Edge. Somente não Chrome não está assim e, em razão disso, para trabalhar com o e-Saj (fico muitas horas), estou fazendo somente no Chrome. Não sei a razão do ""bug"". Utilizo kaspersky (sem o salvador de chaves) e W10 Pro. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1160;firefox-11602;,firefox,fix-problems,pt-BR,"",pinheiro_adv
