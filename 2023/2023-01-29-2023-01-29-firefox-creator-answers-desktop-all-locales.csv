I have run complete scans with Webroot and it found nothing. I have tried uninstalling Webroot antivirus &amp; rebooting and it made no difference, the pop-up still appears. I have tried downloading Malwarebytes and running a complete scan while Webroot was uninstalled, and it found nothing. I am out of ideas.

However, I went back to the actual profiles folder to check out of curiosity, and the new profile was there. So creating new profiles is clearly not the answer, because it will just refuse to recognize them too. </p><p>I also tried opening Firefox in troubleshooting mode by holding down option and clicking the icon--it didn't work.
