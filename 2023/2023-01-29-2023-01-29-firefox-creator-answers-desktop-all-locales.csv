Then there are two clickable choices, Continue and Cancel. I always click Cancel because I don't know what this Threat Protection is. Then the pop-up keeps reappearing. About every five minutes it pops up and two or three times in a row after I click Cancel. It does this as long as Firefox is open. I have tried disabling Nord VPN and it made no difference. I have run complete scans with Webroot and it found nothing. I have tried uninstalling Webroot antivirus &amp; rebooting and it made no difference, the pop-up still appears. I have tried downloading Malwarebytes and running a complete scan while Webroot was uninstalled, and it found nothing. I am out of ideas. I fear it is malware, but Nord VPN did not stop it, and both Webroot antivirus and Malwarebytes scans find nothing.

I was unclear whether they were profiles or something else. They have names like ""2sb6poj9.default"" or ""gya9gghh.default-release"". Most of them contain something called ""times.json"" but one of them has a whole bunch of stuff in there, so maybe it's the real profile?  </p><p>I also followed some other instructions and was able to bring up what another website called the old Firefox Profile Manager.

However, I went back to the actual profiles folder to check out of curiosity, and the new profile was there. So creating new profiles is clearly not the answer, because it will just refuse to recognize them too. </p><p>I also tried opening Firefox in troubleshooting mode by holding down option and clicking the icon--it didn't work.
