Every once in awhile when using Firefox it will pop up to a full sized white screen except for my taskbar and freeze for a couple of seconds. This will happen usually when I am opening a new page/link or moving to a different tab. I have quite a few tabs open but I have always ran Firefox this way and never had problems before. </p><p>Sometimes after flashing white several times Firefox will crash. Ending the Firefox task in Task Manager, running a cleaning program and restarting fixes this for a while but it still keeps happening. Any help or advice is appreciated. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1090;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Isebas

It may be missing or inaccessible.""  </p><p>I read the ""How to run Firefox when your profile is missing or inaccessible"" page. It implied that I had moved or deleted profiles--I had not. I hadn't even been aware that Firefox had profiles.  </p><p>I followed the instructions and found my Firefox profiles folder, and was confused to find 15 separate folders in it. I was unclear whether they were profiles or something else. They have names like ""2sb6poj9.default"" or ""gya9gghh.default-release"". Most of them contain something called ""times.json"" but one of them has a whole bunch of stuff in there, so maybe it's the real profile?  </p><p>I also followed some other instructions and was able to bring up what another website called the old Firefox Profile Manager. The space where it should be showing profiles was, unsurprisingly, empty. I tried creating a new profile and it let me but then told me it hadn't saved it, and the space remained blank. However, I went back to the actual profiles folder to check out of curiosity, and the new profile was there. So creating new profiles is clearly not the answer, because it will just refuse to recognize them too. </p><p>I also tried opening Firefox in troubleshooting mode by holding down option and clicking the icon--it didn't work. However, I just checked the Profiles folder after another attempt and even making this attempt seems to create a new folder! Is that normal? </p><p>I have no idea what to do at this point. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ksiusia
