It didn't say anything about fixing anything. Suddenly all my data is gone; all bookmarks, history, accounts, ect.   I restarted my pc ,and everything came back that day (2 dys ago) However, I JUST closed the browser and reopened it, and everything is gone again! I don't know what is going on, but it's been very frustrating.  </pre> <p>Steps I have already tried per this forum-  </p><pre>I have restarted my PC, I have shut down and started up my PC.  </pre> <p>I have checked for multiple accounts and profiles (looks like there's now 3 brand new ones all created today with no history) I tried to log into a firefox account in case I had one, I didn't, so now I have a new account. I have checked my desktop and searched every file for anything remotely related to a file called ""old firefox data"". There isn't one. I have opened the folder where profiles are kept on my PC and found one that has files on it that date back to 2019, before the update, although I am not sure what to do with them, on the surface it doesn't look like there is anything with old data on it.  </p><p>So if anyone has any ideas or knows where I can go with those profile files on my PC next I would appreciate it since the forums all seem to just ask people if they are there and to come back for additional help if they found anything.  </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1090;,firefox,other,en-US,"",lymandaniele

I use Nord VPN and Webroot antivirus which I have been using several years. This event just started occurring a week ago, and I can't find any Google references to it. As soon as I open Firefox a pop-up appears that says: ""Quit your browser app. For Threat Protection to start working with your browser, you need to quit it first. Quit Firefox and click Continue."" Then there are two clickable choices, Continue and Cancel. I always click Cancel because I don't know what this Threat Protection is. Then the pop-up keeps reappearing. About every five minutes it pops up and two or three times in a row after I click Cancel. It does this as long as Firefox is open. I have tried disabling Nord VPN and it made no difference. I have run complete scans with Webroot and it found nothing. I have tried uninstalling Webroot antivirus &amp; rebooting and it made no difference, the pop-up still appears. I have tried downloading Malwarebytes and running a complete scan while Webroot was uninstalled, and it found nothing. I am out of ideas. I fear it is malware, but Nord VPN did not stop it, and both Webroot antivirus and Malwarebytes scans find nothing. I would appreciate any help. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1090;,firefox,other,en-US,1562485;1562491;1562495;,debow48

1403640,2023-01-28 16:54:15 -0800,2023-01-28 16:54:15 -0800,Firefox occasionally switches to a white fullscreen,"<p>For about a month or so I have been having this problem. Every once in awhile when using Firefox it will pop up to a full sized white screen except for my taskbar and freeze for a couple of seconds. This will happen usually when I am opening a new page/link or moving to a different tab. I have quite a few tabs open but I have always ran Firefox this way and never had problems before. </p><p>Sometimes after flashing white several times Firefox will crash. Ending the Firefox task in Task Manager, running a cleaning program and restarting fixes this for a while but it still keeps happening. Any help or advice is appreciated. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1090;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Isebas

It may be missing or inaccessible.""  </p><p>I read the ""How to run Firefox when your profile is missing or inaccessible"" page. It implied that I had moved or deleted profiles--I had not. I hadn't even been aware that Firefox had profiles.  </p><p>I followed the instructions and found my Firefox profiles folder, and was confused to find 15 separate folders in it. I was unclear whether they were profiles or something else. They have names like ""2sb6poj9.default"" or ""gya9gghh.default-release"". Most of them contain something called ""times.json"" but one of them has a whole bunch of stuff in there, so maybe it's the real profile?  </p><p>I also followed some other instructions and was able to bring up what another website called the old Firefox Profile Manager. The space where it should be showing profiles was, unsurprisingly, empty. I tried creating a new profile and it let me but then told me it hadn't saved it, and the space remained blank. However, I went back to the actual profiles folder to check out of curiosity, and the new profile was there. So creating new profiles is clearly not the answer, because it will just refuse to recognize them too. </p><p>I also tried opening Firefox in troubleshooting mode by holding down option and clicking the icon--it didn't work. However, I just checked the Profiles folder after another attempt and even making this attempt seems to create a new folder! Is that normal? </p><p>I have no idea what to do at this point. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1562480;1562481;1562487;1562488;,ksiusia
