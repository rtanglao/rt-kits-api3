But, I see the instructions for the uninstall, Delete the Firefox installation folder, which is located in one of these locations, by default: </p><pre>   Windows: (Note: Check both folders.)        C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox        C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox  </pre> <p>Being I'm not computer wizard I had trouble finding the location of such folder. But when I accessed my program list in my windows program list I see a program named Mozilla maintenance service.  When I click on that I see a format/window to ""uninstall C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\."" Is this the program/folder I need to uninstall to complete the proper instructions I need to perform a clean install? If so, when I delete it I then reinstall Firefox once again after the uninstall procedure? Is performing the uninstall procedure going to screw up my Firefox browser and my many bookmarks I have accumulated over the years? Can someone please help and explain? Thank you. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1090;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",sciencemagic
