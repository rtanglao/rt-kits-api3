Anyway, I don't know what this falls under, but after the update before last (I'm currently on 109.0.1 (64-bit)), my window history has disappeared. I had a window with at least 20 tabs open. I closed 3 Firefox windows, reopened it later, and only 2 of my 3 windows opened. When I went to open the 3rd window, it wasn't there in the history. The tabs aren't in 'Recently closed tabs' and definitely got lost from 'Recently closed windows'. What a disaster, because this is going to cause me a lot of work and I don't remember what was in all the tabs. </p><p>Oh, how I wish you had some sort of SAVE ALL option before applying these updates. They are doing weird things, including my bookmark sorting being all messed up after an update. Haven't gotten that to work right since it got out of whack. Sorting doesn't stick when I close Firefox windows. </p><p>Now, I have a bunch of tabs missing that I can't get back. UGH! Where did they go? I can't possibly know what Firefox will break, which is why we need a SAVE ALL where Firefox knows all the nooks &amp; crannies to save before applying updates.
