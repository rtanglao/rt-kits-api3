I first noticed it a week ago when I tried to log in and then ended up calling the bank tech support. They told me to use google chrome instead. I have been using Firefox for years and never had a problem. After researching for latest update changes, I tried changing the settings to allow cookies for the session for the bank but this did not work either.   Any idea why this is happening? Thank you. Tony. </p>",desktop;other;windows-8;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,other,en-US,"",tony.koukounas

I still have all my bookmarks, history and download history, extensions (though they are not visible on the upper tab like usual) even some user prompts. The start up page is two tabs ""Open up an amazing internet Our latest version is built around you,.."" says on, while the second is "" Firefox Privacy Notice Effective August 1, 2022 "". These two tabs keep opening on startup even though Ive restarted dozens of times and chose specific statup pages in settings. </p><p>What happened to my passwords and what ways can I attempt to recover them.

I tried to use this extension: </p><p><a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/shortkeys/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/shortkeys/</a> </p><p>But sadly my new added shortcuts were not opening the new private window while the ctrl + shift + p still worked, and it appears that this extension is only able to add new shortcuts and not change nor delete the existing ones. I want to assign a comfortable keyboard shortcut for opening a we private window (optionally unassign the Ctrl + Shift + N from Undo close window and assign that keyboard to open a new private window). </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",Shmark
