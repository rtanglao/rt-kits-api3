All Firefox history shows me is the order in which I went to the website. For example, if I got to History&gt;Today&gt; it just says that I went to supportdotmozilladotorg, not the date or time. Same if I go to ""Last 7 days"" - it's simply a list of the sites I've visited, not which day of the week I went to them. Any advice would be appreciated as this is somewhat urgent since I'm trying to report fraud from a website and need to show what date/time my activity was on there. Please help and thank you.
