Can I use Windows Backups to Recover Lost Bookmarks?,"<p>I went to save a bookmark in a folder and saw the folder was missing. Then I noticed some things didn't seem right so I tried putting folders in the right place. That is when I noticed that when I moved one folder, several others would just move somewhere else! I could move one folder down in a list, then some - but not all - would jump to a new place in the order. An important folder is missing. So, what causes this to start happening? Also, how can I recover my missing bookmarks from Windows Backup? And is there any way to know which bookmarks and folders were deleted? I have recently added some important ones, so I don't want to delete the existing ones and restore the old ones, nor do I want to simply restore the old ones in the existing hierarchy and then have gazillions of duplicates.

When logging in somewhere, if there are multiple choices for userid (say with different dates) none can be chosen.  You mouse down to the popup with the choices and there's a weird stroboscopic action where the popup disappears and is recreated as fast as it can, over and over, and nothing can actually be clicked on.  If you type in the userid then try to enter the password the same thing happens.  It's not possible to use the password manager anymore, both fields need to be typed in manually. </p><p>Another example is the search field.  If you type something and there are several options from previous searches, and you try to mouse down to pick one, the popup disappears.  If you click the search keyword again it highlights as for replacement, then you have to click it again (removing highlight) and only then can you mouse down and choose a search engine. </p><p>etc etc etc!
