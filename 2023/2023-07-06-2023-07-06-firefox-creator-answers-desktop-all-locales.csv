I can browse to mounted network drives and select files but when clicking open nothing is attached in any of my online email accounts. This also applies to the open dialog box. I have tried using the KDE File Picker as well as the GTK one but they both fail. This is not an issue for LibreOffice or other programs and greatly impacts the usefulness of Firefox. </p>,linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1150;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1588995;,superseth

This will allow users to keep their Colorways theme when they are later removed from Firefox installer files.</em> I guess it is relevant somehow, but i never installed Colorways and don't know what is it. </p><p>How to make FF 115 look like it was in 114? I can see changes in `browser/themes/` in sources between 114.02 and 115. Is it possible to ""extract"" default theme from 114 and install/apply it to 115? </p><p>I use Firefox under Fluxbox window manager in Arch Linux, if it matters. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1150;,firefox,other,en-US,"",dimich.dmb
