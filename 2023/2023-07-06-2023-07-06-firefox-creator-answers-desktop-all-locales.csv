All of a sudden it now displays event information for every click, every keypress (up and down events separately), every selection, everything. This now happens on (almost) any site I visit. This is so absurdly verbose anything I am hoping to debug is buried under mountains of extraneous information about my inputs.  </p><p>Is this is a setting that can be disabled somewhere, that I enabled without realising somehow?

When window of v115 becomes inactive, background color changes to lighter, but still no visible horizontal line between menu and tabs. I don't use any additional themes, ""System theme — auto"" is selected. </p><p>From release notes for FF 115: <em>For users with a Firefox Colorways built-in theme, the theme will be automatically migrated to the same theme hosted on <a href=""http://addons.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">addons.mozilla.org</a> for Firefox profiles that have disabled add-ons auto-updates. This will allow users to keep their Colorways theme when they are later removed from Firefox installer files.</em> I guess it is relevant somehow, but i never installed Colorways and don't know what is it. </p><p>How to make FF 115 look like it was in 114? I can see changes in `browser/themes/` in sources between 114.02 and 115. Is it possible to ""extract"" default theme from 114 and install/apply it to 115? </p><p>I use Firefox under Fluxbox window manager in Arch Linux, if it matters. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1150;,firefox,other,en-US,"",dimich.dmb
