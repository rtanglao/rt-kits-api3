Is it possible to have Firefox display the Menu Bar in fullscreen mode? </p><p>I have added </p><p><em>:root[inFullscreen] #PersonalToolbar { </em> </p><pre>visibility: visible&nbsp;!important; </pre> <p>}<em> </em> </p><p>to userChhrome.css which is great, it makes the bookmarks toolbar show when in fullscreen, but I don't know what to use for the Menu Bar. Perhaps something in <em>about:config</em>? When in fullscreen and I right click up the top near the Tab bar, Menu Bar is checked but doesn't show. There are things that don't appear in the 3 line menu on the top right that do appear in the Menu Bar's menus that I'd like access to in fullscreen mode. </p><p>Thanks </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-10212;firefox-102120;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",interfusion
