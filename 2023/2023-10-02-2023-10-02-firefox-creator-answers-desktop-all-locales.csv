The Bookmarks pulldown menu is VERY widely spaced vertically compared to Windows 7, and I have so many bookmarks, I have to scroll down below the level of the taskbar at the bottom of the screen to reach them all.  I was cleaning up my bookmarks, when I noticed that I moved just enough folders into a Miscellaneous folder at the bottom of the list, that it is just at the level of the taskbar and is hidden beneath it.  However, the Bookmarks pulldown thinks it's within the resolution of my screen, so no button for scrolling down appears.  Firefox needs to sense the size of the screen ABOVE the level of the taskbar, and place the scroll down button appropriately. </p><p>As I finished typing this, though, I went to put in a pic, and now the pulldown menu scroll buttons come up properly (albeit placing them over the level of the taskbar).  There's some bug hidden in there that prevented it from working properly for 15 minutes, probably carried over from the Manage Bookmarks menu, because after I was moving folders into the Miscellaneous folder in Manage Bookmarks, it wouldn't allow me to expand the Miscellaneous folder to see the folders I moved were actually moved in there, and F5 (refresh) didn't work.  That's probably why the scroll buttons didn't come up.  The Manage Bookmarks needs a Refresh button at the very least. </p><p>Also, if there's any way to make the spacing between bookmarks configurable (like with a single-spaced option instead of the 1.x spacing currently being used), that would be great, and I could put my old bookmarks back where they belong.  Always remember, instead of just changing things, keep the old setting and make a selectable option out of it.  If it's a Microsoft issue, you need to figure out a workaround.  When you're dealing with a 4K desktop, like I am, big changes are REALLY big.  Thanks in advance. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",Browzilla

I called the Geek squad who remoted in and made things worse. She somehow deleted my ONLY restore date there. So for a week I have been trying to find help. You are my last resort before I switch to another browser. I work from home so this is not convenient, as I print often. Switching browsers just to print is wasting time (I don't like the other browsers). HELP! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,other,en-US,1607701;1607721;1607730;1607744;,janpre2001
