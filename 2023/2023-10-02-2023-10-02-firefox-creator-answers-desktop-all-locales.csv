Curiously, it seems like the first time each day that I go onto any given website, the dropdown does populate properly, but just that once.  I checked Edge and Chrome, and the dropdowns work fine there, so it's definitely a Firefox problem.  Any ideas about what is going on and how I can fix it?

Everything was fine until last week with the update. It's not my printer as I am able to print from other browsers.  I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Trying to clear saved printer setting per Troubleshooting advice. I even deleted it from my computer to try and get an earlier version but it keeps bringing me back to the latest version that does not work.  The worst part was I was trying to back up my computer (restore point) to an earlier date my Webroot was not allowing me to do that I I could not get that turned off. I called the Geek squad who remoted in and made things worse. She somehow deleted my ONLY restore date there. So for a week I have been trying to find help. You are my last resort before I switch to another browser. I work from home so this is not convenient, as I print often. Switching browsers just to print is wasting time (I don't like the other browsers).
