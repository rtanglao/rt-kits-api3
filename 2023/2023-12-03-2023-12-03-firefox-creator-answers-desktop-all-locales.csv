I also run Vivaldi and test with Chrome.  I installed Google Analytics Opt-Out add-ons on FF, Vivaldi, and Chrome.  When I go to any site with links to X (Twitter), and click on the link, instead of that link appearing the last X link I went to appears.  If I click again I get to the correct link. </p><p>When I disable the Google Analytics Opt-Out add-on all works fine.  This doesn't happen with either of the Chromium browsers, so I'm thinking there's something happening in Firefox by avoiding Google analytics that isn't in the Chromium browsers.  In addition, this behavior began within the past couple of weeks of recent FF updates. </p><p>I installed several different Google Analytics add-ons and the same thing happened in FF, but not in the Chromium browsers. </p><p>Any ideas?
