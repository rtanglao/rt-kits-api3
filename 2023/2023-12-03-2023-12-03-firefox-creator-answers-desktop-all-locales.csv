When I go into Preferences &gt; Security, the box to ""remember logins and passwords for websites"" is checked.  When I click on saved passwords they all are there.

The problem seems to happen every time I install the latest Firefox update, or Windows 10 Pro updates. Some of my apps want to know if I am using a new device. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",shel3
