My internet is fine and I have restarted my computer a few time since the problem started. I have added some sites to the Exceptions list but even then they don't work properly. I have tried refreshing Firefox and changed the profile and they both didn't fix the problem. I am sadly not knowledgeable enough to make sense of the Web Developer Tools. The attached image is what my YouTube page looks like after add the site to the Exceptions list. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",reven2574

We need to be able to turn this off.,"<p>I've just now noticed the Threading automatic default grouping/marking of messages, and it is appalling. Thunderbird/Mozilla either needs to eliminate this (with appropriate warning notices, perhaps) or at least give us the ability to NOT link various messages. It's not only vastly annoying, it can cause severe real-world problems if anyone not in the CC or BCC fields is receiving these messages that were not intended for them. </p><p>I suppose for now, the only way to NOT link things that were never meant to be would be to change the Subject when discussing important topics. </p><p>Either that, or get a whole new mail service, which I'd prefer not to have to do. </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-11550;firefox-1155;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",Squirebran
