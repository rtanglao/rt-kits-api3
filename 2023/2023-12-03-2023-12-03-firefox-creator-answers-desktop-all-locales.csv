Using this version of Firefox, as well as previous versions for the last few months, I am having a persistent error when using Google Advanced Search.  I enter search criteria into the field “Find pages with … all these words” and successfully progress through a chain of web pages.  Previously I was able to backtrack to the previously mentioned field and find my search criteria, then edit the text, and carry out a modified search.  For many months this field has been blank when returning to it.  So it is now necessary to re-enter all text for a new search.  This is very frustrating.  I have experienced this problem on the three computers that I regularly use. </p><p>I have found that when I use the Google Chrome browser the problem goes away and searches progress normally.  I would much prefer to use Firefox as my browser as I find its bookmark system superior.  The truth is that if this problem with Firefox can’t be fixed soon I will be forced to migrate to Chrome.  Can you please help me resolve this Firefox problem? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1621753;,timbergetter
