I've never had this happen before, except for the past two weeks where it's just non-stop. </p><p>I'll put it out there, before I start, that I've tried refreshing, as well as reinstalling and clearing my data. </p><p><br> So, it keeps acting like I just installed Firefox: it asks me to log in, it asks me to import passwords and everything from other browsers, it deletes every add-on I have, turns off sync, resets my settings, and then won't connect to any websites. </p><p><br> Right, yeah, it won't connect to any websites, so I need to refresh it to get it to function, which makes me go through the same steps again, so I turn on my sync and can keep going. If I close it and reopen it, it acts like it just wants me to go through import process again.  </p><p><br> So, I turn off my computer, reboot it, run Firefox, and it's fine. However, after a few days, the same thing happens. I go through the same process of refreshing it to have it function for another few days, or a day, and then repeat this for two weeks and now I'm here. </p><p>Any useful ideas? I'd appreciate it. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,other,en-US,"",johnlewiswinter

To begin with the obvious: Firefox, by default, does not require you to set up a primary password. Without one, anyone who can get past the lock screen of your desktop can see your saved logins. Furthermore, Firefox mobile does not include the primary password feature. If a user has not set up a lock screen on their mobile device, anyone can see the saved logins. This caught me by surprise as I recently bought a tablet for home use on which I installed (and synced) Firefox. For convenience, I did not set up a lock screen (I won't keep sensitive data or email accounts on the tablet). Being used to my desktop (which asks for the primary password) and my phone (on which Firefox automatically asks for the fingerprint/pattern already set up on the phone), I didn't stop to think that my saved logins on the tablet did not have equivalent protection. I realise this was naive, but the reason I think it could catch more people out is that almost everyone has a lock screen on their phone, but they don't think about setting up protection of saved logins because Firefox automatically adopts the phone's existing fingerprint/pattern for this function. I can imagine a similar scenario where a user installs Firefox on a second desktop device and syncs saved logins. Primary passwords are set locally and are not synced between profiles or devices. However, having already set up a primary password on their original desktop computer, the user might not realise that they do not automatically have the same standard of protection on the second desktop. This can all be deduced from the information already on the help pages, however perhaps the following could be considered: A message explicitly informing the user when syncing (a) what protection will be used by default (eg, the system fingerprint/pattern on a mobile device), or (b) that there is currently no system fingerprint/pattern/etc or primary password set up and that consequently the saved logins have zero protection. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1170;firefox-11701;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",tb2944

When I browse I get asked for every new page in which language I want to translate and I don't want to.  The translations are mostly bad and I know in which languages I browse and research.  I haven't been able to find how to turn it completely off in the settings.  Can anyone help? It'd be great, thanks. </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,customize,en-US,1608482;,aline.bo

When I scroll on Maps to zoom out or in, it zooms all the way out or in, even when I just do one ""scroll click"". Scrolling up and down works fine on other websites. Using the scroll wheel for zoom in Google Maps in other browsers (latest versions of Google Chrome, MS Edge, Brave) works as expected/fine, there it only zooms out/in one level.  </p><p>It's not a new issue, it's been here for a long time, I just haven't bothered doing anything about it.  </p><p>I have found another old thread about the same issue and the suggestion was to disable hardware accelleration. I tried that and it made the scrolling worse, but same thing happens, just slower and with choppiness. I have tried running troubleshooting mode. Still the same thing. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1608483;1608497;1608499;1608503;,jorkedbs
