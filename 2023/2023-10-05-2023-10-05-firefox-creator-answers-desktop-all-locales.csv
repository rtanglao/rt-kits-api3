When I browse I get asked for every new page in which language I want to translate and I don't want to.  The translations are mostly bad and I know in which languages I browse and research.  I haven't been able to find how to turn it completely off in the settings.  Can anyone help? It'd be great, thanks. </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,customize,en-US,1608482;,aline.bo

When I scroll on Maps to zoom out or in, it zooms all the way out or in, even when I just do one ""scroll click"". Scrolling up and down works fine on other websites. Using the scroll wheel for zoom in Google Maps in other browsers (latest versions of Google Chrome, MS Edge, Brave) works as expected/fine, there it only zooms out/in one level.  </p><p>It's not a new issue, it's been here for a long time, I just haven't bothered doing anything about it.  </p><p>I have found another old thread about the same issue and the suggestion was to disable hardware accelleration. I tried that and it made the scrolling worse, but same thing happens, just slower and with choppiness. I have tried running troubleshooting mode. Still the same thing. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1608483;,jorkedbs
