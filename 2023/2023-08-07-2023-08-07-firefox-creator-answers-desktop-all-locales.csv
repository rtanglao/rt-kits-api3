The reply was   ""That isn't a Firefox issue but McAfee support to resolve for you. Also check with McAfee site and support about their software issue. Also Firefox Browser doesn't do popups to buy a product or software. ""  However the title of the popup IS Firefox.  Would you suggest that McAfee is the originator of the malware? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1160;,firefox,other,en-US,1595841;1595853;,billyork88
