Many many tabs open, across multiple devices. I decided to try and consolidate some of them and go through them, try to reduce the ridiculous number I have open. I sent 500+ tabs from one device to another in one go, the first device had the little blue 'Sent!' popup, but the tabs never arrived. Now the second device never finishes Syncing, just spins forever, and no tabs sent to it since then have arrived. Is there any way I can flush the Sent Tabs buffer or something? Sending tabs is kinda important for how my productivity (sort of) functions, so that I can find stuff on my phone while travelling and send it to a pc for proper investigation with a bigger screen. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",foofmoonshot

Allow me to share --  </p><p>Let me preface this question with a quick note:  I use my Firefox Browser (V. 109.0.1) quite adequately and comfortably with the HTTPS Only mode set to ""ON"" all the time. (..thank you, btw..)   To continue: I was recently sent a link from my antivirus company (Avast) for a discounted renewal for my account with them.  This link was to a website called "" <a href=""http://digitalriver.com"" rel=""nofollow"">digitalriver.com</a> "".   I was instructed by the sender that when using this link to access my 'discount', I would only have 1-Hour within which to complete my transaction or else the link would 'expire' and I would subsequently need to contact them once again for a 'new' link.  ""Not a problem!"" I said to myself, as I confidently clicked the link and..   ..lo and behold, to my great surprise, when I clicked it, the site immediately threw up a 'security-window' (a 'frame' within the page) indicating that I could not access this site (the link) with my browser set to ""HTTPS Only"" mode.   Somewhat miffed (and puzzled) I followed the included instructions on how to 'turn-off' this particular setting and yet once I did - Firefox immediately required me to ""restart"" the browser for this to take effect. Ultimately - this caused two issues... First, ..when i 'restarted' my Firefox browser, I lost my place in the page on ""<a href=""http://digitalriver.com"" rel=""nofollow"">digitalriver.com</a>"", and was unable to 're-access' the link that I was sent..   ..and- Second, ..even though I have indeed changed my setting on the browser - all my pages still show up in the address-bar as ""https://"" rather than ""http://"" ...!? </p><p>Although I have sent an email to Avast regarding this issue, and hope for them to send me a New Link for the discount that was offered to me, I am troubled about how my browser has behaved since this time. I am also quite hesitant to do as suggested on Mozilla's help pages and - set my browser to ""HTTPS Only"" mode -but- adding an exception for this particular website, due to the instructions I received once I clicked on the link to '<a href=""http://digitalriver.com"" rel=""nofollow"">digitalriver.com</a>' which -again- stated explicitly to ""turn-off"" the HTTPS Only mode. </p><p>Please guys, what do you have to say about this particular dilemma I'm experiencing..? </p><p>Thank you in advance for your help,  </p><p>Sincerely,  </p><p>-Steven ""Art"" Slater </p><pre>                 .                             . </pre>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1090;firefox-10901;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",ArtStud
