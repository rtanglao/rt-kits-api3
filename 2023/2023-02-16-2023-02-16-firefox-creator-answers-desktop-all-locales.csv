Allow me to share --  </p><p>Let me preface this question with a quick note:  I use my Firefox Browser (V. 109.0.1) quite adequately and comfortably with the HTTPS Only mode set to ""ON"" all the time. (..thank you, btw..)   To continue: I was recently sent a link from my antivirus company (Avast) for a discounted renewal for my account with them.  This link was to a website called "" <a href=""http://digitalriver.com"" rel=""nofollow"">digitalriver.com</a> "".   I was instructed by the sender that when using this link to access my 'discount', I would only have 1-Hour within which to complete my transaction or else the link would 'expire' and I would subsequently need to contact them once again for a 'new' link.  ""Not a problem!"" I said to myself, as I confidently clicked the link and..   ..lo and behold, to my great surprise, when I clicked it, the site immediately threw up a 'security-window' (a 'frame' within the page) indicating that I could not access this site (the link) with my browser set to ""HTTPS Only"" mode.   Somewhat miffed (and puzzled) I followed the included instructions on how to 'turn-off' this particular setting and yet once I did - Firefox immediately required me to ""restart"" the browser for this to take effect. Ultimately - this caused two issues... First, ..when i 'restarted' my Firefox browser, I lost my place in the page on ""<a href=""http://digitalriver.com"" rel=""nofollow"">digitalriver.com</a>"", and was unable to 're-access' the link that I was sent..   ..and- Second, ..even though I have indeed changed my setting on the browser - all my pages still show up in the address-bar as ""https://"" rather than ""http://"" ...!? </p><p>Although I have sent an email to Avast regarding this issue, and hope for them to send me a New Link for the discount that was offered to me, I am troubled about how my browser has behaved since this time. I am also quite hesitant to do as suggested on Mozilla's help pages and - set my browser to ""HTTPS Only"" mode -but- adding an exception for this particular website, due to the instructions I received once I clicked on the link to '<a href=""http://digitalriver.com"" rel=""nofollow"">digitalriver.com</a>' which -again- stated explicitly to ""turn-off"" the HTTPS Only mode. </p><p>Please guys, what do you have to say about this particular dilemma I'm experiencing..? </p><p>Thank you in advance for your help,  </p><p>Sincerely,  </p><p>-Steven ""Art"" Slater </p><pre>                 .                             . </pre>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1090;firefox-10901;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",ArtStud
