A change has taken the ability to click the down menu in the Get Messages icon to show all the accounts for a individual account check.  With this change , if its intentional, it allows no obvious method to check these seldom used accounts.  Checked the customization for the old ""Get Message"" with the down menu so I can return this feature and its not shown as a choice.  If this is the intent then the ""Account Settings"" ""Server Settings"" to ""Check for new messages at start up"" which can be either checked or unchecked needs some attention. The missing down menu allowed these unchecked accounts to be checked only by selecting this down menu allowed clicking any of my 5 accounts account, and if memory is correct a choice to check all accounts. </p><p>If this is intentional change, how do I check individual accounts that are unchecked as still allowed in the settings. </p><p>Should this ""Get Messages"" with the down menu feature be returned or the ""Account Setting / Server Settings"" be changed to not allow a choice but require all accounts to be checked at start up, after a period of time, or by clicking ""Get Messages"" again to get newer messages all the time rather then by choice. </p><p>I'm requesting it be returned as a choice in the Customization items as I see no way to now check them with my current Account / Server settings. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1190;,firefox,other,en-US,"",patcoghm
