Cannot start Firefox or profile manager, have followed other articles","<p>After a long time, I've decided to reinstall Firefox on my PC.  Upon installing it, I got the error ""Your firefox profile cannot be loaded.  it may be missing or inaccessible.""  I cannot start Firefox. </p><p>After looking online, I found this article on the support page: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-run-firefox-when-profile-missing-inaccessible"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-run-firefox-when-profile-missing-inaccessible</a> </p><p>I tried opening the profile manager, but can't get to it since Firefox won't start.  It also is not accessible through using ""firefox.exe -P"" in the run dialog box. </p><p>So then I followed the directions and found my existing profiles.ini which pointed to my profile file.  Wondering if it got corrupted, I changed the file extension to profiles.iniold and moved the whole mozilla folder to my desktop.  Firefox continued to give me the same error message. </p><p>Finally I uninstalled firefox, deleted the mozilla folder under %appdata%, deleted the Mozilla folder under %programdata%, and deleted any mention of Mozilla in regedit.  I finally reinstalled a fresh copy of firefox... and I got the same profile cannot be loaded error. </p><p>Is there somewhere that I'm not seeing that needs to be deleted to finally get a fresh install?  I don't care about the original profile and am happy to start from scratch, but have no idea what I can still do in order to get to that point.  Any suggestions on what I can do to completely remove any remnants of the original install from years ago? </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",robert.whitneyiii

However, I have a bookmarks setting with Firefox that has not been imported. I did not have an account (or at least that I can remember) with Firefox. I just set up one today. I had written that I had an account under the username jackhsiao, but I was not able to log in.  </p><p>I would like to know if I can import my bookmarks that were on the browser of my computer that I can no longer access.  </p><p>Thank you, </p><p>Jack Hsiao </p>",desktop;bookmarks;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1090;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1562282;1562284;,jvkhsiao
