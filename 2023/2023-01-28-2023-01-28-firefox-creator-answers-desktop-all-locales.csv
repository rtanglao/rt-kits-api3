However, I have a bookmarks setting with Firefox that has not been imported. I did not have an account (or at least that I can remember) with Firefox. I just set up one today. I had written that I had an account under the username jackhsiao, but I was not able to log in.  </p><p>I would like to know if I can import my bookmarks that were on the browser of my computer that I can no longer access.  </p><p>Thank you, </p><p>Jack Hsiao </p>",desktop;bookmarks;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1090;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",jvkhsiao
