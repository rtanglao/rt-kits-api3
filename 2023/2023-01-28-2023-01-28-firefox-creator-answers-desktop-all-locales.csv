When I first started using it and sent my 1st email, it did copy my email into sent folder TWICE. It was frustrating. I played with the settings as suggested checked ""place copy"", unchecked ""place copy"" checked ""other"", unchecked ""other""; NOTHING HELPED. I do NOT have the copies of my sent emails. I spent sooo much time playing with it and to no avail. Very FRUSTRATING. I donated some money to the developers of TB and deserve better functionality of the email program. Please HELP! Thank you in advance. Paul. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1562298;,paulkay17

Cannot start Firefox or profile manager, have followed other articles","<p>After a long time, I've decided to reinstall Firefox on my PC.  Upon installing it, I got the error ""Your firefox profile cannot be loaded.  it may be missing or inaccessible.""  I cannot start Firefox. </p><p>After looking online, I found this article on the support page: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-run-firefox-when-profile-missing-inaccessible"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-run-firefox-when-profile-missing-inaccessible</a> </p><p>I tried opening the profile manager, but can't get to it since Firefox won't start.  It also is not accessible through using ""firefox.exe -P"" in the run dialog box. </p><p>So then I followed the directions and found my existing profiles.ini which pointed to my profile file.  Wondering if it got corrupted, I changed the file extension to profiles.iniold and moved the whole mozilla folder to my desktop.  Firefox continued to give me the same error message. </p><p>Finally I uninstalled firefox, deleted the mozilla folder under %appdata%, deleted the Mozilla folder under %programdata%, and deleted any mention of Mozilla in regedit.  I finally reinstalled a fresh copy of firefox... and I got the same profile cannot be loaded error. </p><p>Is there somewhere that I'm not seeing that needs to be deleted to finally get a fresh install?  I don't care about the original profile and am happy to start from scratch, but have no idea what I can still do in order to get to that point.  Any suggestions on what I can do to completely remove any remnants of the original install from years ago? </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1562294;,robert.whitneyiii
