Firefox continued to give me the same error message. </p><p>Finally I uninstalled firefox, deleted the mozilla folder under %appdata%, deleted the Mozilla folder under %programdata%, and deleted any mention of Mozilla in regedit.  I finally reinstalled a fresh copy of firefox... and I got the same profile cannot be loaded error. </p><p>Is there somewhere that I'm not seeing that needs to be deleted to finally get a fresh install?  I don't care about the original profile and am happy to start from scratch, but have no idea what I can still do in order to get to that point.
