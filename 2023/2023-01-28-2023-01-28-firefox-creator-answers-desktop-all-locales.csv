I used to do bimonthly backups (to any of three external hard drives) until my wife died four years ago. Never thought about it again until very late December. Decided I'd do it on January 1. Hard drive crashed on December 29, on an older laptop running Windows 10. Paid an obscene amount of money for the (successful) data recovery effort, and have it all on an external hard drive. That older laptop had other (physical) problems as well, so I bought a new one running Windows 11 while the data recovery effort was going on. I've been using Firefox exclusively for 20 years, I imagine, and I've got hundreds of bookmarks. (I tend to do a lot of research.) </p><p>Current issue: When I installed Firefox on the new laptop, it wanted to import bookmarks, but of course, they weren't available. Got the recovery drive back.  Researched... located the folders that Mozilla says contains the bookmarks. Stopped Firefox. ...AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles Renamed the folders therein. Copied the similarly named folders from the recovery drive to this location. (Names and/or extensions were similar, but not exact.) Fired up Firefox. Deep sigh. It didn't work. Stopped Firefox again. Renamed the file extensions. Fired up Firefox again. Back up and running again, your witness, I'm writing this. </p><p>So, it's not a matter of simple file substitution. Is there another way to recover bookmarks from a file? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1090;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",MtSB

If the browser is actually treating the GPU as having zero RAM it might be a starting point to investigate why the browser is unresponsive for sometimes up to 30 second when 42 tabs are open and I'm opening a new tab and trying to interact with an existing tab after switching between tabs or windows. Often these are divided between two or three windows grouping tabs as part of a multi monitor workflow while editing Wiki content. The system responsiveness is unaffected and other program do not change in their responsiveness. This occurs while CPU is under load and not under load, but occurs more frequently when under cpu load (low priority compute applications via BOINC for distributed computing). No GPU compute is being used. </p><p>Firefox was installed via the Pop!_OS Pop!_Shop. Confusingly the Pop!_Shop lists two Firefox Browsers (one by Mozilla, and one by the Mozilla Corporation) I'm told that these are separate due to their app IDs not matching which prevents the listings from being merged, but it is unclear which is sourced from what repository and how they differ for install as flatpak, deb, etc are not specified in the UI of the Pop!_Shop. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",wolfgang8741
