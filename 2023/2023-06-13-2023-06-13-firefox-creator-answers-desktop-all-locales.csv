I’m suddenly getting told since installing 11.4.0.1 when I download files “This file contains a virus or malware”.  Yes there is a workaround by saying Allow Download but that shouldn’t have to be the case.  By the way my Internet Security confirms all these files are perfectly fine.

So slow that it can't even watch normal HD content. But not always, sometimes it does work at normal internet speeds which is so weird. I have around 500 Mbps download speed internet so I know it's not the issue. The picture with the slow download speed is on Firefox and the fast/normal download speed is on Chrome. Sometimes in a private window Firefox runs at normal speed but not always, I don't think it's an extension issue. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1585257;1585261;1585262;,Firefox696969

I haven't made any changes, I haven't downloaded anything or installed anything new. The last firefox update for both machines happened yesterday between 1 and 2 in the afternoon. 18 hours after an update, I just lose a basic feature? I'm able to right-click and open youtube vids in edge. So it has to be a firefox thing... Any ideas or suggestions? </p><p>I've attached a pic to show you my right-click menu.
