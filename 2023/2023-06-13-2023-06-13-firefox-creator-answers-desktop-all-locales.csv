I haven't made any changes, I haven't downloaded anything or installed anything new. The last firefox update for both machines happened yesterday between 1 and 2 in the afternoon. 18 hours after an update, I just lose a basic feature? I'm able to right-click and open youtube vids in edge. So it has to be a firefox thing... Any ideas or suggestions? </p><p>I've attached a pic to show you my right-click menu. I've never seen this menu before. </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1585237;,darthno2
