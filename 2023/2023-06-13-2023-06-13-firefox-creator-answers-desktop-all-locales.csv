Therefore <em>most of the time</em> when I Cmd+click on a link, it opens on a new tab that loads in the background. This is what I want. </p><p>However, some websites break that behavior. 2 high-profile examples: </p> <ul><li> In <strong>Google Docs</strong>, if a piece of text links to an URL, clicking on the text shows a small window with the URL. Cmd+click on that URL opens it in a new tab, <strong>and takes me to that tab</strong>. </li><li> In <strong>Facebook Messenger</strong>, if I Cmd+click on a chat, again the chat opens in a new tab and <strong>I'm taken there</strong>. <strong>Additionally</strong>, the original tab activates that chat. </li></ul> <p>Interestingly, in both these cases, I get the right behavior if I right-click on the URL or in the chat and in the contextual menu choose ""Open link in new window/tab/container tab"": the new tab stays in the background. </p><p>So my question is: does anyone know of a way to always make cmd+click behave just like ""Open link in new tab"", no matter the website? </p><p>I'm on Firefox 115b4 on macOS, but this has been like this for years at least. </p>",desktop;beta;customize;firefox-1150;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",hmijail

I wanted anyway to reinstall my (few) extensions, all of which are safe and well known. When I do that, though, their icons don't show up in the toolbar. When I open the ""customize toolbar"" setting, extension icons aren't there. So there's no way to add them to toolbar. </p><p>I tried all possible methods: - ""Restore Firefox"" and resync my account (extensions are reinstalled but icons not shown in toolbar / customize toolbar) - ""Restore Firefox"", not syncing, and manually installing extensions (icons still not shown in toolbar / customize toolbar) - Uninstall Firefox, delete everything in Profiles folder, reinstall Firefox. Same behavior. </p><p>So, it seems it's something not related to a broken profile, since a fresh profile, with no syncing, does not fix the issue. </p><p>Any clue of what I could try?
