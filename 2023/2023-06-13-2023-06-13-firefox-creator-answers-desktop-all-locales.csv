I wanted anyway to reinstall my (few) extensions, all of which are safe and well known. When I do that, though, their icons don't show up in the toolbar. When I open the ""customize toolbar"" setting, extension icons aren't there. So there's no way to add them to toolbar. </p><p>I tried all possible methods: - ""Restore Firefox"" and resync my account (extensions are reinstalled but icons not shown in toolbar / customize toolbar) - ""Restore Firefox"", not syncing, and manually installing extensions (icons still not shown in toolbar / customize toolbar) - Uninstall Firefox, delete everything in Profiles folder, reinstall Firefox. Same behavior. </p><p>So, it seems it's something not related to a broken profile, since a fresh profile, with no syncing, does not fix the issue. </p><p>Any clue of what I could try?
