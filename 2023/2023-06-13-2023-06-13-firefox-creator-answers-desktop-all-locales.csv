I was startled to see the machine overnight using 100% cpu with the fans on high. Firefox, and Isolate+ were the culprits. </p><p>I could understand how a machine that I left with lots of tabs could do this, though with the display sleeping, you would think firefox would go to sleep. But after killing the task, restarting firefox with no tabs open, it still uses 5% of cpu, and isolate+ 2.3%.  </p><p>There is no excuse for that. If you're not called upon to display, you should go to sleep. Why on earth would you be updating. And we are talking with one (empty) tab. What is firefox doing when literally nothing is happening? </p><p>So firefox CPU utilization seems to be irretrievably broken at the moment. </p><p>With just this one page open, writing this complaint, firefox is showing 4% cpu, and isolate+ 2% of cpu, and that's not with me typing, that's with me looking at top to see where the CPU is going. </p><p>When I iconify, it goes to 12.9% momentarily, then 0.7% Which is a lot better, but why not zero? What on earth are you doing in the background when the window is iconified with only a single tab? </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1140;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",dov.kruger

Therefore <em>most of the time</em> when I Cmd+click on a link, it opens on a new tab that loads in the background. This is what I want. </p><p>However, some websites break that behavior. 2 high-profile examples: </p> <ul><li> In <strong>Google Docs</strong>, if a piece of text links to an URL, clicking on the text shows a small window with the URL. Cmd+click on that URL opens it in a new tab, <strong>and takes me to that tab</strong>. </li><li> In <strong>Facebook Messenger</strong>, if I Cmd+click on a chat, again the chat opens in a new tab and <strong>I'm taken there</strong>. <strong>Additionally</strong>, the original tab activates that chat. </li></ul> <p>Interestingly, in both these cases, I get the right behavior if I right-click on the URL or in the chat and in the contextual menu choose ""Open link in new window/tab/container tab"": the new tab stays in the background. </p><p>So my question is: does anyone know of a way to always make cmd+click behave just like ""Open link in new tab"", no matter the website? </p><p>I'm on Firefox 115b4 on macOS, but this has been like this for years at least. </p>",desktop;beta;customize;firefox-1150;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",hmijail

Same behavior. </p><p>So, it seems it's something not related to a broken profile, since a fresh profile, with no syncing, does not fix the issue. </p><p>Any clue of what I could try?
