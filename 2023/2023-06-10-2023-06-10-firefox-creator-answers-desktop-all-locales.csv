On occasion when I walk away from my computer with Firefox running (usually 20-30 minutes) I come back to find the browser itself has closed, including Private/Incognito tabs. Everything else on my computer has continued to function as per normal, nor has the computer itself seem to have restarted itself. It is only Firefox that this is happening with. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1140;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",terriermon50

I would like the majority of settings/etc to be synced with my account but I would also like to be able to have some add-ons excluded.
