It is prompting me to shut down Firefox in order to open the next window. It is also flickering on the refresh icon. It is also blocking adult content. I have refreshed the Firefox browser but that changed nothing. I am not sure how to troubleshoot to look specifically at these problems. I am fearful of trying to delete and reinstall this program as I do not use any other online browsers and do not want to install them. Can this be troubleshooted remotely without risking malware? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mstrue1
