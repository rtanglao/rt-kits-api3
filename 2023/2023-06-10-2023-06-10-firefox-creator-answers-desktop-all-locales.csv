Cannot load Hulu, MSN News, <a href=""http://Booking.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Booking.com</a>, but they work fine on Chrome. I've used Firefox since its inception and I hate using Chrome, but it looks like I am going to have to, as I cannot get any response or support from Firefox. Is there any hope at all or should I just get used to Chrome? This is my second post--I attached screen shots to the first one, but no response, so I'm thinking they have no fix. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;website-breakages;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",suzanne77
