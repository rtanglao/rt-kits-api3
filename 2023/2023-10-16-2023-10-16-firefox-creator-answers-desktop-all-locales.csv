I've updated the browser and disabled some extensions like the downloaders and calculators, but the issues persist. Has anyone else encountered similar problems with Firefox, and what steps or troubleshooting techniques did you use to address these crashes and speed issues? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",afrasiabsajid9

Looking at the about:processes, I saw that the GPU usage was high. Disabling hardware acceleration solved this problem. </p><p>This occurred on a Dell XPS-15-9520, Win11, i5-12500H, 64GB RAM, Iris Xe. I don't have this problem on Linux machines. </p><p>May I suggest to benchmark and monitor hardware acceleration so that both CPU and GPU are used in case of heavy workload? </p><p>Many thanks, </p><p>Olivier. (very long time, happy, FF user ... ) </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",romarin12

However if I do the same and scroll upwards by moving my mouse cursor to the top edge to scroll, it scrolls at a reasonable fast rate. The issue does not fix when I start in safe mode, or in private windows. The issue is exclusive to highlighting text and holding down to scroll. My scroll speed by clicking the scroll bar is normal, and so is using two fingers on my laptop (Asus Zenbook 14) to scroll down.  </p><p>I don't encounter slow click and drag scrolling on google chrome. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1611305;,reyhan.quayum
