Evey time I boot up, open Firefox, and start Disney+ site, my monitor would shutdown after showing white noise screen for like quarter of a second.  </p><p>Then after reading an article (link attached) with the same problem that I have, I tried to replicate the problem using Brave Browser, and there was no issue there. Then I uninstalled Firefox using an advanced uninstaller to remove all traces of files, keys, and others, then reinstalled a clean new Firefox, opened up Disney+ site and the same problem happened. The only solution that I don't know how to apply is how to reset Firefox completely, but I doubt it would solve it since I completely uninstalled &amp; reinstalled it without leaving any traces back.  </p><p>The following can be removed from being the cause of the problem, since I've double checked them and confirmed them in all ways possible: Monitor's Settings, 270hz overclock, DisplayPort, Windows 10 Pro settings, gaming related settings, power settings &amp; updates , Graphics Card.   </p><p>I've attached a link for a post that's describing the same issue that I'm having, just to save some time and maybe provide more description to my issue. I would highly recommend viewing it since it contains an answer to my issue which could be the right solution.  </p><p>Thanks a lot in advance, I would highly appreciate any help. Have a great one. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1090;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",Eng.Adnan.Adel
