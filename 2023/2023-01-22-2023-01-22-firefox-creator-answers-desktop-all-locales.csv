To be more specific, out of the blue every-time I try to connect to a website it will say ""Unable to connect, An error occurred during a connection"" and such. But you see this problem ONLY occurs on Firefox and not Microsoft Edge. I have looked EVERYWHERE and everyone else that has met the same problem never found a solution and just gave up it seems. I tried all of the solutions listed on the Mozilla support page <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-cant-load-websites-other-browsers-can"" rel=""nofollow"">Here</a> and NONE of them worked. It seemed my Firefox was dead. Other than the officially listed solutions I feel like I tried everything one could possibly do. Re-installing, Restarting, uninstalling all add-ons, deleting my previous profile, changing the proxy settings and many more. So all hope seemed lost and I was sure that I would have to abandon ship and just migrate to Chrome or Opera GX, neither of which sounded appealing at all. But then I came up with an Idea, my thought was since it was a connection issue maybe changing my connection would do SOMETHING, hell ANYTHING. And to my surprise using a VPN and trying again works. I am able to do all that I previously could its just going through a VPN. The thing is that it still doesn't work when it isn't connected to a VPN so what is the problem here, I don't really want to HAVE to use a VPN to use my browser so if anyone has ANY idea at all anything would be appreciated, thank you for your time reading this. </p><p>TLDR: Out of nowhere only Firefox couldn't connect to sites on windows 10 but everything else could, using VPN allowed me to connect to stuff but I don't really wanna have to be forced into using a VPN so any help appreciated, thanks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1090;,firefox,other,en-US,"",lukegroves2012
