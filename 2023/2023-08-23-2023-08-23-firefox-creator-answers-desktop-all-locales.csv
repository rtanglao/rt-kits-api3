After i logged in again i saw the all my saved Passwords, that should have been saved in Firefox, disappeared. </p><p>Now my question, how can i restore them? I saved many important Passwords, so its quite significant that i get them back... </p><p>Are you mad because I switched to Opera GX? if you can help me restore them I come back to team Firefox, i swear. </p><p>Thanks in advance </p><p>chrismoeslang </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;,firefox,sync,en-US,1599518;,chrismoeslang

Their speedtest has 3 tests it runs. 1. Up/download speeds, 2. My device to FIOS and 3. a Wifi Analysis. When running this test using Firefox v102.14 on a brand new, fresh Win11 pc, the test gets through the up/download test then hangs at the 2nd test. I have tried this same test using 2 cell phones, a tablet and a laptop. They all proceeded through all tests with no issues (Using Firefox). I connected my pc direct to the router and the test did not run to completion. It hang on test 2 (again, using Firefox). I then started MS Edge and ran the same test from this PC and it worked fine. So from my tests, it appears as if there is an issue with Firefox. My old pc using windows 10 had the same issue. When the same issue happens on a brand new pc with Windows 11 preinstalled, it seems like a FF problem. </p><p>Old PC AMD FX8320, 16gb DDR3 memory and 1TB SSD HD </p><p>New PC AMD Ryzen 7 4700G with 32gb DDR4 memory and a 512GB NVME drive.
