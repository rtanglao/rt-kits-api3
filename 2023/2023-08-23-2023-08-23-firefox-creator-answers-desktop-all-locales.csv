However, when not in troubleshoot mode, even with all Add-On's and Themes disabled, the issue occurs. </p><p>I have tried changing Add-Ons to ones with rated performance, restarting my Laptop, ensuring all Drivers, Applications are updated, Refreshing Firefox, uninstalling &amp; reinstalling firefox, reducing the number of open tabs and windows. I also ran sfc /scannow and DISM in case the issue was with the taskbar, with nothing being reported. Nothing appears to have worked. </p><p>Any assistance would be appreciated, as I love using Firefox and have not had any issues with it up until now. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1599392;,aidanshort
