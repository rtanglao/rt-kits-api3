I found out this goes back to 2022!  My downloads folder is cluttered with files I only wanted to view and not save.  All the previous forum questions which I've viewed have now been archived, so I'm opening a new one.  On one of the previous threads, I found that a new hidden setting was added so we could change this back to the old behavior of the automatically-downloaded files going to a temporary folder instead of being saved in our downloads folder.  We can use about:config to find <strong>browser.download.start_downloads_in_tmp_dir</strong> and toggle it to ""true.""    </p><p>Instead of our having to dig around on the forum to find how to change this, the setting needs to be added to the Main settings page under ""Downloads.""  Then those of us who wish to ""always"" be asked where to save files will be able to find this setting and change it to our preference.  If I want to download something to keep, I will intentionally save it.  If not, I expect anything I read online to remain in a temporary cache folder and be deleted when I clear history (which is when I close Firefox, because that is what is selected in my settings). </p><p>Please unhide <strong>browser.download.start_downloads_in_tmp_dir</strong> and add it to our main Settings page.
