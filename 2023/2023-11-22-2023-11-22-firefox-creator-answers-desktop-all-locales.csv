Using File Explorer found Profile Folder &amp; renamed it 'old'.  Copied and pasted 'Old Firefox Data' as new profile. Firefox would not open. Had to remove etc and Firefox worked again. Thought this maybe the easiest way to get my Bookmarks back. </p><p>PS  Presume Profile Folder does not contain Thunderbird Addresses? </p>,desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-11;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1619338;,Eanie

What do I do? I tried to go to manage bookmarks first, and under the import option, it says how many tabs were bookmarked or saves, or something, but when I go to click to restore it, it says it cannot be restored. I feel like its somewhere still there, and I really need some of that information. Any help is appreciated, thank you </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",7treesinthewoods

I can only see the tops of the buttons. I tried disabling my plugins but that didn't help. I launched FF in troubleshooting mode and that still did not resolve it. So far, I've only found two ways to fix it. I can either view it in a private window or I can use the User Agent Switcher plugin to force it to Chrome. This is something that just recently started, probably beginning with v119 or even 119.01. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1200;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Neiby
