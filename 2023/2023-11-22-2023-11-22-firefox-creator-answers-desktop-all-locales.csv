If you have the file on your computer you can import it."" </p><p>I will play a song from a playlist and is given that pop-up, it will continue skipping to the next song until it plays, but only for 9-10 seconds until the song mutes, to specify, the dot (when hovered on the progress bar) will still move, indicating that ""it's playing"". </p><p>Some clarifications: 1. I use Spotify Desktop app (windows), Spotify App (android), and Spotify Webplayer on Chrome and Firefox. Everything works just as fine on all of these, except for Spotify Webplayer on Firefox. 2. Skipping to a later timestamp does not unmute the song. 2. I have Spotify Premium 3. I have no VPN 4. I am running Firefox with an ad blocker 5. I am running Chrome with an ad blocker (same ad blocker in Fifefox) 6. I am running Firefox to the latest version (Firefox 119.0.1 (20231106151204)) </p><p>What I've done so far: 1. Cleared caches and data. 2. Updated my Windows to the latest update available - Win10 v.22H2 3. Signed-out of Spotify for all my devices, then logging-in first on Spotify Desktop (this automatically redirects to Firefox webplayer) 4. Ran Firefox on ""Troubleshoot Mode"" 5. Un-checked and re-checked ""Play DRM content"" setting. 6. Disabled and re-enabled the plug-in ""Widevine Content Decryption Module by Google Inc"".

What do I do? I tried to go to manage bookmarks first, and under the import option, it says how many tabs were bookmarked or saves, or something, but when I go to click to restore it, it says it cannot be restored. I feel like its somewhere still there, and I really need some of that information. Any help is appreciated, thank you </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",7treesinthewoods
