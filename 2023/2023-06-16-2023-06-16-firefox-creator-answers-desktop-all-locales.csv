Whenever I first installed it on my iPhone I was using Password1 and that is the only record it shows, with no obvious way to delete that entry now that I have dumped Password1 in favor of Bitwarden. Plus when trying to install on Linux Mint desktop it first wanted me to use Snap package but Mint uses Flatpak. Got it installed using default software manager in Mint, then when I wanted to authenticate it sent code to phone, but phone said already registered so no way to authenticate desktop version. Forget it ... I use my Yubikey for all my other 2FA and it works slicker-n-snot this Twilio thing is too much hassle comparatively. When Mozilla adds some other 2FA choices THEN I can use 2FA with FF, not this app. Ugh. </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1140;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1585810;,w7dah1
