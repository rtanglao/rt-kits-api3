I loved it and after a bit of tweaking, I run into a problem I can't deal with myself.  In Chrome I loved auto fill options every time I needed the option for my home address, email address or credit card. In Firefox I just can't do it. The option is only available for Canada or SUA. Is there any way I can make it work? Of course, I looked for some add-ons and actually found several, but given the fact that auto-fill in my case deals with personal and sensitive data, I need a safer method. Is there any? Thank you! </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",dfonwww
