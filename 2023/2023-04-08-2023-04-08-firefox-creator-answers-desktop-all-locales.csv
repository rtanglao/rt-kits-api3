When I visit aliexpress it changes the url into ""<a href=""http://best.aliexpress.com"" rel=""nofollow"">best.aliexpress.com</a>"" and changes the search results where some of the sellers are highlighted and framed with flashy banners. It sometimes causes crashing other shopping websites as well. I tried deleting my profile, uninstalling firefox, deleting site data, cookies, cache, scanning with 3 different antimalware programs, deleting mozilla folder on %appdata% </p><p>it also closes my aliexpress tabs when I open multiple tabs of a product from different sellers, it redirects them all to the <a href=""http://best.aliexpress.com"" rel=""nofollow"">best.aliexpress.com</a> homepage the moment I look away. </p><p>I tried firefox mobile browser that I logged in with my account and is on synch with the desktop browser. When I visit aliexpress it can't redirect to <a href=""http://best.aliexpress.com"" rel=""nofollow"">best.aliexpress.com</a> and asks ""Would you like to leave firefox to view this content"" and I tap on cancel and no further problems occur. When I'm looking at an aliexpress page, it always asks ""Would you like to leave firefox to view this content"" without me tapping on anything, or when I'm trying to check out a product. When I tap on Cancel, it still opens the page I want to see without redirecting me to anywhere. </p><p>When I create a new profile with Run&gt;Firefox -p, it stops redirecting me to the <a href=""http://best.aliexpress.com"" rel=""nofollow"">best.aliexpress.com</a> problem but altered search results are still there with certain sellers being highlighted and advertised. I don't see them on mobile. </p><p>I really like firefox and don't want switch to other browsers, even if it doesn't fully work for some websites with the dark mode addon, and some website developers are only considering chrome when designing a website. I still don't want to use any other browser. So please help me with this problem. Again, it only causes firefox desktop version to misbehave, not many problems with mobile version other than occasional asking ""Would you like to leave firefox to view this content"" </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",aylinyilmaz

When I try and bookmark a web site on you tube, and bookmark it to the Firefox option of ""new folder"", the bookmark will NOT occur or stick. I used to be able to use that bookmark option of ""new folder"" but now it won't work any longer? Although, if I use the ""bookmark menu"" or ""imported from Firefox"" the bookmark WILL work. I'm confused as to why I can no longer use the ""new folder"" option when trying to bookmark a site. Can someone please help.

The document was corrupted, with some letters changed and a lot of special characters (*&amp;%$#) replacing alphanumerics.  the spacing was also messed up.    I thought that the sender had made this mess; how-ever, I also got another e-mail with a messed-up attachment.  This one was from an academic and was a PDF. It had the same sort of wild replacement of alphanumerics with special characters.  I use  Yahoo, so I thought maybe it was Yahoo's fault.  But I checked the two e-mails on the same computer but in Edge and Brave:  both attachments were uncorrupted.

It happens only with slate, nowhere else, and again inconsistently. I don't know if I have done anything differently on these occasions.  </p><p>Any thoughts? It's persisted over many months, during which time of course Firefox has updated many times, caches have been cleared, Window has rebooted, anti-virus and anti-spyware checks have run, CCleaner has run, you name it.
