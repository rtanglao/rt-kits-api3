The only way to fix the issue for me is to close out of Firefox entirely and to start a new session.

When I took a look at my task manager I noticed that my ram usage had climbed up to all the way to 95%.

1410326,2023-04-08 11:27:05 -0700,2023-04-08 14:09:33 -0700,Firefox crashing regularly,"<p>Hail all: </p><p>Last two, three years, I keep getting regular crashes. System Info (reduced), with a bloody ridiculous name due to the hosting site limitation and renaming moronicy, my apologies: https://tan-veronika-35.tiiny.site/ </p><p>I have right now 27 pinned tabs and 16 Unpinned tabs open in Regular Window, and HAD 74 tabs in a Private Window, which I lost (AGAIN) due to crash. I use Private Window to prevent unnecessary data to be stored on my system 9such as text, pictures, whatever), since having severe Asperger's, i am somewhat OCD about keeping my system clean and mean. Useless data is that, and I hate useless. </p><p>I did not get any information, as usual, about what caused the crash, I just got a pop-up saying basically: ""Well hotdang, you poor sod. Seems your Firefox figured to pull a prank on you. Well, sorry mate, going to close the whole darn thing, you will loose all you had open, but cheer up, Firefox will still work when you pummel that Icon again. Cio, hombre!"" which does not quite tell me anything but: ""Bad luck, Ol' Chum."" </p><p>As this happens fairly regularly, this is becoming a true annoyance, the crashes. The sites lost, then, a far bigger issue. </p><p>Now, I have a doable system (which you can see in the .PDF), but what baffles me, is the fact that now, with mere 43 tabs (this one not included) active, excluding this one (see picture), just devouring immense much memory. With the lost in the crash Private Window it ran towards a staggering 21 GB used by Firefox. Funny, not too long ago, in Internet explorer (OBVIOUSLY it could not handle this amount of tabs, but 30 was possible), only about 600MB got used. Running nigh 4 times the tabs now in Firefox, should result in IE (if it could handle 118 tabs) into about 2400MB used, not a baffling 21GB! What makes it that tabs or sites use this insane much resources? I do not quite get this. Pictures became a tad larger, sure, but not to fill 21GB on resources? Why doesn't Firefox use the Virtual Memory/Swapfile more? Could help immensely. </p><p>Also, what makes my Firefox crash so often? If I had data on this, I could maybe fix the issue, but as Firefox just stops without further information, I am at a loss. </p><p>Earlier (not the first time I post about this issue) I requested an optional way to have a Private Window ""screenshot"" that would be restored on restart after crash, but which would be deleted (ERASED, to be correct, Erase does not leave traces) by normal shut-down. This way, privacy would still be active for the needy, while the ""Bad Luck, Ol Chum-ers"" like me with this crash, have something to regain the crash-closed tabs. Win-win situation, I think. So ... why has this ""Crash Tab-Loss Prevention"" not yet been installed in Firefox? </p><p>Same for File Resume, requested, but never gotten. Though both would be surely quite a welcome addition. </p><p>To end my post: How do I prevent crashes, why does Firefox use so darn much resources, and why is ""Crash Tab-Loss Prevention"" nor ""File Resume"" been installed in Firefox, despite there been several updates since requested, please? </p><p>Kindest regards: Ben </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1574646;,Xogroroth

So, just for clarification, DOES FIREFOX ""THROW"" AN INACCESSIBLE CAPTIA TO ENSURE HUMAN ENTRY RATHER THAN A BOT?  One thing for sure, my anger will be against whichever agency ""potped"" that inaccessible captia!  I don't like most captias anyhow; but I manage fairly well if the captia is truly accessible, but I despise those thoughtlessly created inaccessible captias.
