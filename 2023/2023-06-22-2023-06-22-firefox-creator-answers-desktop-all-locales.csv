Ho contattato l'assistenza dei due siti e mi hanno detto che accade perché il browser cancella i cookie, ma io ho settato entrambi i siti nelle eccezioni sia dell'antitracciamento avanzata che dei cookie e dati salvati. Come posso evitare che il browser cancelli alla chiusura i dati di questi due siti? Ringrazio per la cortese attenzione. </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-10;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,cookies,it,"",emanuele5

I recently updated from Ubuntu 22.04 to 23.04. Firefox got updated accordingly. I replaced the snap version with deb package (from MozillaTeam/PPA), version 114.0.1. Since then, Firefox 114.0.1 (and also 114.0.2, recently updated) does not open downloaded files automatically. It doesn’t matter if the corresponding file mime type is registred or not in Firefox configuration. When you click on a link, in the first case Firefox downloads the file, and then nothing happens. In the second case, Firefox asks for a program to open it, and once selected, nothing happens. In any case, you can go to the download folder and doble click on the file, and it opens without problem. </p><p>I have tried Firefox save mode, dissabling all extensions, and even with a newly created profile, but it makes no difference. I installed Firefox ESR (version 102.12.0-ESR) locally on my user folder, and it works as expected.   </p><p>As an exemple, if you go to <a href=""http://entropymine.com/jason/testbed/mime/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://entropymine.com/jason/testbed/mime/</a>, and click on any link on the last two rows of the table, Firefox ESR launches the corresponding app, while nothing happens with Firefox 114. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,es,"",xavic69

The amount of battery usage is significantly higher compared to other browsers (Even about 10 times more!), It is my request to Mozilla to fix this problem.

I'm not more a programmer, but if i give to someone a program which crashes, and after i tell him it is your environment, what kind of programmer i am?  what knows the user? why is not possible to verify you will have the memory you want to use before using it? if there is no space find out, and handle it. you choose to crash.  -- i replaced the hdd, (but i copy the same data on the new one) i replaced the memory, i replaced the motherboard, i replaced everything, but not the software. it is not a hardware problem here. only a bad management, os - program, ... program! thanks for your help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1140;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1586665;1586689;,it3

I have my homepage set to Firefox's "" about:preferences#privacy ""   I usually clear all the  ' stored cookies, site data ' through the "" Clear Data' button.  Have it set to clear ALL data.     Also clear "" History "" data and too ALL data.  </p><pre>Then I use "" CCleaner "" to clear any data that might have been left on my PC.  It/CCleaner too has settings to clean Firefox's Cache, history, cookies, download history, session and more which use to work very well on clearing all data of web browsing.   That doesn't do it anymore.   After all the effort I go through after closing Firefox to delete/eliminate all my browsing history... through the manual tic-buttons IN Firefox... AND with the settings to clear cookies, site data and history upon closing.  PLUS using CCleaner.   I ALSO close down/disable my 'Wireless Network' modem EVERY TIME I close Firefox  because I've had programs... AV program... that had stupid-non-disabling auto update that would connect... on it's own... to the net and not only check for it's update but downloads updates on every program update-able.  But with all the work and precautions.... NOW when I click on Firefox to start a whole new session... remember all the moves I take AFTER the last session... It/Firefox asks if I want to continue with my last session and shows the sites I was at the last time. If there is anyway to get... MY PRIVACY BACK!!! ... I would LOVE to hear about it. I would LOVE to have my ""Firefox 2.0. "" back where/when there were no problems. </pre>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ynot_jd
