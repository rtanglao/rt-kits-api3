I have my homepage set to Firefox's "" about:preferences#privacy ""   I usually clear all the  ' stored cookies, site data ' through the "" Clear Data' button.  Have it set to clear ALL data.     Also clear "" History "" data and too ALL data.  </p><pre>Then I use "" CCleaner "" to clear any data that might have been left on my PC.  It/CCleaner too has settings to clean Firefox's Cache, history, cookies, download history, session and more which use to work very well on clearing all data of web browsing.   That doesn't do it anymore.   After all the effort I go through after closing Firefox to delete/eliminate all my browsing history... through the manual tic-buttons IN Firefox... AND with the settings to clear cookies, site data and history upon closing.  PLUS using CCleaner.   I ALSO close down/disable my 'Wireless Network' modem EVERY TIME I close Firefox  because I've had programs... AV program... that had stupid-non-disabling auto update that would connect... on it's own... to the net and not only check for it's update but downloads updates on every program update-able.  But with all the work and precautions.... NOW when I click on Firefox to start a whole new session... remember all the moves I take AFTER the last session... It/Firefox asks if I want to continue with my last session and shows the sites I was at the last time. If there is anyway to get... MY PRIVACY BACK!!! ... I would LOVE to hear about it. I would LOVE to have my ""Firefox 2.0. "" back where/when there were no problems. </pre>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ynot_jd
