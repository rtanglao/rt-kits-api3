The amount of battery usage is significantly higher compared to other browsers (Even about 10 times more!), It is my request to Mozilla to fix this problem. Firefox is really awesome but it uses a lot of resources. </p>",desktop;other;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,other,en-US,1586666;,Celestial_Sapien

I'm not more a programmer, but if i give to someone a program which crashes, and after i tell him it is your environment, what kind of programmer i am?  what knows the user? why is not possible to verify you will have the memory you want to use before using it? if there is no space find out, and handle it. you choose to crash.  -- i replaced the hdd, (but i copy the same data on the new one) i replaced the memory, i replaced the motherboard, i replaced everything, but not the software. it is not a hardware problem here. only a bad management, os - program, ... program! thanks for your help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1140;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1586665;1586689;,it3

The background color is a similar gray, so the tab symbol for the NYTimes (beginning with an ornate letter T) cannot be distinguished from the background.  The NYTimes tab foreground color used to remain black.   </p><p>For an example, go to <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nytimes.com/</a>.  The tab foreground colors for some NYTimes pages remain black; for example, go to <a href=""https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.nytimes.com/hc/en-us</a>.  I think this tab foreground color change began recently, less than a month ago.  This problem does not occur for web sites other than the NYTimes.  Restarting my computer does not help.

I have my homepage set to Firefox's "" about:preferences#privacy ""   I usually clear all the  ' stored cookies, site data ' through the "" Clear Data' button.  Have it set to clear ALL data.     Also clear "" History "" data and too ALL data.  </p><pre>Then I use "" CCleaner "" to clear any data that might have been left on my PC.  It/CCleaner too has settings to clean Firefox's Cache, history, cookies, download history, session and more which use to work very well on clearing all data of web browsing.   That doesn't do it anymore.   After all the effort I go through after closing Firefox to delete/eliminate all my browsing history... through the manual tic-buttons IN Firefox... AND with the settings to clear cookies, site data and history upon closing.  PLUS using CCleaner.   I ALSO close down/disable my 'Wireless Network' modem EVERY TIME I close Firefox  because I've had programs... AV program... that had stupid-non-disabling auto update that would connect... on it's own... to the net and not only check for it's update but downloads updates on every program update-able.  But with all the work and precautions.... NOW when I click on Firefox to start a whole new session... remember all the moves I take AFTER the last session... It/Firefox asks if I want to continue with my last session and shows the sites I was at the last time. If there is anyway to get... MY PRIVACY BACK!!! ... I would LOVE to hear about it. I would LOVE to have my ""Firefox 2.0. "" back where/when there were no problems. </pre>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ynot_jd
