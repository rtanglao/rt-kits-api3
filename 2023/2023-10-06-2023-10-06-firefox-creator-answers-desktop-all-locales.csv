Instead, I get an ""Unable to connect"" message, and Firefox is reporting it failed to check for updates. As Firefox worked before running ""brew install stats"", I suspect that has something to do with it, but I have tried turning my firewall to automatically allow built-in software to receive internet connections, and even tried quitting Firefox. I strongly suspect it is the Stats brew I installed, as browsers normally don't break a week after an update was installed, but quitting Stats doesn't help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ethan.a.glasby
