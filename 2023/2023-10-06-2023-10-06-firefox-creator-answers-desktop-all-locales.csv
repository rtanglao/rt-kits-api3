For example, when I try to use the ""Search"" function, I can't type a search string. Or sometimes when I create an event I have problems typing in the event title field as well. On these occasions when it doesn't work there is no blinking cursor placed at the left end of the text field, so you can't type in that field.  </p><p>Hoping that this isn't just me, since I really like using FIrefox. Have had to move to the Edge Browser because Google Calendar is a central tool for me that has to work without having to fiddle around. </p>",desktop;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",MrDoh

Instead, I get an ""Unable to connect"" message, and Firefox is reporting it failed to check for updates. As Firefox worked before running ""brew install stats"", I suspect that has something to do with it, but I have tried turning my firewall to automatically allow built-in software to receive internet connections, and even tried quitting Firefox. I strongly suspect it is the Stats brew I installed, as browsers normally don't break a week after an update was installed, but quitting Stats doesn't help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ethan.a.glasby
