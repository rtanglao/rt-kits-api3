Every Youtube (and other platforms) Video shows extreme brightness. It looks like as someone recorded the video directly in the sun. An example is the best so I attached a Photo with FF in the top left, Chrome in the top right and Edge at the Bottom. Only the frames have been a bit cropped for privacy. </p><p>The video shown in the screenshot can be found <a href=""https://youtu.be/tO01J-M3g0U"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. Today I also tried a fresh installation of my Win 11 and also FF (Had some free SSD around for that). But this had no effect, it looked the same. The only change I can see is when the Troubleshoot mode is being activated. But only while this mode is active. If FF is being reset or even new installation (like before fresh Win 11), no change. </p><p>Cause of this behaviour I also mentioned FF Video Stream is not HDR. The others show HDR but as not every Youtube Video can be HDR I think this is not the Problem. Anyway, I don't want to change my favorite browser which was working now for about 20 years. </p><p>Does anybody have a clue what is causing this or is it a bug? </p><p>greets indy </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",indiiana
