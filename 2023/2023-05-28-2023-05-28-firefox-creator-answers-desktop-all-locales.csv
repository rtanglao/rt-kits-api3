Sometimes I can middle-click on ""open image in a new tab"" multiple times and get no response. Other times if I hold down for a while and then release, it will open the image. And then other times again it will work as intended. </p><p>I'm not quite sure why this issue has suddenly occured. </p><p>Firefox is up to date, Version 113.0.2 (64-bit).
