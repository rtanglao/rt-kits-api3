I have selected the option not to track in the address bar and still the same problem. I run ebay through MS Edge and runs perfectly. Happens to me in 3 out of 4 computers.  Only in 1 works ok,  very strange... </p><p>Speed connection in all of them is at least 200mb/s </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",xmilkeg

It is disabled by default not only in Firefox, but also in other major browsers like Chrome, Edge, or Opera. </p><p>If I wanted to activate it (Because it is nice feature), then I must press F7, or click on checkbox in settings. </p><p>If you don't know what I'm talking, then it is the ""Always use the cursor keys to navigate within pages"" option. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,other,en-US,"",pk22.games1

Sometimes I can middle-click on ""open image in a new tab"" multiple times and get no response. Other times if I hold down for a while and then release, it will open the image. And then other times again it will work as intended. </p><p>I'm not quite sure why this issue has suddenly occured. </p><p>Firefox is up to date, Version 113.0.2 (64-bit). My mouse is a KLIM Blaze, drivers 3.1 which again seem to be up to date. My middle-click in new-tab is set to true in firefox's config. </p><p>Does anyone know why these issues are happening? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",salliedrazzi
