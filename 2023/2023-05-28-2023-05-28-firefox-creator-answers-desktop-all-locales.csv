I have added Zotero to manage my writing reference citation library, and have downloaded the current Zotero Connector for Firefox. I should be able to add references from online, by using the Zotero save icon that should appear on my Firefox toolbar. But this icon is nowhere to be seen and I cannot see how to make it appear. The whole advantage of Zotero for me as a writing academic is pinned to this function, so I am anxious to get it working. How can I get the Zotero save icon in its proper place on my Firefox toolbar, just to the right of the search window? Many thanks </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",gray6

It errors that it only works in a browser. Why can't Roboform see or associate the connection when Firefox browser is in use. If it is in use, then Roboform should work. Is it a Firefox problem or a roboform problem? Between both of you surely someone can resolve this problem? It seems Roboform has washed their hands of the problem because they reply with a standard enable process that doesn't work for many people. I am on my 2nd new computer and still have the same problem.  Again the error states it only works when the browser is in use. If the browser is in use, then what is the problem? thanks for any assistance you can provide.... I like Firefox and Roboform, it would be a blessing to have both working at the same time.
