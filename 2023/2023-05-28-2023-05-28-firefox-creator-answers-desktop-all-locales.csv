A partire da 4-5- updates fa, succede che dopo essermi connesso a tre-quattro siti in schede diverse, volendo connettermi ad un altro sito il programma è come se non aprisse per niente la connessione e quindi la pagina che volevo aprire rimane blank. Il problema si risolve se, entrando nella pagina ""about:support"" (ma solo all'apertura di firefox) cancello la cache di avvio, il che mi chiude e riapre il programma. Utile, certamente, ma poco pratico. Inoltre, sulla barra degli strumenti non compaiono più le icone delle estensioni che ho installato (visibile nell'apposita sezione delle impostazioni). Eppure le espensioni installate funzionano perfettamente. Precedentemente alle citate updates firefox funzionava egregiamente. Sono grato per qualsiasi aiuto al riguardo. </p><p>Buon lavoro.
