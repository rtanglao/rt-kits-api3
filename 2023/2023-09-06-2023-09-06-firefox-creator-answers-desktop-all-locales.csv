For testing the addin performance in office web, i'm currently trying out different browsers. There is a shortcut key to my addin that should open the addin taskpane. The shortcut doesn't conflict with any firefox or excel office web shortcut (even if it did, there should be a prompt according to microsoft's documentation).  The problem is, when i load a workbook and press the shortcut key combination, the addin taskpane doesn't open. There is no error in console either. I tried setting the security.enterprise_roots.enabled = true assuming this could be due to certificate trust issue but that didn't solve it.  More interestingly, the shortcut does work in firefox once after many retries and this is completely random - at least i couldn't identify when it works and why. It is very rare and may be once in 100 tries. I tried loading a sample addin provided by microsoft to test shortcuts (you can also use it) from here: <a href=""https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-samples/tree/main/Samples/excel-keyboard-shortcuts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-samples/tree/main/Samples/excel-keyboard-shortcuts</a> If i load the manifest.xml in any office web excel workbook (as described in the sample above) in firefox, it worked the first time i.e. the prompt appeared (as the sample shortcut CTRL + ALT + 1 had a conflict with existing office excel shortcut for number formats dialog) and the shortcuts from both addins were working at this point (interesting). It means the sample addin shortcuts and my addin shortcut started to work briefly. Then again i pressed CTRL + F5 to test again, and none of the addin shortcuts were being picked up. My addin shortcut simply does nothing, and the sample addin shortcut opens excel's number format screen. If i reset the excel shortcut preference in the workbook using the search bar, it should show the conflict prompt for the sample addin, but it doesn't and rather loads the number format dialog.  Please note that none of these behaviors are present in chrome and edge, where everything works as expected and documented by Microsoft - for both my addin and the sample. The taskpane opens as soon as i press the shortcut key for my addin or the sample's.  I think firefox somehow ignores or doesn't remember the addin shortcuts most of the time. That's why it does nothing with my shortcut as it is not mapped to any excel or browser action. And it opens the number dialog for sample ignoring the sample shortcut because excel has an action against it. This also explains why both addin shortcuts work when one of them works as firefox starts to remember shortcuts for that session. What doesn't explain is why firefox doesn't store it all the time or why it keeps ignoring? If you want to reproduce, please try with the sample from microsoft. And please let me know if I can help in any way to identify the problem.  Sorry for the very long message. I'm eagerly waiting for your response. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1170;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",istiaq.ahmed.023

In fact I have used Firefox on many macs since Firefox was first offered.  As of the last update or browser upgrade offered by Mozilla for Firefox for Apple desktops, most all streaming video service no longer work.  YouTube, Amazon Prime, and Netflix all stall after a minute or less of selecting a video from the above vendors.  I get the little spinning arrow, and then a screen message that states that my ISP is not providing me with enough bandwidth to stream video.  Absolute nonsense.  Using Safari I have absolutely no issues, problems, stalls, buffering, error messages etc., and the experience is what I used to get from Firefox.  I have lots of bandwidth available, and have had a professional network engineering service provider check my internet connection. Even if I make sure no other tabs, applications or other iterations are running, ONLY Firefox, it stalls and will not play video.  Then I get another screen message that states that ""maybe if you restart your device you may be able to play video"".  While I realize that Firefox is free, I still think I should have a reasonable expectation that it will continue to provide buffer, stall, and hang free performance when I want to watch YouTube, Amazon Prime and or Netflix. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1170;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",bekglm1
