I have my tracking privacy set to strict. Twitch has permission to use my cookies and site data (Settings -&gt; Privacy and Security -&gt; Cookies and Site Data -&gt; Manage Exceptions). All of the other websites that I have granted that permission to have no problem remembering my device, but Twitch does.  I looked at <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/gu-IN/questions/1362478"" rel=""nofollow"">this post</a> already and my account was already set to these settings. How do I make Twitch remember by device? It's annoying to have to go to my email and use a one-time passcode every time I log in. </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-10;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,cookies,en-US,1625813;,blasphemybee

When the WIFI connection is then changed from its current state, initially no errors are thrown. However, although the very next web-socket request from the browser to the local server reaches the server, the response is rejected by the browser and the socket is closed, firing the onerror and onclose events of the socket. The HTTP requests are still processed in both directions (can fetch without issue) and can request another new web socket connection without error. The error thrown is `The connection to ws://127.0.0.1/34215... was interrupted while the page was loading.` </p><p>This takes place when the port is anything other than 8000; all works as expected when the port number is 8000. The local server was set to choose a random unused port number to avoid conflicts with any other running applications. </p><p>If the socket would throw an error before sending the new request, then it would be less of an issue; but, when that request was to save data passed in the XOR frame, the browser has no way of knowing whether or not it was successful because it rejects the response, such that the UI and database could become out-of-sync. </p><p>This is run under a separate profile that is set to work offline (removing offline does not resolve this). Are there any `about:config settings` that might stop the browser from rejecting the responses? Perhaps it is a security measure. </p><p>This was tested on chrome-based browsers and WIFI can be connected and disconnected multiple times and the web socket is never closed regardless of the port number.   </p><p>Thank you for any guidance you may be able to provide. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1625792;,1codedebugger
