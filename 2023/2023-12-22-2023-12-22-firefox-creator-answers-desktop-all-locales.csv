Firefox version is 121.0 (64 Bit) Windows 11 Home Ver: 22H2, OS Build 22621.2861 This is a reasonably new Acer Nitro PC (August 2023) with a solid state drive.  </p><p>When I double click the Firefox Icon a large white box opens on my PC and remains that way for 10-15 seconds, then the white box fills-in with the Firefox screen. Once opened, Firefox works perfectly.  </p><p>I tried the troubleshooter and Firefox starts instantly, as it did previously.  I have no Extensions, Themes, or Plugins.  I even disabled: OpenH264 Video Codec and Widevine Content Decryption Module.  I tried Google and DuckDuck as the Search engine with no difference.  </p><p>Any suggestions? </p><p>Thanks for your help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1210;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",cintex

I usually look at a French site so I click on the translate symbol on the toolbar - fine.   But this no longer works  - the ""en"" appears but the page is still in French.   If I click on Menu then Translate....... just the same.

When the WIFI connection is then changed from its current state, initially no errors are thrown. However, although the very next web-socket request from the browser to the local server reaches the server, the response is rejected by the browser and the socket is closed, firing the onerror and onclose events of the socket. The HTTP requests are still processed in both directions (can fetch without issue) and can request another new web socket connection without error. The error thrown is `The connection to ws://127.0.0.1/34215... was interrupted while the page was loading.` </p><p>This takes place when the port is anything other than 8000; all works as expected when the port number is 8000. The local server was set to choose a random unused port number to avoid conflicts with any other running applications. </p><p>If the socket would throw an error before sending the new request, then it would be less of an issue; but, when that request was to save data passed in the XOR frame, the browser has no way of knowing whether or not it was successful because it rejects the response, such that the UI and database could become out-of-sync. </p><p>This is run under a separate profile that is set to work offline (removing offline does not resolve this). Are there any `about:config settings` that might stop the browser from rejecting the responses? Perhaps it is a security measure. </p><p>This was tested on chrome-based browsers and WIFI can be connected and disconnected multiple times and the web socket is never closed regardless of the port number.   </p><p>Thank you for any guidance you may be able to provide. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1625792;,1codedebugger
