In other words, I click a link in an email and am taken to a completely white, blank page in a new tab of my Firefox browser.  I've tried clearing my cache but that didn't resolve the issue.  I figure it's time to ask for some help with this strange, frustrating issue so that I can open links emailed to me.  I've attached a screenshot of one of the emails this happens with.  It's been happening with a company called Geru as well as the one in the screenshot, but I've found that links from the Epoch Times for instance work fine.

I have ""Always ask where to save files"" enabled. In the ""About:Config"" it does show Documents as the last folder.  So oddly... lets say I download 3 files... The first 2 it will show Documents in the save dialog box and all I have to do is click save.  Then the 3rd file it will default to dowloads for some reason.  Ya I can just click Documents and click save, but that is irksome.  Sometimes it will default to downloads for 10 save file attempts and sometimes it will just default to Documents 10 times in a row.  Ultimately I don't want to have to check folder location each time.  I will often ""lose a file"" and then remember I have to double check downloads, and sure enough it is there (because I forgot to double check, I just clicked save).  I realize this is not the end of the world, but there does not seem to be any legit reason that I have found, that FF does this.  Shouldn't it just do as it says it will do and the default location that pops up is the last location I saved to?  Note this has been like this for years (I'm just now finally saying ENOUGH!&nbsp;:D ) </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1210;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1625891;,sharks17

When the WIFI connection is then changed from its current state, initially no errors are thrown. However, although the very next web-socket request from the browser to the local server reaches the server, the response is rejected by the browser and the socket is closed, firing the onerror and onclose events of the socket. The HTTP requests are still processed in both directions (can fetch without issue) and can request another new web socket connection without error. The error thrown is `The connection to ws://127.0.0.1/34215... was interrupted while the page was loading.` </p><p>This takes place when the port is anything other than 8000; all works as expected when the port number is 8000. The local server was set to choose a random unused port number to avoid conflicts with any other running applications. </p><p>If the socket would throw an error before sending the new request, then it would be less of an issue; but, when that request was to save data passed in the XOR frame, the browser has no way of knowing whether or not it was successful because it rejects the response, such that the UI and database could become out-of-sync. </p><p>This is run under a separate profile that is set to work offline (removing offline does not resolve this). Are there any `about:config settings` that might stop the browser from rejecting the responses? Perhaps it is a security measure. </p><p>This was tested on chrome-based browsers and WIFI can be connected and disconnected multiple times and the web socket is never closed regardless of the port number.   </p><p>Thank you for any guidance you may be able to provide. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1625792;,1codedebugger
