The result works on all browsers as expected but not with Firefox vers 109 for Apple Silicon devices (m1, m2) - the video animation is just lagging,it takes cpu usage up to 160% and the video itself is stretched. Comparing to that Chrome takes 22%, Safari 14% of cpu usage. It's just regarding to this devices, it works fine on Microsoft so I think it's a browser bug regarding to osx verision. Could someone pls help me with that or have a look over? </p>",desktop;beta;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1090;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",develop3
