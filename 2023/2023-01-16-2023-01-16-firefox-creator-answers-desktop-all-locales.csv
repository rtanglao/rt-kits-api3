I know that Firefox has a way to force websites to dark mode, though it applies it to all websites. I don't really want that because some websites just look awkward when Firefox applies its dark mode to them. I want to know how to have Firefox only apply dark mode in a few domains that I choose?

When I installed firefox, I was asked to ""import"" cookies and such. I did. Which has been a terrible headache. All of the bookmarks and everything from Chrome came with it, which I already had in firefox, since I've had it for years. But, I thought since this is a brand new computer that I needed to do that. Fast-forward a couple of weeks and now EVERY time I open up firefox, all 10 million history links are in history. </p><p>I use firefox to unwind and watch movies. I don't want 10 million links to work in front of where I left off in binge watching Seinfeld.  </p><p>I've tried everything and followed instructions and STILL, all history from Chrome shows up in firefox. It is infuriating. AND uninstalling and reinstalling did nothing. The setting is already in the account to import from Chrome to firefox. I've removed addons and extensions as well. Nothing has worked. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",boundlessenterprise
