I really don't understand the part stating who is managing by whom is this organization? I've been a long time user of Firefox so I would like to have this issue resolved as this my second attempt. I downloaded this file suggested by a member called policy_templates_v4.12.zip but at 73 years old and reading this nonsense imho is just not right. If I can't get this resolved soon I shall change browsers and it won't be Chrome that is for sure. I started with computers back 1989 long before the internet came along so due to bad health issues my memory is at best not great. Thanks for reading this and hopefully I can get an answer that will satisfy me as I love Firefox and really don't want to give up on it. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,other,en-US,1587884;,hemi426
