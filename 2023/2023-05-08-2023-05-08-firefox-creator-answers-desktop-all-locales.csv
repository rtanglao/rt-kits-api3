The issue has been 'answered' by advanced users to tell people to 'inspect' which font is the issue then check local systems font book for corrupted/duplicate fonts: however this is not a satisfactory response. Context: see screen shot attached for what the jibberish looks like, and a point in the 'inspect' view that I believe (guessing) is involved. System: Firefox 112.0.2 (64-bit), MacOS 13.3.1 (a) (22E772610a) on Macbook Pro (13-inch, 2020, 2 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5). This same websites do not have any issue on the same computer viewed on Chrome or Safari. Nor is there any problem on my iPhone on the iOS firefox browser.  </p><p>Firstly this is not a user-friendly solution for most people, I'm afraid. Opening the inspect viewer is mindboggling for anyone who doesn't code and even for people who do some programming but not for websites (like me), it isn't exactly self-explanatory. I think I've managing to find examples that indicate  'Roboto'  seems to be consistently involved in the display issue.  Secondly, the step for 'fixing' the font that is the culprit - my local system indicates that all fonts are valid and there are no duplicates. I haven't installed manually Roboto as I'm uncertain where to 'safely' get the font from and my computer is owned and managed by my workplace - with overly strict administration/security rules so if I f-up a download of something dodgy my IT service will blacklist me and revoke my admin access... ** which would mean I'd be unable to do my job!**. I wondered if perhaps there is some security setting due to that, which stops website from loading the fonts they choose? From previous 'solutions' it said that having Firefox preference set to ""allow websites to choose their own fonts..."" should mean the websites can load as needed. If indeed I must manually download fonts for each and every instance that Firefox fails to display text legibly that is equivalent to Firefox being unusable.  I'm clearly frustrated and it's because I love FIrefox and the ethos behind it all so leaving for Chrome would be very sad indeed! Help and a solution for normal users would be so very much appreciated. Also where can I properly lodge this issue with peeps who fix things? There are issues of this kind going back years and for both Windows and Mac Systems so it's not a one-off problem but a recurring one! Please pretty please, people who do the magic that makes Firefox - fix this issue...  Thanks for reading my rant and for any helpful responses.
