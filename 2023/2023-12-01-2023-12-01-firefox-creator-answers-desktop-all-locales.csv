I am now connected to my ISP modem wirelessly.  I have been using Firefox as my browser for many years (ten?) and have not had a problem until today.  When I attempt to go to a web site I get a notice that says: ""Unable to find the proxy server.  Firefox is configured to use a proxy server that can't be found.  Check the proxy settings to sure they are correct.  Check to make sure your computer has a working network connection. If your computer or network is protected by firewall or proxy make sure that Firefox is permitted to access the web.""  </p><p>I am able to get to any web site I choose when using another browser.  I am also receiving my emails, and able to send emails.  So I know the computer has a working network connection.   When I have visited the Mozilla support site (having to use another browser) I see advice that shows opening the Settings page and getting to the Proxy settings.  When I open my ""Settings"" page from the menu on the Firefox home page upper banner I do not see any option to get the Proxy settings.  How do I access the Proxy settings page?  Or how do I access the Firewall settings?  Don't forget, I cannot open any web page from Firefox. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jamesqualey7
