I changed the password, it didn't help. </p><p>Their chat support sent me to their Privacy statement. There, there is custom list of cookies that they use. I was told to try to delete them individually...   I have no idea how to do that and I could not find a method that works. </p><p>I can login the website using Safari. Any suggestions for what to do to be able to use again Firefox to login into this website?
