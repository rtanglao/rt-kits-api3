I went to help and have tried everything suggested (for example, in this article -&gt; <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1365225"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1365225</a>) to no avail. I generally have to have at least a dozen tabs open at a time due to the nature of my work and it is time-consuming and frustrating to have to re-open the every time.  </p><p>I have tried the 'restore previous session' under the History menu but that is not an option given. So that isn't working for me either. 'Recently closed tabs' is an option but is greyed out / doesn't work. </p><p>It is possible that this is a result of a recent update as Firefox has been almost daily been asking me to update. But I do not know how to go 'back' to last version if that is the case ... or how to turn off the annoying update messages. </p><p>So what is going on?  </p><p>Thank you in advance. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",Birdsnest

After upgrading to 111, Firefox's ability to remember per-site zoom settings seems to have disappeared. Based on my perusal of some previous issues with Firefox zoom levels, I  tried changing the `browser.display.os-zoom-behavior` setting in `about:config` from `1` to `0`, but this has no effect. Is there some way to restore per-site zoom level retention? That was a really nice feature that I relied on quite a bit. </p>",desktop;tabs;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1110;firefox-11101;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",toby15

Now, when I transfer a link to a folder on the Bookmarks toolbar, it always sets the URL of the link as the ""name"" of the bookmark. How do I make it so that when I drag a link to the bookmarks toolbar it saves with the header rather than the URL. </p><p>If this helps, I'm using MacOS most of the time. </p><p>I've attached an image of what it's like now.
