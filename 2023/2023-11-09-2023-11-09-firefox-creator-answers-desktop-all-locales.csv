It worked before I updated to 108.0.2. I then updated to the current version (119.0.1) in hopes to fix the problem, but still no tooltips show up. I wonder why. Do you have any idea? </p><p>P.S. In the ""load"" event handler (this is when the window loads) I add mouse event handlers to ""A"" elements to catch ""mouseenter, mouseleave,"" and ""mousemove"" events. Then, in the same ""load"" event handler, I create invisible ""SPAN"" element that would serve as a tooltip. I then add this invisible element to the ""BODY"" using ""document.body.insertAdjacentElement('beforeend', ..."" The event handlers for mouse events change the ""style.display"" property of the tooltip element to render it visible or vice versa, depending on where the mouse pointer is. Nothing fancy. </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",antizilla

Now, whenever I take a screenshot, it copies only 3/5's of the page (from the left margin to roughly 3/5ths of the page both displayed or entire). My settings in about:config have not been changed (well, they are changed but at the same settings as when 'Take Screenshot' worked and now only copying 3/5ths of the page). </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1190;,firefox,other,en-US,1616934;,PH8978

It happened today and all I can do is close it on the task bar. It will not close via the X in the top right hand corner. I have 32 GB of memory and when I open Task Manager, it shows 16 processes running with 8 of them in efficiency Mode, with no CPU in use. My only option at this point is to move to a new browser. What can I do to help you with my issue? When this happens, it only shows a line with an arrow at each side of it.  &lt;--&gt;.
