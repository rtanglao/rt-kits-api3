It happened today and all I can do is close it on the task bar. It will not close via the X in the top right hand corner. I have 32 GB of memory and when I open Task Manager, it shows 16 processes running with 8 of them in efficiency Mode, with no CPU in use. My only option at this point is to move to a new browser. What can I do to help you with my issue? When this happens, it only shows a line with an arrow at each side of it.  &lt;--&gt;.  I receive no error message. </p><p>I am using Firefox 119.0.1 64 bit on Windows 11 Version 23H2 Build 2263.12506 </p><p>Help Me! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",dwilliams131
