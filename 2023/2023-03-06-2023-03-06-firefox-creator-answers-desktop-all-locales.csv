In the new about:config page, the search bar can only match the name of preferences, but can't match the value of preferences. For example, when I type ""https"" in the search bar, The old about:config page can list all preferences with ""https"" in its name and value; but the new about:config page only list the preferences with ""https"" in its name. It makes user difficult to find the target preferences with specific value.

This function works fine in Chrome on the same computers.  In Firefox, the rest of the Ancestry website works without problems.  I can navigate to the DNA Matches page where it shows Paternal, Maternal, etc., but when I click on the ""View Matches"" button, only the header and footer information shows up on the resulting page -- no DNA match data appears.  It's almost like the Javascript, or whatever they use, isn't firing.  I tried texting Ancestry, and their automated response suggested downloading the latest version of Firefox.  I've already done that (version 110.0.1 (64-bit)).  I don't know if this problem belongs to you or if it's large enough for you to worry about, but it's annoying to me and I'll have to switch to another browser if this can't be resolved.  I'd prefer to stay with Firefox.  I didn't notice this problem until the past few days (or maybe a week) or so.  I'm wondering if it's anything related to your latest update(s)?
