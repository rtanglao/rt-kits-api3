This, at least, is what the Keeper website says.  I have looked at the Keeper extension in Firefox (and made sure it was the current version) but I cannot find any reference to auto logoff.  I would like to be able to use this feature (as I am able to do in Chrome.)  Any insight to this? </p><p>James Beeghly </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",hopefulflyer

This function works fine in Chrome on the same computers.  In Firefox, the rest of the Ancestry website works without problems.  I can navigate to the DNA Matches page where it shows Paternal, Maternal, etc., but when I click on the ""View Matches"" button, only the header and footer information shows up on the resulting page -- no DNA match data appears.  It's almost like the Javascript, or whatever they use, isn't firing.  I tried texting Ancestry, and their automated response suggested downloading the latest version of Firefox.  I've already done that (version 110.0.1 (64-bit)).  I don't know if this problem belongs to you or if it's large enough for you to worry about, but it's annoying to me and I'll have to switch to another browser if this can't be resolved.  I'd prefer to stay with Firefox.  I didn't notice this problem until the past few days (or maybe a week) or so.  I'm wondering if it's anything related to your latest update(s)?  Thanks! </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1100;firefox-11001;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1569162;,dtstaley57

The companies listed except for a couple are all ones that I do not have accounts on so I don't understand how I ended up on a breach list.  Are you able to explain this further and when you reply, would you mind not sending a reply that I cannot reply to if I still have a question (or if the replies are generated with that type of email in the reply field would you mind including an email address that I can reply to so that the individual reading my follow-up question doesn't have to begin from the beginning with my submitting another support request like this but can see what has already been addresses and then hopefully wrap it up? Thanks so much! </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,1569151;1569156;,tara7175
