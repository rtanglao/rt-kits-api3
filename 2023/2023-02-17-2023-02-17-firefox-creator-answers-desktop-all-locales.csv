The tabs display at the top of the window in Firefox Mac as they always have. </p><p>The problem is that they auto-hide in Firefox Windows and I have to press the Alt key to re-display them. I want the always visible. How do I turn the auto-hide feature off? </p><p>I checked for browser extensions on the Windows version and don't have any installed. The only plugins are codec- or encryption-related. </p><p>I'm not sure whether this new behavior is new to 110 or to a less recent version as I use the Windows version less often than the Mac version. </p>,desktop;tabs;windows-11;firefox-1100;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",CharlesBelov
