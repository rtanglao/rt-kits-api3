Google Chrome notified me that their browser will no longer update with new versions of Google Chrome, so I switched to Firefox which is not a chromium-based browser. </p><p>I successfully imported all my files and bookmarks, etc., so that's okay. </p><p>The problem is that all of my desktop icons and bookmarks are all tainted with Google Chrome.  What I mean by that is that if I click on any desktop icon or bookmark, my computer wants to open that website using Google Chrome and not Firefox. </p><p>While I can reset these to open with Firefox one icon or bookmark at a time, this would be very time-consuming since I have several dozen bookmarks and appx. 35 desktop icons. </p><p>Is there a way I can take care of all of these at one time? </p><p>Thank you, </p><p>George in Arizona </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1100;,firefox,other,en-US,1566097;,argonne1
