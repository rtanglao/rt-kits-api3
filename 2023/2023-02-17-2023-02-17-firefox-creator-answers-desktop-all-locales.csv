In the past when I accessed a bookmark, and then a clicked on the bookmark tab to access ANOTHER bookmark, my bookmark list would show where I had left off from the previous bookmark within that list.  </p><p>Now when I access a another bookmark after I had accessed a previous bookmark, my bookmark list starts from the very top of it instead of where I was previously within that bookmark list.  Being I have many bookmarks, (100's) it is a real pain to have to constantly scroll down from the top of my bookmark list every time to access another bookmark. I didn't have to do this previously. When I accessed bookmarks AFTER I accessed a given bookmark, the bookmark list stayed where I was previously located within my bookmark list. This made it easy to access my next bookmark selection! It sure is handy being all the hundreds of bookmarks I have, to have the list not ALWAYS revert back to the top of my bookmark list every time I want to find a bookmark!   </p><p>This peculiar situation just started yesterday. In the past this would NOT happen when I accessed my bookmarks. </p><pre>Looking at the bookmark manager and bookmark library I don't see options the change how the bookmark list is presented?  </pre> <p>Can someone please help me and explain how do get back my old bookmark list actuation process?

Since developers not yet made disabling plugins easy (like opening a single tab in debug window, easily disable half of plugins in that window. See what happen. Quickly enable these back without manually selecting each one. And disable other half) it is not easy to find addon that is causing the issue. </p><p>Ideas: 1. at about:support page i can copy the list of extensions, but the developer would have to waste their time installing each one manually. Then they will be missing my extensions settings lowering the chance to reproduce even more. 2. Can i somehow export all my extensions and their settings so developers can easily apply it? I mean the way so i can be confident i do not supply them any sensitive data of the extensions. 3. other idea please? </p>",linux;desktop;website-breakages;firefox-10280;firefox-1028;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1566126;,postcd
