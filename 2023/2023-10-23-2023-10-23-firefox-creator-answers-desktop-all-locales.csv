The cards are rendered blurry/unsharp. For a brief moment in the animation where the cards are dealt they appear sharp. But after the animation they become blurry/unsharp. See attached .gif for example. This only happens with Firefox, other browsers i tried (Edge, Chrome, Brave) do not show this behavior; cards are appearing nice and sharp, even after the animation. </p><p>I tested on Windows and Ubuntu, seeing same issue on both OS's. </p><p>Things i tried to solve this: - Updated video card drivers - Disable FF Hardware Acceleration  </p><p>From articles found online i think this might be solved with some css injection, but i don't know how to do that properly. At least things i try don't seem to work at all. =) </p><p>Any ideas on why this is happening and how to solve it? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",etraman

Then I had troubles with ad blocks.  Ad blocks keeps breaking down.  It will work for a few weeks then cracking.  This went on for a long time until finally they said I had an old version, that I have to download the current version and they sent me a link.  I tried it and then the link said I have to choose a paying option.  I knew that's not a special link.  They just sent me the same link for buying a new adblocks.  I subscribed a 5 year program.  And their service didn't even last a year.   </p><p>In the mean time google keep flashing the ad of subscribing to youtube with a prime service. </p><p>But I started to download Firefox.  I had a terrible time downloading it.  I failed a couple of times.  I finally managed to download and install Firefox.  In the mean time the suspicion about google is messing around with my account started. </p><p>I haven't been happy with google for a long time, ever since they started to monitor people's comments on youtube.  So after I deleted my videos and then I went into troubles of making comments on youtube.  Finally I succeeded changing the code they gave me to a name I can remember.  In the mean time they discontinued my account.  All kind of things happening to me.  I finally shrugged them off as a matter of miscommunication.  But the flashing ads became a flashing warnings, something like you must choose google or discontinue adblocks. Then I started searching if there's a battle between google and adblocks.  Finally firefox came through, and I was still troubled by annoying ads.  Finally I got so mad, I just deleted adblocks completely out of my computer.  And somehow I found firefox has an option I can turn on to block the ads.  Ever since then I was enjoying watching youtube again.  And google's warning became more frequent and I just close the window without choosing any options.   </p><p>All through this period, I ran into troubles with my computer on and off.  I keep telling myself it's because my grandson is playing with my computer.  But I cannot help thinking things are really getting out of hand.  I need some help. </p><p>My grandson finally getting used to using my daughter's computer.  I really shouldn't have that much trouble any longer.  This morning when the stock market started trading.  My Robinhood page didn't update and showing the durrent stock prices.  It went on for a while.  I googled if the market is on holiday.  It's not a holiday.  Then I tried to refresh the page, and nothing works.  I finally deleted the page and started a new page.  Then it worked.  This went on for about an hour.  It seriously disturbed me a great deal.  I chatted with Robinhood, and they said they didn't have any trouble with their internet.  I know it's time to ask help from Firefox.  It's google messing up with my account.  Can anyone tell me otherwise?  Please help. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1180;firefox-11801;,firefox,other,en-US,1613114;,shenjee888

I've had Dell and Geek Squad involved both before and after I found this guy's fix in the Mozilla faq's.  Before finding that I have had the new pc checked, the old and new monitor checked.  All turned out fine system wise.  So first suggestion from Dell - new cord - HDMI to VGA - didn't help.  New monitor.  Didn't help.  Finally after much purchasing of technology and no changes a Dell tech was on using Edge browser.  I realized that the monitor was perfect and told them so.  So they tried Chrome and still the monitor text was fine.  Firefox - back to blotchy.  That's when I did the search in Mozilla faq's and found this other issue and ""fix"".  I talked a Geek Squad tech into changing my display setting to  ""Extend Display"" in Windows.  Text totally disappeared from the monitor.  So I've run out of options other than to set up everything under Chrome or Edge which I really don't want to do.  But I may have to.
