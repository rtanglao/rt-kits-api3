The fact that I am able to even ask you this question must mean that I do. I have been using Firefox and Thunderbird for years and never new that it / they needed or came with an account.  So I apparently have an account. Now what? What can or should I do with it?

I tried again a few times and it still said it was wrong. So I tried resetting the password using my recovery code, but it also says my recovery codes are wrong. I have never used my recovery codes on this account, what can I do? I don't want to lose my bookmarks and this account has all my passwords on it. I have the account tied to my google acc, but I don't have that sign in option on my other browser.
