I have a new Dell pc and my Mozilla browser is 118.   I have had this issue from the time that I purchased the new pc and attached it to my old Dell monitor.  I've had Dell and Geek Squad involved both before and after I found this guy's fix in the Mozilla faq's.  Before finding that I have had the new pc checked, the old and new monitor checked.  All turned out fine system wise.  So first suggestion from Dell - new cord - HDMI to VGA - didn't help.  New monitor.  Didn't help.  Finally after much purchasing of technology and no changes a Dell tech was on using Edge browser.  I realized that the monitor was perfect and told them so.  So they tried Chrome and still the monitor text was fine.  Firefox - back to blotchy.  That's when I did the search in Mozilla faq's and found this other issue and ""fix"".  I talked a Geek Squad tech into changing my display setting to  ""Extend Display"" in Windows.  Text totally disappeared from the monitor.  So I've run out of options other than to set up everything under Chrome or Edge which I really don't want to do.  But I may have to.  In the meantime I've proved that I didn't need a new monitor or a new cord. </p><p>The image below is a camera picture of text on the monitor. </p><p>Help!!! </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1180;firefox-11802;,firefox,other,en-US,1613045;1613046;,starshipraleigh
