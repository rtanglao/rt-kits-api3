Have been using Mozilla for years on a Surface laptop (windows 11), Cyberpower desktop (windows 10), and Android Note 20.  I've downloaded Thunderbird and it is working fine.  Where can I find user training videos for Thundbird, especially archiving?  Are there other ways besides on-line gifting in which I can contribute to the research that makes Mozilla and Thunderbird possible?  Thank you. </p>",desktop;tips;windows-11;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",wbrawlings

Using sites like <a href=""https://www.whatismyip.com/proxy-check"" rel=""nofollow"">whatismyip</a> and <a href=""https://whatismyipaddress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">whatismyipaddress</a>, I am seeing that I have a VPN or Proxy enabled. When I use Chrome, I don't see this. I went through all the settings and turned off anything that could even remotely be related, and still get the same results. Does Firefox have a built in VPN that I am unaware of? Is there a way to turn it off? </p>",desktop;beta;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1200;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1618905;1618909;,mlfusco97

Everything works well except for one minor irritation that might be just a setting - but I can't find it! The mail is set to show in ascending date order and is unthreaded and in table format, if I scroll to the most recent mail at the bottom of the list it displays fine. However, I have 11 mailboxes and if I switch between them, although the mail is still in ascending order, the mail selected is not the last on the list, in fact it could be hundreds of emails earlier than the last one.  I have set each mailbox to show in ascending order and there are no extensions installed.  Having to scroll to the end of each mailbox as I switch between them every time is a time waster.  Just a guess, is there an index to the selected position in the table that isn't being preserved as mailboxes are switched?  It would be nice if the most recently received mail was always selected when the mailbox is opened. </p><p>Brian. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,other,en-US,"",brian310
