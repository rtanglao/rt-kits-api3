However one of them I use very rarely, maybe once in 2-3 months the other one i use almost daily. Therefore I have saved both logins in Firefox and I can see them in my passwords.  </p><p>The problem is that whenever I try to access the website, Firefox auto-fills the ""second"" account, the one i only use rarely. What this means is that instead of me being able to just press login i have to delete the username filled in by Firefox and select the other one.  So what i would like to do is to maybe tell Mozilla that I want it to use the other account for auto-fill. </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1153;firefox-11531;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",damin1969

There are three specific windows of the lost windows that had data I was actively using and don't want to lose. The URLs would be enough. I was also using the other windows, but I can re-find that information easily enough. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,other,en-US,"",seandbreslin

By playing around with it, I've found that it's still functioning, but it ceases to update visually. I'm not having the same issues with any other program on my PC, I don't see the icon to update Firefox, and I've restarted my PC a few times along the way. </p><p>When this happens, it's not just website contents that freeze, but Firefox's UI as well. Hovering a tab doesn't highlight it. Clicking the hamburger doesn't appear to open the menu. Etc... </p><p>If I have a video playing when this happens, I will continue to hear it, but the frame the video is on stays in place. </p><p>If I click on another open tab, it will still show me the tab it visually froze on, but if I end Firefox with Windows Task Manager &amp; reopen it, the session saves the tab switch, so it's still taking mouse inputs. I've been able to do similar with keyboard inputs by clicking on the address bar and entering a new URL. I don't see anything as I type it, but after using Task Manager to close and reopen Firefox, the site I entered is there. </p><p>I can switch between open Firefox windows when this happens without issue, even on the same monitor, and if I pull up something else in front of Firefox and then switch to Firefox it will still display what was last visible in that Firefox window while the bug is occurring. </p><p>I have tried disabling add-ons, and actually found that disabling some of them made it happen *more* frequently, not less. Privacy Badger, Auto Tab Discard, &amp; Ad Nauseum specifically. Switching from Ad Nauseum to AdBlock Plus or uBlock Origin neither increases nor decreases the frequency. My other add-ons, like Duplicate Tabs Closer, haven't had any effects on frequency that I can see. With all of my Add-ons disabled, Task Manager shows double the number of Firefox processes. </p><p>I tried to clear my history, but I can only select my last 1 hour of history, as clicking on the dropdown box to select another duration will cause the problem to occur &amp; I can't see the other options in the box to select a longer option. The dropdown to select a topic for this question has the same issue. </p><p>These are some actions that risk causing the bug to start, but aren't 100% reproducible, and the list is not exhaustive: </p> <ul><li> Trying to click &amp; drag to pull a tab into becoming its own window or to move the tab into another window. (Firefox does not save this movement if it causes the bug, so closing and reopening it will keep the tab in the window it was already in.) This seems to work fine for some sites, but specifically tends to break if it's a YouTube tab. </li><li> Mid-clicking to open a link in a new tab, if done on several links in a row </li><li> Clicking on a UI element, like the hamburger button </li><li> Right clicking on an image and selecting ""copy"" </li><li> Right clicking within Firefox </li><li> Opening Firefox </li></ul> <p>I have not seen the bug occur at any time that I was not actively providing some input to the Firefox program. </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-11;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,cookies,en-US,"",seandbreslin

I have no patience for this kind of bullshit, especially when everything always worked before this started happening. Typically it's about five stories out of the twenty-five or so offerings on the page but I'm sick of messing around with it, having to close the tab, go to something else and hope IT doesn't break!
