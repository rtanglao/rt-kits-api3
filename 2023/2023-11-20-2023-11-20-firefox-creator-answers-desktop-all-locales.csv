I have tried a lot of things and none of them work,"<p>Hello,  I have been a diehard Firefox user since it was still in Beta.  I have been using computers personally since 1994 and professionally since 2004, doing Windows and Linux systems administration.  I can and will do whatever (within limits) you need me to do to troubleshoot and resolve this issue, which is otherwise going to cause me to abandon this otherwise excellent browser, perhaps forever.  The <strong>browser.cache.disk.capacity</strong> seems to work, but <strong>browser.cache.memory.capacity</strong> does not. </p><p>Why does firefox not respect the assigned values for browser memory cache (<strong>browser.cache.memory.capacity</strong>)? Is there anything I can do to limit the memory and processor usage of Firefox and its child processes? Is extension CPU/memory usage constrained by the application values? Is there a way to determine and/or limit the resource usage of extensions? </p><p><a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/UYBM0oX"" rel=""nofollow"">I have included a number of screenshots documenting its behavior</a> and generated an<strong> about:memory </strong>report during ""normal use"".  After configuring a number of system variables, I then attempted to determine its resource usage under heavy load. </p><p>Open the browser with a couple 2, 3 tabs: ~1GB memory usage Use the browser as ""normal"" (dozens tabs): ~2GB memory usage Open 100+ tabs from history: The CPU and memory resource usage increases until it consumes all available system resources despite configured values.  After killing and restarting the process, the tabs have invisible titles in the extension and browser, and must be closed using Ctrl+W until only a few remain after which the browser can be used normally and again consumes ~1GB. </p><p>While I understand ""just don't open so many tabs"", under some circumstances such as poorly written websites, bugs, etc, <em>even single sites may attempt to claim excessive resources</em>.  I sometimes run VMs and such on this machine and in order to retain a responsive system, cannot have applications consuming all of the available resources.  I have found one proposed solution that <a href=""https://superuser.com/posts/1771172/revisions"" rel=""nofollow"">uses an external application</a>, is this the only way? </p><p>I am open to allowing Firefox to utilize more of the SSD storage (the 1GB limit was imposed for testing) and would be fine with increased slowness due to disk cache or refetching internetworked resources.  However, none of the settings I have changed or attempts I have made appear to be able to limit the memory usage in any way.  Additional included screenshots are linked above instead of as attachments due to number.  I can share or generate additional reports to assist in troubleshooting. </p><p>Thank you!

By playing around with it, I've found that it's still functioning, but it ceases to update visually. I'm not having the same issues with any other program on my PC, I don't see the icon to update Firefox, and I've restarted my PC a few times along the way. </p><p>When this happens, it's not just website contents that freeze, but Firefox's UI as well. Hovering a tab doesn't highlight it. Clicking the hamburger doesn't appear to open the menu. Etc... </p><p>If I have a video playing when this happens, I will continue to hear it, but the frame the video is on stays in place. </p><p>If I click on another open tab, it will still show me the tab it visually froze on, but if I end Firefox with Windows Task Manager &amp; reopen it, the session saves the tab switch, so it's still taking mouse inputs. I've been able to do similar with keyboard inputs by clicking on the address bar and entering a new URL. I don't see anything as I type it, but after using Task Manager to close and reopen Firefox, the site I entered is there. </p><p>I can switch between open Firefox windows when this happens without issue, even on the same monitor, and if I pull up something else in front of Firefox and then switch to Firefox it will still display what was last visible in that Firefox window while the bug is occurring. </p><p>I have tried disabling add-ons, and actually found that disabling some of them made it happen *more* frequently, not less. Privacy Badger, Auto Tab Discard, &amp; Ad Nauseum specifically. Switching from Ad Nauseum to AdBlock Plus or uBlock Origin neither increases nor decreases the frequency. My other add-ons, like Duplicate Tabs Closer, haven't had any effects on frequency that I can see. With all of my Add-ons disabled, Task Manager shows double the number of Firefox processes. </p><p>I tried to clear my history, but I can only select my last 1 hour of history, as clicking on the dropdown box to select another duration will cause the problem to occur &amp; I can't see the other options in the box to select a longer option.

(Firefox does not save this movement if it causes the bug, so closing and reopening it will keep the tab in the window it was already in.) This seems to work fine for some sites, but specifically tends to break if it's a YouTube tab. </li><li> Mid-clicking to open a link in a new tab, if done on several links in a row </li><li> Clicking on a UI element, like the hamburger button </li><li> Right clicking on an image and selecting ""copy"" </li><li> Right clicking within Firefox </li><li> Opening Firefox </li></ul> <p>I have not seen the bug occur at any time that I was not actively providing some input to the Firefox program. </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-11;firefox-1190;firefox-11901;,firefox,cookies,en-US,1618938;,seandbreslin
