In a nutshell, to be able to log on and use the extension, I needed to install the app on my phone as well and sync between laptop and phone did the rest. This solved the login issue however, there is no icon on the toolbar for the extension and if I want to use the Password Manager, I have to do it on my phone.  </p><p>Any ideas on how this could be solved? I have reinstalled the extension numerous times, tried troubleshooting mode as well but that is not useful with add-ons.. </p><p>Thanks S </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,customize,en-US,1583204;,lsdigiti

I checked to see if the same happened with Vimeo videos and it did. I'm running W10.  </p><pre>   Interestingly, the pop-up thumbnails one gets when hovering over the timeline as not affected; they look fine.    One post by someone else was answered that it was a GPU driver issue; another said it's only with HD videos.    I'm a B&amp;W photographer and would really like to get back to normal again.
