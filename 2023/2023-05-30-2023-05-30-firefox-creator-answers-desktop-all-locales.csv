It works only in troubleshoot mode and not in normal. I tried refreshing and reinstalling the app, installing Firefox for Web and nothing worked. Cleaning data and turning ""false"" preference <em>media.wmf.vp9.enabled</em> didn't work either. I also tried deleting all extensions, turning off recommended performance mode (using hardware) and enabling default theme. I haven't installed anything recently. Last Windows quality update 24.05.2023, last feature update 08.03.2023. Firefox app still works perfectly on my phone, so it's probably something with the computer. What can be the cause and what can I do to fix it? Added info about crashes below </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Karina_W

We've got a process which I've followed once before and been fine.  But this time, after I install the certificate, Firefox gives me a ""SEC_ERROR_CERT_NOT_IN_NAME_SPACE"" error.    The only other Browser we have on our system is IE.  When I entered the url of the Vsphere server, in IE - it did give me the Vsphere login screen OK.  When I clicked on the padlock in the address bar, the new certificate was there, complete with its chain (Root CA and intermediate) and the dates were as expected. So it look like the PKI cert install has worked.  However, I need it to work in Firefox.  I'm a bit out of ideas.   I did find this post: </p><p><a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/188914/certifying-authority-for-this-certificate-is-not-permitted-to-issue-a-certificat"" rel=""nofollow"">https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/188914/certifying-authority-for-this-certificate-is-not-permitted-to-issue-a-certificat</a> </p><p>But when I checked the Permitted name constraints of our intermediate CA, the expected domain was in there, so I assumed that wasn't the issue (if I've understood this correctly). Any thoughts would be much appreciated. Thanks. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",howes_phil

At the moment there is no arrow, the Reply box stays grey and nothing happens if I click the mouse button. Eventually though after about two minutes the action is done. This is happening with any command in Firefox, e.g. trying to delete text in a draft message or trying to open an email in my inbox etc. etc. - all of it is the same as above and takes about two minutes to happen. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1583214;,cakeseed55
