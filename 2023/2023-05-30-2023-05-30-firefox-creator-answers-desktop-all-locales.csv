I have researched the issue as I can. It is not my Windows night light; my drivers and PC are apparently all updated; everything is working fine. I checked to see if the same happened with Vimeo videos and it did. I'm running W10.  </p><pre>   Interestingly, the pop-up thumbnails one gets when hovering over the timeline as not affected; they look fine.    One post by someone else was answered that it was a GPU driver issue; another said it's only with HD videos.    I'm a B&amp;W photographer and would really like to get back to normal again.     Any ideas? </pre>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,other,en-US,"",philipu39
