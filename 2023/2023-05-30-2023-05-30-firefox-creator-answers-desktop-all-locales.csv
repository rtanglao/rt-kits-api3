Except this isn’t my work PC, so I should be seeing this type of prompt. When I’ve googled this, it appears to be AVAST anti-virus, and people suggest deleting the policy register. I’ve checked my registry and can’t find such a policy. </p><p>2) I’m getting issues logging into iCloud saying that Firefox doesn’t support physical security keys? </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,other,en-US,1583186;,broomwalker

There does not seem to be a way to tell the browser to ignore the security requirement for all pages in this website. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1583183;,RonStein

I have researched the issue as I can. It is not my Windows night light; my drivers and PC are apparently all updated; everything is working fine. I checked to see if the same happened with Vimeo videos and it did. I'm running W10.  </p><pre>   Interestingly, the pop-up thumbnails one gets when hovering over the timeline as not affected; they look fine.    One post by someone else was answered that it was a GPU driver issue; another said it's only with HD videos.    I'm a B&amp;W photographer and would really like to get back to normal again.     Any ideas? </pre>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,other,en-US,"",philipu39
