Despite the lack of passwords, I can still see the tabs from other devices. Occasionally, when on the password page, I get a bar across the top asking me to log in with my password, but when I click on the 'Log In' button, nothing happens and the bar eventually disappears. This is despite already being logged in. Perhaps related, I can't set a primary password for my account. As far as I'm aware, I don't have one, and trying to set one tells me that it failed to change. I also occasionally get pop-up windows with something like ""Security Center"" asking me to create a new password, but even if I put in a password, this fails as well. </p>",desktop;sync;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",ng
