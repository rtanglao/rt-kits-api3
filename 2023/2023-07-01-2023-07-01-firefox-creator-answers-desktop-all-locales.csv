But for the life of me I cannot take out the extension icons from the little jigsaw puzzle. For instance, I'd really like Ublock Origin to be right on the toolbar and not click through the jigsaw icon.  I tried setting <em>extensions.unifiedExtensions.enabled</em> flag to false but it did nothing. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1140;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",szemawy

When I changed from my last browser I transferred all my passwords from Opera and Chrome. I can now see my saved passwords on my Windows devices and my iOS phone, but not on my Apple laptop.  I use the same account and password across all four devices, but my laptop is the only one which doesn't show my passwords. I've tried re-syncing it, logging out and back in, and nothing has worked. Despite the lack of passwords, I can still see the tabs from other devices. Occasionally, when on the password page, I get a bar across the top asking me to log in with my password, but when I click on the 'Log In' button, nothing happens and the bar eventually disappears. This is despite already being logged in. Perhaps related, I can't set a primary password for my account. As far as I'm aware, I don't have one, and trying to set one tells me that it failed to change. I also occasionally get pop-up windows with something like ""Security Center"" asking me to create a new password, but even if I put in a password, this fails as well. </p>",desktop;sync;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",ng

Unfortunately as usual tech people don't know how to talk to ordinary people. So I'm stuck with losing many years of bookmarks etc. Because fire fox which normally crashes at least every month or two now crashes so badly it won't start up even after I sent a report. So I installed the newest version thinking that I could believe people on this site when they say, ""oh yes your bookmarks and everything else will be there. Well they aren't. </p><p>I even what is the profiles folder of course there is an any message there about which one is the default of the new installation. Plus nobody here makes it clear on what I'm supposed to copy over toward folder. I made a new profile folder, but so worth it no information on what I'm supposed to do with it. </p><p>Plus I keep hearing that there's really no security when browsing unless I have a third-party VPN which I now have. </p><p>That's for help before on numerous occasions and got a little to no help. I thought I would try one more time. </p><p>I need a good browser because I am a disabled veteran who needs to be securely connected to the Internet. So it looks like I have to go somewhere else. Again I don't expect any help after how I've been treated here in this supposed help community.  Have a good Fourth of July.

I've taken the following actions: Restarted the app, refreshed then reset the app, ran troubleshooter mode, uninstalled then reinstalled the app, re-booted my PC and shut down-rebooted my PC, disabled all protections in Bitdefender(firewall, ransom, etc), ran a full anti-virus scan, checked Chrome and Edge(they work fine), created a 2nd profile but no change.

I've expanded the number of rows displayed which as an odd history of my browsing, yet the latest links I've visited are not there - meaning the link to the location I would like to pin.   Seriously, the entries in the rows (other than previously pinned links) is a hodgepodge.  It might be useful if there was some evident logic to the items included.   It is disappointing the number of times this question has been posed and the ""answer"" is to display more rows.    Similarly disappointing - an old knowledge base article that says to click the 3 dot icon next to address bar for Firefox on android - would have been handy had such a control appeared in the latest version of Firefox I'm running on my Mac. </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,customize,en-US,1588009;1588042;,roaming_bob

I've had a couple big crashes now on Firefox where my session doesn't restore and because I have hundreds of tabs open at any given time I always back them up manually from sessionstore in the folder system. The problem is the session store files always reflect my most recent session- the one that doesn't have anything in it. The older sessions like ""previous"" and ""upgrade"" are always weeks old.  </p><p>Is there a way to save data more frequently into the session store backup folder, or to increase the number of recovery files available to reach back to older sessions?
