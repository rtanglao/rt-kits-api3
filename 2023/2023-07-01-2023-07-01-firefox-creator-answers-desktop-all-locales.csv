I've taken the following actions: Restarted the app, refreshed then reset the app, ran troubleshooter mode, uninstalled then reinstalled the app, re-booted my PC and shut down-rebooted my PC, disabled all protections in Bitdefender(firewall, ransom, etc), ran a full anti-virus scan, checked Chrome and Edge(they work fine), created a 2nd profile but no change. My system consists of the following: ASUS Z390-a MB I5-9400 CPU 64GB of RAM 850W ATX PSU Intel 1TB SSD(OS) Windows 11 Pro I believe this problem started soon after I updated the BIOS on my ASUS MB. I'm not sure how that relates. Thanks for any help or suggestions. optimxr PS the message on the tab is ""GAH, Your Tab Just Crashed"" </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-11;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1588008;,bitsurge

I've expanded the number of rows displayed which as an odd history of my browsing, yet the latest links I've visited are not there - meaning the link to the location I would like to pin.   Seriously, the entries in the rows (other than previously pinned links) is a hodgepodge.  It might be useful if there was some evident logic to the items included.   It is disappointing the number of times this question has been posed and the ""answer"" is to display more rows.    Similarly disappointing - an old knowledge base article that says to click the 3 dot icon next to address bar for Firefox on android - would have been handy had such a control appeared in the latest version of Firefox I'm running on my Mac. </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,customize,en-US,1588009;,roaming_bob

They never finish loading. I've turned off ad blockers, DuckDuckGo, and a few other add-ons to see if they're the issue, adjusted multiple other settings (proxy, etc.) and it makes no difference. This is becoming an issue with multiple websites in Firefox in recent weeks. </p><p><br> Fix your browser. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1588010;1588034;,TheJoeGreene

I've had a couple big crashes now on Firefox where my session doesn't restore and because I have hundreds of tabs open at any given time I always back them up manually from sessionstore in the folder system. The problem is the session store files always reflect my most recent session- the one that doesn't have anything in it. The older sessions like ""previous"" and ""upgrade"" are always weeks old.  </p><p>Is there a way to save data more frequently into the session store backup folder, or to increase the number of recovery files available to reach back to older sessions? I'd like to count on a backup at least once a week that can't be overwritten by the current session loss. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1140;,firefox,sync,en-US,1588000;1588001;,andrewprivett
