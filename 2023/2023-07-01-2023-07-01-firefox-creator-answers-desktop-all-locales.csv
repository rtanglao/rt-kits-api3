I've had a couple big crashes now on Firefox where my session doesn't restore and because I have hundreds of tabs open at any given time I always back them up manually from sessionstore in the folder system. The problem is the session store files always reflect my most recent session- the one that doesn't have anything in it. The older sessions like ""previous"" and ""upgrade"" are always weeks old.  </p><p>Is there a way to save data more frequently into the session store backup folder, or to increase the number of recovery files available to reach back to older sessions? I'd like to count on a backup at least once a week that can't be overwritten by the current session loss. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1140;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",andrewprivett
