Usually any passwords auto generated by Firefox used uppercase, lowercase, and numbers - no symbols. As of very recently, all passwords being generated now include special characters. I didn't change this so I assume it came with an update.  </p><p>Ordinarily this would be fine, however the characters being inserted are often invalid ones and I've found a few websites unable to accept passwords including them, such as &lt; and&nbsp;: making the generated password useless. </p><p>Is there a way to customise how passwords are generated? I've looked through settings but can't see any way to adjust it. I'd prefer to remove special characters completely. Thanks! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1150;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",sam.osullivan

Then today, the browser was refreshed updated (I dont know what the exact term is) but since the new browser I have lost all of my history, my saved websites, my extensions etc etc etc . I was under the impression that these can be retrieved, can they as I would really like to be able to reload all of my extensions, but this doesnt seem possible now. Can you advise, why this occured and how I can retrieve the lost information? Thankyou </p><p><br> </p><p><br> </p><p><br> /edit: moved thread from Firefox for iOS (for iPhone/iPad) to Firefox section since you mentioned Extensions and there are no extensions for Firefox on iOS. </p>",bookmarks;macos;,firefox,use-extensions-and-add-ons,en-US,1590063;,timrogers2206

I'm not very computer literate but I have checked settings within firefox and don't see where it might be blocked. Next I imagine you might ask for a screenshot of the website and i do have one but all it shows is after I enter my password, it displays an ""OK"" small screen and does not login. Do you have any suggestions for Firefox is my favorite browser but I have to use another lately to check the website I have a problem with and only on Firefox. My 5 other browsers can log me in to the website. Thanks for your time and suggestions. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1150;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",firefighter1tx

However, I've notice that many files, especially videos, while they download at normal speed, can take over 10 minutes to actually START downloading. It also seems to vary based on whether I'm downloading from a download link, a page like mediafire, using ""save video as"", etc. It will just stay on the screen, with the little dot on its' tab going back and forth. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1150;firefox-11501;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",goldbergl1
