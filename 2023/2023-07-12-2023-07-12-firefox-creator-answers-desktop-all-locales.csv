It might be Nginx related but it does not effect Chrome at all which is why I've started this ticket. </p><p>Any help in debugging this would be greatly appreciated. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1140;firefox-11402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1590048;,brendan8

I'm not very computer literate but I have checked settings within firefox and don't see where it might be blocked. Next I imagine you might ask for a screenshot of the website and i do have one but all it shows is after I enter my password, it displays an ""OK"" small screen and does not login. Do you have any suggestions for Firefox is my favorite browser but I have to use another lately to check the website I have a problem with and only on Firefox. My 5 other browsers can log me in to the website. Thanks for your time and suggestions. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1150;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",firefighter1tx

However, I've notice that many files, especially videos, while they download at normal speed, can take over 10 minutes to actually START downloading. It also seems to vary based on whether I'm downloading from a download link, a page like mediafire, using ""save video as"", etc. It will just stay on the screen, with the little dot on its' tab going back and forth. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1150;firefox-11501;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",goldbergl1
