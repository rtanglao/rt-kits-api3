Usually any passwords auto generated by Firefox used uppercase, lowercase, and numbers - no symbols. As of very recently, all passwords being generated now include special characters. I didn't change this so I assume it came with an update.  </p><p>Ordinarily this would be fine, however the characters being inserted are often invalid ones and I've found a few websites unable to accept passwords including them, such as &lt; and&nbsp;: making the generated password useless. </p><p>Is there a way to customise how passwords are generated? I've looked through settings but can't see any way to adjust it. I'd prefer to remove special characters completely.

Do you have any suggestions for Firefox is my favorite browser but I have to use another lately to check the website I have a problem with and only on Firefox. My 5 other browsers can log me in to the website.
