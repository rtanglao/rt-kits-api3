However, I've notice that many files, especially videos, while they download at normal speed, can take over 10 minutes to actually START downloading. It also seems to vary based on whether I'm downloading from a download link, a page like mediafire, using ""save video as"", etc. It will just stay on the screen, with the little dot on its' tab going back and forth. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1150;firefox-11501;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",goldbergl1
