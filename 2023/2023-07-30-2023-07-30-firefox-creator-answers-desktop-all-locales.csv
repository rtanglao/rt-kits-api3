How difficult can it be to give me my free choice of my new tab url without using an unnecessary plugin / extension. Why do I need to fight to keep you guys from taking property rights on my 'New Tab Url' You came forward ....that the new tab came under attack from malware therefore we cant use custom new tab from ver 41. Well this is BS if I can set custom Home Page why not New Tab....It is the same security risk! Why is it so difficult to understand that when I open my browser and all other new tabs I want it to be my Home Page. Give me the option to set my home page and new tab as the same address.

I think I clicked that I didn't want it.  After using Firefox for a little while, a McAfee pop up appeared about being on a dangerous site.

I searched through my apps and found a McAfee Webmaster app and uninstalled it.  I have inadvertently had McAfee added on other computers and have had nothing but problems with it.

Now, I signed out of many of them and I am down to about 15 -- mostly because I am a little confused about how FF Accts determines what to sync and when I start Sync are all of them brought back?  Even from 6+ months ago?  The one's that were years old I signed out of and deleted but still ... and so, since I use FF for testing and I thought that there shouldn't be that much in each 'sync' test device ... it is sort of confusing... </p><p>So, is there a way to use FF Accts 'sync' to get my data to a new device without making a new 'synced' device? </p><p>Thx/Bill  </p><p>PS - in the FF past releases I got what I wanted by just copying the .mozilla directory to the new system but that broke a few releases ago&nbsp;:P  too bad stuff has to change&nbsp;:(  </p><p>Also, please understand that I am on Android, iOS, MacOS, and Linux daily so trying to 'gather' what I am submitting this question on will not lend itself to trying to solve my insanity &gt;&lt;  Sorry! </p><p>PPS - I have not tried the first solution offered in the old question yet...
