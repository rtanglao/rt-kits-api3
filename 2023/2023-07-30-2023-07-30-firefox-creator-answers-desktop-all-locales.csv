This composition box is a prime example.  30 years ago when my eyes were 30 years younger web sites tended to use BLACK TEXT on WHITE BACKGROUNDS, with fairly THICK FONTS.   </p><p>Over the last 5 to 10 years websites and/or browsers have adopted much the terrible Apple Style used in its packaging:  Light Gray Text on Lighter Gray Backgrounds *and* very Thin Fonts.  Fortunately websites/browsers have not yet generally followed Apple's lead to the use of about 4 point fonts. </p><pre>    I'm using:          * Firefox Browser 115.0.3          * MacBook Pro 15""          * macOS Monterey  ver. 12.6.7 </pre> <p>How can I greatly increase the contrast and the density of text displayed by the Firefox Browser? </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1150;firefox-11503;,firefox,other,en-US,1593712;,tapanfil
