I have 2 different wifi sources here at my home, one of them is a DSL zyxel modem from century link &amp; the other is a Verizon internet gateway that runs off of cell towers. I recently logged into both of them to configure some of the settings etc. and in the past when i only had the DSL wifi, i would log into it via file explorer&gt;network&gt;network interface and then select the router &amp; would automatically be taken to the login page. For the verizon wifi, i had to go into the browser searchbar ,while being connected to that network,  and enter the default IP address of 192.168.0.1 and it would take me to the login page. I first logged into the DSL network and then for the first time ever, into the verizon one, and now when i try to login to the DSL network via my traditional method &amp; also by inputting its IP address into the searchbar (both routers have the same default address to access setup), it takes me to the verizon login page regardless if im connected to it or not. If i input the DSL modems IP address into Edge browser while connected to it, it takes me to the correct login page for that network which leads me to believe that somehow something is messed up with my firefox browser.

I suspect what is happening is that firefox thinks that I have alt down when the keyboard state is in third level.

Switching it to my original profile causes it to freeze on load again. This leads me to believe that it's something to do with my profile. Possibly a corrupt file? 2)There are no error reports that I can find. 3) I noticed there was a firefox update rolled out on the 14th.

I tend to keep a lot of windows open and navigate among them using the ""Window"" pulldown menu at the top between ""Tools"" and ""Help"". It used to be that the latest window more or less stayed at the bottom and the others stayed in order so they were easy to find quickly. A recent upgrade made it so the windows are now alphabetized and constantly shuffling. Since they are alphabetized by the name in the page title, this often offers no clue as to what it is--like it might be alphabetized under like cart or home page or main or something general like that. Also, if you have different tabs in a window, that window might jump from the top to the middle if a different tab is last looked at. Bottom line: it is very difficult and non-intuitive to find a page when you have a lot of windows open--but it used to be easy. Is there a way to order the wondows the way you want them or go back to the chronological order of before? Seems like there must be a setting somewhere.
