Non c'è nessun modo per filtrare le parole né usare i soliti sistemi Booleani. Se indico un nome preciso (ad esempio Tab Mix Plus) mi vengono presentati decine se non centinaia di proposte che contengono tutte  e tre le parole prese singolarmente. Non serve unirle con ' &amp; ' né racchiudere il tutto fra virgolette. Quindi il tutto diventa inservibile. Non si possono perdere decine di minuti per scorrere le varie proposte per poi trovare che quello che serve è obsoleto o inesistente. </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,other,it,1570823;1570827;,carlo6

My push notification from sites I allow started running through Windows notifications instead just popping up like normal. I read an article that said I could disable this feature through Windows Settings and the push notifications would start showing up like they used to. Unfortunately after I did this I stopped getting push notifications at all. Would have left it to go through Windows notification but it makes an annoying sound every time I got a notification and that got old fast. I just want push notifications back like they used to be. </p><p>I run Firefox on Windows 10. </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Isebas

Can only start in Safe Mode.,"<p>So yesterday, March 14th, we had a major snow storm which caused a power outage. When I finally got power back I now notice I can't open firefox without it just staying as a white screen (freeze). I can start it fine in safe more (hold shift and click on the icon). I just can't start it in normal mode. </p><p>My computer is using Windows 7. </p><p>What I've tried so far: 1) In safe mode I disabled every extension. Theme is already default. 2) Turned off hardware acceleration. 3) Cleared Startup Cache 4) Deleted Firefox from C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox and installed the latest version which seems to have installed it in C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox </p><p>Observations: 1) Changing the default user profile to a clean profile loads firefox fine. Switching it to my original profile causes it to freeze on load again. This leads me to believe that it's something to do with my profile. Possibly a corrupt file? 2)There are no error reports that I can find. 3) I noticed there was a firefox update rolled out on the 14th. Not sure if that has anything to do with this. </p><p>I've really like to not have to start a new profile. Is there anything else I can try? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1110;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",DeathfireD
1408132,2023-03-15 19:04:28 -0700,2023-03-15 19:04:28 -0700,"""Window"" top menu pulldown","<p>Hi. I am in Mac Big Sur and Firefox 108. I tend to keep a lot of windows open and navigate among them using the ""Window"" pulldown menu at the top between ""Tools"" and ""Help"". It used to be that the latest window more or less stayed at the bottom and the others stayed in order so they were easy to find quickly. A recent upgrade made it so the windows are now alphabetized and constantly shuffling. Since they are alphabetized by the name in the page title, this often offers no clue as to what it is--like it might be alphabetized under like cart or home page or main or something general like that. Also, if you have different tabs in a window, that window might jump from the top to the middle if a different tab is last looked at. Bottom line: it is very difficult and non-intuitive to find a page when you have a lot of windows open--but it used to be easy. Is there a way to order the wondows the way you want them or go back to the chronological order of before? Seems like there must be a setting somewhere. Thanks so much for any help. </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",greggms17
