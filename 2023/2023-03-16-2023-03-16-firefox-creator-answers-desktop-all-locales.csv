So I tried to open the ""Passwords"" tab on the firefox menu. It opened but there were zero logins and passwords there, while I had dozens before. </p><p>I searched on google and found very few problems like mine, mostly from old posts. The solution presented there had something to do with enabling e10s (multiple process support). I don't know what this is but I saw that multiple process was already enabled on my firefox and I didn't change anything recently. </p><p>There was a firefox update pending (haven't updated in months) so I did the update AFTER I had these problems. The update didn't solve anything apparently.  </p><p>Then I decided to reinstall firefox but first I wanted to backup some files (bookmarks, passwords, login, etc). This is when another issue appeared. I couldn't copy/paste some of these files. It said I needed a permission. But I'm the ""admin"" on this PC, only I use this computer, so I should have permissions to everything. I tried changing permissions on the properties/security tab of the file, but everything was already checked to ""allow"". The only thing that is not checked is ""special permissions"", but I can't change that. </p><p>So I thought maybe there is a process open ""holding"" these files so I restarted windows. After the restart, I still couldn't copy those files. Renaming the files also isn't allowed. Then I decided to come here and post about this problem, but didn't remember my login to this site. So I opened the ""passwords"" tab again and to my surprise everything was restored there. </p><p>So my main issue was solved, but I'm still trying to understand what happened. Why I couldn't see the logins and passwords before. And why I can't copy those files to create a backup. </p><p>A few extra information: I don't use firefox profile, so I don't sign and don't sync with anything. The most recent change to the computer was a windows update (1 or 2 days ago). I didn't change anything else in weeks. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1110;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",troublesandissues

I have 2 different wifi sources here at my home, one of them is a DSL zyxel modem from century link &amp; the other is a Verizon internet gateway that runs off of cell towers. I recently logged into both of them to configure some of the settings etc. and in the past when i only had the DSL wifi, i would log into it via file explorer&gt;network&gt;network interface and then select the router &amp; would automatically be taken to the login page. For the verizon wifi, i had to go into the browser searchbar ,while being connected to that network,  and enter the default IP address of 192.168.0.1 and it would take me to the login page. I first logged into the DSL network and then for the first time ever, into the verizon one, and now when i try to login to the DSL network via my traditional method &amp; also by inputting its IP address into the searchbar (both routers have the same default address to access setup), it takes me to the verizon login page regardless if im connected to it or not. If i input the DSL modems IP address into Edge browser while connected to it, it takes me to the correct login page for that network which leads me to believe that somehow something is messed up with my firefox browser. Ive already tried going into the saved passwords and deleting the saved verizon login info. Any other ideas as to what it could be?

I apologize if I write a lot and if I ask more than one question. I begin to tell you that I have firefox with ""update without User Controll in background"" and my only extensions are Ublock,Privacy Badger, HTTPS Everywhere and WOT and nothing else. Last night (around 1:00) I started my firefox (by clicking on the icon that doesn't have administrator permissions) and the window to install the updates appeared, initially I refused and went to Help --&gt; About Firefox and clicked there to restart. Once restarted, the window reappeared and I accepted by installing the updates So after I updated firefox it started with the main screen saying ""that I could now edit pdfs by opening them in firefox"". My question is: was it right to install them this way? After installing I thought that User Control actually never asks me for updates, I also checked Update History in the configurations and the 111.0 update ran on March 15th at 7:57pm (I had done it all around 1&nbsp;:00am at night on the 16th, is this normal?) What makes me worry is that after doing the update the internet was disconnected (not letting me connect to my router or smartphone hotspot. I restarted the pc and it had no more problems (say it's a coincidence and there am I thinking too much?) However I did scans with both Avira and Malwarebyte and finally with AdwCleaner which found nothing Surely I had hardly ever noticed it, but however I notice that in the task manager even having only one tab open in the browser I have more than 10 (11 or 12, I am attaching a screen) firefox processes, is this also normal? what advice can you give me? </p><p>I apologize for the very long message I wrote </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Cydin

I tend to keep a lot of windows open and navigate among them using the ""Window"" pulldown menu at the top between ""Tools"" and ""Help"". It used to be that the latest window more or less stayed at the bottom and the others stayed in order so they were easy to find quickly. A recent upgrade made it so the windows are now alphabetized and constantly shuffling. Since they are alphabetized by the name in the page title, this often offers no clue as to what it is--like it might be alphabetized under like cart or home page or main or something general like that. Also, if you have different tabs in a window, that window might jump from the top to the middle if a different tab is last looked at. Bottom line: it is very difficult and non-intuitive to find a page when you have a lot of windows open--but it used to be easy. Is there a way to order the wondows the way you want them or go back to the chronological order of before? Seems like there must be a setting somewhere. Thanks so much for any help. </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1080;firefox-10802;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",greggms17
