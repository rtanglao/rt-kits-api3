I apologize if I write a lot and if I ask more than one question. I begin to tell you that I have firefox with ""update without User Controll in background"" and my only extensions are Ublock,Privacy Badger, HTTPS Everywhere and WOT and nothing else. Last night (around 1:00) I started my firefox (by clicking on the icon that doesn't have administrator permissions) and the window to install the updates appeared, initially I refused and went to Help --&gt; About Firefox and clicked there to restart. Once restarted, the window reappeared and I accepted by installing the updates So after I updated firefox it started with the main screen saying ""that I could now edit pdfs by opening them in firefox"". My question is: was it right to install them this way? After installing I thought that User Control actually never asks me for updates, I also checked Update History in the configurations and the 111.0 update ran on March 15th at 7:57pm (I had done it all around 1&nbsp;:00am at night on the 16th, is this normal?) What makes me worry is that after doing the update the internet was disconnected (not letting me connect to my router or smartphone hotspot. I restarted the pc and it had no more problems (say it's a coincidence and there am I thinking too much?) However I did scans with both Avira and Malwarebyte and finally with AdwCleaner which found nothing Surely I had hardly ever noticed it, but however I notice that in the task manager even having only one tab open in the browser I have more than 10 (11 or 12, I am attaching a screen) firefox processes, is this also normal? what advice can you give me? </p><p>I apologize for the very long message I wrote </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Cydin

I tend to keep a lot of windows open and navigate among them using the ""Window"" pulldown menu at the top between ""Tools"" and ""Help"". It used to be that the latest window more or less stayed at the bottom and the others stayed in order so they were easy to find quickly. A recent upgrade made it so the windows are now alphabetized and constantly shuffling. Since they are alphabetized by the name in the page title, this often offers no clue as to what it is--like it might be alphabetized under like cart or home page or main or something general like that. Also, if you have different tabs in a window, that window might jump from the top to the middle if a different tab is last looked at. Bottom line: it is very difficult and non-intuitive to find a page when you have a lot of windows open--but it used to be easy. Is there a way to order the wondows the way you want them or go back to the chronological order of before? Seems like there must be a setting somewhere.
