I did this and have had problems ever since. GMail: Connecting to gmail is a hit or miss affair - it mostly does not work at all but on rare occasions it does connect. If it does load it is very slow, often I cannot change tabs or access labels. I cannot switch inboxes to other accounts. I mostly cannot send emails (though very occasionally I can). When trying to switch accounts it mostly just says something went wrong but once or twice it has brought up the list of accounts but I cannot select one. I can rarely send an email - it is very slow, it says working but mostly nothing happens. Sometimes an Oops 01 error message appears. I have not been able to attach a file to any email I have tried to send. I am seem to be receiving emails without issue. [Gmail mostly works on Chrome but sometimes I have trouble sending]. </p><p>Google Search: When I use Google as a search engine I often get only a white screen but it will sometimes bring up a screen of search results however when I click on the link either nothing happens or it is really slow to load the page - once the page loads navigating around the site is normal. </p><p>I have no issues when using Duck Duck Go or if I type the address into the address bar or it is a book marked site. </p><p>YouTube: I can rarely connect to Youtube using Firefox - it mostly just sits at a white screen with the address in the address bar but nothing happening. If it does connect it is incredibly slow at searching or changing screens. I often get a message saying I am not connected to the internet but I am because I have other things open and operating. </p><p>Google docs: I cannot access google docs using Firefox but can using Chrome. </p><p>I have no issues with online gaming or streaming sites.

I've tried checking my antivirus software, and I've tried checking for files that can reportedly keep the browser from running, none of which I have on the PC.
