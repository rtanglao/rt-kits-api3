I sell the occasional bits on Etsy and Ebay. I had found the perfect tool to edit my photos on Chrome. Now this has gone haywire because I am forced into using Edge, which does not give me anything like the editing choices I have on Chrome. I have followed all the directions given by Microsoft to get off Edge and back into Chrome but they have all failed miserably, so I am trapped in Edge and all my efforts are turning into Groundhog Day&nbsp;! Also if I return to Firefox, what will happen to all my photos, and the folders they are kept in&nbsp;? As an 86 year old, I need clear, concise directions on how I can restore everything I need to be able to return to a browser I was completely comfortable with.
