A lot of the time i want to have multiple windows open and play a tv show or movie in the browser windows while I perform other tasks in other applications. But I would like the tv show or movie to use the entire screen of the browser window as if it was in fullscreen mode but limited to only the size of the browser window and not the entire display device. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",dgrim67

I had no problems until ver. 115 was installed. Now I get The authentication required message. I'm using Comcast as my provider. I have looked at this problem in earlier versions, but following the suggestions hasn't helped. I've checked that all the email addresses are correct. I have 3 Comcast email addresses I use and I have set the Outgoing Server to match each email address.
