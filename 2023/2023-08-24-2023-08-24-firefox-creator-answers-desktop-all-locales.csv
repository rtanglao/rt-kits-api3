I can get the webpage to load instantly if I simply open a different browser (Chrome or Edge). Once the other browser opens, the web page will load instantly in Firefox. I can close the other browser and Firefox will function normally. This will reoccur multiple times throughout the day for, seemingly, no reason. </p><p>I have never experienced this with other browsers, I can use them all day without any hiccups/slow downs. it does not relate to any specific web page or time period. It can happen at any time on any website. </p><p>Firefox wont load a webpage unless I open a different browser. As soon as the other browser pops up on my screen the webpages in Firefox will suddenly load. If I don't open another browser, Firefox will suddenly load the webpage(s) but it will sit for multiple minutes before they suddenly load. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1160;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1599644;,yellowline35

Never had a problem until the last year or so when printing reservation confirmation emails from Southwest Airline, Princess Cruise line, and the Open Table service.  Firefox cannot print these elaborate and colorful emails, instead will preview and print only blank pages with a one line header.  At first, I blamed my printers. I disposed of 1 old HP printer and returned 1 new HP printer but that did nothing.  A new Canon printer has the same fault. </p><p>A solution was found when I successfully printed the latest fancy email by changing the browser.. It felt great to see the complete email using the Safari browser on my MacBook Air.  On my WIN 11 PC, eMails print complete using the Edge browser instead of Firefox. </p><p>So, my dumb question is how can I fix the Firefox browser? </p>",desktop;other;firefox-1160;,firefox,other,en-US,"",mtclasen
