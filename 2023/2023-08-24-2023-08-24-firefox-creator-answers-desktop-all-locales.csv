I checked gmail and i saw that the edits i made, especially the text was gone, just a few remained for some reason. Today I edited another pdf file and when I opened it on chrome to see if the problem was still there, it was. More than half of the edits i made on the file were gone. I don't understand why only some parts stay but the rest disappears, is there a way to fix this? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1160;,firefox,other,en-US,1599611;,kereste123kereste

Since a little more than 24hrs ago I can no longer use correctly a website that I always am interracting with.  I can log on it but when I click on their launch button there is somewhat of a screen flash and nothing is happening. I have no such problems when I use another browser!  Another useful information is that I had a Firefox update 1 or 2 days before the problem started </p><p>Also, on another site (<a href=""http://Kijiji.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">Kijiji.ca</a>) after filling in my email and password I click to log in but nothing happens as well besides both my password and email disappearing. The site is working perfectly on another browser as well.  This one has been going on for a number of months. </p><p>Both sites are https:// sites. </p><p>I believe the problem is with Firefox unfortunately as the other browser on my desktop computer have no such problems with those sites. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1160;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",Z0mbieknight
