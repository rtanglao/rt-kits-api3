A lot of the time i want to have multiple windows open and play a tv show or movie in the browser windows while I perform other tasks in other applications. But I would like the tv show or movie to use the entire screen of the browser window as if it was in fullscreen mode but limited to only the size of the browser window and not the entire display device. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1160;firefox-11603;,firefox,customize,en-US,1599552;,dgrim67
