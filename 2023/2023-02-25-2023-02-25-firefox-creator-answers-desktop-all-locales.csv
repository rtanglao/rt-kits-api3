My favorites, passwords, DuckDuckgo, background, and everything. I thought that once I signed into Firefox again all these saved items would come back but nothing has. It's like someone pushed a button and changed my world using all the products that you offer. I don't know how to retrieve these needed items and I'm hoping hard you can return my Mozilla world to me. I don't really understand how this could have happened but I'm hoping it wasn't something I did. I can't give you any hints that might explain how something like this could happen. When I tried to sign into firefox Microsoft Edge offered to provide the password but I don't want to go near their products. It seems when you go that way Microsoft will add a dozen things I don't want. I'd like to thank you for any and all help you can provide to me. Also thanks for your time.

Trying to make my PC basically run on your products and leave MSN out of as many places that I can on my PC.,"<p>It seems every time I allow windows update it changes the way I access things and makes changes in areas I don't want changes made or adds things I don't need. On this question, I would like to know how to access my pictures and then print them. On one of the latest updates from MSN when I go to look at a saved picture I can only see them in MSN ""Paint"". I just want to simply view my pictures and not change them. I want to then print them in the fastest and most uncomplicated way that I can. I'm currently dealing with a way just to see the pictures that I've saved using Firefox and DuckDuckgo search. At one time when Internet Explorer was being used, I just saved a picture and then accessed the folder in which I placed them, and then just simply printed them. Please advise me on how I can use your products to get back to the simplest way possible. I also use Onedrive and I'm going to delete it. It just is something I find gets in the way. I like simple no hassle products to replace the way MSN wants me to do things. I tried in the past to eliminate it and then I couldn't find some saved items in the documents, download, and picture storage area. Turns out they were placed in the recycle bin. I have no idea why they just could stay in the files I placed them in rather than send them to recycle. I know this is long and I'm sorry for that. I hope what I've written in this question makes sense. I have another question but I'll save it for another email to the staff. Thank you very much for any help or advise you can provide. I do value your time and help. Sincerely, Robert Auerbach </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,customize,en-US,1567427;,colleenandrob
