They are apparently two different locations according to the website. I must add, these locations are from a dropdown menu so I cannot change them. I emailed motogp and their tech people reckon either my browser (Firefox) or my internet provider (Sky) could be having a conflict with the payment platform. What do you think?

I like simple no hassle products to replace the way MSN wants me to do things. I tried in the past to eliminate it and then I couldn't find some saved items in the documents, download, and picture storage area. Turns out they were placed in the recycle bin. I have no idea why they just could stay in the files I placed them in rather than send them to recycle. I know this is long and I'm sorry for that.
