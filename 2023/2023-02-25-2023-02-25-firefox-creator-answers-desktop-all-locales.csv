I did try to click the 3-bars on the upper right corner of the menu bar to add the icon to the menu bar, but the icon was missing and I could not find it anywhere. I also checked to make sure that I have the latest version of FireFox. I did try to remove and delete Video DownloadHelper from FireFox, clear and remove all my data, cookies, history... and then defrag my hard drive, restart my desktop computer and then reinstall Video DownloadHelper. The Video DownloadHelper icon was nowhere to be found.  My operating system I am using is  Windows 11. There is no email, no phone number for me to contact.

But since December, I am having catastrophic failures. Sometimes with an error message, sometimes just getting no response at all when submitting information in a browser-based university application. And yet, I can complete those functions when I immediately go to Chrome (once I remember that that might be a problem).  I really don't want to use Chrome.  Is there a change in Firefox (including something which I can change some settings in my browser to counteract), or a change in our university's software making Firefox incompatible?  One returned error today was ""Request Header Fields Too Large. The server refused this request because the request header fields are too large."" [PS, I had to type this all over when I tried to share data with you about my system -- I had to click on ""troubleshoot"" information, which lost all the data I had previously entered...

Trying to make my PC basically run on your products and leave MSN out of as many places that I can on my PC.,"<p>It seems every time I allow windows update it changes the way I access things and makes changes in areas I don't want changes made or adds things I don't need. On this question, I would like to know how to access my pictures and then print them. On one of the latest updates from MSN when I go to look at a saved picture I can only see them in MSN ""Paint"". I just want to simply view my pictures and not change them. I want to then print them in the fastest and most uncomplicated way that I can. I'm currently dealing with a way just to see the pictures that I've saved using Firefox and DuckDuckgo search. At one time when Internet Explorer was being used, I just saved a picture and then accessed the folder in which I placed them, and then just simply printed them. Please advise me on how I can use your products to get back to the simplest way possible. I also use Onedrive and I'm going to delete it. It just is something I find gets in the way. I like simple no hassle products to replace the way MSN wants me to do things. I tried in the past to eliminate it and then I couldn't find some saved items in the documents, download, and picture storage area. Turns out they were placed in the recycle bin. I have no idea why they just could stay in the files I placed them in rather than send them to recycle. I know this is long and I'm sorry for that. I hope what I've written in this question makes sense. I have another question but I'll save it for another email to the staff. Thank you very much for any help or advise you can provide.
