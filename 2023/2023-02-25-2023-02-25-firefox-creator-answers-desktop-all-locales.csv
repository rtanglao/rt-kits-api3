Trying to make my PC basically run on your products and leave MSN out of as many places that I can on my PC.,"<p>It seems every time I allow windows update it changes the way I access things and makes changes in areas I don't want changes made or adds things I don't need. On this question, I would like to know how to access my pictures and then print them. On one of the latest updates from MSN when I go to look at a saved picture I can only see them in MSN ""Paint"". I just want to simply view my pictures and not change them. I want to then print them in the fastest and most uncomplicated way that I can. I'm currently dealing with a way just to see the pictures that I've saved using Firefox and DuckDuckgo search. At one time when Internet Explorer was being used, I just saved a picture and then accessed the folder in which I placed them, and then just simply printed them. Please advise me on how I can use your products to get back to the simplest way possible. I also use Onedrive and I'm going to delete it. It just is something I find gets in the way. I like simple no hassle products to replace the way MSN wants me to do things. I tried in the past to eliminate it and then I couldn't find some saved items in the documents, download, and picture storage area. Turns out they were placed in the recycle bin. I have no idea why they just could stay in the files I placed them in rather than send them to recycle. I know this is long and I'm sorry for that. I hope what I've written in this question makes sense. I have another question but I'll save it for another email to the staff. Thank you very much for any help or advise you can provide. I do value your time and help. Sincerely, Robert Auerbach </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1100;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",colleenandrob
