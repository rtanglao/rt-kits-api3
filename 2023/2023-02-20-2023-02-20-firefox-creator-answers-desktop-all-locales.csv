I work for a chiropractic office that requires a chiropractic software and it can only be downloaded through the firefox ESR web browser. I've done this many times on our older mac but we just purchased a much newer one for the office. Every time I try to download it on the new one there is just an invisible box that comes up once I open it. No way for me to use it. I've done this 6 or 7 times and it's the same outcome every time. I contacted Apple to see if it was on their end but they said to mention to Firefox support that I have the M1 chip on this computer and to ask for a link from you guys that supports that chip. The chiropractic software is very particular on what browser I can download on.
