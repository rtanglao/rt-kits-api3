When I signed up for VPN, I created an account under a second email, not realizing the original account was under a different email.  I cancelled the second account, added the second email as a secondary email to the original account, and then made the second email the primary email for my original account.  Since then, I am seeing very strange behavior with my password.  At first neither password from the new or old account would work (not that the password from the cancelled account should work).  Both attempts said that it was an incorrect password.  I performed a password reset to create a new password.  Shortly afterward, I tried to login through the VPN tool and the sign-in failed with the message ""You've made too many attempts to sign-in"".  At the same time, I opened a new tab to the Accounts page and it showed no one as logged in, despite the Firefox browser showing that I was logged in.  I used the new password to login on that tab and it did go to the accounts page at the time.  I can't see a real pattern the behavior, but it seems to have started when I changed the primary email address.  I still have not been able to login to the VPN tool.  I'm not sure that I have waited 15 minutes yet, but it doesn't seem like that should matter if I am giving it the correct password, which I 100% know that I am since I can log in to the account page with that password. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1566665;,chris.thames
