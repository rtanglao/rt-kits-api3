I have turned off Mozilla VPN, cleared Cache and Cookies, rebooted several times, but it's still not viewable beyond 2nd click in DNA section.  The rest of Ancestry is working fine: can search, add to trees, etc.   I checked with Ancestry and they say my account is fine from their end; plus it works find on Chrome.  I am a Firefox fan and hate the thought of using anything else and use Ancestry daily.   Any help appreciated;  Singer35 </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1100;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",singer35
