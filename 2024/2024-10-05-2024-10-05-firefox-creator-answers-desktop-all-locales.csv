And from the examples that are shown, you might think it is also possible to add ip-address-range like 192.168.1.0/24.  But this does not really work. Even when your servers are in the network 192.168.1.0/24, the proxy still we be used. It is only working if you add your domain e.g. .mydomain.local. </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",user22

Los Angeles Times newspaper online suddenly won't work.,"<p>New version (131.0) installed 10/3-10/4/2024. Los Angeles Times newspaper online suddenly won't work.   I have been getting daily delivery of the Los Angeles Times newspaper for many years. It has always worked perfectly with Firefox up until today -- the day immediately following the overnight install of version 131.0 for the Mac on my computer. The daily edition comes with an email (gmail) that has a graphic depicting the front page of the edition and a notation that says something like ""Read today's paper"", which you can then do by clicking on the graphic of the front page. The app gives you an option of viewing either one or two pages at a time and allows you to turn pages by clicking on arrows on either the left or right edge of the screen. The reader can then navigate on the page by just grabbing the page with a click and hold. You can also select any article on the page by clicking on that article, which makes it appear in a window that works like a PDF of the article. You can also click on a copy icon to create a text copy of the article which you can copy and paste into a Word (or other word processing document). So I hope you will FIX YOUR APPLICATION. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",lliksirdkram
