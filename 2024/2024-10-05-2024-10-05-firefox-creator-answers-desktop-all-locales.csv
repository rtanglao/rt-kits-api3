I just figured it was my particular combination of installed extensions and the websites I frequented because certain sites tended to crash tabs pretty often (e.g., <a href=""http://HomeDepot.com"" rel=""nofollow"">HomeDepot.com</a>), while others didn't (e.g., <a href=""http://Lowes.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Lowes.com</a>). However, I'm working more hours per day on my PC and have had the app crash multiple times in one day so I figure it's time to try fixing it. So... I made sure that Windows, FF, and my device drivers are up to date.  I ran two separate malware/virus scans.  The only third-party modules loading are from Intel (it's an Intel CPU and graphics adapter).  I ran FF in Troubleshooting Mode, and the tab crashes continued, as well as an app crash.  I have four crash report IDs from that event; I am sure it's these four because the Extensions tabs report ""No extensions were installed.""  Three are out-of-memory, one is EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION_READ. </p> <ul><li> * 593e9741-2b1e-4a9c-8cd0-1fa720241005 </li><li> * 0af6e22a-150f-4f88-922d-46c6a0241005 </li><li> * d967d511-cd39-4bfe-9b77-6597c0241005 </li><li> * 9d98d242-5b2e-421e-8b12-1e0c00241005 </li></ul> <p>I ran MemTest86 and it didn't find any memory hardware issues. </p><p>Since Troubleshooting Mode didn't reveal a misbehaving extension, do I still need to ""Refresh Firefox""?

System: Windows 10 x64, Firefox Nightly. </p><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Out of the blue, when I start Firefox Nightly (I think 2-3 days ago), it just crashed with no extra info. I see the ""window of the update process"", it goes to the middle or to the end, immediately closes and doesn't bring up the Crash reporter. <strong>However!</strong> When I tried to run a Nightly Installer that I downloaded through Chrome, it quietly runs and then just opens up my browser no problem, profile and all. I checked and it seems to be the exact same .exe file (according to the Task Manager). </p><p>So in short: it breaks if I run it straight from my usual shortcut, or with .exe. But if I run the installer myself, the browser opens up fine. </p><p>However, the installer didn't bring any new updates that would fix the problem, I have this for 2-3 days now, I don't remember. I start working, I see I didn't fix it and run the installer again. </p><p>Any ideas on the fix? I would love to not lose my profile, settings and, if possible, tabs. I'll try disabling all the extensions after I post this, I don't think they contribute, though (seeing how the external Firefox Nightly Installer opens up my browser just fine). </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,1679633;,vospi.vospi

The reader can then navigate on the page by just grabbing the page with a click and hold.
