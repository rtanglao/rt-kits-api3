There is the Downloads History, displaying all downloads done in the past. This list has several features so far. Among them are: </p> <ul><li> delete a file </li><li> remove from history </li><li> clear history </li></ul> <p>Hitting one of these by accident is very easy. This is a massive oversight. Things that can happen: </p> <ul><li> You want to remove several files from the history but accidentally hit deleting them. </li><li> You want to remove several files from the history but accidentally hit Clear History, which can especially result removing failed downloads from the past that you might want to retry. </li><li> You hit Clear History, expecting it to spare failed downloads intuitively. As it is, I will *never* use it, since I obviously want to retry failed downloads. </li></ul> <p>Therefore, I propose several feature requests: </p> <ol><li> For history deletion/restoration, I propose an undo option. Certainly, the history does not take up much space. My specific recommendation is that history up to one week is logged. It can be deleted completely where the cache is also emptied, and old entries in the backup are removed automatically when the corresponding file is updated (something gets added or removed from history). </li><li> For file deletion/restoration, I simply propose that the files are moved to the trash of the system, instead of being directly deleted. I am not sure why this is not already the case. Should be quite easy to implement as well. </li><li> For Clear History, additionally to point 1, I propose that the user is prompted with ""are you sure? Yes/No"". Also, Clear History ignores failed downloads. Like that, it actually becomes useful. And again, this should be trivial to implement. I'd also be quite fine if this is made an option one can choose in the settings. </li></ol> <p>Note that I have seen replies to people with these or related problems that went like ""you can go to the profile folder and search for this and that SQL file and..."" - no. The points I wrote should be something that a casual user would want to have available, and going into technical folders is anything but user friendly.

When entering some (in tis case financial: <a href=""https://www.nordnet.se/se"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nordnet.se/se</a>) sites the time shown are exactly 2hours behind the system time. If system time is 11:15 (correct time zone in Sweden) the time shown on the site is 09:15. This is probably something that has to do with an update of Firefox. I have automatic update to Firefox but the problem has been there for some months although I have not been able to recognice it until the recent week. I have tried a ""clean"" new install of Firefox to a new directory with no import of bookmarks or anything but the problem is exactly the same. For your information I have tried a clean install of Duckduckgo browser which do not suffer this problem. But I want to keep with Firefox which I have used since at least 15years. I guess there is a ""timestamp"" or samething that have gone wrong, but should be easy to correct if you just know where to look.

Can someone tell me how to fix this if it's even fixable yet? Chrome does this if you want to compare the user experience I'm missing since switching to Firefox.
