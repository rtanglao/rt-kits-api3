Sometimes I can't access my Google searches or links in emails don't work, then it works, then it starts to malfunction again. I have to restart my PC. Could you release a patch that works as well as before FireFox 129.0? On the other hand, Canal+ works perfectly Thanks. Kind regards. </p>",desktop;troubleshooting;windows-11;firefox-1290;firefox-12902;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",czoppigor06
