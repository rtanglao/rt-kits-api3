When entering some (in tis case financial: <a href=""https://www.nordnet.se/se"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nordnet.se/se</a>) sites the time shown are exactly 2hours behind the system time. If system time is 11:15 (correct time zone in Sweden) the time shown on the site is 09:15. This is probably something that has to do with an update of Firefox. I have automatic update to Firefox but the problem has been there for some months although I have not been able to recognice it until the recent week. I have tried a ""clean"" new install of Firefox to a new directory with no import of bookmarks or anything but the problem is exactly the same. For your information I have tried a clean install of Duckduckgo browser which do not suffer this problem. But I want to keep with Firefox which I have used since at least 15years. I guess there is a ""timestamp"" or samething that have gone wrong, but should be easy to correct if you just know where to look.

Example:  I want to open <a href=""https://www.arabdict.com/en/deutsch-arabisch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.arabdict.com/en/deutsch-arabisch</a>  but typing ""ara"" in the URL input field always suggests  <a href=""https://www.arabdict.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.arabdict.com</a> although the first link is both bookmarked and pinned on home. Can someone tell me how to fix this if it's even fixable yet? Chrome does this if you want to compare the user experience I'm missing since switching to Firefox. Thank you!  </p><p>P.S: sorry for the first screenshot, I couldn't catch the suggestions menu with the built in screenshot tool. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1290;,firefox,other,en-US,1669813;,Adam.I
