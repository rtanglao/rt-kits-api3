I use the local Windows Hosts file to give my router a quick reference name to get into it.  That too has worked for years but began to fail last year.  Inconvenient.  The best I could track this down, it has something to do with forced DNS lookups and skipping the old Hosts file.  If so, any work around to get my system simplicity back?  Attached is what I see on each attempt. </p><p>I tried various settings for DOH and nothing works.  I can reference the Hosts file in a Windows Cmd Prompt and it resolves just fine.  Something is screwy in Firefox for some time now and I'd like to know what. </p>",firefox-13303;firefox-1330;firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1698635;,KC_the_Komputer_Dinosaur
