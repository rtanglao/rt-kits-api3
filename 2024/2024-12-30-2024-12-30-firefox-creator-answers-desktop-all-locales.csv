It doesn't matter if the video is on my primary or secondary display. They're both the same resolution (1440p), but my main monitor is 165hz while the second is 60hz. </p><p>I've read online that disabling hardware acceleration and then re enabling it fixes this. This temporarily works for me and the artifacts disappear. But whenever I restart my PC, the issue returns and I have to disable and re enable hardware acceleration every time. How do I fix this permanently?? </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",jarav51151
