I have a 200Mb connection to the internet and bandwidth testing confirms that it runs at a consistent 195 - 202 Mb.   2. I am using Firefox 126.0 on a dual boot machine running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Windows 10 (both OSes show similar stuttering and pausing). 3. My hardware is a Gigabyte Aorus Z690i motherboard with 32 GB of RAM and an Intel i5-12600K processor and an NVidia GeFroce RTX 2060 Super graphics card. I have tried disabling ""Use hardware acceleration"" in Firefox and also disabling all add-ons and rebooting.  This hasn't resolved the problem. When I watch the same video in Google Chrome, it seems to display a much slower frame rate than 30fps but doesn't stutter. I have concluded that this video must be a super demanding one to render.  There are many picture elements changing constantly.  But is there a way to watch this at 4K/30fps with it playing smoothly and at the correct frame rate? </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1260;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1654262;1654281;,rreed1913

These are well catered for in Chrome and allow easy import of products into stores such as Shopify.  They save a lot of time for already busy store owners and staff yet Firefox loyalists are forced to switch over and use Chrome to make life easier and save time. For someone who has been using Firefox across both Linux and Windows since it's 2004 launch, it is galling and almost physically debillitating to have to resort to this each time.  If I were any good at coding I would surely fix this serious shortcomming. </p><p>Please Mozilla look to this and provide us with better options. </p><p>Bernie </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1260;,firefox,customize,en-US,1654258;,ohenenana
1448180,2024-05-24 04:27:13 -0700,2024-05-24 04:39:10 -0700,Request for Implementation of Text Fragments Feature (#:~:text=) in Firefox,"<p>Dear Firefox Development Team, </p><p>I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request the implementation of a feature in Firefox that I believe would greatly enhance user experience and accessibility on the web. Specifically, I am referring to the text fragment feature (#:~:text=) that is currently supported in browsers based on the Chromium engine, such as Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge. </p><p>The text fragment feature allows users to link directly to specific pieces of text within a webpage, facilitating more precise navigation and making it easier to reference exact portions of content. This is particularly useful for academic citations, sharing specific excerpts from lengthy articles, and improving overall user interaction with web content. </p><p>For example, a URL formatted as <a href=""https://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://example.com</a>#:~:text=desired%20text%20fragment directs users not just to the page, but to the exact location of the specified text, highlighting it for easy identification. This can save users significant time and improve the efficiency of information retrieval. </p><p>Given Firefox's commitment to innovation and user-centric design, I believe that integrating this feature would be a valuable addition. It would not only bring Firefox in line with other major browsers in terms of functionality but also enhance its appeal to users who rely on this precise method of navigation. </p><p>I hope you will consider this suggestion and look forward to potentially seeing this feature in a future release of Firefox. </p><p>Thank you for your continued dedication to improving the Firefox browser. </p><p>Best regards, Grey Ronin </p><p>Ps.
