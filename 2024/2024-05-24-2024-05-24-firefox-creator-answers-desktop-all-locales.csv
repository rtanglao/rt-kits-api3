On Linux (Firefox 125.0.3, for Ubuntu), the procedure is simply to type the IP address into the search bar, and press enter, and it works. On MacOs, no way to get to that website, I only get a Google search (I also tried adding http:// or https://, or tried creating a Bookmark and modifying the address there, it simply refuses to update if I just have <a href=""http://xxx.xxx.x.xxx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xxx.xxx.x.xxx</a> as the address)... </p><p>Any chance there might be a way for me to connect to that IP-only website? </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",desktop;tips;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1260;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",jeremie.wenger

I have a very capable i5, rtx3070 machine and this issue started just a couple of days ago. I have not done any changes or updates which could trigger this problem. The problem starts mainly when I Watch in full screen mode or have multiple non-fullscreen vids active. All other apps show no signs of problem. I can watch the exact same video in Edge, no fans/high cpu, VLC works fine, Chrome is OK, it's only in FF that the problem occurs. </p><p>I have tried the following: 1.Reinstalling FF 2. Activating HW acceleration in FF and forcing it in Windows11 3. Theatre mode is off and all other YT settings are off. 4. Updated Nvidia and windows 5. FF is the latest version. 6. Disabled all my addons/plugins </p><p>No clue what can cause this.. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1260;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",henrikengdahl90

Since the most recent update of Firefox I have been unable to use Afterpay. My Afterpay account still works in Chrome and through the phone app. Afterpay themselves have checked through my account and their system, and there are no problems. Therefore, they recommended that I reach out to Firefox to request help. I want to use Firefox as I have done for years, but I cannot use it if it is incompatible with my Afterpay account. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1260;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",beever008
