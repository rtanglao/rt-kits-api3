My firefox browser has been taking ages to load. I've tried various 'fixes' over the last week or so and they don't work for long. I'm going down the 'try this' list and am at the 'clear junk in manage data' suggestion. Someone else had success with getting rid of a load of youtube saved junk.  I'm in the Cookie and Site Data area, it says it's using 793mb of disc space yet when I tap on 'manage data' to try and clear stuff that area shows up as empty.  I've searched but can't locate how to fix this issue. Or I might be missing something completely obvious.&nbsp;:/ </p><p>My memory, and health, is not great so if possible I really don't want to resort to clearing everything and having to re-add log ins etc. </p><p>Does anyone know how to fix this please? </p><p>Thank you! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1240;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",blake.wolfe

It's not exactly consistent in timing, but I'd say every second or less.  It may be happening when scrolling normally as well, but if it is I can't tell. </p><p>Trying to google for a potential fix, I found a reddit thread suggesting to look at the WEBRENDER entries in about:support, though that's where it ended because the individual that posted the thread had no issues there.  As the attached image shows, there are multiple NVIDIA_REFRESH_RATE_MIXED error codes, in WEBRENDER_COMPOSITOR and WEBRENDER_DCOMP_PRESENT.  This makes some sense, as my main monitor is 144hz, and my tv, also connected to my GPU, is 120hz.  I have a 3070 Ti FE, which I also used in my previous computer, which I remember having no stuttering in firefox with. </p><p>I also found that if I force the GPU to run at a higher speed (not overclocked, just at the advertised speed rather than the reduced speed it normally offers when doing non-intensive tasks like browsing the web), the stutter goes away. </p><p>I tried various about:config settings, like mousewheel.system_scroll_override.enabled from true to false, layout.frame_rate from -1 to 144 (this didn't seem to fix it, and made scrolling choppier in general, almost as though I'd turned off smooth scrolling though not as severe), though nothing seemed to help. </p><p>I'd greatly appreciate any help anyone can offer. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",derpnik
