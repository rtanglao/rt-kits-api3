It works in desktop apps (eg webcamoid), and chromium. I've checked the permissions (about:preferences#privacy), and that is not the problem. about:support does not list the device in the input at all. I've tried using LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libv4l/<a href=""http://libv4l1compat.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libv4l1compat.so</a>, but that has not helped. Does anyone have any suggestions? </p>",linux;desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",mike737

Opens search page (start page) instead of results, adding a (unnecessary) step to searching and causing me to have to re-enter my search term. the 2024 trend across the tech industry seems to add unnecessary steps for previously single-step convenient/efficient processes. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jeremy.wendell

It's not exactly consistent in timing, but I'd say every second or less.  It may be happening when scrolling normally as well, but if it is I can't tell. </p><p>Trying to google for a potential fix, I found a reddit thread suggesting to look at the WEBRENDER entries in about:support, though that's where it ended because the individual that posted the thread had no issues there.  As the attached image shows, there are multiple NVIDIA_REFRESH_RATE_MIXED error codes, in WEBRENDER_COMPOSITOR and WEBRENDER_DCOMP_PRESENT.  This makes some sense, as my main monitor is 144hz, and my tv, also connected to my GPU, is 120hz.  I have a 3070 Ti FE, which I also used in my previous computer, which I remember having no stuttering in firefox with. </p><p>I also found that if I force the GPU to run at a higher speed (not overclocked, just at the advertised speed rather than the reduced speed it normally offers when doing non-intensive tasks like browsing the web), the stutter goes away. </p><p>I tried various about:config settings, like mousewheel.system_scroll_override.enabled from true to false, layout.frame_rate from -1 to 144 (this didn't seem to fix it, and made scrolling choppier in general, almost as though I'd turned off smooth scrolling though not as severe), though nothing seemed to help. </p><p>I'd greatly appreciate any help anyone can offer. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",derpnik
