I am writing to seek urgent assistance in recovering my saved passwords, which appear to have been lost following a recent reinstallation of Windows 11. Issue Details: </p><pre>   I reinstalled Windows 11 and attempted to sync my main Firefox account, but none of my saved passwords have appeared in the browser, despite trying multiple solutions.    I have already tried the following steps:        Ensured I was logged into the same Firefox account and enabled sync for Logins and Passwords.        Attempted manual sync multiple times.        Checked my Firefox Lockwise settings and verified that no passwords were visible there.        Tried logging out and back into my account and using the ""Sync Now"" feature again. </pre> <p>Further Attempts: </p><pre>   I checked for possible Firefox profile backups from my previous Windows installation but could not find any recoverable data related to saved passwords.    Unfortunately, I do not have a recovery key, and it seems I did not export my passwords prior to reinstalling Windows.    I also explored other possible recovery options, such as using system restore points, checking other browsers, and scanning for old profile files, but none have yielded results. </pre> <p>I would greatly appreciate any assistance or guidance in recovering my lost passwords. If there is any way to retrieve the data from the Firefox Sync server or another potential method I might have missed, I would be grateful for your support. </p><p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon. </p><p>Kind regards, Syed Zain Abbas </p>",firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",imzainabbas

Obviously, you don't need to ask too much about my experience. I have been conducting activities in mainland China, which means I have to visit overseas websites to get important news and bring it back to China. However, language communication is very important. I can't always look up in a dictionary to find out what the news is about. That will be a waste of time. So out of respect, I can only reply to you in English. Thank you for your understanding and support. I am a democratic whistleblower who supports Taiwan independence. You can do some research on my background.
