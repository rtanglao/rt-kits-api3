Obviously, you don't need to ask too much about my experience. I have been conducting activities in mainland China, which means I have to visit overseas websites to get important news and bring it back to China. However, language communication is very important. I can't always look up in a dictionary to find out what the news is about. That will be a waste of time. So out of respect, I can only reply to you in English. Thank you for your understanding and support. I am a democratic whistleblower who supports Taiwan independence. You can do some research on my background. I respect your decision! </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",shuihez
