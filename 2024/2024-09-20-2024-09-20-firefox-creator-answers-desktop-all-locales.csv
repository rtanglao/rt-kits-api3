I'm using Firefox 130.00 on a MacBook Pro (15-inch, mid-2012) running Catalina (10.15.7). It has run flawlessly for years, but suddenly won't open, and only hangs, requiring me to Force Quit. It stopped working on Thursday, 9/12, which, I notice, was the day it was last modified with an automatic upgrade. I have quit and tried restarting multiple times, but am unable to get into it at all and, therefore, cannot access Troubleshooting Mode. I have NOT yet tried deleting it and downloading a fresh copy. I would like, if possible, to retain my open tabs, Bookmarks, and History. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",jt26

Tested on other browsers (which work perfectly, so it seems isolated to Firefox).    Signed in on a different device with the same Gmail (works fine outside Firefox).
