I'm using Mullvad VPN, and whenever it's on, I cannot search for anything regardless of my search engine, and pretty much the only website that will open is Tumblr. For anything else, the URL will be in the bar at the top, but it won't do anything beyond that; it won't even show the loading symbol. It worked very briefly when I first got the VPN, but now it doesn't. Other browsers work with my VPN. What am I supposed to do? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",kl4ush4rgr33v3s

Why&nbsp;? Because the standard edition has a distinct orange icon. I am not able to quick glance at the task bar and see the difference between what window is Firefox Dev (blue icon), Outlook (blue icon), VSCode (blue icon), Azure Data Studio (blue icon), WebStorm (blue icon), 1Password (blue icon) or MS Edge (blue icon). </p><p>My problem is that my web browser (in this case Firefox) is the application I most often switch back and forth between and the struggle is real... I have to spend a lot of time looking at the task bar to acuatlly be able to see what icon is Firefox Developer Edition. </p><p>I don't need this as a feature in Firefox, necessarily, just some tips or tricks if there is any icons in the program folder e.g. I can swap out. </p>",desktop;beta;tips;windows-11;firefox-1280;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",oskaremil
