Then later there is a job for a lion trainer that I want to bookmark from the same company, same website -- but it overwrites the zookeeper job and replaces it with the lion trainer job.  </p><p>1) Why is it doing this? 2) How can I save BOTH bookmarks (and more) from the same website? </p><p>TIA </p>",desktop;bookmarks;firefox-1270;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1658182;,MizzouMadeKC

It's ONLY in firefox that it does this issue in, I've tried it in other browsers. Youtube tends to just....stop buffering in firefox for some reason? My internet connection is not the issue so I'm not sure what I could do to mess with it, I've done a fresh install of firefox, I've cleared cache and cookies. I'm genuinely at a loss. </p><p>It takes FOREVER for it to actually s tart up in the video too. The video plays fine until it just...stops buffering and takes 5-10 minutes to load. As mentioned before this is only an issue in firefox. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1270;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",nizzknob
