I have installed Firefox on all windows 10 workstations and I have also installed latest Firefox Group Policy ADMX on Server. I need to set some preferences on all Workstations. The preferences that I want to set are the ones that can be found in about:config. </p><p>But the problem is that only some of these preferences exist in Group Policy by default and it says ""deprecated"". I know that I can add additional about:config preferences in a Group Policy object called ""Preferences"".  But no matter how I enter the format or how I change the JASON file, no preference policy is applied to Firefox in workstations. By the way when I change ""Preferences"" gpo in group Policy the next Policy called ""Preferences (JASON on one file)"" does also change. I have thoroughly searched the web and Mozilla support and have tested all suggestions but all to no avail. Can you please help me and Give me an example of how to do that? I would appreciate any answer in advance. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1647460;,manoochehr.zangooei

They simply revert back to the default (see image) when I restart Firefox. Not sure what is meant by ""your organisation"" as I am a personal user, not organisation. I'm the single user of the browser (e.g. just one user on my PC, which is me) and also Admisitrator. Can someone help me remove this.

It is confusing! A bookmark is a link!  For comparison, both of them are CTRL + click in chromium.  BTW, there is no explanation in advanced configuration preferences. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1230;firefox-12301;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",Heporis
