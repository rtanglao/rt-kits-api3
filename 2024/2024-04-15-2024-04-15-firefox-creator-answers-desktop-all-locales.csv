I don't like that icon in the top-left hand so I right clicked it and removed it. All was good. However, today there is a blank black space in the corner as if the icon was back (but without an actual icon). It's only a small thing but it bugs me. I want the tabs to be shifted all the way over to the left like they have been up to today. It's triggering my OCD.
