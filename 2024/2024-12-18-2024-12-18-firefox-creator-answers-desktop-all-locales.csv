It seems even though camera permissions are enabled, Firefox is unable to connect to my camera for my telehealth sessions. The light indicating my camera is in use comes on for a second, then immediately turns off. I am also unable to even start a session and coast with voice only. The window to start my session never pops up. I have put in a ticket and been in contact with TherapyNotes going back and forth for the past couple of weeks. Their tech support insists it is an issue with Firefox since I can utilize their site completely on other browsers. I much prefer to use Firefox for the security, so I'm hoping there's something you can tell me to do to make it work. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",ivyk.psyd
