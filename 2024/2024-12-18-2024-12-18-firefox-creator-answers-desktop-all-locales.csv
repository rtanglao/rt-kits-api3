This one I have been unable to find this issue myself, so thought I would ask here. I use Qobuz to stream hi-res music up to 24bit/ 192kHz. Some albums do not have sound at that resolution. The file will load and timer shows the song is playing, but there is no audio. I can change the setting to stream at 16bit/44.1kHz and then I get audio. Again, this does not occur with all albums, some will stream at hi-res and some will not. An interesting note: the same file with no audio at hi-res on firefox will have audio at same resolution setting on chrome. The only thing I can think of is chrome is reducing resolution in the background, or maybe a DRM issue? I do have ""Play DRM-controlled content"" checked in firefox settings. </p><p>p.s. I am aware that streaming music through a browser is not necessarily the best way to listen to hi-res music, and my ears may, or may not hear the difference between the 16bit and 24bit. However, the issue is the functionality, or lack of.  </p><p>Thank you in advance for any insight. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1695616;1695622;,claysora
