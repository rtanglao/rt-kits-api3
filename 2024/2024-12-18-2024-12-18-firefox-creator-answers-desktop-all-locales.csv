It is NOT an .htm file.,"<p>A recent update apparently causes FF to add "".htm"" when saving a text file that has no extension. It didn't used to do this. The file being downloaded has no extension. It is a hash text file used to verify my ownership of a domain during SSL cert renewal. I can save without an extension if I delete the extension and surround the filename with quotes. But that is a pain.  Other browsers don't require this.  How do I get my old FF behavior back? </p><p>Currently: FF 133.0.3 (64-bit), Win10 </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",AvgFireFoxUser

I settled on <em><strong>/var/lib/krb5tabs/krb5cc_%u</strong></em> I configured that within <em><strong>/etc/krb5.conf</strong></em>  </p><p>I use pam_winbind from Samba to do the Kerberos login and the keytab is filled in and the environment var KRB5CCNAME is set correctly. </p><p>Before the change of the location of the keytab from the defaults, everything works fine apart from after a resume and creds need re entering (which is the pain I am trying to avoid). </p><p>After the change, Evolution is still able to authenticate via Kerberos but Firefox is not.  So, does FF just assume defaults or actually follow KRB5CCNAME - which seems to be the standard for Kerberos? </p>",firefox;seg-linux;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1695474;,gerdesj
