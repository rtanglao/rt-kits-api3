It can happen randomly with no particular sites. Even if the tab eventually loads, refreshing it can cause FF to go into loading mode forever.  The example could be <a href=""http://Reverb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Reverb.com</a> site that loads the home page after a delay but then searching for anything would send the tab into ""forever spin"". I checked it on a different router - same issue. I'm on Mac OS Sonoma 14.6.1. </p><p>Any hints? TIA. \tim </p>",desktop;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",info11767
