I've saved my gmail login credentials in my Firefox saved passwords. About a month ago I started having a problem where opening the gmail login page no longer autofills my gmail username. I've used Firefox, Gmail, and Mac together for 14 years. This has never been a problem until July 2024.  </p><p>I can't find an answer in Mozilla Support, Stackoverflow, etc. </p>",desktop;other;firefox-1290;firefox-12902;,firefox,other,en-US,"",bbcc

Since the most recent Firefox updates (129.01 and 129.02), a translucent rectangle has appeared on some web pages that I access. I can see through it, but I cannot click on anything, or select text, in areas covered by the rectangle. It doesn't always appear immediately, it may take a minute or so of scrolling before it shows up.  If I restart Firefox in Troubleshoot mode, the rectangle goes away. But when I restart normally, it comes back. If I turn all extensions off (I don't use very many), the problem goes away. If I turn Ghostery back on, it comes back. </p><p>I've turned off Ghostery for now. So my questions are: (1) Does the latest Firefox just not work and play well with Ghostery? (2) Is that floating rectangle likely to be a sign of something bad, or just an annoyance? </p><p>Many thanks for any clues! </p>",desktop;troubleshooting;firefox-1290;firefox-12902;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",Amanda9

It can happen randomly with no particular sites. Even if the tab eventually loads, refreshing it can cause FF to go into loading mode forever.  The example could be <a href=""http://Reverb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Reverb.com</a> site that loads the home page after a delay but then searching for anything would send the tab into ""forever spin"". I checked it on a different router - same issue. I'm on Mac OS Sonoma 14.6.1. </p><p>Any hints? TIA. \tim </p>",desktop;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",info11767
