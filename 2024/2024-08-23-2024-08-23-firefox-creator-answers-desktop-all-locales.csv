I then realized that upon the last button click, Firefox downloaded a weird HTML file called something like ha71ksd.htm. The file was empty (0KB) and when uploading it to VirusTotal it showed me a completely different file there (probably since the hash of an empty file is always the same). </p><p>In any case, I am a bit worried that I might have been infected by a virus. Therefore, I'd like to at least reproduce what happened. I read in different places that it might have something to do with a wrong MIME type reported by a server prompting Firefox to download instead of displaying a file. But Stackoverflow having such a misconfiguration is also strange. I know that a 0KB file cannot contain anything malicious but the whole incident seemed highly suspicious and I need to find out what happened. </p><p>Any help or tips are appreciated! </p>",linux;desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1290;firefox-12902;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",nimrare

I already turned off the related sync settings, but I think since I synced my history before I turned them off, the websites from my main laptop are still showing up.  My main question is- would I be able to clear my history on my work laptop without deleting the cookies/usage information from my main laptop (as I know this would log me out)?

So about a week ago i was hacked, and i removed all the files and everything, and managed to get past with 0 damage. I installed Avast to scan for viruses and i have been using it ever since then, but it keeps blocking something from opening and i don't know what it is or whether its normal. It used to only block a blacklisted URL called: "" 1.awakened.work"". It scared me a bit so i went to check on the IP for the website and a bunch of information on what it is but i found nothing that meant anything to me. I uninstalled Firefox a few times and reinstalled it. I even completely removed all the files related to Mozilla but once  i reinstalled it then 4 web URL's tried to open and got blocked named:"" 1.awakened.work"", ""1.foreground.work"", ""<a href=""http://1.6912044.cc"" rel=""nofollow"">1.6912044.cc</a>"" and ""<a href=""http://listitnow.org"" rel=""nofollow"">listitnow.org</a>"". I have no idea what these do or are and i came here to ask whether anyone knows how to stop them from even trying to open. When i removed Mozilla then they didn't try to open and only tried to open while i had Mozilla. I looked at the location of the files and it says they are the Firefox.exe so i don't know. I really love using Mozilla but if i can't fix this, then i will have to use GX. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1290;firefox-12902;,firefox,other,en-US,1670067;,toothlessgamingnr1

How can I recover or restore the Downloads list?,"<p>My situation is similar to: </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1410815"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1410815</a> </p><p>but that thread is archived. </p><p><br> <strong>Problem</strong>:  I opened the Downloads folder and meant to click 'Organize' but I accidentally clicked 'Clear Downloads'. All the names in the Downloads list are now gone and I want to bring them back.  </p><p><strong>Situation</strong>: I did not want to clear the Downloads list, all I wanted to do was learn what options were listed in the 'Organize' button. I was hoping there might be an option to have past Downloads (the names on the Downloads list, not the downloaded files themselves) sorted by date and by domain. But now all the names in the Downloads list are gone. I don't want this to happen again so what's the best solution for this problem? </p><p><br> cor-el says (in page linked above) that a backup of 'places.sqlite' can recover the Downloads list. I copied that file to my Desktop but I'm guessing that it's too late for this file to be of any use now, as I did this only *after* the Downloads list was cleared. </p><p>The information I've read about the <em>places.sqlite</em> file (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/fix-bookmarks-and-history-will-not-be-functional"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/fix-bookmarks-and-history-will-not-be-functional</a> , <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data</a> , and  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/recovering-important-data-from-an-old-profile#w_bookmarks-downloads-and-browsing-history"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/recovering-important-data-from-an-old-profile#w_bookmarks-downloads-and-browsing-history</a>) seems to focus mainly on its relation to Bookmarks, not Downloads. Does everything that article say about restoring Bookmarks also apply to restoring Downloads?  </p><p><br> I haven't made a backup before in Firefox specifially but my system (Linux) took a system snapshot (Timeshift) before this mistake happened. Would reverting the system to the previous snapshot allow me to access the old <em>places.sqlite-wal</em> file that has the now-missing Downloads list? </p><p><br> Also, is there a way to customize the appearance of Downloads window? I'd like to add some space between the 'Organize' button and the 'Clear Downloads' button. If I could have them separated just a little bit more, I think it might help to prevent this kind of thing from happening again.  </p><p><br> In the meantime, I'm thinking of writing a script that regularly backs up the <em>places.sqlite-wal</em> file so that if this happens again, I can just use the backup. But as of now I'm uncertain that it will do what I need it to do. </p><p><br> Any help is appreciated. I hope I've provided enough information to make this report clear.

No matter what I do, including all other fixes previously suggested on the Mozilla forums and elsewhere, nothing seems to work. </p><p>Things that I've already tried and did not work include: - Pausing Kaspersky Internet Security - Resetting WiFi router - Switching to a different WiFi - Turning on troubleshooting mode - Resetting Firefox entirely - Creating a new profile - Reinstalling Firefox (several times) - Installing Firefox for Developers - Flushing DNS - Turning off proxy settings </p><p>I really don't want to be forced to use Google Chrome.
