No matter what I do, including all other fixes previously suggested on the Mozilla forums and elsewhere, nothing seems to work. </p><p>Things that I've already tried and did not work include: - Pausing Kaspersky Internet Security - Resetting WiFi router - Switching to a different WiFi - Turning on troubleshooting mode - Resetting Firefox entirely - Creating a new profile - Reinstalling Firefox (several times) - Installing Firefox for Developers - Flushing DNS - Turning off proxy settings </p><p>I really don't want to be forced to use Google Chrome. Is there anything else that I can possibly do that can fix this? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1290;firefox-12902;,firefox,other,en-US,1669958;,gety1919
