The pages load halfway and then it just churns/spins and never completes loading the page.  So far I've discovered no other websites that have the same problem. </p><p>I am able to access the Amazon website on three other browsers - Edge, Brave and DuckDuckGo - with no problems and normal loading speed.  I don't use Chrome, so I can't speak to that. </p><p>I've tried clearing the cache and that did not help.  I had a Firefox update installed a couple of days ago.  Don't know how long it had been sitting there, as Firefox is almost always open and doesn't have the opportunity to update until I close everything and restart my computer, which I did a couple of days ago. </p><p>Windows 10 on a Dell pc/laptop.
