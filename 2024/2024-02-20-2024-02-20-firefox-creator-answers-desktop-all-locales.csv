It opens in a little box that is usually partially off screen. I have not changed any settings and do not understand why this is happening. I maximize the window which usually has to be done twice (meaning I hit the maximize window twice to get it to go completely back to full screen). I have also tried dragging the corners of the window to maximum size, but the following day it will go back to not opening in full screen. If someone could help me with this, I would really appreciate it. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1220;,firefox,other,en-US,"",baile4ma

The images that i was uploading into the mailjet templates where displaying fine both on mailjet and when sent to mozilla firefox users. </p><p>The problem is that for 10 days now; when i upload images in mailjet and sending newsletters; the images are not displaying in mozilla. In contrast, when i use chrome everything displays fine, both mailjet and email accounts. </p><p>I had a long chat history with mailjet support and they requested to follow these instructions to fix this issue first: <a href=""https://documentation.mailjet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058211453-Why-are-my-images-not-displayed-missing-in-the-Email-Editor"" rel=""nofollow"">https://documentation.mailjet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360058211453-Why-are-my-images-not-displayed-missing-in-the-Email-Editor</a> I did this but i had no success so they requested me to use chrome instead of mozilla. But that is not the solution of the problem because this must address all different browser users. </p><p>Can you please help me on this? </p><p>Thank you, </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",spearth
