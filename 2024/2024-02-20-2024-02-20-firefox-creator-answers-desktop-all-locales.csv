Additionally, I have opened ‘Troubleshooting Mode’ which comes up with ‘Restart’ then ‘Open’ and I have ‘Refreshed Firefox’ from this option. I have cleared my Cookies and Cache. I asked for help through the Firefox Community. I received one response asking if the problem still happened in ‘Troubleshooting Mode’. My response 'yes' it does but I have not had any other reply. Hence, I am stuck. Nothing has worked which I find very frustrating.
