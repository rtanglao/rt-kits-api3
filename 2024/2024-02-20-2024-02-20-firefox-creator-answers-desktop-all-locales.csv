When I access my Firefox main default screen I open up a respective website I want to access but within a matter of a few seconds the main default screen automatically opens up again meaning I now have two windows open which shouldn’t happen! I have opened up ‘Help’ and have refreshed Firefox a few times now. Additionally, I have opened ‘Troubleshooting Mode’ which comes up with ‘Restart’ then ‘Open’ and I have ‘Refreshed Firefox’ from this option. I have cleared my Cookies and Cache. I asked for help through the Firefox Community. I received one response asking if the problem still happened in ‘Troubleshooting Mode’. My response 'yes' it does but I have not had any other reply. Hence, I am stuck. Nothing has worked which I find very frustrating. I have used Firefox for many years now but if I cannot resolve this matter I will have to select a different browser which I don’t really want to do. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",graemesmith300653
