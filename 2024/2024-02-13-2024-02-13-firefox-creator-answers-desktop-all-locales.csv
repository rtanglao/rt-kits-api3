When Firefox goes into efficiency mode it be comes slow and unresponsive. if I manually uncheck efficiency mode in task manager Firefox becomes quicker and less laggy until a few seconds to minutes later it goes back into it. The performance of Firefox in efficiency mode makes it almost unusable and can take up to a minute for it to start working again. </p>,desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",racing_4_fun

Sometimes just one tab will crash, and other times it'll be the entire browser. I ran it in troubleshoot mode and it still crashed, so it's not caused by an extension or anything. It never used to do this before and I don't understand what's causing this issue. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;needsinfo;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1636561;1636595;,everythinggreatandsome48
