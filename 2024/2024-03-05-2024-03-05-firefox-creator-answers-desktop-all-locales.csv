Mercifully, I have had Microsoft support working on recovering my data, which has proved a tremendous task. 4 months and counting. </p><p><br> We have now finally managed to recover my passwords for my browsers, but they are encrypted. Microsoft Support have therefore asked if Mozilla do a decryption tool as they cannot open the file without it being decrypted first. If I was using Microsoft Edge, they would have been able to assist as that is a Microsoft product, but as Firefox is a third party application, they've asked for assistance.  By the way, these are NOT scammers or hackers 'helping' me, but Microsoft support and I get everything emailed about our support etc.  </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1230;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",darrenallen73
