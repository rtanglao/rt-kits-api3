I am a Mac user. I use Sugarsync cloud service to keep my Mac Studio desktop (OS 12.6.3 Monterey) and Macbook Air (OS 13.3 Ventura) laptop in sync. I am running Firefox 133.0. </p><p>I have noticed that Firefox .png screenshots have not been uploading properly to Sugarsync for the last 6 months or so. In Finder a green tick appears which indicates that a file has been properly uploaded to SugarSync but when I go to the Sugarsync app I can see the following error message for such files ""Waiting on upload from Mac Studio"". This means that screenshots I take on my desktop do not go across to my laptop and vice versa. </p><p>I spoke to the very helpful tech support (Luis M, senior tech support) at Sugarsync today and he and his colleague were able to figure out that the problem has to do with the attributes of the saved .png files. </p><p>I will outline the issue in detail: </p><p>On a Mac you can examine the attributes of a file by doing the following: - right click on the folder in which your file is located and click ""new terminal at folder"". This opens a new terminal window - type the following: xattr -l and then drag and drop the file name from finder next to the ""xattr -l"" and then insert a space, a dot and a forward slash and press enter,  i.e. myusername@NameOfMyComputer Foldername % xattr -l full path and file name ./ </p><p>For example if I take a screenshot of the following URL: <a href=""https://www.mlb.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mlb.com/</a> and I save the screenshot in a folder I have named ""Firefox Screenshots"" it saves as as ""Screenshot 2024-12-07 at 14-48-02 <a href=""http://MLB.com"" rel=""nofollow"">MLB.com</a> The Official Site of Major League Baseball"" on my computer. I can examine it's attributes in terminal using the steps outlined above: </p><p>myusername@NameOfMyComputer Firefox Screenshots % xattr -l /Users/myusername/Firefox\ Screenshots/Screenshot\ 2024-12-07\ at\ 14-46-28\ The\ New\ York\ Times\ -\ Breaking\ News\ US\ News\ World\ News\ and\ Videos.png ./ </p><p>When I click enter it generates a massive amount of information that looks like this: /Users/myusername/Firefox Screenshots/Screenshot 2024-12-07 at 14-46-28 The New York Times - Breaking News US News World News and Videos.png: com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms: bplist00?_ /Users/myusername/Firefox Screenshots/Screenshot 2024-12-07 at 14-46-28 The New York Times - Breaking News US News World News and Videos.png: com.apple.quarantine: 0081;6753c517;Firefox;0F67116D-C970-45CB-A578-65EAFC93F6DD myusername@NameOfMyComputer Firefox Screenshots % xattr -l /Users/myusername/Firefox\ Screenshots/Screenshot\ 2024-12-07\ at\ 14-48-02\ <a href=""http://MLB.com"" rel=""nofollow"">MLB.com</a>\ The\ Official\ Site\ of\ Major\ League\ Baseball.png ./ /Users/myusername/Firefox Screenshots/Screenshot 2024-12-07 at 14-48-02 <a href=""http://MLB.com"" rel=""nofollow"">MLB.com</a> The Official Site of Major League Baseball.png: com.apple.metadata:kMDItemWhereFroms: bplist00?_Q?^data:image/png;base64,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 etc etc etc </p><p>The total output is over 19 million characters long due to the long alphabet soup that is generated.
