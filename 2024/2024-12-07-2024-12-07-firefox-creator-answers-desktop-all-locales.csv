I always put my pc in ""sleep"" mode at night. This morning it wouldn't ""wake up"" so I held the power button down until it shut down (Windows 11). Then I hit the power button and it started fine. I opened Firefox (Version 333.0) and all my tabs were gone. My wife uses Firefox on her Mac laptop and the same thing happened to her. She put her laptop to sleep last night and this morning all her tabs were gone. </p><p>After 3 hours of restoring my tabs, i went to settings and the option for Firefox to reopen all tabs from previous session was grayed out and clicking the circle next to it didn't do anything. </p><p>I am assuming this was caused by a Firefox update and am hoping someone has a fix for this. I'd hate to go back to Chrome, but I can't live with spending three hours of each day restoring tabs. I'd appreciate and be eternally grateful for any assistance and fix for this issue. </p><p>Thanks! </p><p>Bob Kitsis bkitsis@yahoo.com </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,1692561;1692563;,bkitsis

I've had this job almost 9 years and would be lost without these bookmarks--a treasure trove of resources gathered over those years.
