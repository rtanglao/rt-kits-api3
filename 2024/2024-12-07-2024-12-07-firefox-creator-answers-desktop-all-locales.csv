Please try again later.,"<p>Earlier today I was trying to watch Prime video and I kept getting an error saying that Firefox wasn't updated (which it was). I looked up some solutions, one of which suggested turning the DRM setting off and then back on. That was a mistake, because after that, any time I opened Prime or netflix, the error I got was ""Firefox is installing components needed to play the audio or video on this page. Please try again later. "" </p><p>Then, I looked that up and found out that my Widevine was just not installing. So, I found an alternative way to manually install it, which shows that it is installed in the Add-ons Manager, but I keep getting that error and nothing works. Prior to this my Netflix was still fine and working.  </p><p>I've tried a few other things including closing firefox, refreshing firefox from the troubleshoot settings, and restarting my computer. </p><p>I am out of ideas, and I wanted to see if anyone can help me before I have to jump ship to another browser. </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",gurjapbhullar

I am running Firefox 133.0. </p><p>I have noticed that Firefox .png screenshots have not been uploading properly to Sugarsync for the last 6 months or so. In Finder a green tick appears which indicates that a file has been properly uploaded to SugarSync but when I go to the Sugarsync app I can see the following error message for such files ""Waiting on upload from Mac Studio"". This means that screenshots I take on my desktop do not go across to my laptop and vice versa. </p><p>I spoke to the very helpful tech support (Luis M, senior tech support) at Sugarsync today and he and his colleague were able to figure out that the problem has to do with the attributes of the saved .png files. </p><p>I will outline the issue in detail: </p><p>On a Mac you can examine the attributes of a file by doing the following: - right click on the folder in which your file is located and click ""new terminal at folder"". This opens a new terminal window - type the following: xattr -l and then drag and drop the file name from finder next to the ""xattr -l"" and then insert a space, a dot and a forward slash and press enter,  i.e. myusername@NameOfMyComputer Foldername % xattr -l full path and file name ./ </p><p>For example if I take a screenshot of the following URL: <a href=""https://www.mlb.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mlb.com/</a> and I save the screenshot in a folder I have named ""Firefox Screenshots"" it saves as as ""Screenshot 2024-12-07 at 14-48-02 <a href=""http://MLB.com"" rel=""nofollow"">MLB.com</a> The Official Site of Major League Baseball"" on my computer.
