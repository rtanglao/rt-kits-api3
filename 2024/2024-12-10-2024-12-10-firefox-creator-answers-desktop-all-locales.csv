If I just disable `media.hardware-video-decoding.enabled` and restart, then the problem goes away on Nightly. </p><p>Enabling/Disabling my user customizations don't seem to affect it. Enabling/Disabling addons don't affect it. Using a new empty profile also doesn't affect it, the problem persists. I tried deleting ""gmp-widevinecdm"" folder and redownloading it, still didn't solve the problem. </p><p>I seems to be some sort of regression, it used to work before a couple of days ago. Please fix, I hope the information I provided helps, as I like having hardware acceleration. </p><p>I also tried to update the display driver. nVidia Driver: 31.0.15.5176  now 32.0.15.6636 </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;nightly;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1693247;1693248;,luizfelipe
