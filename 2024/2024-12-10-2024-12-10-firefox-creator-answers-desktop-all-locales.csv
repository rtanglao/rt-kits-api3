This began to happen recently but I'd like to know how to configure Firefox to do search like it used to, in the URL bar not a new search bar, and disable this new search bar that disorients me when it pops up and disappears. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",BPaul_H

One of my local utility companies is not going to be supporting the use of Firefox on their website any longer. Has anyone else seen anything like this on other sites, or has this been brought up elsewhere? Frankly I find it outrageous and is forcing me and others to use Chromium based browsers (aside from Safari which I don't use). </p> <ul><li> I emailed the company asking for an explanation, and I'm awaiting a reply.  </li></ul> <p>I would share the URL for others to email and help press the company on the issue, but wasn't sure of the guidelines of the forum or if that was appropriate. I'm just irritated and venting sorry =/ </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",justinb

Then I tried to log into Aflac and got a message saying the site wasn't redirecting properly.  Again Chrome worked.
