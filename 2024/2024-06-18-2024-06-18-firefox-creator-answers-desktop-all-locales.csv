I then have to manually choose the correct app for opening the file, overrule error messages and delete the "".pdf"" when re-saving the file even though it recognises it is not really a pdf file. </p><p>I've tried to change the Firefox settings, clearing cache, restarting or deleting in config and other small attempts to reboot whatever suddenly started to cause this problem. As far as I can see, it is not an unknown issue, but I've not yet been able to find a solution to my problem, which is getting on my nerves. </p><p>Hope you can be of help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1270;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mikkelwg

The problem just started recently and I don't know what could have caused it because I haven't done anything that could affect downloads to my knowledge. Things I've already tried are </p> <ul><li> Reinstalling firefox (including full uninstall via ""Revo Uninstaller"" </li><li> Updating firefox to the latest version (127) </li><li> Disabled all firewalls </li><li> Chose the save location </li><li> Disabled all parental controls in windows  </li><li> Chose the ""don't enable HTTPS mode"" (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1414064"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1414064</a>) </li><li> Tried firefox &amp; windows safe mode (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1442742"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1442742</a>) </li><li> Chose a different save location inside my computer (a folder other than downloads) </li><li> Cleared download history </li><li> Ran a chkdsk on windows </li></ul> <p>The thing is that everthing else of firefox works (browsing the web, watching videos, etc), it's only the downloads. It's also not a computer problem I think because I can download on other browsers (such as chrome and pale moon). Any help asap is appreciated. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",NuGUndam123456789

For my setup, I'm using a thinkpad with a wide gamut display running in fedora. </p><p>The issue is that an image exported from Darktable looks overly saturated in Firefox. I found I was able to fix this by specifying the color profile using the flag `gfx.color_management.display_profile`. However that profile is the OS default, and according to Firefox it should've been picked up when querying the OS. </p><p>How can I see what icc/color profile Firefox is using? Alternatively, what method is Firefox using to query the OS for its default profile? Thank you. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1270;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",bogardon
