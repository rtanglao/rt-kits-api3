For the last recent issue, I was told a website doesn't work correctly basically with Firefox and that I needed to use Google Chrome or Edge. I recently received an email from Mozilla which had a link to an article titled, ""Here’s what we’re working on in Firefox"" at: <a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/heres-what-were-working-on-in-firefox/?amp;utm_source=fxakip&amp;utm_campaign=mozilla-brand&amp;utm_content=fxakipnewsletter20240618-na"" rel=""nofollow"">link text</a>  and in the article in large print it says, ""Bringing you the features you’ve been asking for.""

The security key mfr says there is no way it can be the key causing this and suggested contacting Firefox.  I have reinstalled Firefox and the same thing happens.

In the past couple weeks Firefox, and related Private Browsing browser, seem to have developed consistent hangups in fetching data across a pretty wide range of sites. Both my banking sites will not load after logging in to them, just spins and spins. Also some very general searches will not load any results for minutes at a time, I just give up and kill them. I've uninstalled/cleaned/reinstalled latest version, etc, etc. By comparison, these same data fetches in banking sites, etc, work dandy in Duckduckgo browser, which is also a heavy no-trace browser. This ominous to me as I really like Firefox and do NOT want to have to resort to Edge. Duckduckgo browser is very good but doesn't have nearly the menu or favorites sort of features that Firefox does. Can you investigate?  This is typical Win 10 system in Lenovo i7, been working like a champ till just recently, no system changes.

Yesterday, I passed a message from <a href=""https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/setup/linux_build.html#building"" rel=""nofollow"">https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/setup/linux_build.html#building</a> ---The official documentation for firefox on Linux compiles and installs a Linux system with aarch64 architecture on an Ubuntu host with x86 architecture. In fact, I only modified a file called  "". mozconfig""  and added the following information: ""ac-add-options  -- target=aarch64-linux-gnu      mk-add-options  MOZ-OBJDIR=@TOPSRCDIR@/obj-aarch64-linux mk-add-options AUTOCLOBBER=1"". After compiling for a while, I obtained a folder called ""obj-aarch64-linux"". I used the command ""file   /obj-aarch64-linux/dist/bin/firefox"" to check the properties of the knowability file as follows: "" firefox: ELF 64 bit LSB shared object, ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter/lib/ld Linux arch64. so. 1, for GNU/Linux 3.7.0, BuildID [md5/uuid]=6b1bede035b0d0bc9930d0d4d88c3c14, with debug_info, not stripped ”. I think I have completed cross compilation, so I compressed the ""obj-aarch64-linux"" folder on a USB drive and copied it to my aarch64 architecture development board. And when I tried to launch the browser on the development board using the ""./obj-aarch64-linux/dist/bin/firefox"" command, I received an error message saying ""Couldn't load XPCOM"". It is worth mentioning that firefox is installed by default on my development board, but I need to compile and install its source code, and local compilation cannot be achieved on my development board, so I made the above operation. So, I want to know how to solve this problem, or if there are any errors in my cross compilation process. Thank you for your help and look forward to your prompt reply. </p>",linux;desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",158107824

For my setup, I'm using a thinkpad with a wide gamut display running in fedora. </p><p>The issue is that an image exported from Darktable looks overly saturated in Firefox. I found I was able to fix this by specifying the color profile using the flag `gfx.color_management.display_profile`. However that profile is the OS default, and according to Firefox it should've been picked up when querying the OS. </p><p>How can I see what icc/color profile Firefox is using? Alternatively, what method is Firefox using to query the OS for its default profile? Thank you. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1270;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",bogardon
