Yesterday, I passed a message from <a href=""https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/setup/linux_build.html#building"" rel=""nofollow"">https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/setup/linux_build.html#building</a> ---The official documentation for firefox on Linux compiles and installs a Linux system with aarch64 architecture on an Ubuntu host with x86 architecture. In fact, I only modified a file called  "". mozconfig""  and added the following information: ""ac-add-options  -- target=aarch64-linux-gnu      mk-add-options  MOZ-OBJDIR=@TOPSRCDIR@/obj-aarch64-linux mk-add-options AUTOCLOBBER=1"". After compiling for a while, I obtained a folder called ""obj-aarch64-linux"". I used the command ""file   /obj-aarch64-linux/dist/bin/firefox"" to check the properties of the knowability file as follows: "" firefox: ELF 64 bit LSB shared object, ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter/lib/ld Linux arch64. so. 1, for GNU/Linux 3.7.0, BuildID [md5/uuid]=6b1bede035b0d0bc9930d0d4d88c3c14, with debug_info, not stripped ”. I think I have completed cross compilation, so I compressed the ""obj-aarch64-linux"" folder on a USB drive and copied it to my aarch64 architecture development board. And when I tried to launch the browser on the development board using the ""./obj-aarch64-linux/dist/bin/firefox"" command, I received an error message saying ""Couldn't load XPCOM"". It is worth mentioning that firefox is installed by default on my development board, but I need to compile and install its source code, and local compilation cannot be achieved on my development board, so I made the above operation. So, I want to know how to solve this problem, or if there are any errors in my cross compilation process. Thank you for your help and look forward to your prompt reply. </p>",linux;desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",158107824

However that profile is the OS default, and according to Firefox it should've been picked up when querying the OS. </p><p>How can I see what icc/color profile Firefox is using?
