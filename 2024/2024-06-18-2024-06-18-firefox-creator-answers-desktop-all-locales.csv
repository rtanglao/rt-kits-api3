Yesterday, I passed a message from <a href=""https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/setup/linux_build.html#building"" rel=""nofollow"">https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/setup/linux_build.html#building</a> ---The official documentation for firefox on Linux compiles and installs a Linux system with aarch64 architecture on an Ubuntu host with x86 architecture. In fact, I only modified a file called  "". mozconfig""  and added the following information: ""ac-add-options  -- target=aarch64-linux-gnu      mk-add-options  MOZ-OBJDIR=@TOPSRCDIR@/obj-aarch64-linux mk-add-options AUTOCLOBBER=1"". After compiling for a while, I obtained a folder called ""obj-aarch64-linux"". I used the command ""file   /obj-aarch64-linux/dist/bin/firefox"" to check the properties of the knowability file as follows: "" firefox: ELF 64 bit LSB shared object, ARM aarch64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter/lib/ld Linux arch64. so. 1, for GNU/Linux 3.7.0, BuildID [md5/uuid]=6b1bede035b0d0bc9930d0d4d88c3c14, with debug_info, not stripped ‚Äù. I think I have completed cross compilation, so I compressed the ""obj-aarch64-linux"" folder on a USB drive and copied it to my aarch64 architecture development board. And when I tried to launch the browser on the development board using the ""./obj-aarch64-linux/dist/bin/firefox"" command, I received an error message saying ""Couldn't load XPCOM"". It is worth mentioning that firefox is installed by default on my development board, but I need to compile and install its source code, and local compilation cannot be achieved on my development board, so I made the above operation. So, I want to know how to solve this problem, or if there are any errors in my cross compilation process. Thank you for your help and look forward to your prompt reply. </p>",linux;desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",158107824

I then have to manually choose the correct app for opening the file, overrule error messages and delete the "".pdf"" when re-saving the file even though it recognises it is not really a pdf file. </p><p>I've tried to change the Firefox settings, clearing cache, restarting or deleting in config and other small attempts to reboot whatever suddenly started to cause this problem. As far as I can see, it is not an unknown issue, but I've not yet been able to find a solution to my problem, which is getting on my nerves. </p><p>Hope you can be of help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1270;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mikkelwg

The problem just started recently and I don't know what could have caused it because I haven't done anything that could affect downloads to my knowledge. Things I've already tried are </p> <ul><li> Reinstalling firefox (including full uninstall via ""Revo Uninstaller"" </li><li> Updating firefox to the latest version (127) </li><li> Disabled all firewalls </li><li> Chose the save location </li><li> Disabled all parental controls in windows  </li><li> Chose the ""don't enable HTTPS mode"" (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1414064"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1414064</a>) </li><li> Tried firefox &amp; windows safe mode (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1442742"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1442742</a>) </li><li> Chose a different save location inside my computer (a folder other than downloads) </li><li> Cleared download history </li><li> Ran a chkdsk on windows </li></ul> <p>The thing is that everthing else of firefox works (browsing the web, watching videos, etc), it's only the downloads. It's also not a computer problem I think because I can download on other browsers (such as chrome and pale moon). Any help asap is appreciated. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",NuGUndam123456789

For my setup, I'm using a thinkpad with a wide gamut display running in fedora. </p><p>The issue is that an image exported from Darktable looks overly saturated in Firefox. I found I was able to fix this by specifying the color profile using the flag `gfx.color_management.display_profile`. However that profile is the OS default, and according to Firefox it should've been picked up when querying the OS. </p><p>How can I see what icc/color profile Firefox is using? Alternatively, what method is Firefox using to query the OS for its default profile? Thank you. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1270;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",bogardon
