I don't exactly remember the link I went to, but since I am logged in to my browser with a Firefox account, I could opt to log in to that forum with it, I didn't need to type my password, just click the button to use my existing account. So far so good. </p><p>I got an answer via e-mail. The email contained no plain link back to the post or answer. It contained a big green button ""Mark as solved"" and a link ""This doesn't solve my problem"", graphically positioned as to make it quite analogous to the big green button.  </p><p>I didn't want to quickly mark the answer as either one, I wanted to go there to reply.  </p><p>In the answer, however, the person answering me included a link to another post. I hoped that, clicking on this one, would  - first of all - be of interest, and - secondly - lead me back to the forum in a neutral way so that I could find my own post there via my profile. Again, I clicked on a button to use Mozilla to login. Now I seem to have a second profile, the two are obviously not the same. Also, the forums don't quite seem to be the same. Support Mozilla vs Connect Mozilla. Why are they handled differently, why didn't I get the option to login with my firefox-account, when Connect Mozilla even gets my email adress automatically from it? </p><p>So, I had to try one of the buttons, they have different link addresses. I obviously tried the one that said ""This doesn't solve my problem"", and it plainly led me back to the answer on the (correct) forum and opened the replyform, also showing a button again: ""Solved"" and ""This doesn't solve my problem"". Why isn't the link in the email just labelled as linking you back to the forum, like ""View thread"" or ""Reply to thread"".  </p><p>In addition I did not easily understand how to vote for the suggested idea in the linked post. A community manager had posted the reply that the post is now idea-status and that it is open to ""votes (aka kudos)"". No link or button to do it. Some scrolling around led my eye to an answer in the post to have one kudo, so I understood it had something to do with the like-button. Scrolled up to the original post, which did not have the word kudo on its like button, just a number. Hovering over it I finally got to know that I could give kudos by pressing this button. I got confused since several answers had this button. It was just a like-button to me, not the special vote-button that only appears if a manager opens the vote. Why is the manager text not just: ""Vote (aka 'leave kudos') by clicking the like-button, which is now enabled."" </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1280;,firefox,other,en-US,1662226;,mak2

MYBAD, fersure, i am  hoping against all odds that you  can help me recover all my  old  passwords which  i have stored on the Fire Fox app that i  was using, quite happily, with the old drive, i  still have some, a handful of those addresses and passwords on file, but not near enough  to  get back  to  where i  was online b4 the old drive kacked, i was hoping that if i  gave you  the addies and passwords, you  could somehow find that  Firefox i  had downloaded? I gotta say  that i  feel SO stupid asking this, but trust me...LESSON WELL LEARNED!!! if you  can  help  me that would be AWESOMELY MASSIVELY GOOD!!!!
