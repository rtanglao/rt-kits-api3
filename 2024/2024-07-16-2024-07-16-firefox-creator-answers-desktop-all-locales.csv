Turns out i  have NOT done that... MYBAD, fersure, i am  hoping against all odds that you  can help me recover all my  old  passwords which  i have stored on the Fire Fox app that i  was using, quite happily, with the old drive, i  still have some, a handful of those addresses and passwords on file, but not near enough  to  get back  to  where i  was online b4 the old drive kacked, i was hoping that if i  gave you  the addies and passwords, you  could somehow find that  Firefox i  had downloaded? I gotta say  that i  feel SO stupid asking this, but trust me...LESSON WELL LEARNED!!! if you  can  help  me that would be AWESOMELY MASSIVELY GOOD!!!!
