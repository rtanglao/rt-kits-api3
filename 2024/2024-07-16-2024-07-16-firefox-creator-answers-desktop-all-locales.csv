I file with NYSCEF which is the electronic court filing portal.  As of yesterday my PDF files would not show up on the portal as a complete document. I never had this problem before. Many documents were missing pages or parts of pages when I tried to access them.   I then used Chrome and all the documents loaded properly. In addition the print function with a Brother MFC L2700DW printer will not work and an error notification appears on my computer screen. The print function with my Brother MFC 9340 CDW works fine. The NYSCEF documents all load properly with Chrome and the printers work with Chrome.   How do I get back to the prior version of Firefox?  Or how can this issue be resolved.  I like the feel of Firefox better than Chrome but will have to discontinue using Firefox if the issues cannot be resolved.

However, occasionally the R.C. gets what I think is an erroneous result.  Recent case was a Japanese stationery product (on the U.S. site) where all of the reviews were in Japanese. R.C. rated the reviews as an ""F,""  I presume because R.C. didn't translate them. But Firefox could easily translate to English, and looking at them they seemed both authentic and positive.  My real question is this: for a new, beta product I would think Mozilla would welcome some reviews of the Review Checker. I could find no way to do this.  Hence  - this posting.  Suggestion - a feature on the still in Beta review checker to grade the check of the review.  </p><p>I have no idea if a posting here gets to the right place, but if not I would appreciate a pointer to the correct place.  thx, . </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1280;,firefox,other,en-US,1662286;,markeh

I don't exactly remember the link I went to, but since I am logged in to my browser with a Firefox account, I could opt to log in to that forum with it, I didn't need to type my password, just click the button to use my existing account. So far so good. </p><p>I got an answer via e-mail. The email contained no plain link back to the post or answer. It contained a big green button ""Mark as solved"" and a link ""This doesn't solve my problem"", graphically positioned as to make it quite analogous to the big green button.  </p><p>I didn't want to quickly mark the answer as either one, I wanted to go there to reply.  </p><p>In the answer, however, the person answering me included a link to another post. I hoped that, clicking on this one, would  - first of all - be of interest, and - secondly - lead me back to the forum in a neutral way so that I could find my own post there via my profile. Again, I clicked on a button to use Mozilla to login. Now I seem to have a second profile, the two are obviously not the same. Also, the forums don't quite seem to be the same. Support Mozilla vs Connect Mozilla. Why are they handled differently, why didn't I get the option to login with my firefox-account, when Connect Mozilla even gets my email adress automatically from it? </p><p>So, I had to try one of the buttons, they have different link addresses. I obviously tried the one that said ""This doesn't solve my problem"", and it plainly led me back to the answer on the (correct) forum and opened the replyform, also showing a button again: ""Solved"" and ""This doesn't solve my problem"". Why isn't the link in the email just labelled as linking you back to the forum, like ""View thread"" or ""Reply to thread"".  </p><p>In addition I did not easily understand how to vote for the suggested idea in the linked post. A community manager had posted the reply that the post is now idea-status and that it is open to ""votes (aka kudos)"". No link or button to do it. Some scrolling around led my eye to an answer in the post to have one kudo, so I understood it had something to do with the like-button. Scrolled up to the original post, which did not have the word kudo on its like button, just a number. Hovering over it I finally got to know that I could give kudos by pressing this button. I got confused since several answers had this button. It was just a like-button to me, not the special vote-button that only appears if a manager opens the vote. Why is the manager text not just: ""Vote (aka 'leave kudos') by clicking the like-button, which is now enabled."" </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1280;,firefox,other,en-US,1662226;1662327;1662329;,mak2
