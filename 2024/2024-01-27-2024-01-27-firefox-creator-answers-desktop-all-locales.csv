The window asking if I would like to start in troubleshoot mode briefly flickers on the screen a few seconds later, and I am unable to start it in troubleshoot mode. I also have this problem with Google Chrome, but not with Microsoft Edge, which still works fine. I also downloaded Opera and I found that Opera works fine as well. I have tried various solutions I found online and none of them have worked yet. However, when I started Windows 11 in Safe Mode, Firefox still wouldn’t open initially but this time it did let me open troubleshoot mode, which I was able to succesfully start. In troubleshoot mode, I turned off hardware acceleration and all my extensions, and once I exited troubleshoot mode, Firefox was able to start normally in Safe Mode. However, I do not know if hardware acceleration or the extensions actually caused the issue because even if I turned them back on, Firefox continued to run normally in Safe Mode. Once I exited Windows Safe Mode, however, Firefox still continued not to open, and I still couldn’t access troubleshoot mode. Using the shift key trick to open Firefox in troubleshoot mode doesn’t work either. I would appreciate any help I can get with this issue. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1633531;1633533;,diessonic

This system has run almost flawlessly for many years.  Updated to 20.3 in early 2022.  Rather suddenly (yesterday) Firefox began repeatedly crashing, displaying 'Mozilla Crash Reports' (example attached).  Firefox appears to initiate as expected.  However, on display (e.g., Youtube, Facebook, web page, etc.) request, Firefox immediately throws a 'Mozilla Crash Report'. I do not recall any changes to the system that might have generated this condition, and have spend most of today unsuccessfully troubleshooting. </p><p>MB: Gigabyte F2A85XM-D3H CPU: AMD A-10 5800K APU with Radeon HD Graphics OS: Kernel: 5.4.0.170 generic x86_64bits; on 128MB SSD Firefox for Linux Mint mint-001 - 1.0 (122.0 (64 bit)) RAM: 7 GB </p><p>I have attempted to follow some of the moz://a Support pages (i.e., ""Troubleshoot extensions, themes and hardware acceleration issues to solve common Firefox problems"").  I have noted that while in 'Troubleshooting mode', Firefox appears to behave as expected, seeming to implicate extensions, themes and/or hardware acceleration.  However, under normal Firefox operation enabling/disabling these does not seem to resolve the issue. </p><pre>    * Hardware acceleration (on or off) still results in display of 'Mozilla Crash Report',     * Default theme is selected, and     * I don't appear to have any unaccounted extensions or other addons enabled. </pre> <p>Any thoughts and/or additional guidance would be greatly appreciated. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,customize,en-US,1633360;1633471;1633479;1633488;,Grizz952
