I signed in to my Mozilla account on both computers, and the sync process worked just fine. For weeks, my synced tabs appeared in my Firefox sidebar on my new laptop, and all was good. However, the other day, I had to restart my computer a few times, and when I open Firefox again, my synced tabs were gone. On my Mozilla account page, it still says that I am signed in to my old laptop. How can I see my synced tabs again? Thank you very much for your help! </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;firefox-1320;firefox-13202;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",alanadoty

Yet I have never been to France or speak French. When I created my account I created it in English as French is not my language. When I first downloaded firefox I naturally downloaded  the English version and but as soon as I logged into my account everything changed to French. My search results are in French, the websites presented to me in French. I have changed the language settings to English, I have also changed my profile to Canada and Language as English yet my account is still in the French region and the language French. I would like my region to be changed to Canada and my default language to be English. Please look at the attached screen shot. The system language of my computer is also English. </p><p><br> Thanks, Ruptanu. </p>",firefox;accounts;,firefox,accounts,en-US,1688406;,rupai

It takes password fine and works just fine on sites just as designed and has worked for years.  Lately last couple weeks since last update to 132.0.1 I notice a change.  I didn't notice before this update.    When starting Firefox it asks for primary password which is normal, I enter it and all is fine.  I can go to sites and all works fine, passwords and user id are entered when prompted.   However, later in the day when I go to a site wanting password, I get the prompt to enter primary password again.  That never use to happen, once I entered the primary password, it didn't prompt again unless Firefox was restarted.   Has anyone else seen this?  Maybe it started and I just didn't notice some time ago.  I know it wasn't that long ago the primary password prompt didn't have the little eye so you could see what you typed.  I liked that, because FF for whatever reason wasn't always realizing I had the shift key pressed.  Now with the eyeball I can see that it doesn't have what I typed, but that is not the problem I am asking about. Below is what Mozilla says about primary password: </p><p>Important: After you have defined and set your Primary Password, you will be prompted to <strong>enter it once</strong> for each Firefox session, when Firefox needs access to your stored passwords. This also applies if you want to add, remove or show a password. </p>",firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",diverjer

However, another problem remains since the last update: my open tabs have also disappeared, and there were quite a few, as I was making a survey of equipment to buy and I left each model on a tab, for later comparison. I lost them all and a lot of time too. Is there any process that allows me to recover the lost tabs? </p><p>Joao Duarte </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",vieitasduarte
