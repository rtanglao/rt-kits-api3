Geen idee wat er is gebeurd. Er stond wel een map met oude firefox bestanden op het bureaublad. Aangezien ik geen idee had waarom dat daar stond heb ik die map verwijderd. Ik probeer nu mijn bladwijaers terug te krijgen met alle mogelijke manieren die ik inzake dit onderwerp heb kunnen vinden maar het lukt mij niet. Dus bijv. de methode bij bladwijzers beheren en herstellen. Als ik Firefox start komt telkens de updater. Die durf ik nu niet uit te voeren. Ik heb nog 3 profile maps gevonden, van vandaag, van 14-11 (toen het mis ging) en van 12 september. Ik heb ergens gelezen dat er wel 15 backups zouden moeten zijn van Firefox. Ik vind ze niet. Al zou ik het profiel van 12 september kunnen terugzetten, zou ik al heel blij zijn. Ik heb ook nog favorieten van Microsoft Edge maar die zijn van zo'n 2 jaar geleden. Iemand een oplossing?

I noticed that they seem to be consistent even after reinstalling my browser or system, as long as I log into my Mozilla account (even though I have completely removed all my stored passwords from Firefox, and disabled the feature that stores them). I also noticed that I accidentally put an important password in the suggestions, and I would love to remove it somehow. I read in the help articles that the arrow keys and then shift+delete might work, but as soon as I press the arrow keys, the whole suggestion list gets covered by suggestions from  the Bitwarden extension. It would be nice if that could be prevented somehow, and if there was a clear graphical way to remove the suggestions, perhaps a trash can icon on the right side? </p>",linux;firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",blindfolded

I signed in to my Mozilla account on both computers, and the sync process worked just fine. For weeks, my synced tabs appeared in my Firefox sidebar on my new laptop, and all was good. However, the other day, I had to restart my computer a few times, and when I open Firefox again, my synced tabs were gone. On my Mozilla account page, it still says that I am signed in to my old laptop. How can I see my synced tabs again?

My search results are in French, the websites presented to me in French. I have changed the language settings to English, I have also changed my profile to Canada and Language as English yet my account is still in the French region and the language French.

It takes password fine and works just fine on sites just as designed and has worked for years.  Lately last couple weeks since last update to 132.0.1 I notice a change.  I didn't notice before this update.    When starting Firefox it asks for primary password which is normal, I enter it and all is fine.  I can go to sites and all works fine, passwords and user id are entered when prompted.   However, later in the day when I go to a site wanting password, I get the prompt to enter primary password again.  That never use to happen, once I entered the primary password, it didn't prompt again unless Firefox was restarted.   Has anyone else seen this?  Maybe it started and I just didn't notice some time ago.  I know it wasn't that long ago the primary password prompt didn't have the little eye so you could see what you typed.  I liked that, because FF for whatever reason wasn't always realizing I had the shift key pressed.  Now with the eyeball I can see that it doesn't have what I typed, but that is not the problem I am asking about. Below is what Mozilla says about primary password: </p><p>Important: After you have defined and set your Primary Password, you will be prompted to <strong>enter it once</strong> for each Firefox session, when Firefox needs access to your stored passwords. This also applies if you want to add, remove or show a password. </p>",firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",diverjer

I lost them all and a lot of time too.
