But when using vertical tabs, you can a ""useless"" row that takes almost as much space as the horizontal tabs row, so vertical tabs doesn't make you gain that much browsing space. </p><p>Thanks </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,1688392;,tanin

However, another problem remains since the last update: my open tabs have also disappeared, and there were quite a few, as I was making a survey of equipment to buy and I left each model on a tab, for later comparison. I lost them all and a lot of time too. Is there any process that allows me to recover the lost tabs? </p><p>Joao Duarte </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",vieitasduarte
