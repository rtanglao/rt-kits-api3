I didn't close out of or update Firefox, I was just browsing online. I didn't change anything in my settings or have opened that up in days at the minimum. I cannot figure out how to either revert back or tell Firefox to not show me these choices so I can get my old ones. </p><p>I'll give an example: When I typed in ""ma"" it would show me <a href=""http://mangadex.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mangadex.com</a>, which I often go to. Now when I do it not only is 5th on the list it shows up and fills in ""<a href=""https://www.manticgames.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.manticgames.com/</a>"", which I don't have that specific page bookmarked. I have ""<a href=""https://www.manticgames.com/games/kings-of-war/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.manticgames.com/games/kings-of-war/</a>"" bookmarked, but not that homepage. But now all of a sudden it is showing me the homepage of that site when I begin to type in ""ma"". </p><p>This is incredibly irritating and I have no idea why it's doing this at me out of nowhere. I don't want about anything showing up besides my bookmarks and <em>specifically</em> only the pages I bookmarked. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1250;firefox-12501;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",konahrik20

After migrating my data from my old one I noticed that when using Firefox my Facebook account was not working properly.  I no longer could access my own page or the pages of friends.  However, I could access some group accounts I'm associated with.  On Safari, everything works fine.  I suspect something must have been compromised during the data migration.   </p><p>I deleted the Firefox app from my new computer and then reinstalled it but to no avail.  When I'm in Facebook and try to access my page I get an error message.  My OS system to up to date and apparently my Firefox is up to date as well.  Any suggestions?
