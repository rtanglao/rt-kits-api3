After migrating my data from my old one I noticed that when using Firefox my Facebook account was not working properly.  I no longer could access my own page or the pages of friends.  However, I could access some group accounts I'm associated with.  On Safari, everything works fine.  I suspect something must have been compromised during the data migration.   </p><p>I deleted the Firefox app from my new computer and then reinstalled it but to no avail.  When I'm in Facebook and try to access my page I get an error message.  My OS system to up to date and apparently my Firefox is up to date as well.  Any suggestions?
