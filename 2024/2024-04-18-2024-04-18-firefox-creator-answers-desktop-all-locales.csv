People use browsers to write emails and other online documents, and the hotkey combo for things like Bold and Italics on Macs are Cmd-B and Cmd-I. All such websites I use recognize that as a standard, but Firefox insists on using those same commands for browser features I almost never use and certainly don't need hotkeys for. </p><p>All the information I'm finding online on how to fix this is deeply unhelpful and far more complicated than I can handle. Can you please tell me if there is a simple way to stop Firefox from pulling up Page Information and Bookmarks as a result of keyboard commands, or at least for me to change what those commands are so that they don't conflict with industry standard commands for text formatting on the vast majority of websites? </p><p>-Nic </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,customize,en-US,1648111;,nic.carrier

This behavior contrasts with other browsers, which handle SVG scaling seamlessly, typically adapting to the specified width or inheriting dimensions from parent elements. </p><p>During our website development, primarily through Elementor and leveraging Flexbox in a WordPress environment, this discrepancy becomes evident. The issue persists exclusively in Firefox, confirmed through extensive testing across various browsers and OS's with multiple SVG files and sites. </p><p>For diagnostic purposes, I recommend conducting controlled tests with SVG images embedded with our current setup. Set the SVGs to 100% width without defining their height and observe how they render in Firefox compared to other browsers. This should help ascertain whether the behavior in Firefox is anomalous. </p><p>I am assuming it may be with the way the markup of the SVG is rendered as it doesn't happen with all SVGs, however, other browsers appear to fix or override whatever is getting in the way from rendering...it is a strange issue. </p><p>I have included two images as an example. As you can see in the first image, the SVG isn't rendering (in Firefox) , but does render in Chrome/Safari. It only works when I define a height in px value on Firefox. </p><p>Please let me know if further information is required or if any specific steps need to be undertaken to address this issue. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",6pzqdwqjxs

I didn't close out of or update Firefox, I was just browsing online. I didn't change anything in my settings or have opened that up in days at the minimum. I cannot figure out how to either revert back or tell Firefox to not show me these choices so I can get my old ones. </p><p>I'll give an example: When I typed in ""ma"" it would show me <a href=""http://mangadex.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mangadex.com</a>, which I often go to. Now when I do it not only is 5th on the list it shows up and fills in ""<a href=""https://www.manticgames.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.manticgames.com/</a>"", which I don't have that specific page bookmarked. I have ""<a href=""https://www.manticgames.com/games/kings-of-war/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.manticgames.com/games/kings-of-war/</a>"" bookmarked, but not that homepage. But now all of a sudden it is showing me the homepage of that site when I begin to type in ""ma"". </p><p>This is incredibly irritating and I have no idea why it's doing this at me out of nowhere. I don't want about anything showing up besides my bookmarks and <em>specifically</em> only the pages I bookmarked. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1250;firefox-12501;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1648017;1648033;,konahrik20
