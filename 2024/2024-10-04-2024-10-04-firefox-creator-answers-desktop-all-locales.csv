For example if I hit add attachment to an email which is open on Mozilla nothing happens. It's the same if I try to upload a resume or a photo for example. I can drag and drop files to upload but some websites don't have that option. I have disabled the pop up blocker and nothing changed. It was the same when I was using chrome and I transferred the data and settings over. Could someone please advise? </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",rochellefyfe

The bluetooth audio device I am using are the Galaxy Buds FE.  </p><p>Audio desyncs from video playback when pausing a video (either by clicking pause, using the keyboard to press pause, or by pausing using the earbud touchpad). I noticed that with my desktop computer and my Samsung S22 Ultra phone, when pausing and unpausing a video, the video player has a brief buffering period to auto-sync the audio to the video; however, this is not occurring with the laptop and it causes the audio and video to desync.   </p><p>Any help you could provide with this matter would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",jameslee1
