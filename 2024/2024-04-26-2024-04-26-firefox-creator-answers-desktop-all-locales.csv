(Or sometimes, partway through.)  Scrolling past the video causes it to jump to a sticky position in the lower right corner of the window.  (See attached screenshot.)  Also, even if various disable-autoplay boxes are ticked in my settings, the shifted video will always start playing. </p><p>Granted, most sites provide a little ""X"" to close the video.  At worst, there is the pause option.  But still, it's an annoyance to have to do this on soooo many sites, every time I visit to read something. </p><p>Key word there: <strong>read</strong>. </p><p>My point is: if I wanted to watch the video, I would have, when it was right there in front of me.  Since I have scrolled past it, this ought to be an indication that I do not want to watch the video. </p><p>So, the request is some sort of option in Settings that would prevent this behavior.  Enabling it would do nothing else to the page except prevent the behavior as described. </p><p>Thanks for listening! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1250;firefox-12502;,firefox,other,en-US,1649669;,bjkeefe
