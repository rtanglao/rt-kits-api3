HP laptop, Firefox 125.0.2 Win 11 pro","<p>When browsing with Firefox, scrolling with the up/down arrow keys intermittently causes the keyboard to be disabled.  Trackpad and touchscreen still function, but keyboard becomes completely disabled, requiring a reboot.  </p><p>This ONLY happens while browsing with Firefox browser.  I cannot deliberately reproduce this, but it happens frequently - up to several times a day. It seems to be tied to multiple key hits on the down and/or up keys.  This only happens in Firefox, not in any other apps, including Visual Studio.   </p><p>This is a brand new HP laptop. HP support says that this is a Firefox support issue because it only happens on Firefox and no other programs or scenarios.    </p><p>Can you please help me to identify, troubleshoot and resolve this issue?   I am a software/database engineer but this is a little outside the scope of my knowledge. I should be able to conduct any tests or provide any needed feedback at a useful level with only a reasonable level of hand holding.

I wasn't getting any error messages from any other sites or attempts to connect with any other sites. </p><p>I contacted Kaiser and got some tech office in California (I'm in Hawaii).  I did all that they suggested, i.e. ""cleaning up"" my computer, and I even paid and installed a program called ""CClean"", and used ""Ninite.""  After making all the ""clean ups"" the error message was still happening, and later it even mentioned Firefox in the message. </p><p>At that point I had no idea what to do and went to ""help"" on the application menu.  Did the ""troubleshooting"" a couple times, and then saw a ""refresh"" button, that I thought was probably, and looked innocuous; this led to a bunch of other things that I certainly didn't want to mistakenly perform anything untoward. </p><p>After all this I was finally able to link properly with Kaiser, BUT ALL OF MY TABS WERE GONE! </p><p>This seems to be a real problem on Firefox, since I've NEVER seen anything that is easy to select to ""resolve"", ""reinstate"", or ""RECOVER"" tabs.

Depois de algum tempo retorna para a página inicial como se nenhuma busca tivesse sido feita.  Utilizo diariamente uma página que possui captcha, e frequentemente o captcha não aparece ou só aparece após diversos recarregamentos da página. O problema acontece de forma aleatória, nem sempre no mesmo site, e nem sempre para a mesma busca (às vezes carrega, às vezes não). Já experimentei, por diversas vezes, restaurar, desinstalar (excluindo a pasta do Firefox ou pelas configurações do Windows) e reinstalar, sair da conta, desligar todos os softwares antivirus, desabilitar todas as opções nativas de privacidade, mas nada funcionou. As mesmas buscas, na mesma sessão, através de outros mecanismos (bing e duck-duck go, por exemplo) funcionam NORMALMENTE. O problema não ocorre no modo de solução de problemas, nesse computador. As mesmas buscas pelo Google funcionam normalmente em diversos outros navegadores. Em resumo, o problema ocorre de forma intermitente, no Windows 10 e 11, exclusivamente no Firefox, somente utilizando o mecanismo de busca do Google, nas diversas configurações e situações citadas. Até o momento não ocorre no modo de solução de problemas. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1250;firefox-12502;,firefox,fix-problems,pt-BR,"",mauromescolinribeiro
