I was going to put it off, as I had 25 tabs open, but the notice indicated that my open tabs would be restored once the update was complete, so I approved the update. It download and I assume installed the update, seemed to temporarily close Firefox, and then reopened the original page with all my open tabs, plus an empty page. When I tried to open the tabs shown, they all indicated that the tab had crashed and then gave me the option of restoring that tab or on some restoring all tabs.  Neither worked, in fact, that Firefox page became completely unresponsive and would not allow me to browse new urls (the tabs just spun). I actually had to use MS Edge to get to anywhere to seek out someplace to make a report. I first went to the discussion group and opened up an account there, but from there noticed that feedback on Firefox was at a different url.  I then needed to create an account ""here"". Since nothing was working, I closed and reopened the Firefox page with all the tabs on it, figuring maybe it would restore the crashed tabs. It did not and all tabs were lost. I can probably get back to some of them using the history archive, but it was very disappointing and will be even more time consuming.  I am running the current version of Win 10 pro, 64 bit, on a PC.  I thought you would want to know about this.
