The loading screen is eternal and it doesnt show any kind of error (unless it tries to connect for too long like a couple of minutes, then the error does shows up). The site still sends me notificarions through the browser though. Any other site loads up without a problem. I tried to use methods mentioned in the help article (turned off proxy, turned on network.dns.disableIPv6, deleted cookies and cache). In other browsers (Edge, for example) <a href=""http://reddit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">reddit.com</a> loads just fine. Please help me if you can. </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",antontarasenko27

It was not. </p><p>Is there a setting that I can enable that I can download to make this happen? </p><p>I think extensions don't have the capability to prevent macOS from going to sleep. Correct me if I'm wrong. </p><p>A quick fix for now would be the `caffeinate`-command in the Terminal-app, but I think this is very resource-wasteful. </p><p>Thank you in advance! Kind regards. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",oushima

I was going to put it off, as I had 25 tabs open, but the notice indicated that my open tabs would be restored once the update was complete, so I approved the update. It download and I assume installed the update, seemed to temporarily close Firefox, and then reopened the original page with all my open tabs, plus an empty page. When I tried to open the tabs shown, they all indicated that the tab had crashed and then gave me the option of restoring that tab or on some restoring all tabs.  Neither worked, in fact, that Firefox page became completely unresponsive and would not allow me to browse new urls (the tabs just spun). I actually had to use MS Edge to get to anywhere to seek out someplace to make a report. I first went to the discussion group and opened up an account there, but from there noticed that feedback on Firefox was at a different url.  I then needed to create an account ""here"". Since nothing was working, I closed and reopened the Firefox page with all the tabs on it, figuring maybe it would restore the crashed tabs. It did not and all tabs were lost. I can probably get back to some of them using the history archive, but it was very disappointing and will be even more time consuming.  I am running the current version of Win 10 pro, 64 bit, on a PC.  I thought you would want to know about this.  Thank you for your time. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1651371;1651372;,artistik
