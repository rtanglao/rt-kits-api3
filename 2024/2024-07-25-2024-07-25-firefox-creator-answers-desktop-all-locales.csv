Error says that ""you may be behind a firewall"" </p><p>No firewall. Chrome, safari, MS Edge all connect to the internet but FF refuses to.  Toggling wifi on/off for a few mins does nothing.    Closing and reopening FF doesn't work.  The only solution is to completely restart the machine (macbook pro). </p><p>Needless to say, this is incredibly frustrating.  Anyone else having this issue? </p><p>It's really basic functionality like this I wish FF would focus on rather than all the experiments for new tab layouts, etc. that the community seems to be busy with.   Side note: there's other 'quality' issues with FF lately e.g. if the Print dialog is opened, the entire browser window ""greys out"" even when going back to any of the tabs or windows... it stays in this greyed out mode as though the application isn't the selected one even though it clearly says FF in the upper left as the open application. </p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.

Dear Firefox team, </p><p>I encountered a problem while using the Firefox Sync service. After registering an account with one of my email addresses, I tried to log into this account on another device, but it prompted me to register again. After following the instructions and registering, I found that both Firefox accounts are associated with the same email, but they cannot be linked together. Later, I tried using a different email address, but the same issue occurred. Finally, I attempted to log in with Google, only to discover that one of the devices does not have the option to log in with Google. I suspect this might be the reason why I cannot use Sync. The Firefox version on this device is 128.02, running on Win10. </p><p>Looking forward to your response. Wishing you a pleasant day. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1280;firefox-12802;,firefox,sync,en-US,1663972;1663974;,rhx3088892871
