Via a Lenovo docking I am connected to a screen with resolution 3440x1440.  </p><p>Sometimes when using firefox, all browser windows suddenly go blank (white/black screen). It mostly appears when a video is playing (e.g. the website from framework laptop (https://frame.work/at/de/products/laptop13-diy-intel-ultra-1) causes the issue very reliable... In the screenshot attached this website was running on the right side of the screen.  </p><p>I tried the different drivers, the official ones from Lenovo and the latest from AMD over several months now. The issue appears on both driver versions, sometimes more sometimes less. I also tried several troubleshooting methods like resetting firefox and so on...  </p><p>When I do click into a blank browser window the window comes back to life. Sometimes I have to minimize and maximize all windows to make them viewable again.  </p><p>Any ideas how to get rid of this behavior? </p>",desktop;troubleshooting;windows-11;firefox-1280;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",gamebird92

I have always kept it open and then today for some reason after a reboot of my machine, Firefox will NOT keep the sidebar open permanently.  I can see the sidebar button on the address bar, and pressing this button will reopen the sidebar, but I don't want to have to reopen it all the time because it doesn't save my size settings.  I have looked at the JSON file where this setting is supposedly stored and nothing looks wrong.  I even deleted this file (after making a backup) and nothing changed. </p><p>How do I get my sidebar to stay open so when I start up a new window, it is already open and I don't need to use the button or the keybind? </p>",desktop;windows-10;firefox-1280;customize-settings-and-preferences;firefox-12802;,firefox,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",denisemain

Dear Firefox team, </p><p>I encountered a problem while using the Firefox Sync service. After registering an account with one of my email addresses, I tried to log into this account on another device, but it prompted me to register again. After following the instructions and registering, I found that both Firefox accounts are associated with the same email, but they cannot be linked together. Later, I tried using a different email address, but the same issue occurred. Finally, I attempted to log in with Google, only to discover that one of the devices does not have the option to log in with Google. I suspect this might be the reason why I cannot use Sync. The Firefox version on this device is 128.02, running on Win10. </p><p>Looking forward to your response. Wishing you a pleasant day. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1280;firefox-12802;,firefox,sync,en-US,1663972;1663974;,rhx3088892871
