So when I started the sound from the second tab, the sound from the first tab is interrupted for a while (100-500ms). It is not related youtube, I examined that situation with radio streaming channels via start-stop music. The result is same. While playing music goes on from Mozilla browser, I opened music from also chrome without interruption. Also more tabs on chrome do not interrups the playing music from Mozilla (opening more sources or single sources from chrome is not interrupting) The interruption is occurs inside Firefox (between tabs).
