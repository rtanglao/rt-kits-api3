I could hear the video playing while I opened a new tab. Suddenly today the video pauses as soon as I click away to a NEW tab.  </p><p>Oddly enough, if I have any other tabs already opened, when I first click on one of those, I can then open a new tab without the video pausing. It's only if I go directly from a YouTube video (that's already playing) that it pauses when trying to open a new tab. Odd. </p><p>Why is this happening? and so suddenly? At least I have a work around but this is so weird. </p><p>Any ideas out there? </p><p>Thanks, Andre'a </p><p><br> BTW - Is ""Settings"" the best topic? or should I've chosen something else (like Performance)? </p>",settings;firefox;firefox-1320;firefox-13202;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",DreaSpirit
