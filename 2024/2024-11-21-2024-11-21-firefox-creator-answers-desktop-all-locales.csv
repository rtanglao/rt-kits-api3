I could hear the video playing while I opened a new tab. Suddenly today the video pauses as soon as I click away to a NEW tab.  </p><p>Oddly enough, if I have any other tabs already opened, when I first click on one of those, I can then open a new tab without the video pausing. It's only if I go directly from a YouTube video (that's already playing) that it pauses when trying to open a new tab. Odd. </p><p>Why is this happening? and so suddenly? At least I have a work around but this is so weird. </p><p>Any ideas out there? </p><p>Thanks, Andre'a </p><p><br> BTW - Is ""Settings"" the best topic? or should I've chosen something else (like Performance)? </p>",settings;firefox;firefox-1320;firefox-13202;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",DreaSpirit

When reopened, my previous tabs have disappeared.  While setting up my laptop on a docking station today, I had to reboot several times.  Every time it reopened my previously opened tabs are gone.  Yes, I have Settings set to re-open Firefox with previously opened tabs.  It has worked beautifully for me for years.  Does anyone know what is going on?  What I can do? </p>",firefox;windows-11;performance-and-connectivity;firefox-1320;firefox-13202;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1689195;,ScruffysMom

Instead I get error messages like error 404 or most recently, the attached which was from a link in an email from my doctor. I opened the same link using brave no problem. I have uninstalled and reinstalled firefox a few times. I have deleted all plug ins. I can open every single one of those links and any other links in brave or any other browser. Not firefox. This is frustrating. Any help would be appreciated. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1689191;1689193;1689194;1689212;,wenfarrow
