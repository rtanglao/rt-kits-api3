I just want to share this info to others. </p><p>Yesterday, I was tearing my hair because the Photos app in my Windows 11 just kept on crashing when I opened any image file (jpg, png, etc).  ""Crashing"" means the window was partially displayed on the screen but not the content, then two or three seconds later, it just closed itself! </p><p>Then by pure chance, I had to exit Firefox.  After that, Photos app was working just fine.  I was thinking ""what?""  Then I reopened Firefox.  Photos app crashed on opening.  So I was 100% sure that for some reason, running Firefox would crash Photos app. </p><p>So I think I had to share this information to the community.  Here I am. </p><p>Have a nice day. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",seak.tf+ff

I can access the content of the emails just fine if I use either of these other browsers. </p><p>I also have Firefox installed on my iPad AND on my Android phone.  The same thing happens on both of these devices as well—so this is not an issue with my Mac computer.  I can access the content of the email from Royal Mail via either Safari (on my iPad) or DuckDuckGo (on iPad AND my android phone.)  However, neither of these will show me the email when I use Firefox. </p><p>I can access the actual Royal Mail website with Firefox on my computer, no problem.  It’s just when I try to open emails from them that the problem arises.  </p><p>No idea what is causing this anomaly.  I can’t pinpoint exactly when it started, but it’s been going on for at least a month and maybe more. </p><p>I use the latest version of Firefox at all times on all devices, and my operating systems are up to date on my devices as well.  (I have the latest version of Sonoma on my Mac, I have iOS 17.7 on my iPad, and whatever the latest update for Motorola e14 is.) </p><p>I’m hoping you can offer a bit of advice.

My laptop is fairly new and handles most tasks smoothly, but when it comes to browsing with Firefox, I’m running into several problems. </p><p>Here’s what’s happening: </p><p>Lagging and Slowness: Whenever I open multiple tabs or use web apps, Firefox becomes sluggish. Pages load slowly, and switching between tabs is much slower than expected. </p><p>Freezing: Occasionally, Firefox will freeze for a few seconds, especially when I’m using extensions or trying to stream videos or handle media-heavy websites. </p><p>High CPU Usage: I’ve checked my Task Manager, and Firefox is using a surprisingly high amount of CPU resources, which is affecting the overall performance of my <a href=""https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/d/i5-laptops/"" rel=""nofollow"">best i5 laptop</a>. </p><p>Battery Drain: It seems like Firefox is draining my battery faster compared to other browsers, which is frustrating since I rely on my laptop for long periods of usage. </p><p>I’ve tried clearing the cache, disabling extensions, and even reinstalling Firefox, but the issues remain. Given that my laptop is one of the best i5 laptops, I’m surprised by these performance problems. </p><p>Has anyone else experienced similar issues with Firefox on an i5 laptop? Are there any tweaks, settings, or specific solutions that might help improve performance? I’d appreciate any advice or recommendations to get the most out of Firefox on my system. </p><p>Thanks in advance for your help! Looking forward to your suggestions! </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",moorejulie199

Do you have a guide on how to parse these output files so that I can sort on the various energy usage components? In the visual capture of the profile all the data is available nicely to see.
