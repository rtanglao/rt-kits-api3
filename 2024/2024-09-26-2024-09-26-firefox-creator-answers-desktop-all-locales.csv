When I click the bookmark to my organization's subdomain, it starts to go to the page as usual but then logs me out of the site automatically.

Given that my laptop is one of the best i5 laptops, I’m surprised by these performance problems. </p><p>Has anyone else experienced similar issues with Firefox on an i5 laptop? Are there any tweaks, settings, or specific solutions that might help improve performance?
