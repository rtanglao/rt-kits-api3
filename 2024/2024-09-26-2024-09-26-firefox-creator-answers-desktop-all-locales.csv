Now when they finished loading i noticed a few failed to load, and remain about:blank even though i knew i didnt have any such tabs on my phone, to fix these few tabs i was planning to get a list of urls of all the tabs i opened and a list of those that were on my phone and compare them with a tool online. I got the list of tabs on my desktop through an addon, i checked the number of lines and it matched that that i got from the ""syncronized tabs"" feature. I got the list of tabs on my android by using the ""share all tabs"" feature available when you click the three dots on the top right when opening the tabs screen. Once i sent that last list to my desktop i was perplexed, the number of tabs was significantly higher, 1228 to be exact. And when i compared the lists with my online tool the results were even stranger, both lists were missing tabs from the other list, hundreds of them in fact, how is this possible? how do i even know that i got all my tabs if so many are missing from both of these features?

The same thing happens on both of these devices as well—so this is not an issue with my Mac computer.  I can access the content of the email from Royal Mail via either Safari (on my iPad) or DuckDuckGo (on iPad AND my android phone.)  However, neither of these will show me the email when I use Firefox. </p><p>I can access the actual Royal Mail website with Firefox on my computer, no problem.  It’s just when I try to open emails from them that the problem arises.  </p><p>No idea what is causing this anomaly.  I can’t pinpoint exactly when it started, but it’s been going on for at least a month and maybe more. </p><p>I use the latest version of Firefox at all times on all devices, and my operating systems are up to date on my devices as well.  (I have the latest version of Sonoma on my Mac, I have iOS 17.7 on my iPad, and whatever the latest update for Motorola e14 is.) </p><p>I’m hoping you can offer a bit of advice.

My laptop is fairly new and handles most tasks smoothly, but when it comes to browsing with Firefox, I’m running into several problems. </p><p>Here’s what’s happening: </p><p>Lagging and Slowness: Whenever I open multiple tabs or use web apps, Firefox becomes sluggish. Pages load slowly, and switching between tabs is much slower than expected. </p><p>Freezing: Occasionally, Firefox will freeze for a few seconds, especially when I’m using extensions or trying to stream videos or handle media-heavy websites. </p><p>High CPU Usage: I’ve checked my Task Manager, and Firefox is using a surprisingly high amount of CPU resources, which is affecting the overall performance of my <a href=""https://www.lenovo.com/gb/en/d/i5-laptops/"" rel=""nofollow"">best i5 laptop</a>. </p><p>Battery Drain: It seems like Firefox is draining my battery faster compared to other browsers, which is frustrating since I rely on my laptop for long periods of usage. </p><p>I’ve tried clearing the cache, disabling extensions, and even reinstalling Firefox, but the issues remain. Given that my laptop is one of the best i5 laptops, I’m surprised by these performance problems. </p><p>Has anyone else experienced similar issues with Firefox on an i5 laptop? Are there any tweaks, settings, or specific solutions that might help improve performance? I’d appreciate any advice or recommendations to get the most out of Firefox on my system. </p><p>Thanks in advance for your help! Looking forward to your suggestions! </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",moorejulie199

Do you have a guide on how to parse these output files so that I can sort on the various energy usage components? In the visual capture of the profile all the data is available nicely to see.
