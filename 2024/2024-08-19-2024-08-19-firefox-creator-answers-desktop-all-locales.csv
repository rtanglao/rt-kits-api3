This happens both when the hardware acceleration is turned on and turned off. </p><p>When I open a website that has mainly images or videos, the browser goes blitz (Reddit, Twitch, etc.). Screen splits to multiple views, it starts flickering and <strong>continues until I switch to another tab or quit Firefox</strong>. For flickering to stop, I need to restart the computer. I can also send a video if you can communicate a proper way of sharing. (Drive link, youtube, etc.) </p><p>Is there any way I can ensure Firefox does not break things on my computer? </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;windows-10;troubleshooting;firefox-1290;firefox-12901;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",notaname
