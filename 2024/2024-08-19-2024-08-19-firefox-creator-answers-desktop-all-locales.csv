This resulted in a disastrous event whereby an error message displayed: error message 129.  I finally managed to open a version of Firefox but I had lost all my bookmarks and open tabs. I also had to sign in to all existing websites which I had previously automatically had access to. The strange thing was that the version of Firefox that I had opened was from 2022 sometime because of the data that appeared. I am totally devastated by the loss of my bookmarks.&nbsp;:( What can you do to help? </p>,desktop;windows-10;troubleshooting;firefox-1290;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,1669096;,bassettjohn

I don't want to delete it because I don't want to lose my bookmark data, which are stored in this database (I even double-checked this by temporarily moving the database out of my profile folder, basically as if it were ""deleted,"" and started Firefox, and sure enough all my bookmarks' data were gone). </p><p>I tried running `sqlite3 vacuum` on it, but that only reduced it to 79 MB. Is there another way to further cleanup old or unimportant data in this database? </p><p>-- Firefox 64-bit v129.0.1  Windows 11 </p>",desktop;windows-10;troubleshooting;firefox-1290;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",fiffox
