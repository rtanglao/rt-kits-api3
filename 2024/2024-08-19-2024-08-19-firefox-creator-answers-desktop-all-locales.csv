This resulted in a disastrous event whereby an error message displayed: error message 129.  I finally managed to open a version of Firefox but I had lost all my bookmarks and open tabs. I also had to sign in to all existing websites which I had previously automatically had access to. The strange thing was that the version of Firefox that I had opened was from 2022 sometime because of the data that appeared. I am totally devastated by the loss of my bookmarks.&nbsp;:( What can you do to help? </p>,desktop;windows-10;troubleshooting;firefox-1290;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,1669096;1669104;,bassettjohn
