In fact, it seems like the browser doesn't recognize that I'm using Google Docs at all - in my attempts to see what was up I tried to bold a word to see what would happen, but the Ctrl + B shortcut opened the Firefox bookmarks tab instead. This is happening across all my Google Accounts, but only on Firefox and only in Docs - I can edit sheets and forms without issue, I can edit them all on my Android through the google apps, and I can edit them in another browser. </p><p>This is an issue that happened suddenly yesterday and I cannot think of anything that's caused it. I double checked that I had editing permissions on these docs, asked the people who owned them to remove me and re-add me but no luck. I have cleared cache and cookies, logged out and back, restarted the browser, and restarted my computer. Though I haven't changed anything with my extensions recently, I tried deactivating and reactivating everything I had. None of this caused any difference and I still cannot edit. I've also tried a user-agent switcher to see if that could help, but no dice. It really does seem like the issue is firefox not recognizing Google Docs is Google Docs and I'm not sure what the fix for that would be. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1290;firefox-12901;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",sparkyoungupstart
