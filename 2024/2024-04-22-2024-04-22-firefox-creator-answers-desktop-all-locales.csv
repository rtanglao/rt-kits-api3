At first the download is blocked because of an insecure source (but the server is on our internal LAN). Then when we choose to allow it anyway, the file always is corrupted. That means we cannot save any report results anymore. </p><p>I already tried to uninstall firefox and install an earlier version (124) but the result was the same. </p><p>Please help to solve this issue asap </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1250;firefox-12501;,firefox,other,en-US,"",l.evers
