Nel pomeriggio dovevo fare un'altra riunione ma meet non permetteva alla fotocamera e al microfono di funzionare e il popup ""consenti..."" si bloccava e non mi permetteva di cliccare. Se utilizzo direttamente il browser google chrome tutto funziona regolare, sembra un conflitto tra firefox e google meet.  Ho provato anche a ripristinare firefox ma non funziona lo stesso. Chiedo se mi potete aiutare. Grazie. </p><p>Rimane tutto bloccato come nell'immagine allegata </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1250;firefox-12502;,firefox,other,it,"",max.fagiani
