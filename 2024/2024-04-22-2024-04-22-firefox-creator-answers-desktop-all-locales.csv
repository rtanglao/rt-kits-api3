When I look at bookmarks there are a few, but I had multiple folders for different subjects, I do not find. I would like to have the procedure to return my bookmarks back to the left hand side of the screen with all of my bookmarks, bookmark folders, and other bookmarks like it was prior to the update.  Thank you for help, Steve Zimmerman </p>",windows-7;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-115100;firefox-11510_1;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",z.zimmerman
