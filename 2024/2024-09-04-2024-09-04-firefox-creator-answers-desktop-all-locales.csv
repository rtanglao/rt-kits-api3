AND NOW NEITHER PASSWORD IS LETTING ME LOG IN. i am not going to risk resetting my password AGAIN on this device as it still  has all my saved data. this shouldnt be an issue, i dont know why it said wrong password and made me verify multiple times. please help. i was able to log in perfectly fine to my mozilla account for this very report, but not to sync my data? </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1290;firefox-12902;,firefox,sync,en-US,1672619;,tigris62716
