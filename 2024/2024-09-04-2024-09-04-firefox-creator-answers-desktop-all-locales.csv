There seems to be no rhyme or reason as to when and why. In one instance I may be able to go through 10 tabs without an issue, and in other instances it will unload and have to reload images multiple times, even if I am only switching between two tabs. </p><p>Sometimes the images will reload automatically a couple of seconds after switching to a new tab, and other times the image will not reload unless I navigate away to a different website and then hit the back button to return to the image. In either case, it's extremely aggravating when looking back and forth between two images in different tabs to compare differences when they reload every single time I switch between them. </p><p>This only seems to happen with image files. I can have any number of web pages open in different tabs and they will not unload, but if the address points directly to an image it exhibits this behaviour. </p><p>I have already looked for solutions and tried disabling the 'browser.tabs.unloadOnLowMemory' option through the 'about:config' menu, but this has no effect on the behaviour at all. It continues to unload images when this option is set to 'false'. </p><p>This behaviour is a very recent change from how Firefox usually works, so I'm assuming that it's something to do with the latest update(s). I've only noticed it happening in the past couple of weeks, though I don't remember exactly when in that timeframe the problem first appeared. </p><p>Looking for any possible solutions or options that I might try to correct this. </p>",desktop;troubleshooting;windows-11;firefox-1290;firefox-12902;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",bard_mk

A seguito dell'ultimo aggiornamento Firefox (3 settembre 2024), risultano alterati tutti i colori predefiniti dei siti e delle schede dei siti nel navigatore superiore del vostro browser. Lo stesso avviene per la schermata Thunderbird di partenza, in cui il classico blu del logo è visualizzato come verde prato, così come quello della Unione Europea, e di Facebook. Altre alterazioni sono visibili anche nel logo Instagram. </p><p>Fino a ieri mattina, ovvero prima dell'ultimo aggiornamento, i colori erano quelli originari, non alterati.  </p><p>Il driver AMD installato sul computer è l'ultimo disponibile (OS Win 11 aggiornato all'ultima release, processore AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX con Radeon Graphics). </p><p>Ho disattivato l'accelerazione grafica da Prestazioni nelle impostazioni Firefox. Lo stesso è stato fatto per Thunderbird, senza tuttavia risolvere il problema. Rispetto all'uso precedente all'ultimo aggiornamento Mozilla, la gestione dei colori in Impostazioni non è stata cambiata.  Ho anche provato a reinstallare la precedente versione di Firefox, ma dopo questa installazione mi viene impedito di utilizzare il profilo principale. La visualizzazione è perfetta sia con Google Chrome (dopo la disattivazione dell'accelerazione grafica) che con Microsoft Edge, e con quest'ultimo senza nemmeno dover disabilitare l'accelerazione grafica. Quindi, a parte Firefox e Mozilla, non ci sono problemi di visualizzazione con nessun altro software e nessuna altra interfaccia. Per esempio, il classico blu del logo Microsoft Word è rimasto inalterato. </p><p>Allego immagini del navigatore Firefox e di Thunderbird.  </p><p>Saluti, </p><p>Mario Monteleone mmonteleone@unisa.it </p>",desktop;needsinfo;windows-11;install-and-update;firefox-1300;,firefox,install-and-update,it,1672648;,mmonteleone

AND NOW NEITHER PASSWORD IS LETTING ME LOG IN. i am not going to risk resetting my password AGAIN on this device as it still  has all my saved data. this shouldnt be an issue, i dont know why it said wrong password and made me verify multiple times. please help. i was able to log in perfectly fine to my mozilla account for this very report, but not to sync my data? </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1290;firefox-12902;,firefox,sync,en-US,1672619;,tigris62716
