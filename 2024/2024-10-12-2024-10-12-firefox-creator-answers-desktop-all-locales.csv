That is, 5 out of 10 times the browser crashes or becomes unusable. </p><p>I took my time to study it and <strong>this is what i know</strong>: </p><p>I can use the Private Browsing on other sites and it will work very well. Even on <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a>, the Private Browsing works only when i don't type <strong>username</strong> or <strong>password</strong> of the GMail account. That is, the Private Browsing won't freeze when i choose a Google account from the <strong>highlighted accounts saved on the browser.</strong> </p><p>However, the <strong>browser freezes when i try typing a user name or password</strong>. I've tried typing the username very fast but the browser froze at the password section. </p><p>When the browser freezes, it isn't limited to the Private Browsing mode alone but the entire browser. I will be forced to shut down the browser via Task Manager. I'm using <strong>Firefox v131.0.2 (64-bit)</strong> which is the latest version as at this writing. </p><p>But i've also <strong>experienced this same issue with previous versions of Firefox</strong>, but it seems like <strong>the issue keeps getting worse with each update</strong>. </p><p>Back then, the browser freezes once in a while but now it freezes several times in a single day, which can be very very frustrating and super annoying (on blue days). </p><p>Please, I need a solution. It's just too much. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1681067;,slumwire

The browser was always open, and the pages were static, and nothing was playing. The strange thing is that it didn't take up much memory at the beginning, but it took up more and more memory over time. Today the system got stuck and couldn't respond (it might be that the system used virtual memory). </p><p>I used the browser's task manager, which showed that the Shared Web Process memory of several pages was very high, some as high as 4G, and the GPU memory was also higher than before. </p><p>I think this is very strange. Why does the memory usage increase exponentially after the webpage has been there for a while? </p><p>My settings and usage habits have basically not changed. I didn't have this problem before, but it has appeared in the past six months. I have updated many versions, but the problem still exists. I have always used Firefox. If it continues like this, I will be very disappointed and have to make changes. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1681062;,robot-yang
