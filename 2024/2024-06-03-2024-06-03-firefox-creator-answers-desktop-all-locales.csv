After installing the game and Vanguard, I am unable to open Firefox. When I try to launch Firefox, nothing happens. However, if I change the name of the firefox.exe file, I can start Firefox on a different profile, but it only works for a short period before becoming unresponsive. None of the options or tabs respond after that. </p><p>Could you please provide assistance on how to resolve this issue? </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",bambodinho
