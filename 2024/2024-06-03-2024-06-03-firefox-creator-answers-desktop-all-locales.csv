Most are there, but some are missing entirely, and the ones that remain are varied slightly.  Whaaaat for!?  It is truly a form of torture. </p><p>Now in fairness I can't tell if it's the browser (Firefox), or the search engine (Duck Duck Go), because I am unfortunately not a developer.  However, whatever is causing it should  be fixed out of a sense of social responsibility to the greater good. </p><p>If anyone knows why this happens and knows how to fix it, I would be sincerely grateful if you shared the solution. </p><p>E </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1150;,firefox,other,en-US,1655571;,obhke4e3

Once the first site loaded, it would load subsequent sites normally. Interestingly, it was only my default profile that was affected; if I used another profile or created a new one, websites would load within seconds of my starting Firefox. </p><p>I finally broke down and created a new default profile, imported my history/bookmarks/etc., reinstalled extensions, adjusted settings, etc. The new profile behaved nicely, loading the first website within a few seconds of Firefox starting. But over time, the load time has gradually increased to the point where it is now behaving just like the old profile: I load Firefox, I try to go to any website, and it takes several minutes for it to load. </p><p>Any ideas what's happening/what's the problem? Hoping someone out there has some wisdom and can help troubleshoot. Thanks! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1655561;,pvdecker11
