Once the first site loaded, it would load subsequent sites normally. Interestingly, it was only my default profile that was affected; if I used another profile or created a new one, websites would load within seconds of my starting Firefox. </p><p>I finally broke down and created a new default profile, imported my history/bookmarks/etc., reinstalled extensions, adjusted settings, etc. The new profile behaved nicely, loading the first website within a few seconds of Firefox starting. But over time, the load time has gradually increased to the point where it is now behaving just like the old profile: I load Firefox, I try to go to any website, and it takes several minutes for it to load. </p><p>Any ideas what's happening/what's the problem?
