Once the first site loaded, it would load subsequent sites normally. Interestingly, it was only my default profile that was affected; if I used another profile or created a new one, websites would load within seconds of my starting Firefox. </p><p>I finally broke down and created a new default profile, imported my history/bookmarks/etc., reinstalled extensions, adjusted settings, etc. The new profile behaved nicely, loading the first website within a few seconds of Firefox starting. But over time, the load time has gradually increased to the point where it is now behaving just like the old profile: I load Firefox, I try to go to any website, and it takes several minutes for it to load. </p><p>Any ideas what's happening/what's the problem? Hoping someone out there has some wisdom and can help troubleshoot. Thanks! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1655561;,pvdecker11

After installing the game and Vanguard, I am unable to open Firefox. When I try to launch Firefox, nothing happens. However, if I change the name of the firefox.exe file, I can start Firefox on a different profile, but it only works for a short period before becoming unresponsive. None of the options or tabs respond after that. </p><p>Could you please provide assistance on how to resolve this issue? </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",bambodinho
