Recently, I noticed that Norton scans HTTPS traffic, and I’m unsure about how this impacts my privacy and security. While I understand the feature is meant to detect threats, I’m particularly worried because it involves decrypting sensitive information. This raises concerns about whether my personal data, such as login credentials or payment details, could be exposed during the scanning process. Has anyone else experienced issues or found this feature problematic? I'd love to hear about your experiences and whether there are any steps I can take to ensure my online security without risking privacy. </p><p><br> I also have found a names of site that were blocked in the report generated from Norton </p><p>someting to read ---&gt; <a href=""https://zakird.com/papers/https_interception.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://zakird.com/papers/https_interception.pdf</a> </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1690759;1690760;,hornet.ledges958
