Firefox is my go to browser and always my default. Most of the time I delete any other browser on my computer or just never use it and take away all icons from desktop. But over the years I've learned that it's good to always have at least one backup might not use it but it's nice to know it's there if I need it. I loved Firefox until recently. Recently it's been giving me a tremendous amount of problems and troubles. I used to have hundreds of bookmarks all my passwords were saved on it everything until recently. About a month ago is when I first encountered this problem and it's only magnified sense. I went to bed one night and put my computer in sleep mode before I did. Got up the next day turn on my computer went to press Firefox and restore previous session and it shows on my taskbar but would not let me maximize I do run 2 screens I tried to restore I tried to maximize I tried to close it and reopen it all to no success. I even disconnected the second screen to where the computer only had one screen my laptop in order to see if it would load and maximize on just that taking away any other variable. Nothing worked. I tried reading tons of forms and watching YouTube videos and everything else I'm trying to figure out why this is happening and why this is not working. I tried the four different suggestions that was online using a different browser obviously because I couldn't use Firefox Sam told me to rename a file with the ending dot old. Some told me to go into command prompt and run as administrator and do some things in that which I did and then restart the computer and go back into it still no success I'm not computer illiterate but this problem is very annoying and irritating. I finally decided to uninstall Firefox and then reinstall and see if that would fix this problem. It did for the first time opening it the next day when I went to use it again same problem and the part that makes me mad the most was I lost everyone of my bookmarks and I lost all my passwords to everything very frustrating and extremely time consuming and then for the problem to continue to persist extremely annoying. I then went through all the forms and all the videos again trying all the suggestions once again. That rename dot old seem to work using the windows R key and typing in a certain thing. It's been working for maybe a week. I started reclaiming passwords and bookmarks and getting it reset all back up again. Then I get up today and the problem is back again I try all the suggestions once again and nothing is working same problems but no solution. And these recommendations go all way back to 2018-2019 20/20/2022 nothing current. My computer is an Asus gaming laptop I have 16 gigs of ram I have almost a terabyte hard drive space I have extremely fast Internet and I'm running Windows 10 home. The fact that this problem continues to happen has completely obliterated my trust with Firefox and at this point I'm looking for another browser to take over my everyday tasks and what I need to do because Firefox is not cutting it no more. I've never had these issues in the past like this never to this extreme. I cannot afford to lose my bookmarks and passwords every time Firefox wants to have an issue it's too costly for time patience frustration stress irritation it's too much to handle. Firefox used to be excellent and I loved it more than any other browser or search engine but now it's went completely just shit. And the way this is going I can't continue to support and use this browser if this is the way it's gonna go. not to mention dozens of hours over the past month with the issues that continue to persist. When a browser becomes more of a headache and irritation then what it's worth it's time to move on. I spent two hours today trying to find a contact phone number customer support chat anything to finally get this issue resolved once and for all. But for all that effort no success after two hours of trying to figure out how to get ahold of you guys I finally came to this and I have no idea if anyone will even read this respond or even can offer any help but at this point I will never recommend this browser again to anyone with what it's cost me I don't even know most of my bookmarks and I damn sure don't know any of my passwords unfortunately I trusted Firefox and I think I put way too much trust with this app.  Sincerely Chris Chris8279wilkins@gmail.com 530-988-6208 </p>",accessibility;firefox;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",chris8279wilkins

What kind of psychopathy is it that makes things like this happen? Would it be possible to have a notice with a stated TIME for the update and a way to regulate it? I lost 4 hours of work this time, and it's happened before. </p><p>Thanks for You Attention to this Matter, </p><p>B.

When I log-in to my bank account a blank page titled ""HTTP Status 400 Bad Request"" pops up.  I shut the computer down, restart it and log-in again and it works.  But each subsequent log-in results in the Bad Request page popping up until I shut the computer down again and restart.  How do I fix this?
