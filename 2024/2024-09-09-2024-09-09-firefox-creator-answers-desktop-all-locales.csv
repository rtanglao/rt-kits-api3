When I log-in to my bank account a blank page titled ""HTTP Status 400 Bad Request"" pops up.  I shut the computer down, restart it and log-in again and it works.  But each subsequent log-in results in the Bad Request page popping up until I shut the computer down again and restart.  How do I fix this?
