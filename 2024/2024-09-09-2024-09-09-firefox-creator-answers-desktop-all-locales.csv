What kind of psychopathy is it that makes things like this happen? Would it be possible to have a notice with a stated TIME for the update and a way to regulate it? I lost 4 hours of work this time, and it's happened before. </p><p>Thanks for You Attention to this Matter, </p><p>B.

When I log-in to my bank account a blank page titled ""HTTP Status 400 Bad Request"" pops up.  I shut the computer down, restart it and log-in again and it works.  But each subsequent log-in results in the Bad Request page popping up until I shut the computer down again and restart.  How do I fix this?
