In Chrome, I would do that by: -typing the name of the website in my address bar -all the pages I frequently visited in that website show in my suggestions -I middlemouse-click all of them, one after the other -this opens one new tab for all of them -I then switch to those tabs and browse them </p><p>However, replicating this in firefox seems impossible.  When middle-mouse-clicking the 1st link, I would have my window forcibly switch to it, not letting me open the other tabs without changing tabs again. Recently I learned I can avoid this forced switch by middle-mouse-clicking the URL on my address bar while holding shift, which is great! . . . Except it still closes my address bar, not letting me click the other ones without having to type the website's name in it again.   </p><p>I don't mind holding shift (though I wish I didn't have to) but I really just want to middle mouse click multiple links in my address' suggestion bar and open them in succession, without shifting back to it after each time. </p>",desktop;windows-10;troubleshooting;firefox-1270;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,1668592;1668593;,darigan25
