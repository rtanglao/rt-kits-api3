For the past week or 2 metamask extension will not open properly. Upon clicking the icon it just perpetually loads. I have the same issue when using any kind of wallet connect to metamask, be it on uniswap or metamask website for example.  I have cleared cookie cache. I have tried both disabling state partitioning using network.cookie.cookieBehavior. I have also tried setting this to 0 to allow cookies, these did not work. I have of course restarted my computer/browser. This is definitely an issue with my firefox because I am able to use the metamask extension in chrome.  I have attached screenshots of the console &amp; debugger from the metamask site in the hopes it has some info that anyone may be able to provide advice.  In the debugger &amp; in my searching I see an issue with ""source maps"", in my debugger it is saying ""no source map found"" - again I cannot apologise enough for my lack of understanding but if this is my issue would anyone be so kind as to explain a fix in laymans terms. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;website-breakages;firefox-1280;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",jessicacalvert932

It is my habit when researching to right click links to open interesting looking things in a new tab and then go back to read all the tabs in turn, the info sticks better that way than reading&gt;searching&gt;reading&gt;searching. I have never had trouble with this before no matter how many tabs I had open, I have a powerful laptop. </p><p>Suddenly Firefox will act as normal and then after a bit the tabs don't load.I don't mean the rightclick/open in new tab doesn't work but the tab which opens will have nothing on it.  Sometimes they will open properly in a new window but sometimes not. Also on the Daily Mail website the page doesn't seem to complete somehow; the relaod icon doesn't appear and you have to click the 'cross' to amke the page stop trying to fetch something (I presume). This doesn't happen with any other newspaper site.  </p><p>I have refreshed Firefox,  I have checked all my settings,  I am not using a VPN or private windows,  I have changed About:config dom.ipc.processPriorityManager.backgroundUsesEcoQoS to <strong>false</strong> to get rid of the eco leaf symbol showing in task manager  I have Norton as my virus protection.

On websites like Figma or Maps, where the user can zoom in and out of a portion of the interface, my zoom-in pinches may cause the non-scalable part of the view to also zoom in. This happens if, by mistake, the starting position of my pinching is within the area of the non-scalable UI. See attached image as an example (the inspect tool remains of the right size, but as you can see, the left-hand-side interface is zoomed in, too). </p><p>If I try to restore the original size with the Cmd+- shortcut, the baseline is taken as my current zoomed-in view, so zooming out further just makes the text smaller in an already gigantic ui. Closing and reopening the tab also doesn't work. </p><p>Normally, performing the pinching-out gesture over the non-scalable part solves the problem. However, for some reason this stopped working today, and I'm now stuck with an unworkable view of Figma. </p><p>How can I fix this? </p>",desktop;troubleshooting;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1280;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,1662840;,testpython.020520

The weird thing is that CTRL+backspace is the only ""make key X operate on a whole word instead of a single character"" that actually works. For example, ""backspace"" removes a single character in text edit fields. ""ctrl+backspace"" would remove the whole word. </p><p>PPS: I don't care too much if the modifier key is CTRL or CMD. I can rebind that.
