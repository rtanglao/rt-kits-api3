I have tried almost everything from installing different versions, rolling back my Nvidia drivers, even reinstalling packages that I'd removed earlier that day. Nothing works apart from it running on X11. </p><p>Logs indicate that it's some problem with Wayland â€“ something along the lines of a protocol error with wp_linux_drm_syncobj_surface_v1#61: error 5: No Release point provided. I have searched around for people with similar problems; although there are some others that are having some problems with Wayland and Firefox, this particular problem does not seem to be documented anywhere. </p><p>Here is a snippet from the crash report that may be useful: GraphicsCriticalError: [1][GFX1-]: Wayland protocol error: wp_linux_drm_syncobj_surface_v1#61: error 5: No Release point provided AdapterDriverVendor: nvidia/unknown AdapterDriverVersion: 555.58.2.0 ContentSandboxLevel: 4 IsWayland: 1 </p><p>This happened on all Firefox versions I could try: official pacman release, flatpak, developer version, the 129 beta. </p><p>Has anybody else run into this or got ideas how to fix? Thanks in advance for your help! </p>",linux;desktop;troubleshooting;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",vhespanha0
