There is custom javascript such that if a user selects a number of thumbnail images, creating a playlist, all of the associated videos will play back in the order selected. This works perfectly in the Chrome, Edge, Safari, and Opera browsers. However, in Firefox, rather than playing back the videos in sequence, after each video, a gray screen appears in the video player (JWPlayer) that says the file is corrupted. The mp4 files are not corrupt since they work well in the other browsers. Also, once that gray box appears, by clicking the ""Play Video""button the next video in the sequence will play but this must be repeated after each video in the playlist. Is there a setting that can be adjusted so that sequence will play in FIrefox? Is there a default setting that prevents the sequential playback?  </p><p>Any help would be appreciated </p>",desktop;troubleshooting;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1280;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",fshill

It is my habit when researching to right click links to open interesting looking things in a new tab and then go back to read all the tabs in turn, the info sticks better that way than reading&gt;searching&gt;reading&gt;searching. I have never had trouble with this before no matter how many tabs I had open, I have a powerful laptop. </p><p>Suddenly Firefox will act as normal and then after a bit the tabs don't load.I don't mean the rightclick/open in new tab doesn't work but the tab which opens will have nothing on it.  Sometimes they will open properly in a new window but sometimes not. Also on the Daily Mail website the page doesn't seem to complete somehow; the relaod icon doesn't appear and you have to click the 'cross' to amke the page stop trying to fetch something (I presume). This doesn't happen with any other newspaper site.  </p><p>I have refreshed Firefox,  I have checked all my settings,  I am not using a VPN or private windows,  I have changed About:config dom.ipc.processPriorityManager.backgroundUsesEcoQoS to <strong>false</strong> to get rid of the eco leaf symbol showing in task manager  I have Norton as my virus protection.

On websites like Figma or Maps, where the user can zoom in and out of a portion of the interface, my zoom-in pinches may cause the non-scalable part of the view to also zoom in. This happens if, by mistake, the starting position of my pinching is within the area of the non-scalable UI. See attached image as an example (the inspect tool remains of the right size, but as you can see, the left-hand-side interface is zoomed in, too). </p><p>If I try to restore the original size with the Cmd+- shortcut, the baseline is taken as my current zoomed-in view, so zooming out further just makes the text smaller in an already gigantic ui. Closing and reopening the tab also doesn't work. </p><p>Normally, performing the pinching-out gesture over the non-scalable part solves the problem. However, for some reason this stopped working today, and I'm now stuck with an unworkable view of Figma. </p><p>How can I fix this? </p>",desktop;troubleshooting;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1280;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,1662840;,testpython.020520

Firefox is the only program on MacOS, that I have encountered, where it is impossible to have the caret skip words forward/backwards. </p><p>I can use Karabiner-Elements to fix whatever weirdness might exist, but not if Firefox has no way to actually trigger that command, nor a way to rebind keys in order to do so either. </p><p>Maybe I've missed something obvious. </p><p>PS: Writing this was annoying, exactly for the reason explained. The weird thing is that CTRL+backspace is the only ""make key X operate on a whole word instead of a single character"" that actually works. For example, ""backspace"" removes a single character in text edit fields. ""ctrl+backspace"" would remove the whole word. </p><p>PPS: I don't care too much if the modifier key is CTRL or CMD. I can rebind that. I just need it to either be *something*, or that one can set it to *something. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1280;customize-settings-and-preferences;,firefox,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",rofurus
