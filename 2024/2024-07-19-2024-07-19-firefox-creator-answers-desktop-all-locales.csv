I think I did click on update earlier today before noticing the page is pretty empty. If I did so, what damage might it have done? </p><p>Is there a chance a hacker took over my whole Firefox account? I ask because just after that I was prompted to enter my info on the Mozilla help page. I couldn't remember my p/w, so I created a new one. This evening, when I tried to log in to the Mozilla support section, I had to create another new p/w. Then, when I tried to enter a secondary address as suggested, the page returned the message that another account was already using that address. </p><p>Can you help me sort this out? Might I have two Mozilla accounts? (It would be unlikely that neither of them would be recorded in my list of p/w's.) How can I check?  </p><p>Thanks for your attention. If you need an e-mail address, please use RJHMM@juno.com. I will also check my primary address, though. </p><p><br> </p><p><br> </p><p><br> </p><p><br> </p><p><br> Tried to set up a secondary e-mail acct but screen says another account is already using it. </p>",desktop;windows-11;firefox-1280;protect-your-privacy;,firefox,protect-your-privacy,en-US,"",MMinSJ

I have tried almost everything from installing different versions, rolling back my Nvidia drivers, even reinstalling packages that I'd removed earlier that day. Nothing works apart from it running on X11. </p><p>Logs indicate that it's some problem with Wayland – something along the lines of a protocol error with wp_linux_drm_syncobj_surface_v1#61: error 5: No Release point provided. I have searched around for people with similar problems; although there are some others that are having some problems with Wayland and Firefox, this particular problem does not seem to be documented anywhere. </p><p>Here is a snippet from the crash report that may be useful: GraphicsCriticalError: [1][GFX1-]: Wayland protocol error: wp_linux_drm_syncobj_surface_v1#61: error 5: No Release point provided AdapterDriverVendor: nvidia/unknown AdapterDriverVersion: 555.58.2.0 ContentSandboxLevel: 4 IsWayland: 1 </p><p>This happened on all Firefox versions I could try: official pacman release, flatpak, developer version, the 129 beta. </p><p>Has anybody else run into this or got ideas how to fix?
