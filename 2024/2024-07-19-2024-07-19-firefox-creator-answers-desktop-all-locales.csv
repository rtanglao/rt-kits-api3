On websites like Figma or Maps, where the user can zoom in and out of a portion of the interface, my zoom-in pinches may cause the non-scalable part of the view to also zoom in. This happens if, by mistake, the starting position of my pinching is within the area of the non-scalable UI. See attached image as an example (the inspect tool remains of the right size, but as you can see, the left-hand-side interface is zoomed in, too). </p><p>If I try to restore the original size with the Cmd+- shortcut, the baseline is taken as my current zoomed-in view, so zooming out further just makes the text smaller in an already gigantic ui. Closing and reopening the tab also doesn't work. </p><p>Normally, performing the pinching-out gesture over the non-scalable part solves the problem. However, for some reason this stopped working today, and I'm now stuck with an unworkable view of Figma. </p><p>How can I fix this? </p>",desktop;troubleshooting;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1280;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,1662840;,testpython.020520

In particular, the ones I'm interested in are ""Go one word to the left/right"" as shown in the attached image. </p><p>Is there a reason why these are left out? Firefox is the only program on MacOS, that I have encountered, where it is impossible to have the caret skip words forward/backwards. </p><p>I can use Karabiner-Elements to fix whatever weirdness might exist, but not if Firefox has no way to actually trigger that command, nor a way to rebind keys in order to do so either. </p><p>Maybe I've missed something obvious. </p><p>PS: Writing this was annoying, exactly for the reason explained. The weird thing is that CTRL+backspace is the only ""make key X operate on a whole word instead of a single character"" that actually works. For example, ""backspace"" removes a single character in text edit fields. ""ctrl+backspace"" would remove the whole word. </p><p>PPS: I don't care too much if the modifier key is CTRL or CMD. I can rebind that. I just need it to either be *something*, or that one can set it to *something. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1280;customize-settings-and-preferences;,firefox,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",rofurus
