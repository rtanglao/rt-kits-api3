It asks to click on all the bicycles, I click on them one at a time until no more appear, hit verify, it brings up something else.  It will do this dozens of times and just never ever end. </p><p>Switch over to Edge, does the same.  Switched to chrome and it works fine.  Has google done something to captcha to deny it working on other browsers? </p><p>I have checked to see firefox is up to date and it is.  I have disabled all extensions/addons. I have run malware/virus scans.  On the Rogers community forums there are all kinds of people having problems but there are no solutions on how to fix.  Oddly (or not) the problems are similar...captcha won't work on Edge, Firefox but will work on Chrome. </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",Ashkevron

The messages (wording) of the body of the email prints fine.  Different browsers prints fine, thus in order to print I have to use a different browser and prints fine.
