Eventually stops even trying to do the loop and does right into the minute long loading and failure to load message. I have found no help for this online and im not tech savvy enough to be able to fix this issue on my own. things ive tried 1. making sure firefox and all extensions are up to date 2. completely restarting the browser 2. disabling all extensions on the site 3. tried private window 4. tried other web browsers (it only effects firefox) </p>,desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",Captain

My issue is that I can't clear the ""Save Files to"" setting under ""Files and Applications\Downloads"" and leave it at ""Always Ask"". What I wind up with is a lot of clutter in my Downloads folder. So my question is, How do I correct this setting so FireFox stops saving files in places that I don't want them saved? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,customize,en-US,1630004;1630006;1630007;,camac688
