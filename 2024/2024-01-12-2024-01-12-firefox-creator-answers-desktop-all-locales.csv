El problema es que cuando quiero acceder a ellas estan dormidas digamos y el Firefox se cuelga y hay que cerrar el proceso. No consigo que el Windows 11 automaticamente no haga esto aunque cierre manualmente pestaña por pestaña el modo eficiencia. Alguna sugerencia? Con Google Chrome no me sucede pero quiero seguir usando Firefox. Como deshabilito el modo eficiencia? Ya le di prioridad alta en el registro de Windows 11 a firefox.exe pero sigue sucediendo.

I can't seem to get it to sign in to my unbanned account because it always defaults to the first one when clicking the sign in button and no amount of switch accounts in other google products seems to change anything. I also can't sign out of just the old, banned account because there is only a 'sign out of all accounts' button which would be a massive pain to have to sign into them all again.

Eventually stops even trying to do the loop and does right into the minute long loading and failure to load message. I have found no help for this online and im not tech savvy enough to be able to fix this issue on my own. things ive tried 1. making sure firefox and all extensions are up to date 2. completely restarting the browser 2. disabling all extensions on the site 3. tried private window 4. tried other web browsers (it only effects firefox) </p>,desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1630042;,Captain

My issue is that I can't clear the ""Save Files to"" setting under ""Files and Applications\Downloads"" and leave it at ""Always Ask"". What I wind up with is a lot of clutter in my Downloads folder. So my question is, How do I correct this setting so FireFox stops saving files in places that I don't want them saved? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,customize,en-US,1630004;1630006;1630007;,camac688
