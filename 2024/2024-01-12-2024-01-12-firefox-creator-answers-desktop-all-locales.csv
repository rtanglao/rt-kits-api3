I'm currently using windows 11 with Firefox 121.0.1.   </p><p>I have always used the hibernate function to switch off my computer when I finish a session, and up until a few months ago Firefox would spring back to life once my desktop reloaded. </p><p>Then I started getting this problem  ...  Firefox is most often but not always terminally slow to reconnect to the internet (other apps and functions have no issue).  I have found the simplest way to overcome this is to shut down Firefox from Task Manager and restart it - it then connects in seconds.   I suspect this started after an automatic windows update, but can't be certain. </p><p>I have searched google and Mozilla sites frequently for help with this issue but haven't found others posting the same issue as me.   I think it is connected to windows power management and have checked but can't find any obvious windows setting that could cause this and have also tried switching off Hardware Acceleration but that makes no difference. Can anyone help, please? Thanks </p><p>windows update. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jeffberens53

This extension is needed so that I can properly control my browser using speech as I have severe repetitive strain injury through typing. The explanation given is that the extension violates some privacy rules that Firefox have put into place. </p><p>Whilst I fully appreciate how Firefox is looking out for us, I am really puzzled as to why I do not have the option to say that I am not concerned about this issue and want to continue using the extension. The Dragon NaturallySpeaking software costs several hundred pounds, and it has now been rendered much less effective, which prevents me from working properly in my browser. </p><p>I have of course contacted Dragon NaturallySpeaking who just said that they were looking into it, but nothing has been done (presumably I am running a version that they no longer actively support). </p><p>Could you please explain to me why it is not possible to allow the users to make an informed decision about whether or not to continue to use an extension? I find it very hard to believe that an extension which is well established as the leading speech recognition software is a serious threat to me? </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,other,en-US,1630096;,Andy217
