The messages (wording) of the body of the email prints fine.  Different browsers prints fine, thus in order to print I have to use a different browser and prints fine.  Why is Firefox not permitting this?  Same thing with certain pdf's, it doesn't access it but other browsers are fine. I use Windows 10.
