They are doing this in Win 7 [and not on any other system I own of higher OS] by having FF constantly writing huge amounts of nothing to my disk, taking no less than a minute each time.  What does this do&nbsp;?  It causes STALLING of any and all functions until some internal clock decides to stop and release the system from this turmoil.  FF is hoping the user will get so frustrated that they will give up on Win7 and go to the hyper-surveillant Win11, but some of us are infinitely patient and will wait for the day when FF says ""You can no longer browse the internet with this version of Firefox,"" and I know that day will arrive.  Thanks, Soros.  So my question is, if there's even an answer&nbsp;; is there anything I can do besides all the usual page long crap of suggestions about computer maintenance, all of which are trite and redundant, so that I do not have to put up with this constant stalling via overwriting to disk&nbsp;?  Even Norton shows logs of FF excessive writing to disk and lists it in the Norton history.  None of this EVER happened until the notice arrived, what, a year ago or so, that M$ and FF were no longer supporting Win7.  How coincidental that I should now have to endure some kind of psychological torment for not allowing my entire computer experience to be surveilled by the DEMONS THAT BE.  Thank you, and if you find my rhetoric too inflammatory, then just forget it, but understand how sick to death of you meatheads I am. </p>",windows-7;desktop;troubleshooting;firefox-11513;firefox-115130;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",maxjenke
