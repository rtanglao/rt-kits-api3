I have used Firefox for many years and have never had a problem The browser is version 128.0.2 (64-bit). A few days ago in the application menu told me there was an update and said to install it because it couldn't check for updates. I downloaded and installed it three times now, but the problem still persists. My Bit Defender also keeps popping up messages telling me ""firefox.exe attempted to establish a connection relying on an unmatching security certificate to <a href=""http://aus5.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">aus5.mozilla.org</a>. We blocked the connection to keep your data safe since the used certificate was issued for a different web address than the targeted one."" I have had over 2000 of those messages in the past few days.  </p><p>I have never had an issue like this before. Is there a glitch in the most recent update? What can I do to fix it outside of resetting my browser, which logs me out of my google accounts and causes me to not be able to get back into them. </p>",desktop;windows-10;firefox-1280;install-and-update;firefox-12802;,firefox,install-and-update,en-US,"",LisaKordich
