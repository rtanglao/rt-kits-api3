This is renedring the Firefox View kind of pointless, as I still have to open my phone to check whether there was maybe one more important page that I wanted to check out, that was not listed in the Firefox View on my PC. At that point, I could very well just see what were I at, on the android device, and just google stuff again. The mixed approch (some opened via Firefox View and some manually) is more time consuming than either of the approaches alone, so I would really appreciate help, as Firefox View seemed to be a time-saver - I believe I have something set erroneously somwhere. Thanks! </p><p>I am on firefox 125.0.3. 64-bit. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",gawroon7

If i'm right about that, I think my question is: can I wipe my profile (or preferably only my bookmarks) from my phones' Firefox without having to entirely uninstall/reinstall (or do you have any other advice for not re-polluting the server from some already-polluted device's bookmarks? </p><p>thanks in advance </p>",desktop;sync;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,sync,en-US,1652943;,tonywoode

Před několika dny jsem musel znovu Firefox nainstalovat, všecko proběhlo tak jak má, až na to, že si nemohu zvolit motiv vzhledu, který by se mi líbil, neboť se Firefox přepíná na vzhled, který je dodán automaticky s operačním systémem. Nevím jak si poradit, i když jsem zkoušel rady, co jsou tady na fóru, nic z toho nefunguje, jsem z toho dost rozmrzelý.
