Appdata folder was removed as well, and did not affect the issue. I do not have any antivirus software other than windows defender, so that should not be an issue. My hardware is also not likely to be at fault, as it is sufficiently up to date (upgraded within last year, not sharing specs here). Chrome starts up in less than a second for reference.
