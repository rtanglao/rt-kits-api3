Since then it will not allow me to access site on the internet when I have ExpressVPN enabled.  ExpressVPN works with Safari.  I have spent over an hour working with a VPN tech.  It's fine.  The only change was updating Firefox.  Since then I have removed and re-installed both Firefox and ExpressVPN.  How do I resolve this? </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1240;,firefox,other,en-US,1643327;,friday.05
