Eu uso as notificações do Firefox ao invés das notificações do Windows.

Nestes últimos dias essas mesmas notificações aparecem no mesmo local, mas como uma janela selecionável na Barra de Tarefas do Windows, que faz com que a notificação não fique sobreposta se estou usando o mouse em outro programa (ou até mesmo no Firefox). O comportamento da notificação mudou, exigindo que eu busque na Barra de Tarefas do Windows qual notificação recebi. É um comportamento novo e irritante, que tira o sentido da notificação. Como faço para mudar isso? Existe algo nas configurações que eu possa fazer?
