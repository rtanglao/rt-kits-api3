In the process, I deleted Firefox (using Revo Uninstaller) and then reinstalled it, downloading it from the Mozilla website. Unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt run, giving me, at different attempts, different error messages. In the time since then, I have read many suggestions from many different websites and I have tried some of these suggestions, all with no success ‚Äì until today. I have just completed the suggestions made on <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1327628"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1327628</a> and Firefox is now back, working. I am happy and grateful, but not finished. None of my personal data came with the currently functioning version of Firefox. Since the re-emergence of Firefox, I have been reading several websites dealing with copy, backup and restore of my Firefox profile. Right now, the path C:\Users\rsuth\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\ shows 5 folders: Two of the folders show 11/11/24 as the date modified (probably the date of the download from Mozilla). The folder 0dppjrfa.default contains one file, times.json, dated 8/11/2020. The other folder, ru82tlj5.default-release, has 97 items, most dated 11/11/2024. The remaining three folders are all dated 12/2/24 (today, as I write this). One folder‚Äôs name ends .default, the second name ends .default-release, and the third name ends .default-release-thirteen digits. The question that I am asking here is what do I do next to, hopefully, bring back the personal date I had with Firefox before my updating to Windows 11. Should I delete the folders dated 12/2/24? What, if anything, is the significance of the folder whose name ends in 13 digits? I‚Äôm hoping someone will be able to tell me how to fix these Firefox problems. And if I can, then I hope to be able to do something similar to help me bring back Thunderbird as well. Thunderbird became unfunctioning at the same time as Firefox. Thank you. </p>",firefox;windows-11;backup-recovery-and-sync;firefox-1330;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,1691692;,I_Rufus

I have used Firefox for the most part going back to the beginning save a 2 year stint when Mozilla fell behind and did not update the product in the early years after ver 4.  However, the slowness of Firefox is so bad now that I may have to find or use another browser!  It is literally that bad!   This problem is recent as in the last 45 days as far as my individual needs.  I have already gone through the troubleshooting list and made the modifications. That seemed to work for a day or two but the slowness of Firefox is progressively getting worse with each passing day.  </p><p>The speed is like 3 minutes to 10 minutes when just trying to open a known and commonly used bookmark. Checked against Edge which came with Win 11 and Edge loads within a second or two. So, the problem is not hardware or internet connection. I have one of the fastest speeds on the planet with a true fiber optic connection as I am close to the backbone location in my city. We are talking 2.1gig down and 820MB up. Tested against two different speed tests.  The problem is with Firefox specific.  Mozilla needs to address this issue as it seems to be an ongoing problem across several IOS platforms. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",pablo222
