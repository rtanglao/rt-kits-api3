How do I get it back?","<p>I'm using a macbook air, and I was trying to use the fingerprint login thing, when instead of unlocking my puter it shut down the whole thing and it started to make very loud fan noises. I waited a few minutes for it to stop, then got back on, and my bookmarks and saved passwords were deleted from firefox. No passwords or logins were reset on any other applications. This is very alarming since I had just made an email and some accounts to manage some event I'm holding, and now the password I trusted to firefox is lost. I need this password, as otherwise I cannot log into my email since I hadn't time to set up recovery measures (I have tried to recover it, but there's insufficient evidence for google that I own the account&nbsp;:/ ).  </p><p>I tried looking through my browsing history for anything helpful, but everything was deleted from there as well. I also was not logged into my Mozilla account at the time either, so I am really in some sort of predicament here, , I'd appreciate any advice and ideas here!! </p>",desktop;troubleshooting;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",b0nes2852

This problem does not occur using Micrsoft Edge, only Firefox. Anyone have any suggestions??? </p>",desktop;windows-10;troubleshooting;firefox-1280;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",howe1
