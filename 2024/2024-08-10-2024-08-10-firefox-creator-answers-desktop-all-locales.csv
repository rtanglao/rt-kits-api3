Having upgraded Firefox to its version 129.0 recently, my Yahoo Mail cannot delete the incoming mail after reading.  In addition, the counter number of incoming mail remains the same and has no effect.

It has worked fine for me for years using Firefox.  However, in the last week or so, when I open an email message, I cannot see anything but empty ""From""and To""  fields.  Nothing is in the body of the message, either (see attached screenshot).  But, if I open a reply or forward message, everything in the original message appears normal (see other screenshot). This problem does not occur using Micrsoft Edge, only Firefox. Anyone have any suggestions??? </p>",desktop;windows-10;troubleshooting;firefox-1280;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",howe1
