Is there a way to send links from my iphone to my computer or firefox so that I can open the links as a batch or save them as a batch of bookmarks without individually clicking on them? I was thinking about sending them as I get the links on my iphone individually as html files, then highlighting all of them with my cursor and opening them all at once as separate tabs in firefox, then saving them as a batch of links (which I know how to do), but I don't know how to send links from iphone to my laptop as individual html files. </p><p>I tried firefox sync but it does not work well with iphone, because it will sync and sometimes delete previously saved bookmarks. So I'd like a new route if you have one. Apologies in advance if I should be on the apple or microsoft forum, please redirect me if so.
