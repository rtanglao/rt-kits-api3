Is there a way to turn off this behaviour without taking those suggestions out of the search altogether? I just want to be able to type in ""maps"" into my address bar and be taken to google maps when I press enter, not to go to whatever site I have visited before that uses maps. Currently I have to type out my search and then press an arrow key or backspace to ensure it's a google search. I still WANT to have those suggestions in the dropdown menu for selection, but I DON'T want it to autocomplete a URL for me when I just want to go to google maps. </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",chris.schnedler
