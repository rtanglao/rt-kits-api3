Other websites via other tabs tend to run and function just fine 24/7.  </p><p>I'm running the latest 133.0.3 version of Firefox, and my system specs are as follows: </p><p>Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-10700T CPU @ 2.00GHz Storage: 595.2 GB Installed RAM: 16 GB (15.7 GB usable) </p><p>Other people have also reported similar things over on Reddit with regards to Firefox and YouTube. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",PocketRocket
