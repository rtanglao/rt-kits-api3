This was on a Windows 11 box. Everything seemed fine, but then one of my tabs crashed. I selected the reload tab option, at which point it informed me it could not load the tab because a background update had happened and I was now required to restart Firefox. </p><p>I'm not certain what version of FF I was on, I believe it was either 126 or 126.0.1.  </p><p>Now, to be completely fair, I cannot with 100% certainty say that I clicked on the update later option. That said, as I _did not want to update then_, and I have put off the update before, it seems unlikely I would have made the mistake, but I wasn't recording everything I did so I can't play it back and prove it. My initial reaction was to associate it with the tab crashing somehow, as everything was working as expected right up until that moment. </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;,firefox,other,en-US,"",pobox3

But Firefox is still there.  </p><p>2) When I turnoff my Comodo Firewall, Firefox has no Internet connection. </p><p>I have done clean uninstalls/reinstalls over and over. I go thru and adjust settings. My other browsers work fine, including WaterFox, WaterFox Classic, and Vivaldi. </p><p>I tried turning off my security software to test. Specifically exiting Comodo Firewall seems to have caused Firefox to not have an Internet connection. All other browsers have Internet access except Firefox. And the Crash Reporter cannot ""report"" when the Firefox Internet connection does not work, though I did have it report many times when the connection DID work. </p><p>One other clue: In Task Manager I see that even though I have closed Firefox, there over 20 instances of it still running. When I try to open it again, I get the ""Firefox already running"" error message. When I try to kill these instances/processes many will not close. </p><p>This problem has been persistent for more than half a year since I built my new PC. I am on Windows 10 LTSC.

Current FF = 107.0.2 I have several PC's, previously NOT synced.  All have overlapping bookmarks - some unique, others the same.  My question has to do ONLY with bookmarks.

When I sync machine A with machine B, I assume entries that are different are copied to the server AND then duplicated to the machine that did not have it.  Q:  Is the item that determines the uniqueness the NAME or the URL? </pre> <p>2.  For entries common to both machines:  copied to server, left alone on both machine. Q: To be considered the same - do they need to have both same NAME and Url? 3a.  Same name but different url?  What happens? 3b  Same url but different name?  What happens? </p><p>............................ Now assume we have 2 synced machines with identical bookmarks.

I can copy the url address and paste it into my Safari browser bar and all proceeds as it should ad I get logged in, etc. There is also an issue with my NYT digital account. Sometimes Firefox acts normally, signing me in and allowing me to read articles and so forth. But often, capriciously I would say since it makes no sense at all it will arrive at the lage and for an instant I'll see the article, or video, and then the page will go blank. Reloading produces the same result and I am unable in Firefox to see the content. If I go to the content on Safari, all is fine. I am seriously considering returning to Safari as my default browser.
