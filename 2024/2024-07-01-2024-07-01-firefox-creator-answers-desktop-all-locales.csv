So i wanted to set up a password for my firefox browser so that only I can access it. i set a primary password, and it asks me to enter the password when i open my browser. However, when the message appears asking me to enter the password, you can just click ""cancel"" option or press 'x' it ignores the password and lets me in the browser, essentially rendering the purpose of the password useless. thus anyone can access my browser. i request you to fix this problem.

It has always been working like a champ, but a few weeks ago, individual YouTube video pages look very odd. Usually the related recommended videos are along the right edge in one row, and below the default video window is the title, description, and then the comments.  </p><p>The problem I have is that these two components became transposed, and if the video is displayed as full screen, the page can be pushed upwards to show the title etc got squashed below the video window, with the recommended videos still in a grid below it. I hope the included pictures are sufficient to illustrate the issue. </p><p>Another computer, an iMac running El Capitan 10.11.6, and Firefox 78.15.0ser owned by a family member, does not show this odd phenomenon. I must say I am quite intrigued by this, and would greatly appreciate any help my fellow members can offer. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1014;firefox-115120;firefox-11512;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Seele

When I am in Firefox version 127.0.2 and I go into any Google search, the tab crashes. It works in private browsing mode and also in other browsers but not in non-private browsing in Firefox. I have tried disabling extensions, add ons, etc. Nothing seems to help. This started happening a few weeks ago with any YouTube page also. How can I fix this? If I can't I will stop using Firefox as I cannot function like this. Please advise! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1659913;,sue5
