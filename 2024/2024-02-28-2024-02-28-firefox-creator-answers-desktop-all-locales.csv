I know it's Firefox, because I look at the system monitor, and there are even more entries for <a href=""http://firefox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">firefox.com</a> running than usual. The first one on the top of the list is the biggest resource hog, and the next one is second. All the rest have something going on, but smaller. Looking at performance in the Windows Task Manager, under performance, the memory usage goes up. Right now, it's 5.35Gb of 16Gb. At worst, several days ago, it was at 12Gb. When I force close Firefox, the memory and usage goes way, way down, to a usable level. </p><p>I wrote last night. ""Ed"" someone got back to me, didn't quote my message, and said he was from another department. I DID EXACTLY THE SAME THING AS LAST NIGHT. I hit the blue button, which took me here, and he advised me to do today, which brought me here, AGAIN. </p><p>If this, again, goes to ""restoring access to Mozilla accounts and subscription services such as Mozilla VPN"", please be professional and forward it to the right department, possibly with my message quoted, as this is the second time I'm creating it, and only have my memory on which to fall back for the first time. The logical topic is ""Fix slowness, crashing, error messages, and other problems"". </p><p>At the same time, other releases have had big memory leaks, and they seem to get patched quickly. </p><p>Thank you again. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Apollyon48

Is there any software or application on Firefox that can help me pre-name the image&nbsp;? </p><p>For example: I'm looking for pictures of Trees and Sea </p><p>when I click to <strong>save image as</strong> for Sea images, it often gives random names and I end up having to rename the images to Sea-0001, Sea-0002 </p><p>if a photo named <em>Thailandbay-34636734-45747457</em> </p><p>Therefore, my usual way is to write <em>Sea-</em> and copy the text </p><p>and when I save a photo when click to <strong>save image as</strong>, I will change the name in Hud , I paste it and it becomes </p><p><em>Sea-Thailandbay-34636734-45747457</em> </p><p>and in my work file I'll sort the photos by name </p><p>So , is there any application on Firefox that allows me to preset the word <em>Sea-</em>&nbsp;? That means every time I click <em>save image as</em>, the system will automatically name it <em>Sea-Thailandbay-34636734-45747457</em> </p><p>Thank you </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,1639232;,caothuchoiterran
