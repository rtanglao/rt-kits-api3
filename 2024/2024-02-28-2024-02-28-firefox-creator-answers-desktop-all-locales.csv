I am using a different computer now to post this with the virtually identical software.   This Intel pad differs from the Beelink Ryzen unit which is the  unit going berserk.    Is there anything that you can  tell me other than the Ctl+0 to modify the operation of the unit.   I had swapped out the monitor on the Beelink though I have no idea that the monitor is the problem as I do not have the same issue withDiscover or the desktop or any of the other software.    I can open up Konsole and use that or open up OpenOffice or OfficeLibre with no similar issue.

I know it's Firefox, because I look at the system monitor, and there are even more entries for <a href=""http://firefox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">firefox.com</a> running than usual. The first one on the top of the list is the biggest resource hog, and the next one is second. All the rest have something going on, but smaller. Looking at performance in the Windows Task Manager, under performance, the memory usage goes up. Right now, it's 5.35Gb of 16Gb. At worst, several days ago, it was at 12Gb. When I force close Firefox, the memory and usage goes way, way down, to a usable level. </p><p>I wrote last night. ""Ed"" someone got back to me, didn't quote my message, and said he was from another department. I DID EXACTLY THE SAME THING AS LAST NIGHT. I hit the blue button, which took me here, and he advised me to do today, which brought me here, AGAIN. </p><p>If this, again, goes to ""restoring access to Mozilla accounts and subscription services such as Mozilla VPN"", please be professional and forward it to the right department, possibly with my message quoted, as this is the second time I'm creating it, and only have my memory on which to fall back for the first time.
