Is there any software or application on Firefox that can help me pre-name the image&nbsp;? </p><p>For example: I'm looking for pictures of Trees and Sea </p><p>when I click to <strong>save image as</strong> for Sea images, it often gives random names and I end up having to rename the images to Sea-0001, Sea-0002 </p><p>if a photo named <em>Thailandbay-34636734-45747457</em> </p><p>Therefore, my usual way is to write <em>Sea-</em> and copy the text </p><p>and when I save a photo when click to <strong>save image as</strong>, I will change the name in Hud , I paste it and it becomes </p><p><em>Sea-Thailandbay-34636734-45747457</em> </p><p>and in my work file I'll sort the photos by name </p><p>So , is there any application on Firefox that allows me to preset the word <em>Sea-</em>&nbsp;? That means every time I click <em>save image as</em>, the system will automatically name it <em>Sea-Thailandbay-34636734-45747457</em> </p><p>Thank you </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,1639232;,caothuchoiterran
