It always worked.  But lately, I noticed that huge numbers of blank pages are inserted in the pdf file, seemingly at random.  I looked at the HTML source, and could not see anything that obviously triggers the blank pages.  For example, a web page that ought to print to about 35 pages generates a file of more than 600 pages, with most of them blank. </p><p>I can use Microsoft Edge as an alternative, but pdf files from that browser strip out all the color, and are nevertheless super huge, about ten times larger than the ones from Firefox.  E.g. the file mentioned above, about 35 pages, would be about 1.3 MB from firefox, and 12 MB from Edge.  So getting the file from Firefox would be nice. </p><p>Is there a reason why print to pdf is behaving in this strange way, and anything I can do about it? </p>",desktop;beta;other;windows-10;firefox-1250;,firefox,other,en-US,"",argnotagain

I don't have it blocked in Notifications. I have allowed pop-up windows for it. I can't figure out what else might be preventing it from loading. It is free. I don't have this problem with any other website that I know of. I'm running the latest version of Firefox &amp; have Windows 11 on a one-year-old PC. I didn't have this problem in my old computer, which ran Windows 7. Please help. Thanks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1250;firefox-12501;,firefox,other,en-US,"",deborahfeller
