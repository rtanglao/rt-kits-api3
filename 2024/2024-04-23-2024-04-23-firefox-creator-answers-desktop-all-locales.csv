It always worked.  But lately, I noticed that huge numbers of blank pages are inserted in the pdf file, seemingly at random.  I looked at the HTML source, and could not see anything that obviously triggers the blank pages.  For example, a web page that ought to print to about 35 pages generates a file of more than 600 pages, with most of them blank. </p><p>I can use Microsoft Edge as an alternative, but pdf files from that browser strip out all the color, and are nevertheless super huge, about ten times larger than the ones from Firefox.  E.g. the file mentioned above, about 35 pages, would be about 1.3 MB from firefox, and 12 MB from Edge.  So getting the file from Firefox would be nice. </p><p>Is there a reason why print to pdf is behaving in this strange way, and anything I can do about it? </p>",desktop;beta;other;windows-10;firefox-1250;,firefox,other,en-US,1648966;,argnotagain
