I don't have it blocked in Notifications. I have allowed pop-up windows for it. I can't figure out what else might be preventing it from loading. It is free. I don't have this problem with any other website that I know of. I'm running the latest version of Firefox &amp; have Windows 11 on a one-year-old PC. I didn't have this problem in my old computer, which ran Windows 7. Please help.
