This has started happening recently, and it doesn't happen under Chrome or Edge. What is going on? </p>",desktop;troubleshooting;firefox-1290;firefox-12901;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",yjkhan

Sometimes only tabs crash, sometimes Firefox crashes. It is not tied to any actions, a tab can crash even if you don't perform any actions in the browser. I have tried clean install on Fedora and Vanilla OS, native and Flatpak packages. The result is always the same - tabs or Firefox crashes every few minutes. </p>",linux;desktop;troubleshooting;firefox-1290;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",podterebkov.m

I have repaired firefox,and created a new profile as advised by members of the French forum.i have also created a new account.  On the computer only, I no longer have the subtitles on the skillshare site. When I go to pinterest and deezer, the page does not display normally. I can't see the images in the duckduckgo search either, because I've been redirected to a non-javascript site.  I had ccleaner, it was suggested to me that the problem came from there but I uninstalled it before creating the new profile. I also have bit defender free on my devices.

When I try to watch a video, the video becomes a static image of one frame.  When I switch tabs and come back to the video, or hit refresh, it changes to the latest frame of the video but freezes once again. I have the latest version of Firefox and am using a Macbook.  Per suggestions I have found online, I have tried disabling all my extensions, deleting my cache, deleting the Firefox folder in my ~/Library, making sure DRM content is enabled, and uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox altogether.  Nothing works.  Was hoping to switch over to Firefox since Google Chrome has banned ublock origin, but I keep running into these obnoxious video problems.  The same issue also happens on Amazon Prime Video, but only when I press full screen. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;website-breakages;firefox-1290;firefox-12901;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1668863;1668864;1668869;,jubinpakdel1
