So, if I have enough tabs open that I need to scroll to see them all, my pinned tabs scroll to the left and go out of sight. Before update they were always in place, and only unpinned tabs were scrolling. Is there a way to make them stationary again? </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-11;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",leeefreeland

I have repaired firefox,and created a new profile as advised by members of the French forum.i have also created a new account.  On the computer only, I no longer have the subtitles on the skillshare site. When I go to pinterest and deezer, the page does not display normally. I can't see the images in the duckduckgo search either, because I've been redirected to a non-javascript site.  I had ccleaner, it was suggested to me that the problem came from there but I uninstalled it before creating the new profile. I also have bit defender free on my devices.  Thank you. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1290;firefox-12901;,firefox,other,en-US,"",unicornwithgoldenhooves

When I try to watch a video, the video becomes a static image of one frame.  When I switch tabs and come back to the video, or hit refresh, it changes to the latest frame of the video but freezes once again. I have the latest version of Firefox and am using a Macbook.  Per suggestions I have found online, I have tried disabling all my extensions, deleting my cache, deleting the Firefox folder in my ~/Library, making sure DRM content is enabled, and uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox altogether.  Nothing works.  Was hoping to switch over to Firefox since Google Chrome has banned ublock origin, but I keep running into these obnoxious video problems.  The same issue also happens on Amazon Prime Video, but only when I press full screen. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;website-breakages;firefox-1290;firefox-12901;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1668863;,jubinpakdel1
