I checked history and Library and restore. And  the 27th and 28th Feb are missing. So I am thinking do I have two Firefox accounts and that's the reason the dates are missing&nbsp;?.  Is their anyway to find the two days I was browsing&nbsp;?.  </p><p>Gerard </p>",desktop;bookmarks;mac-os-x-1013;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",gerardk94

There are many many easy ways to change it so this can never happen to people anymore. Why has this not been fixed after all this time? I am a retired IT pro and this has even happened to me. It is horrible. What can users do to not have this happen, since the developers apparently can't be bothered? And please don't tell me not to keep so many tabs open JUST because the browser sucks at protecting them. Any good news appreciated. Thanks. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1639917;,bywhite7
