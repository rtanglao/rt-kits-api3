Is there a way to prevent firefox from stopping audio playback?,"<p>I was on a teams meeting because I wanted to do a study session with someone on another country. As part of the homework I needed to do, I needed to listen to some audio. I changed my windows audio devices to output through the Communications device for the headset. Then I played the audio on a tab. The audio played for a few seconds before stopping again. </p><p>I understand that this is behaviour intended to let you take a call or meeting without having to manually pause any open tabs you might not have at hand, but I would like Firefox to understand I really want that audio to play without thinking it knows better. Is there any way to disable this behavior? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ardyvee

Pokud mám na druhém monitoru video v režimu PiP a např. si otevřu nějakou aplikaci nebo program, může se stát že se ta aplikace nebo program otevře právě na monitoru kde mám video v režimu PiP takže musím to PiP okno posunout abych se dostal k aplikaci nebo programu co jsem si právě otevřel. Deaktivace always-on-top nebo vždy na popředí by bylo užitečné jelikož by se dalo tomuto problému vyvarovat. <strong>Hledám řešení jak vyřešit tento problém, proto pokládám dotaz.</strong> Děkuji za Váš čas. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1230;,firefox,customize,cs,"",Tomajjs
