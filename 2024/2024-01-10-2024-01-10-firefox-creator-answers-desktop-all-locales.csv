Rendering websites works just fine, but Firefox itself won't show any text. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1120;firefox-11201;,firefox,other,en-US,1629505;1629512;,imdownunderthere

Trying to open it FF entered an endless loop opening new tabs with names like: ""/tmp/pid-949/IMG_9409.heic"".  There was no easy way to stop it, the 'X' button did nothing.  It opened hundreds of tabs. I had to kill all my tabs to get rid of them.  BTW there's supposed to be a 'Recover Previous Session' button in the main menu.  Not there.  On line, I see several different images of what my main menu is supposed to look like but mine is nothing like that.  I have 115.6.0esr (64-bit). </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1150;,firefox,other,en-US,1629498;1629516;,rayandrews

Some websites show this problem too. </p><p>I tried downgrading back to 119 and it displays fine.
