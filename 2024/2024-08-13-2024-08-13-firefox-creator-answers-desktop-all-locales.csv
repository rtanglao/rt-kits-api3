Quando clico em uma das imagens com o link externo recebo uma mensagem de ""Link Externo Bloqueado"" conforme foto em anexo. Parou de funcionar em E-mails antigos que o link funcionava normalmente. Qualquer outro link externo de qualquer outro email e ou loja funciona normalmente. Tenho um conhecimento até avançado de informática. Veja as minhas ações para tentar resolver o problema, mas que não deram resultado. Fiz o teste no Edge, Google Chrome e Mozilla Firefox e problema se apresenta nos 3 navegadores. Então conclui que o problema é de atualização do Windows10, ou de configuração do E-mail. Identifiquei duas atualizações a KB5041355 instalada dia 09/08/2024 e a KB5034441 instalada dia 04/08/2024. Tentei desinstalar e após a reinicialização elas estão lá novamente. Não tenho anti vírus instalado e desativei o ""Firewall e Proteção de Rede"" do Windows, desativei ""Proteção contra Vírus e Ameaças"". Já tentei inscerir excessões em tudo que é lugar que conheço e mesmo assim o link externo somente do Aliexpress está bloqueado. </p><p>Espero que alguém possa me ajudar. </p><p>Att.

Here are a few steps you can try to resolve the issue: </p><p>Clear Cache and Cookies: Sometimes, old cache and cookies can cause problems with loading websites. Go to Firefox’s menu, select ""Settings,"" then navigate to ""Privacy &amp; Security,"" and under ""Cookies and Site Data,"" click ""Clear Data."" </p><p>Check for Extensions: Some extensions might interfere with website functionality. Try disabling your extensions one by one to see if any of them are causing the issue. You can do this by going to the menu, selecting ""Add-ons and themes,"" and then disabling each extension. </p><p>Update Firefox: Ensure you’re using the latest version of Firefox. Updates often include bug fixes and improvements that might resolve your issue. Check for updates by going to the menu, selecting ""Help,"" and then ""About Firefox."" </p><p>Disable Hardware Acceleration: Occasionally, hardware acceleration can cause display issues. Go to the menu, select ""Settings,"" then ""General,"" scroll down to ""Performance,"" and uncheck ""Use recommended performance settings."" You can then uncheck ""Use hardware acceleration when available."" </p><p>Try Safe Mode: Firefox’s Safe Mode can help determine if the problem is related to your current settings or extensions. Restart Firefox in Safe Mode by going to the menu, selecting ""Help,"" and then ""Restart with Add-ons Disabled."" </p><p>Check for Known Issues: Sometimes, there are known compatibility issues or bugs with specific websites. Check the Firefox Support site or forums to see if others are experiencing similar issues with [website name]. </p><p>Try a Fresh Profile: Creating a new Firefox profile can help if there are issues with your current profile.

I think the message was that the update would be downloaded and then the computer would do a restart.  I think the download occurred but not the restart.  I was then logged onto the site and clicked to join the class.  I was only on about 20 minutes as Zoom kept dropping outto the zoom login screen.  After this happened about 5 times I gave up and switched the computer off.   On Monday I logged onto aother zoom class via the came site and againthe Zoom class kept dropping me out to the login screen although a couple of times it went back in on its own.
