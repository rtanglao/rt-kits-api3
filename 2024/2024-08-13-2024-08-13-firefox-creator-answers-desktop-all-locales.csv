Não tenho anti vírus instalado e desativei o ""Firewall e Proteção de Rede"" do Windows, desativei ""Proteção contra Vírus e Ameaças"".

Here are a few steps you can try to resolve the issue: </p><p>Clear Cache and Cookies: Sometimes, old cache and cookies can cause problems with loading websites. Go to Firefox’s menu, select ""Settings,"" then navigate to ""Privacy &amp; Security,"" and under ""Cookies and Site Data,"" click ""Clear Data."" </p><p>Check for Extensions: Some extensions might interfere with website functionality. Try disabling your extensions one by one to see if any of them are causing the issue. You can do this by going to the menu, selecting ""Add-ons and themes,"" and then disabling each extension. </p><p>Update Firefox: Ensure you’re using the latest version of Firefox. Updates often include bug fixes and improvements that might resolve your issue. Check for updates by going to the menu, selecting ""Help,"" and then ""About Firefox."" </p><p>Disable Hardware Acceleration: Occasionally, hardware acceleration can cause display issues. Go to the menu, select ""Settings,"" then ""General,"" scroll down to ""Performance,"" and uncheck ""Use recommended performance settings."" You can then uncheck ""Use hardware acceleration when available."" </p><p>Try Safe Mode: Firefox’s Safe Mode can help determine if the problem is related to your current settings or extensions. Restart Firefox in Safe Mode by going to the menu, selecting ""Help,"" and then ""Restart with Add-ons Disabled."" </p><p>Check for Known Issues: Sometimes, there are known compatibility issues or bugs with specific websites. Check the Firefox Support site or forums to see if others are experiencing similar issues with [website name]. </p><p>Try a Fresh Profile: Creating a new Firefox profile can help if there are issues with your current profile. You can create a new profile by typing about: profiles in the address bar and following the instructions. </p><p>If you’ve tried all these steps and the issue persists, please provide more details about the problem you’re experiencing, such as error messages or specific parts of the site that aren’t working.
