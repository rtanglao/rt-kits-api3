I AM CONNECTED!!!","<p>I am constantly seeing this message on YouTube. I don't have troubles with any other website. I get this message yet other tabs will happily load different pages. I have a fibre connection, I am definitely connected! I have tried everything I can find to remedy this problem but nothing works, for example a flush DNS command. And yes, of course it absolutely still happens in troubleshoot mode. </p><p>This has been happening for over a year now and it is absolutely driving me insane. Whenever this happens I can open another browser and will have none of these problems with that browser. I have been using Firefox for over 20 years religiously, but I am getting so sick of this that if I don't find a solution for this problem soon I will be done with Firefox, I don't even know why I've persisted with this problem for so long.
