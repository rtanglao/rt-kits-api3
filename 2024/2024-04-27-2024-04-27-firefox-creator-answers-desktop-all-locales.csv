Before the update I could type T in the search bar and up popped the URL for The Globe and Mail; or N and the URL for the New York Times popped up. (This works because no other bookmark begins with these letters.) Both are in my Toolbar (no bookmarks have actually changed or disappeared with the update). Now when I type T, a completely different URL turns up, plus a drop-down menu of other URLs randomly selected from any of my bookmark lists IN WHICH A T APPEARS ANYWHERE in it; and when I type N, a website I've NEVER EVEN SEEN BEFORE (<a href=""http://name.com"" rel=""nofollow"">name.com</a>) shows up, plus a drop-down menu with URLs from my bookmarks that contain an N anywhere in the URL. Why is this happening, and how to fix it? Please don't tell me I have to switch back to Safari. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;firefox-1250;firefox-12502;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",gtintner
