However in consequence it imported EVERYTHING from the Chrome browser. I deliberately like to keep data separate from browsers, aside from login data. My Chrome browser has way more bookmarks, in other words, my Firefox browser gets cluttered by this and kind of indistinguishable. I don't like that. </p><p>I still have an installation of Firefox on an other system that's just a few months old that should be fine. Can I determine the direction of the sync, whether it downloads or uploads data? This could solve my problem. Alternatively, may there be different save states to choose from (although this may the same question)? </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",macetheace

This is terrible reliability. </p><p>I hired Dell Tech Support and they checked my software and there were no issues. I have run advance Norton features and there are no problems.  Therefore the issue is NOT with my 20 month Dell computer. </p><p>Firefox has always been reliable until late August.  For four weeks it would freeze and lock up.  by the end of Sept it was slightly better and then fine in November.  Now it only freezes, put the mouse over the image and it freezes.  Play with it for a while and it unlocks. </p><p>I am totally fed up with Firefox.  I'll be starting my taxes soon and year end things and can't afford to have all these issues and rebooting to help eliminate the issue. </p><p>When is Firefox tech support going to help me?  When is Firefox going to fix the issue?  After Christmas I am looking into the Microsoft software......enough is enought! </p>",firefox-13303;firefox-1330;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1697416;,dmineard
