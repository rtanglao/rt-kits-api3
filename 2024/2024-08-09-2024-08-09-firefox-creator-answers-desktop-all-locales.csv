So if any of you guys out there have seen any of these problems, could you please report them?  I've wasted so much time with all this that I have no more, and I'm just exhausted with it. </p><p>I Recently Upgraded to Firefox 128.1.0 ESR Windows 11  (I did not have ESR before - waited until version numbers for both versions were the same (128.0.0) before I switched so the profiles (presumably) would not be affected.  However since the update to 128.1.0esr multiple problems have appeared.  I switched to ESR because I just don't have time right now to deal with inadequately tested software.  This should have been a beta (for those who have available extra time), not a roll-out (to those who are already underwater). </p><p>1. Both in Firefox and in two webmail applications (GMX &amp; PROTON), pages appear blank (white text on white background) until SELECTED, then text appears and goes away when deselected. You cannot work with it that way.  It doesn't happen with other browsers, such as DuckDuckGo - only in Firefox. </p><p>2. While going through Settings after so many glitches occurred, I selected Firefox DARK, to see how it looked, since I use it on my iphone, but it didn't work because many of the text items in various places were grey - grey on black is not readable.  And in some cases, it was apparently black text on black background that would only appear if selected.  When I tried to choose ""light"" again (or automatic) in FF settings,  it still leaves SOME scattered pages dark/unreadable, this includes some options pages for FF extensions.  </p><p>3. The drag &amp; drop to rearrange the order of items in extension ""AutoPinTab"" no longer works - it does nothing at all.  I think the drag icons are not actively detecting mouse touches. </p><p>4.  Settings/General/Startup   ""Open previous windows and tabs""  box is NOT checked, but FF does it anyway.    </p><p>5.  Other things in FF Settings and in FF Extensions no longer work right.  I don't have time to go back through and detail each one right now.  I'm so behind because of all these problems.  One fix will likely fix other related problems (or even seemingly unrelated ones). </p><p>6. In Settings/Manage Your Extensions - ""Reset all Add-ons to Update Manually""  does not work.  It doesn't change anything in any extension from DEFAULT or ON   to OFF. </p><p>7. ""Always Show""is checked for ""Bookmarks Toolbar"", but although the space for the bar appears, the only thing on it is the ""For quick access, place your bookmarks here on the bookmarks toolbar"" and  ""Manage bookmarks....""  I can find NO way to get the actual bookmarks back onto the bar - In the right-click context menu that offers ""Menu Toolbar"" ""Bookmarks Toolbar"" and ""Customize Toolbar"", the Bookmarks Toolbar is set to ""Always Show"" but it no longer works, and won't show the bookmarks.  I'm sure this is something the update did - I recall something similar many years ago.  The bookmarks are on my drive and FF can access them very clumsily in a time consuming, confusing, round-about way, but they are NOT on the Bookmarks Toolbar any longer and there appears to be no way to get them there. </p><p>8.  Extensions.  Now, some of the extensions will not put their icons up on the toolbars, nor do they all work as they say they do, or as they did.  Firefox is becoming unusable for me.  There is more, but I'm going to send this for now, hoping someone has some idea what is going on - maybe fixing one bug will fix others too.  The missing bookmarks and the white-on-white and black-on-black text, especially in GMX and PROTON email (which only occur when using the Firefox browser to access them) are what's killing me - I don't have time to learn another browser right now. </p><p>Are there any plans to address all the current problems in a timely way?   It would be much better to wait, to wait until everything has been properly tested before putting onto the machines of people who may not have the luxury of time to debug it for you.  </p><p>I am so frustrated and stressed right now.  I hope someone can offer some ideas and will let Firefox Bugzilla know.  I tried but was not successful.  Right now, I just feel like crying.  Watch all this be something  I'VE done wrong, from sheer exhaustion&nbsp;!!      --AnneF . </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1281;firefox-12810;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1667261;,x.computer
