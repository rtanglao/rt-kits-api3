Here is my setup: </p><p>- I'm using Firefox 124.0.2 on macOS Sonoma 14.4.1.  - DNS over HTTPS is set to Off in Firefox.  - My Mac is configured to use a DNS server that blocks some domains, such as <a href=""http://facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">facebook.com</a>. I have confirmed that this is working correctly by using the dig tool on the commandline: ""dig <a href=""http://facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">facebook.com</a>"" receives a ""status: REFUSED"" response with an empty A record. - When I navigate to <a href=""http://facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">facebook.com</a> or other domains that should be blocked in Firefox, they are resolved. My expectation is that they should fail to load and a DNS error should be displayed. </p><p>What I've tried: </p><p>- Confirmed via GUI and about:config that DNS over HTTPS is completely disabled in Firefox. - Cleared Firefox DNS cache via about:networking. - Confirmed every way I know how that macOS is configured to use my custom DNS resolver and that the resolver is refusing queries for the specific domains I expect to be blocked. </p><p>I'd be grateful for any suggestions anyone can provide. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ben184

One of the joys of living remotely. However, an unexpected event occurred, causing all my add-ons to vanish. I am very concerned, firstly because that can happen, and secondly, what happens to the data stored? Even after the PC rebooted, my Mozilla account remained logged in. I didn't need to log back in to get to this support page. The sync is on and has been completed. The most inconvenient part is that I was working on some integrations between Obsidian, Readwise, Logsec, Omnivore, and syncing accounts when the outage happened. Because of memory issues, I now need to remember which extensions I had and recently added, which is why the aforementioned apps are necessary. The add-on I am most concerned about is my password manager extension. I've made logging in feel like trying to get into a fortress, so having to go through that again is giving me anxiety. Anyone know how or why add-ons could possibly disappear like that? I'm a long-term ""want to use Firefox"" person, but this sort of thing really turns me off, and I hate all the other browsers because of their lack of security. I'd love to hear your thoughts on fixing this and what I can do if it happens again in the future. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jag5

I går dömdes en tydligen sexuellt ofredande individ i Helsingborg till ett halvårs fängelse. Jämför med att jag dömdes av tf Domaren Martin Persson Helsingborgs TR samt åklagaren Claudio Gittermann till ett års fängelse eller egentligen på obestämd tid med rättspsykiatrisk vård för att ge utrymme för ett noga av polisen Bengt Andersson Ängelholm arrangerar angrepp där en lagfartskapare Emanuelsson från Varberg anställts av kronofogden i Helsingborg för att komma över vår egendom i Mölle och avsikten med arrangemanget visat sig vara ett direkt mordförsök på mig. I upplägget deltog Syriska Hamas med en expert från invandralägret i Nyhamnsläge. Gängkriminella infiltrerar myndigheter och politiska partier enligt Gunnar Strömmer. Här har vi alltså exempel på hur gängkriminella infiltrerat polis domare och kronofogde samt inom rättspsyk. Det har visat sig att två huvudsakliga grunder kunnat identifieras nämligen dels angrepp med anledning av tidigare angrepp då bland annat generaldirektören Anita HSAN medverkat i borttagande av journalblad för en av mina patienter för att försöka skapa falsk grund för en falsk anmälan mot mig där socialdemokraterna i Regeringen och Regions styrelsen Skåne samverkade i brottet som avsåg att tysta mig för att kunna angripa mina forskarkollegor i USA för att de hade en judisk bakgrund och vårt arbete hade blivit alldeles för lyckat för en grupp sossar från Malmö som hade tänkt utnyttja min forskningsvistelse för att skapa ett radioprogram som man ville kunna använda för att förmå någon sinnessjuk att mörda den såsom utrikesminister Anna Lindh ifrågasatte vilka intressen som låg bakom Palmemordet och det gäller först just sådana Hamassossar som inte tyckte att Palme passar i den modell de tänkt sig för sossarna. Den andra anledningen till angreppet kan härledas till Bengt Andersson medverkan i stölden av vårt aktiebolag von Malmborg Innovation AB. </p>,desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",vonmalmborgjm
