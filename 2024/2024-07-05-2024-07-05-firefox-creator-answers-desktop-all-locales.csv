This has happened well over a dozen times. I've tried multiple step-by-step solutions: deactivating extensions, troubleshooting mode, repairing firefox, uninstalling and installing Firefox, trying several versions of Firefox (Quantum, ESR, Nightly), downgrading to an earlier version, uninstalling and completely cleaning Mozilla folders on AppData, deactivating graphics/hardware acceleration...  </p><p>At one point, Firefox was crashing after ten seconds of watching a video on Youtube or another platform. After reinstallation, video playback no longer causes the browser to crash, but closing a tab does. </p><p>I am currently using Mozilla ESR 115.12.0. After reinstalling, I lost all the reports I sent. Nevertheless, I was able to reproduce the crash to give you the ID: [<a href=""https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/a2d0f5de-d03f-450b-88f8-a8fdc0240705"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/repor.../a2d0f5de-d03f-450b-88f8-a8fdc0240705</a>] Another crash report&nbsp;: [<a href=""https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/71c602f6-c682-4158-9880-24d6a0240705"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/repor.../71c602f6-c682-4158-9880-24d6a0240705</a>]   </p><p>According to the crash table, the reason for the crash is as follows: EXCEPTION_STACK_BUFFER_OVERRUN / FAST_FAIL_GUARD_ICALL_CHECK_FAILURE This reason appears on all crashes.  </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-115120;firefox-11512;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",pedrochiron
