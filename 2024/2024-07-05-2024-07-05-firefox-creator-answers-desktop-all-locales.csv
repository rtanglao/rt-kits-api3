Buying things online is one the the basic activities anyone does using a browser these days, yet I am increasingly finding myself unable to do so.  </p><p>It's a particular concern because, like many others, I am disabled and depend on the internet for the delivery of essential goods and services. </p><p>This problem for me began a few years ago with the Cashflows payment service that many retailers use. The card details entry page would never load up and consequently no payment could be attempted, nevermind passing through the security checks after this. Earlier this year or so, Firefox updated itself and seemingly fixed the problem. </p><p>Today, I again have problems with Firefox and Cashflows-enabled websites. I also have problems with VivaWallet-enabled sites now too, and one other that I presently forget the name of. Possibly also Apple's website, but I'm not too sure about this. Taking the browser right down to base settings with no extensions etc, a fresh clean install even, does nothing to resolve it. </p><p>The workaround seems to be use a Chrome-based browser instead, undermining the privacy and security advantages of Firefox, although this doesn't always work in all cases. I also find this less accessible as a disabled user, not that Firefox doesn't still have a long way to go towards accessibility - it certainly does, especially since it dispensed with the Nuance extension for Dragon. </p><p>Is Firefox intending to shoot itself in the proverbial foot? Because I don't think it will have much of a future if it can't at least get this bit right, for all the security and privacy advantages it cares to boast about. </p><p>It's an infuriating and distressing issue. As I encounter more payment issues, I begin to wonder how much more my world could close in on me. Imagine if all the other browsers started behaving this way too? It's a scary thought. </p><p>Please, Firefox, make this issue the priority it deserves to be. You can have all the security and privacy bells you like, but a browser that is otherwise dysfunctional is no good to anyone. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",BlueTurtle

After reinstallation, video playback no longer causes the browser to crash, but closing a tab does. </p><p>I am currently using Mozilla ESR 115.12.0.
