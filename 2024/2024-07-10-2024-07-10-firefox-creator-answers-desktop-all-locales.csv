I found that the two screens will cross each other under Firefox, but not under Google Chrome. Under Firefox, when two tabs are opened, the images will affect each other. It seems that after drawing through the timer, the browsers share a webgl context. </p><p>After testing we found: 1. The versions of Firefox are all up to date. In this case, some computers will have images affecting each other, while others will not (computers with graphics cards of Intel HD Graphics 630 will display normally, while others will not). 2. On the computer where the page displays an error, on the same computer, we update the graphics card driver version of the device manager, and then refresh the page. The pages will no longer affect each other. But after closing all Firefox browsers and opening them again, the images interacted with each other again. </p><p>The first picture is our real usage scenario, and the second picture is the minimum reproduction example. </p><p>Does anyone know how to fix this issue? </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",948830492

I was prompted earlier today to update Windows 10 on my laptop, and now adding tags to Bookmarks isn't working correctly.  </p><p>If I try to add tags to a bookmark, normally - I start typing the tag and if I already have tags starting with those letters a list would usually show of my existing tags that start with those letters - and I can choose which tag I want to use. </p><p>Since the update, what I get is a list of what tags are already on the tag-line for my bookmark! This is terrible. </p><p>I have a huge library of Bookmarks - most of which are extremely well-tagged. </p><p>When I start typing a tag name, I need the interface to act like it did previously - and show me what tags I have that start with those same letters. </p><p>My Firefox browser is on auto-update so it's up-to-date. </p><p>I hope this gets fixed very shortly  because I really hate it! And I'm constantly adding new bookmarks and editing my old ones - so this is such an annoyance. </p><p>I hope my description is good enough because I can't get a screen-shot (as soon as I try to activate the screen-shot thing, clicking to do that makes my Edit Bookmark window disappear). </p><p>I do hope this gets sorted out soon!

The Windows file explorer save dialog would be an <em>acceptable</em> extra step, except that the location sometimes defaults to the last place you saved a PDF. So if you opened a new PDF in a new directory and want to save over the original, you have to navigate to the new PDF's directory from the last directory (which can be a hassle if the new directory is many folders deep). </p><p>So occasionally when I'm paying a hair less attention I save edits to a PDF in a random folder and my original PDF stays un-edited and I have to hunt down the edited PDF in said random folder and move it to its correct spot manually, which is annoying. </p><p>Solutions I'm looking for to smooth out the confusion: </p><p>A) Ctrl+S or whatever just overwrites the original file with no dialog. (and down the line, a save-as button mayhaps) </p><p>B) Always have the Windows file explorer save dialog open at the PDF's directory location. </p><p>The PDF editing is already fantastic, this would make it functionally perfect (for me)! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1280;,firefox,other,en-US,"",thelordofpie
