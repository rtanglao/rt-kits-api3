In this case, some computers will have images affecting each other, while others will not (computers with graphics cards of Intel HD Graphics 630 will display normally, while others will not). 2. On the computer where the page displays an error, on the same computer, we update the graphics card driver version of the device manager, and then refresh the page. The pages will no longer affect each other.

The Windows file explorer save dialog would be an <em>acceptable</em> extra step, except that the location sometimes defaults to the last place you saved a PDF. So if you opened a new PDF in a new directory and want to save over the original, you have to navigate to the new PDF's directory from the last directory (which can be a hassle if the new directory is many folders deep). </p><p>So occasionally when I'm paying a hair less attention I save edits to a PDF in a random folder and my original PDF stays un-edited and I have to hunt down the edited PDF in said random folder and move it to its correct spot manually, which is annoying. </p><p>Solutions I'm looking for to smooth out the confusion: </p><p>A) Ctrl+S or whatever just overwrites the original file with no dialog. (and down the line, a save-as button mayhaps) </p><p>B) Always have the Windows file explorer save dialog open at the PDF's directory location. </p><p>The PDF editing is already fantastic, this would make it functionally perfect (for me)! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1280;,firefox,other,en-US,"",thelordofpie
