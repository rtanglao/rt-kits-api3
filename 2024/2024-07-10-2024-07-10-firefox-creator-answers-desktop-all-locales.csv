I was prompted earlier today to update Windows 10 on my laptop, and now adding tags to Bookmarks isn't working correctly.  </p><p>If I try to add tags to a bookmark, normally - I start typing the tag and if I already have tags starting with those letters a list would usually show of my existing tags that start with those letters - and I can choose which tag I want to use. </p><p>Since the update, what I get is a list of what tags are already on the tag-line for my bookmark! This is terrible. </p><p>I have a huge library of Bookmarks - most of which are extremely well-tagged. </p><p>When I start typing a tag name, I need the interface to act like it did previously - and show me what tags I have that start with those same letters. </p><p>My Firefox browser is on auto-update so it's up-to-date. </p><p>I hope this gets fixed very shortly  because I really hate it! And I'm constantly adding new bookmarks and editing my old ones - so this is such an annoyance. </p><p>I hope my description is good enough because I can't get a screen-shot (as soon as I try to activate the screen-shot thing, clicking to do that makes my Edit Bookmark window disappear). </p><p>I do hope this gets sorted out soon! BTW, I'm usually very happy with the Bookmarks system&nbsp;:) ~Liz </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1280;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",ecowburn

The Windows file explorer save dialog would be an <em>acceptable</em> extra step, except that the location sometimes defaults to the last place you saved a PDF. So if you opened a new PDF in a new directory and want to save over the original, you have to navigate to the new PDF's directory from the last directory (which can be a hassle if the new directory is many folders deep). </p><p>So occasionally when I'm paying a hair less attention I save edits to a PDF in a random folder and my original PDF stays un-edited and I have to hunt down the edited PDF in said random folder and move it to its correct spot manually, which is annoying. </p><p>Solutions I'm looking for to smooth out the confusion: </p><p>A) Ctrl+S or whatever just overwrites the original file with no dialog. (and down the line, a save-as button mayhaps) </p><p>B) Always have the Windows file explorer save dialog open at the PDF's directory location. </p><p>The PDF editing is already fantastic, this would make it functionally perfect (for me)! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1280;,firefox,other,en-US,"",thelordofpie
