The Windows file explorer save dialog would be an <em>acceptable</em> extra step, except that the location sometimes defaults to the last place you saved a PDF. So if you opened a new PDF in a new directory and want to save over the original, you have to navigate to the new PDF's directory from the last directory (which can be a hassle if the new directory is many folders deep). </p><p>So occasionally when I'm paying a hair less attention I save edits to a PDF in a random folder and my original PDF stays un-edited and I have to hunt down the edited PDF in said random folder and move it to its correct spot manually, which is annoying. </p><p>Solutions I'm looking for to smooth out the confusion: </p><p>A) Ctrl+S or whatever just overwrites the original file with no dialog. (and down the line, a save-as button mayhaps) </p><p>B) Always have the Windows file explorer save dialog open at the PDF's directory location. </p><p>The PDF editing is already fantastic, this would make it functionally perfect (for me)! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1280;,firefox,other,en-US,"",thelordofpie
