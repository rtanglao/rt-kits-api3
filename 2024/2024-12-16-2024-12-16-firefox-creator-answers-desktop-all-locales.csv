This is very annoying. I tried Googling how to turn off tab visualization through the config, but it hasn't worked so far. </p><pre>   * <em>browser.ctrlTab.previews </em> </pre> <ul><li>     browser.tabs.closeWindowWithLastTab </li><li>     browser.tabs.animate </li><li>     toolkit.cosmeticAnimations.enabled<em> </em> </li></ul> <p>So now, the only option I see is to turn off Recent Tabs, but then the browser becomes unusable. I also tried the same on a new clean user profile and even on new Mozilla-based browsers, but still nothing. It would be ideal to make the cursor inactive while switching tabs, like it is in Arc Browser and probably many others. But I would be happy enough to just turn off tab switching visualization. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",kingcrimsonq
