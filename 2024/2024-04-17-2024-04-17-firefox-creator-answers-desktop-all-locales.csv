I opened Firefox and the home page was different and then noticed nothing was the same. I dl Firefox again, no help, same result. I do have my desktop synced to my iPad and laptop but I’m concerned they will import from the desktop and get wiped out. Is there a way to sync from the laptop to the desktop?    I am at a complete loss on how to fix this.  I do run a backup on this computer.  Would that help? Restore point?  </p><p>Many thanks, </p><p>Len </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,1647780;1647800;,b52srule
