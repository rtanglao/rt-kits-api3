Obviously you can click on the shield itself and see, but I'd much prefer to display the info live similar to how uBO, AdGuard, Ghostery, Privacy Badger, Disconnect, et al do it. </p><p>If that ability isn't available yet, is there an official method to put in a feature request?  I doubt I'd be the first one making the request, but perhaps I can add a vote for it to become a reality.  ETP has to be about 10 years old at this point, it's surprising that option wasn't added a long time ago. </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1310;firefox-13102;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",cmwmlw

For this reason, I am using the tree style vertical tabs, and when I search, I use the center search box instead of address bar search. </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",NOMOREUPSETTINGS
