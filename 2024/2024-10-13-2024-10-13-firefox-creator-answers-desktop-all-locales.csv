Usually when the process gets above 1gb I kill it, but I've watched it get over 7gb before. This is a terrible nuisance that other browsers handle with ease. Why does Firefox allow such selfishness through your browser? You have the ability to allow or disallow anything! Get on top of it! I say this because more than a decade ago you had the same problem on Windows as you now have on Linux!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! GET A FUCKEN BRAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!  STOP HIRING COMPLETE MORONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will soon be replacing and then banning Mozilla as an option on all Linux platforms and hopefully everyone else will ban you worthless retarded fucks too!!!!!!!!! </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1681258;,terencephillips

Obviously you can click on the shield itself and see, but I'd much prefer to display the info live similar to how uBO, AdGuard, Ghostery, Privacy Badger, Disconnect, et al do it. </p><p>If that ability isn't available yet, is there an official method to put in a feature request?  I doubt I'd be the first one making the request, but perhaps I can add a vote for it to become a reality.  ETP has to be about 10 years old at this point, it's surprising that option wasn't added a long time ago. </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1310;firefox-13102;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",cmwmlw
