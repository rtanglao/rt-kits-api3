Because I had a small problem yesterday I noticed there was a login name on my browser, which comes up automatically when I open Amazon. I have my normal login name using my email address, as well as my wife's email address for her login if she uses my machine. As well as those two there is also my old login with my previous email address and another which I do not recognize. I have tried clearing cache but that does not get rid of it. How do I remove the ones I do not want? I have another similar and related question. Whenever I fill out a form on the web, it automatically tries to enter the data for me. This used to be great and saved a lot of time and typing. However we mover from Florida to Illinois last year and Firefox is still loading my old Florida data. I then have to delete it and enter the current addresses etc. How do I get this brought up to date with my current address please? </p>",firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1681375;,frenchpl1
