So you go search up ""Bacefook"", and enter. - You use the Google search engine, as it does the job. However, you notice it has been taking a few seconds longer than anticipated. - Your internet times out and says it's having trouble connecting to the website. - You refresh, and suddenly the website perfectly loads. </p><p>Sometimes it even takes more than one refresh to get it to load normally! And this is not limited to the google search engine. It happens on all sorts of websites. There is no clear pattern to when a website actually loads or not. This problem is limited to my 2 WiFi routers, as other WiFi routers load all websites perfectly. </p><p>I decided to check the network tab in the inspect element for more information. I get ""NS_ERROR_UNKNOWN_HOST"" which is clearly false because the target website clearly exists. And the timings tab in the faulty request shows that every timing took 0 milliseconds to fulfill, so it may be the case that no data has been sent. (Seen in image below) </p><p>Chrome doesn't really have an issue with this. YouTube may have taken a long time to load in a test experiment though but it loaded successfully all along. </p><p>This also seems to be appearing elsewhere for a lot of internet request my computer makes, so it may be an internet setting that exists from one application from another. But it's been bugging me a lot with Firefox specifically. </p><p>This problem started happening about 1-2 months ago, and I use Firefox 131.0.3, the latest version of Firefox. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",uniquelolowo

As of version 133, this has been made a lot more difficult, unless I'm missing an option somewhere. - In Settings, there's only the ""all or nothing"" approach for browser history, no way to be selective. (You can be selective when deleting cookies, but not history.) - In the History sidebar, where I used to do this, you can group by date or site. I used both: Group by site to avoid deleting the recent stuff I want to keep, and group by date to delete old things I no longer need (anything over a week old). It's no longer possible to delete e.g. everything from the gmail domain, or everything from October. I have to delete each. and. every. site. individually. For Gmail, for example, this means roughly a gajillion lines per visit. - In the sidebar, the keyboard Delete button no longer works either.
