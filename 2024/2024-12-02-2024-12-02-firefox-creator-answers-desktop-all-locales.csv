The text is also tiny in the search bar and book marks in firefox as well. I have restarted my computer several times, and the issue with desktop apps seems to have fixed itself. The firefox issue has not. </p><p>The text in the tab, the search bar, and the bookmark name is all tiny and I can barely read it. Everything else is normal and this is not a problem with other browsers. I have tried switching the text size in firefox settings, I have changed the text size in windows display settings, and I have even tried changing the overall size of the browser through ""about:config"" and changing the ""layout.css.devPixelsPerPx"" to a higher number, but nothing works.  </p><p>I can use the app just fine, but I cannot read the text in the tab, search bar, or bookmark. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",franklinbrezee13

I have followed all methods I found on web &amp; in Mozilla support without success., except I don't want to stop or delete ALL autofills.  Firefox doesn't show this password as saved (even when I search for it by URL), and the ""Saved Logins"" section of ""passwords &amp; security"" [in settings] NO longer exists.  I do NOT want to delete all autofills. I also checked my settings for this website, and it is NOT causing the autofill. Please: How do I stop Firefox from autofilling of a password for a SINGLE website?  Thank you! </p>",firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1691392;,doctorgail
