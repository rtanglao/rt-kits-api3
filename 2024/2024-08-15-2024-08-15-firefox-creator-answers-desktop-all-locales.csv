I have to copy over an old backup that I luckily had in the Firefox files thanks to Firefox itself creating a backup. Still every single time I close this god forsaken browser I get logged out of every single thing. What am I supposed to do leave my PC running 24/7 without ever closing a browser? Every other basic solution that you can instantly find upon googling something similar to the topic title I already tried so don't bother writing it here, such as ""uncheck the delete cookies box"" well that doesn't do anything when its unchecked but still deletes everything does it.
