Despite that, my browser is being controlled by an organization and I cannot control how my browser operates. I have uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox several times to try to eliminate this issue and it keeps returning. There seems to be a certificate associated with this problem.

My bookmarks and my passwords just vanished. I've used the same browser for years and have never had an issue until now. It's sucks cause there is years worth of information gone. I tried to load my information form an ""Old Firefox data"" folder but it has been no luck so far. I am desperately trying to get my information back to the way it was. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1290;firefox-12901;,firefox,other,en-US,"",redpenny47

I have to copy over an old backup that I luckily had in the Firefox files thanks to Firefox itself creating a backup. Still every single time I close this god forsaken browser I get logged out of every single thing. What am I supposed to do leave my PC running 24/7 without ever closing a browser? Every other basic solution that you can instantly find upon googling something similar to the topic title I already tried so don't bother writing it here, such as ""uncheck the delete cookies box"" well that doesn't do anything when its unchecked but still deletes everything does it.
