How can I see it's progress?,"<p>Every few days I get a dialog box that says an update is available, I can either dismiss or download. There isn't any discernible difference in what happens when I click either button. Dismissing it doesn't matter, Firefox will always auto-update when it feels like it. Clicking the download button doesn't appear to do anything either... until the next day (or days later) when it tells me it needs to restart to complete the update. </p><p>Did it really take 24 hours to download the update? Or did the ""download"" button do nothing and it was actually the auto-update happening the next day? </p><p>I'm so so so so so so tired of my browsing session getting knee-capped and losing data. Is there any way for me to tell Firefox ""yes, download and install the update, and do it <em>right now</em>"" so I can be ready for it? Is there any way to see a progress bar somewhere so I can watch it happen and be ready for the restart? </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;install-and-update;firefox-1290;,firefox,install-and-update,en-US,"",kelly.knowles

I have to copy over an old backup that I luckily had in the Firefox files thanks to Firefox itself creating a backup. Still every single time I close this god forsaken browser I get logged out of every single thing. What am I supposed to do leave my PC running 24/7 without ever closing a browser? Every other basic solution that you can instantly find upon googling something similar to the topic title I already tried so don't bother writing it here, such as ""uncheck the delete cookies box"" well that doesn't do anything when its unchecked but still deletes everything does it. Bug fix? </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-10;firefox-1290;,firefox,cookies,en-US,"",FireForgetFox
