I had tried to run Firefox in my real machine (Linux 6.1.0-17-amd64 Debian 12) and it worked well. I just copy the file ""<a href=""http://libflashplayer.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libflashplayer.so</a>"" to the path ""~/.mozilla/plugins"". But when Firefox is running in a container, I do the same but it can't found Flash player plugin. No matter where I place the <a href=""http://libflashplayer.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libflashplayer.so</a>, like ""~/.mozilla/plugins"" or ""/usr/lib/firefox/firefox"", it don't work, I can't find Flash player in ""about:plugins"" or ""about:addons"". I start Firefox from a terminal and there is no error log. I have no idea why it can detect flash player plugin while running in a real system but don't work when running in a container. Thanks. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-840;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",GoodNameNamedByDog

On multiple laptops and desktops after last Windows 11 update and then an immediate Firefox update, the software protection service of Windows 11 goes into high cpu mode consuming 40-50% of cpu when Firefox is opened. Running Firefox version 122.0 (64-bit) version. Tried in safe mode and still having issue. Just an FYI for developers to look into for next Firefox update. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1220;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",alp35035
