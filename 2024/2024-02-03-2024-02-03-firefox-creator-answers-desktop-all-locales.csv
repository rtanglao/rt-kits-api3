The link looks like this: openwith://C:/path/to/file, but after update to the latest Firefox version (v122.0) the second colon from the link is for some reason removed, resulting in a path like this: openwith://C/path/to/file. This is a problem because the path it now tries to open doesn't exist. Is this a deliberate feature in the new Firefox version or is it a bug? If it is a bug will it be fixed?
