On multiple laptops and desktops after last Windows 11 update and then an immediate Firefox update, the software protection service of Windows 11 goes into high cpu mode consuming 40-50% of cpu when Firefox is opened. Running Firefox version 122.0 (64-bit) version. Tried in safe mode and still having issue. Just an FYI for developers to look into for next Firefox update. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1220;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",alp35035
