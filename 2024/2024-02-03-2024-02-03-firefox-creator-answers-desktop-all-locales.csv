On this second machine, I recently installed the Beta channel, 64bit, without Admin rights, and I can now launch either version, but they both seem to share the same profile (and even launching one version, then the other, simply opens a new window in the one that was launched first). </p><p>My question is, on my first machine, where Release channel 32bit was installed with Admin rights, if I were to try to install a new version of a different channel (e.g. Beta or Nightly) without Admin rights, what should I expect? I certainly don't want to screw up my profile (since I have a shit-ton of open tabs in my session). </p><p>Also, is there any way to tell whether Firefox (or any program) was installed with or without Admin rights (in the case of my 2nd machine), other than to try to update with my regular user account and see if it asks for Admin rights (via the UAC window)? My understanding is that some programs, like Chrome and Evernote, can install without Admin rights, and the program files are stored in the C:\Users\username\Appdata folder, but Firefox seems to have data stored there regardless. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",yaktiswan02

I had tried to run Firefox in my real machine (Linux 6.1.0-17-amd64 Debian 12) and it worked well. I just copy the file ""<a href=""http://libflashplayer.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libflashplayer.so</a>"" to the path ""~/.mozilla/plugins"". But when Firefox is running in a container, I do the same but it can't found Flash player plugin. No matter where I place the <a href=""http://libflashplayer.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libflashplayer.so</a>, like ""~/.mozilla/plugins"" or ""/usr/lib/firefox/firefox"", it don't work, I can't find Flash player in ""about:plugins"" or ""about:addons"". I start Firefox from a terminal and there is no error log. I have no idea why it can detect flash player plugin while running in a real system but don't work when running in a container.
