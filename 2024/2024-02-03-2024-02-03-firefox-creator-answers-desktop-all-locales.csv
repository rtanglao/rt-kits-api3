None of these websites were using the Cashflows payment service to process payments at that time. However, since then, I have noticed that any time a website switches to using this service, I am unable to complete payment processes from that point onwards. Sometimes, this results in my cards being blocked, however 99% of the time, I don't even get as far as entering my card information before the system fails. Failure most commonly occurs at the junction between the retailer and Cashflows on transferring from retailer's order checkout page to Cashflows' card data entry page. </p><p>Like I said, I can make payments without issue on any other website. It is just Cashflows I have problems with here in the UK on any website that has installed this system. </p><p>Cashflows says it's nothing to do with them, and blames my setup with Firefox. And the retailers concerned take Cashflows' position on this, leaving me feeling like a ping-pong ball because after all, I am able to make purchases just as normal anywhere else and I hadn't made any changes to my system/Firefox setup in any way. The only change was when Cashflows suddenly became the payment merchant.  </p><p>I also find this quite concerning, as Cashflows appears to be gaining wider market ground with smaller businesses, its target market currently. I rely on the Internet for all my essential purchases due to disability, hence being able to access payment services is absolutely vital as part of that. I have always preferred to use Firefox for privacy and data security reasons, and because I find it more accessible than most other browsers (although blocking the Dragon extension has really impacted my use of the browser since, and is not at all helpful. It is far from 100% voice accessible in its current state). I do not wish to be forced to use privacy-invasive browsers such as Chrome and Edge. </p><p>I have tried all the usual, including deleting cookies, removing all the extensions, clearing out the cache, setting up a brand-new clean profile with no settings changed or extensions added, etc. None of these change the outcome. Either way I am unable to process any payment with Cashflows using Firefox.  </p><p>I'd like to know if there is an explicit block on Cashflows due to any security issues that Firefox may have identified. Is there a way to find this out please? Or, is there another reason that is already known about? It's really frustrating that I can't get the retailers to take this issue seriously, nor Cashflows itself. </p><p>Above all, what is Firefox doing about these growing issues? </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1220;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1634801;,infinityweb
