However the moment I click on a video the tab will crash. I check if this was the case for other video streaming sites. HBO Max has the same issue while Amazon prime doesn't crash however has a message saying there is a problem with the video player. Now I checked if videos can work on another browser (Microsoft Edge), and there are no issues. I have cleared the cache, disabled extensions, checked for updates [update to date: 132.0.1 (64-bit)], restarted Firefox from troubleshooting mode, enabled autoplay, checked if videos work in private mode, updated my graphics card driver, and even checked if Firefox's volume is muted (its not). </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;firefox-1320;firefox-13201;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",thekim0517

Today I opened it and it wanted me to make it my default browser, which it already was, but I did it anyway. Now when I click a link in an email in Thunderbird, Firefox loads but all my passwords and user names are gone. If I close and reload Firefox and cut and paste the link, I have my passwords and user names back and everything is normal. Windows 10 shows only one version of Firefox installed, but for awhile settings/default apps listed 2 versions (now it only shows one).

It's only affecting Twitch because I can load YouTube and other streaming sites fine, and it's only on Firefox because it works fine on Chrome. I tried clearing my cache and cookies, disabling all add-ons and extensions, and restarting my device. Nothing works. The only indication that I have of what the issue might be is a message in the browser console that says this: </p><p>NetworkError: A network error occurred. addcf53b-cec4-4980-829e-de0aca27def2:1 </p><pre>   &lt;anonymous&gt; blob:<a href=""https://www.twitch.tv/addcf53b-cec4-4980-829e-de0aca27def2:1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.twitch.tv/addcf53b-cec4-4980-829e-de0aca27def2:1</a> </pre> <p>From what I can tell, the blob is where the browser loads the stream itself.
