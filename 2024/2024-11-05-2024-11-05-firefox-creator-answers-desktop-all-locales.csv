And when I would type a reply or comment it was easily 1 - 2 words behind.  No similar behavior on other sites - works as it should. Only on FB.  </p><p>Cleared cache/history, quit and reloaded, no change.  </p><p>Disabled extensions ( I run two: Ad Blocker Plus and Container), and restarted. Worked great in FB.

Be the first!"".   It happens an awful lot and it's infuriating, but DeviantArt use this technique all throughout their site tracking your pointer to pop up annoying hints and suggestions as you navigate the site. </p><p>Now I don't see why sites should feel entitled to know where my mouse pointer is as I move it about a page.   </p><p>The only time my pointer location matters as far as I am concerned is when I choose to either left or right click on something.   Even then, it is what I have left/right clicked on, not it's location on the page, which matters.   </p><p>I don't wish for the pointer location to be continuously relayed to the website. </p><p>Clearly it is a functionality which is built into both the site and the browser that it tracks your pointer, sending a steady stream of position data to the host site. </p><p>I wish to be able to prevent that. </p><p>If I were using a touchscreen device there would be no mouse pointer they could spy on yet the sites which abuse this functionality cope just fine with that when I view them on my handheld touchscreen devices.   </p><p>I wish for Firefox to have the functionality to stop this steady stream of mouse pointer coordinates being given to the host site. </p><p>How is it possible to do this please&nbsp;? </p><p>Many thanks! </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",Highland_Itinerant

It's only affecting Twitch because I can load YouTube and other streaming sites fine, and it's only on Firefox because it works fine on Chrome. I tried clearing my cache and cookies, disabling all add-ons and extensions, and restarting my device. Nothing works. The only indication that I have of what the issue might be is a message in the browser console that says this: </p><p>NetworkError: A network error occurred. addcf53b-cec4-4980-829e-de0aca27def2:1 </p><pre>   &lt;anonymous&gt; blob:<a href=""https://www.twitch.tv/addcf53b-cec4-4980-829e-de0aca27def2:1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.twitch.tv/addcf53b-cec4-4980-829e-de0aca27def2:1</a> </pre> <p>From what I can tell, the blob is where the browser loads the stream itself. Every stream I've tried to load gives me this error. </p><p>UPDATE: I was able to fix it by clearing the cache. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;firefox-1320;firefox-13201;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",appledoze
