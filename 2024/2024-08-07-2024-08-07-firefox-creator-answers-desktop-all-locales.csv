I have disabled popup blocking and all installed extensions that have the ability to block popups while trying to print coupons from Qples (I'm trying to print a coupon for Angel Soft toilet paper). I have deliberately placed their domain <a href=""https://offer.qpleshq.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://offer.qpleshq.com</a> in the ALLOW list for popups. I have changed every setting I can see to ALLOW that domain access to just about everything. But I can't make popups work. I haven't had any luck in Edge either (and Edge uses Chrome as a framework so anything that doesn't work in Edge is unlikely to work in Chrome). I even did the ctrl-I trick and ALLOWed every setting it showed for that page specifically. I cleared its cache/cookies from the ctrl-I menu and reloaded. Every single time I reload the page, it gives me the option to print (which I want to be able to do) or ""save"" (which just means emailing you a link to the same print page). If I tell it to print, I get an overlay that reminds me to disable my popup blockers (at which point I internally scream ""but I have disabled every d*mn popup blocker I can find"". Is there some hidden/secret setting I'm missing here? I don't know where else to look, and I would think enabling wanted popups would be a possibility in an up-to-date browser (version 129.0, literally updated minutes ago).

When I close the sidebar and open it again, the page gets reloaded. This makes using messengers etc. in sidebar much less comfortable. I noticed, however, that bookmarks and history, when opened in sidebar, remember the state the were in when last closed. Is there some simple way to make pages remember their state as well or it can only be done by changing the addons' or the browser's code? </p>",desktop;windows-11;firefox-1280;customize-settings-and-preferences;firefox-12803;,firefox,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",alkir-2

Firefox showed that the update was completed and restarted itself.  Nvidia downloaded a driver update &amp; attempted to install it but failed.  The error msg indicated that another app update was in progress, prevented it from installing, and to try later.  Based on what I saw on Task Manager, Firefox locked up the windows installer module and had 100% disk usage.  PC then crashed and looped several times trying to auto-repair itself.  Had to do a hard power down, a safe boot, and the restore PC and Windows 10 to last good version.
