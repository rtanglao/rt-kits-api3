Notifications work correctly when delivered, but after a few days, clicking on the notification does not work properly – it doesn’t open a new window or close the notifications center. I have confirmed this behavior on two different websites. </p><p>Additionally, the same websites and notifications work correctly in Chrome, regardless of the time of delivery. </p><p>Is this expected behavior, or could it be a bug in the service worker code or the browser itself? How can I investigate and resolve this issue? </p><p>Thank you for your help! </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1230;firefox-12301;,firefox,other,en-US,"",kczctr4wy9
