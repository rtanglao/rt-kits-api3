All Windows dialogs look normal and Chrome and Edge look fine.  Only Firefox seems to have the problem.  I am using the latest version of Firefox as far as I am aware (auto-update is turned on).  The OS is Windows 11. The external monitor is set to 2560x1440 resolution and fonts are scaled to 125%.  I'm not sure what other settings are important.  I don't see setting in Firefox that seems likely to help. </p>,desktop;troubleshooting;windows-11;firefox-1280;firefox-12803;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",me-ffs_01

When I close the sidebar and open it again, the page gets reloaded. This makes using messengers etc. in sidebar much less comfortable. I noticed, however, that bookmarks and history, when opened in sidebar, remember the state the were in when last closed. Is there some simple way to make pages remember their state as well or it can only be done by changing the addons' or the browser's code? </p>",desktop;windows-11;firefox-1280;customize-settings-and-preferences;firefox-12803;,firefox,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",alkir-2

Firefox showed that the update was completed and restarted itself.  Nvidia downloaded a driver update &amp; attempted to install it but failed.  The error msg indicated that another app update was in progress, prevented it from installing, and to try later.  Based on what I saw on Task Manager, Firefox locked up the windows installer module and had 100% disk usage.  PC then crashed and looped several times trying to auto-repair itself.  Had to do a hard power down, a safe boot, and the restore PC and Windows 10 to last good version. Will not do any Firefox updates until this problem is resolved. </p>",desktop;windows-10;firefox-1280;install-and-update;,firefox,install-and-update,en-US,"",vj000000
