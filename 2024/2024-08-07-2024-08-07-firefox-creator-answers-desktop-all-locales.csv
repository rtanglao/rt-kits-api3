Firefox showed that the update was completed and restarted itself.  Nvidia downloaded a driver update &amp; attempted to install it but failed.  The error msg indicated that another app update was in progress, prevented it from installing, and to try later.  Based on what I saw on Task Manager, Firefox locked up the windows installer module and had 100% disk usage.  PC then crashed and looped several times trying to auto-repair itself.  Had to do a hard power down, a safe boot, and the restore PC and Windows 10 to last good version. Will not do any Firefox updates until this problem is resolved. </p>",desktop;windows-10;firefox-1280;install-and-update;,firefox,install-and-update,en-US,"",vj000000
