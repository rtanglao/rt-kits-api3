Then I saw that Firefox were offering a 2 month overlap solution, whereby I could download an Firefox ESR extension which I have since done, which seems to be working, albeit I have now found that it seems Microsoft (I hate those people)  have interfered in that I can no longer format any Word documents as I have previously been able to do, when writing to clients using my business profile Matrix letterhead etc, moreover I also have a Skype phone (which is fully credited) yet now when I try to call someone on Skype, whilst I can hear them, they cannot hear me? So I am now wondering, whether your ESR temporary solution doesn't interface with those Microsoft products? I have tried speaking with Microsoft, but honestly it is like talking to a brick wall, as all they are interested in is forcing people like me to pay U.S.D $65 to speak with some Tech head who invariably doesn't know the answer anyway! I would very much appreciate your advise? </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1013;troubleshooting;firefox-11513;firefox-115130;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",letchk1pk
