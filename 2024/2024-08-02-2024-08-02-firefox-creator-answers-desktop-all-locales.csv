Nos últimos dias tem ocorrido um problema extremamente frustrante para o qual não encontrei solução prática. Toda vez que reinicio meu sistema, ao abrir o navegador Firefox ele se recusa a carregar qualquer site enquanto minhas extensões estiverem ativadas. O navegador abre, como de costume, com uma aba nova, e ao lado <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/pt-BR/privacy/"" rel=""nofollow"">esta página</a>, que fica carregando pra sempre. Qualquer outra página que eu tente abrir também fica carregando pra sempre.  A única coisa que aparece no console do navegador é: </p><p><em>Content-Security-Policy: As configurações da página bloquearam a execução de um manipulador de eventos (script-src-attr) porque viola a seguinte diretiva: “script-src resource: chrome:” Source: function() {     [native code] }'</em> </p><p>Já tentei desativar extensão por extensão, mas o navegador só volta a funcionar quando eu desativo <strong>todas</strong> ao mesmo tempo ou o reinicio em modo de segurança. Em seguida, reinicio em modo normal e tudo volta a funcionar ""normalmente"", porém com o agravante de que preciso sempre relogar em minha extensão do BitWarden e outras. </p><p>Gostaria de encontrar a solução, pois não queria ser obrigado a voltar a utilizar outro navegador no meu dia-a-dia. Obrigado! </p>",desktop;troubleshooting;windows-11;firefox-1280;firefox-12803;,firefox,troubleshooting,pt-BR,"",alestori7

Then I saw that Firefox were offering a 2 month overlap solution, whereby I could download an Firefox ESR extension which I have since done, which seems to be working, albeit I have now found that it seems Microsoft (I hate those people)  have interfered in that I can no longer format any Word documents as I have previously been able to do, when writing to clients using my business profile Matrix letterhead etc, moreover I also have a Skype phone (which is fully credited) yet now when I try to call someone on Skype, whilst I can hear them, they cannot hear me? So I am now wondering, whether your ESR temporary solution doesn't interface with those Microsoft products? I have tried speaking with Microsoft, but honestly it is like talking to a brick wall, as all they are interested in is forcing people like me to pay U.S.D $65 to speak with some Tech head who invariably doesn't know the answer anyway!
