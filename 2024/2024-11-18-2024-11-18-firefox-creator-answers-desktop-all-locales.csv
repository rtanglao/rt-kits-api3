(in other browsers everything works fine) When I open tabs with goods on aliexpress. and start switching between them, then at the moment of switching to another tab, my previous tab itself is updated and opens the main page. And there is no way to even press the “Back” button. The browser seems to reload the page completely. The chatgpt was unable to find a solution. All hope is on you. There are no errors. It's just that the aliexpress page reloads by itself when I switch to any other tab. </p>",firefox;needsinfo;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1688548;,bolsosh

For example, if I would like to set <a href=""http://wikipedia.org"" rel=""nofollow"">wikipedia.org</a> to only ""@wi"", it will automatically be set to ""@wi, @wikipedia"". I can remove wikipedia as a search engine, but then I'm not able to set my own keyword. Is there a way to do this?

I went through the trouble twice now in setting up Firefox the way I want to work and for it to open certain bookmarks every time I open it. But 2 times now I have closed Firefox and reopened it and each time it not only fails to open the bookmarks I have setup, it also loses the other settings I setup and acts like I am setting it up for the first time. If I can't get this problem fixed I guess I will start looking at other browsers. </p><p>Thanks, Mark </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",mawaw
