And then a row of windows opened from each one of the extensions that have been deleted saying things like ""we're sorry to see you go"" ""we hope you come back"" and so on. On double checking were extensions like eosia, momentum, mendeley, notion, freedom etc. all gone, and not for my choice. I disconnected my account, checked my laptop but before i could block sync, all extensions started deleting themselves there as well... according to AVG premium, no malware or virus was detected... </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,it,"",andrea.aquino90

As I remember, I never before do anything with passwords and bookmarks. Maybe I am wrong, but I was think about to this is all on my Mozilla Account. Now when I look, its probably not. So for my ""luck"" I have all passwords and bookmarks and history on my smartphone but I have one crazy problem.  When I try to login on my mozilla account none of passwords I know doesn't work, so I change password and now when I log in my account with new password doesn't sync anything from my smartphone, but my smartphone also won't sync anything because of changed password. If I log out from my smartphone and log in again with new password, do I lost all settings, passwords, bookmarks and other stuff? </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",ssaajjkkoo

After upgrading to Firefox 89, I used a white full screen to pinpoint significant issues during scrolling on my MacBook Pro (2022 - macOS 13 Ventura) with an external LG screen over USB-C. This method made the inconsistencies highly visible. </p><p>When I reverted to Firefox 88, the issue disappeared, but it returned with 89, even after trying a new profile. </p><p>Additionally, I noticed that scrolling via the Mac trackpad starts laggy and only speeds up after the first scroll. </p><p>For now, I have reverted to Firefox 88, but I'm wondering if anyone else has faced these problems or found a fix? </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1688580;,evelynfreya11

I recently changed to Firefox to escape forced ads on chrome and the lost support for the Ublock origin. But I am having difficulty performing tasks and pages That I used to be able to do on Chrome with no difficulty.  </p><p>When I open multiple tabs at once the tabs freeze up when trying to load and already opened tabs freeze and anything streaming also freeze. It takes tons of time to load multiple tabs and even sometimes single tabs depending on the website. This never happened with Chrome and I understand Firefox is not as refined as Chrome and is far younger than Chrome is but I feel like it shouldn't be this bad. Is there any settings maybe or maybe settings/preferences in the config area area that might help with faster performance and increased multitasking ability in the Firefox browser?  </p><p>I have tried  </p><p>1. Updating Firefox - I am running the most up to date version 2. Updating Graphics Drivers- I am running the most up to date drivers(Updated yesterday 11/17/2024 3. Deleting Cache/History/Logs 4. removed or disables unneeded extensions that I don't use every day and only activate when I need them.  </p><p>None of this has worked to increase performance. </p><p>P.S. I would also like to fix the problem where firefox is using too much RAM if possible. </p>,firefox;performance-and-connectivity;firefox-1320;firefox-13202;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",Wolfe_Andedare
