I am looking for a way to prevent the width of tabs from resizing when either adding or subtracting tabs from the tab bar. The only reference I can find to this issue is a 2014 post found here: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/989387"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/989387</a>. The suggestions therein do not apply to the current FF version. Among other things, the suggestion to go to the setting ""browser.tabs.animate"" does not seem to apply to the current FF version since I can not find such a setting. Like the OP in the 2014 post, the auto tab resizing drives me nuts! (Maybe he/she and I are the only people in the whole FF world community who are bothered by this?!) I would much prefer the tab width to stay the same and use the arrows on each side of the tab bar to access tabs that do not fit across the screen when many tabs are open. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. I am using FF 128.0 with Win 10 22H2 build 19045.4651. Thanks for any suggestions.

If I remember right, <em>these two click actions</em> wouldn't influence the webpage itself at all <strong>in older versions</strong> of Firefox, because in the screenshot mode the interaction between webpage and mouse clicks was ""blocked"". However, this is not the case anymore. That means, <strong>the webpage could no more look like how it looked like at the moment I wanted to take the screenshot</strong>, due to the unblocked mouse click.
