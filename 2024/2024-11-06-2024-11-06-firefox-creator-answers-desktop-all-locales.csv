I ordered from a different bank card and they still say they can't process my coat. I have been trying to order this coat for a week and I have given all my info to them buy they want me to send a copy of my bank statement and the last four numbers of my card. I'm not sure how to do that but I took pictures but I don't know where they went. I don't know if Amazon received them or not. ALL I WANT IS TO BUY A COAT.  I don't know what else to do. Can you tell me if Amazon received them? Please help! This is a birthday present from my 94 year old mom. If they can't take my word that I am Constance Holland the one who ordered the coat there's nothing more I can do but buy one from another store. Please let me know what's going on.

Firefox essentially stops responding randomly. When it happens, I can usually still scroll through the page, but I'm unable to click on any links on it. Other things like hovering over things that might change color also stops working. When it happens, it happens to all tabs that are open. It usually eventually comes back on it's own after a couple minutes. The weird thing is as soon as I load any other external application, even something as simple as Settings or Preview, Firefox will immediately spring back to life. Only a couple common addons (Ublock Origin) but it happens even with all add-ons disabled. It's sporadic, sometimes I can go all day without it happening, other times it happens every few minutes. </p><p>It's persisted through 3 different OS upgrades and countless Firefox versions. I've tried everything I can find about troubleshooting Firefox on mac and nothing works. It's not a resource thing as it happens with only Gmail open sometimes and Firefox being the only thing running. I'm at a loss and looking for anything that might help. I've never seen this issue on other Macs I've used Firefox with. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;firefox-1320;firefox-13201;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",bhilimon

Also the recovery-mechanisms I found in the documentation database don't work. </p><p>Anyway, I wouldn't want to recover my sessions, I'd rather like Firefox not to behave that way. It is possible to enhance Firefox in such a way that it does NOT forget its sessions if the user closes a private window after the main non-private one has already been closed? </p><p>Thanks in advance, Dennis </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",herakles1
