Whenever I am viewing a dark image, e.g. a relatively dark photo in a newspaper article, this darkens the entire page, including the menu/bar area. This happens as the dark image is scrolled to become visible. Normal bright views are restored once the dark image is out of view. And similarly my youtube music page, which has a black background, is horribly black now. I a musing windows11. Thanks. </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",istvan821

Instead it deleted all my phone's firefox bookmarks when it synced with my computer (ugh!) </p><p>Is there a way to recover my bookmarks from my phone's firefox or they are all lost?

If there's someone talking it's out of sync. Choppy video. I tried emptying the cache but nothing changed. I've started using Edge Browser, which I never used before, and it can play these videos fine. I regret having to switch to it because Firefox was so customized for me. Is there a solution for this?
