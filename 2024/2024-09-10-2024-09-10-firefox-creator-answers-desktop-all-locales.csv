I noticed that Firefox stopped working with my Webcam some time ago and I can't seem to figure out why. </p><p>My webcam works fine on Chrome and using the camera app on my desktop. I hooked the webcam up to my Macbook and was able to connect to it just fine, even using Firefox. </p><p>I tested my webcam using this website: <a href=""https://webcamtests.com/check"" rel=""nofollow"">https://webcamtests.com/check</a> When I go there I get this error message: ""Could not find a web camera, however there are other media devices (like speakers or microphones). Most likely, this means that your webcam is not working properly or your browser cannot access it."" </p><p>When I try to have it forcibly start the camera it gives me this error message: ""NotFoundError: The object can not be found here.; DOMException"". </p><p>I tried clearing the cache, running Firefox in safe mode, clearing all privacy and security settings, and reinstalling Firefox but none of it help, I also tried clearing the cache and got the same result. </p><p>Windows security settings show Firefox last accessed my webcam on 2021-11-08 and there are no access requests from Firefox since then. </p><p>Any idea of whats going on or what troubleshooting I can do from here? </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1300;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1673658;,andrew.e.phillips
