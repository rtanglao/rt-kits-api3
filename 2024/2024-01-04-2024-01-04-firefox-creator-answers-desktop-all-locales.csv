I have searched everywhere and can't find a solution. Searching shows that this has been happening repeatedly for years with people having to go as far as adding code to configure it. It has never happened to me until the change appeared randomly today.  Am I missing something, or has the option completely (and pointlessly) disappeared? Please point me in the right direction to restore the position of the address bar. Thanks. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-11;firefox-1210;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",jmynwa

I used to use Firefox on desktop, on an iPad, and on an android, with no issues accessing my passwords. Recently I replaced my android phone with an iPhone, and after signing onto Firefox sync on said iPhone, the list of my passwords was accessible on the iPhone, but when i used it for auto-fill, it would only load the username, but not the password. This caused no issue with Firefox sync on desktop or iPad however, so I just let it be. However, after 3 months of no issue, when I open both my iPad and desktop today, all my old passwords are gone, and replaced with the few passwords I directly saved with Firefox on my iPhone.  </p><p>i have tried restoring my old Firefox profile using backup software to access older files, but I am unable to regain my passwords this way. I have tried using profile data from several date ranges and that has not helped either. The issue seems to lie with Firefox sync with iOS, but I am at an absolute loss on how to resolve this, so any help at all would be much appreciated. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1210;bug1872730;,firefox,sync,en-US,1628177;1628180;1628182;,garcia.cesar.111
