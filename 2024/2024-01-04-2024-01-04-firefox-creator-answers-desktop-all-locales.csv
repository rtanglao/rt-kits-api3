I used to use Firefox on desktop, on an iPad, and on an android, with no issues accessing my passwords. Recently I replaced my android phone with an iPhone, and after signing onto Firefox sync on said iPhone, the list of my passwords was accessible on the iPhone, but when i used it for auto-fill, it would only load the username, but not the password. This caused no issue with Firefox sync on desktop or iPad however, so I just let it be. However, after 3 months of no issue, when I open both my iPad and desktop today, all my old passwords are gone, and replaced with the few passwords I directly saved with Firefox on my iPhone.  </p><p>i have tried restoring my old Firefox profile using backup software to access older files, but I am unable to regain my passwords this way. I have tried using profile data from several date ranges and that has not helped either. The issue seems to lie with Firefox sync with iOS, but I am at an absolute loss on how to resolve this, so any help at all would be much appreciated. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1210;bug1872730;,firefox,sync,en-US,1628177;1628180;1628182;,garcia.cesar.111
