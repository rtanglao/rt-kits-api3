I need to sign in to Firefox on another pc, but I can't remember my password. Not sure why as I'm fairly sure I know what it is and I only signed in on my phone 2 months ago. Although maybe that was a qr code? </p><p>First question: the 'password' field in the account manager is 18 asterisks long, does that mean my password is actually 18 characters? Or is this just a generic mask? I have seen it work both ways. A clue to the length might jog my memory. </p><p>Second question: assuming it's gone for good I can of course reset it. What's the least damaging way to do this? I can think of backing up my bookmarks and then reuploading them, anything else? Will the reset lose all my passwords for other sites such as forums, is there a way to keep these? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1220;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",jackelliott

That only seemed to work if I had one window open, but I usually have a half dozen or more open with anywhere from a few tabs to well over 100 tabs in a window. The most reliable way I found to have those all reopen was to restart my computer. Firefox would be closed, but next time I opened it all the windows and tabs were there again. I needed to close Firefox a few minutes ago and didn't want to save all the other programs I was in the middle of, so (I <em>thought</em> I had done this before) I right-clicked the Firefox icon on the Taskbar and told it to close all windows. When I opened Firefox the next time it only opened one window (unfortunately the least important one), and only had two other windows in the History | Recently Closed Windows (also not very important windows).  Are there any backup or other files where I could get back the other windows I had open? Unfortunately if I have a tab open for a month, for example, it is not saved in today's tabs, and it's not feasible to scroll back through thousands of listings in the history trying to figure out which tabs I had open. Thank you for any assistance! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,other,en-US,"",goanddo
