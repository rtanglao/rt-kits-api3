If I disable ublock origin then enable again Firefox works but I get all the ADS. What I have to do is: Close firefox and restart Firefox but then I get this message ""Firefox is already running, but is not responding. The old Firefox process must be closed to open a new window."" Sometimes I have to restart Firefox as many as 10 times before Firefox works. I got to the point where I stop after the second try and just switch to Brave browser. </p><p>Before: Firefox use 99%.

That only seemed to work if I had one window open, but I usually have a half dozen or more open with anywhere from a few tabs to well over 100 tabs in a window. The most reliable way I found to have those all reopen was to restart my computer. Firefox would be closed, but next time I opened it all the windows and tabs were there again. I needed to close Firefox a few minutes ago and didn't want to save all the other programs I was in the middle of, so (I <em>thought</em> I had done this before) I right-clicked the Firefox icon on the Taskbar and told it to close all windows. When I opened Firefox the next time it only opened one window (unfortunately the least important one), and only had two other windows in the History | Recently Closed Windows (also not very important windows).  Are there any backup or other files where I could get back the other windows I had open? Unfortunately if I have a tab open for a month, for example, it is not saved in today's tabs, and it's not feasible to scroll back through thousands of listings in the history trying to figure out which tabs I had open. Thank you for any assistance! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,other,en-US,"",goanddo
