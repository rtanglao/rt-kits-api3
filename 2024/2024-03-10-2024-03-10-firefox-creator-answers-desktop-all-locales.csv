In principle this looks like a useful feature (or it would if the scroll wheel worked in that mode, which it doesn't). But at the same time, the context menu opens when the right button is released. So we trigger two features at once, making both less useful, because they're getting in each other's way. </p><p>This frequently happens to me when double clicking on a word and right clicking to open the context menu on it.
