WTF are these cretinous devs thinking in not providing an option to delete this?  One of the hallmarks of Firefox has always been customizability.  Apparently, the devs need to be reminded of this!  I hate this feature with a passion and want it gone NOW!  It is a detestable eyesore on my, otherwise, pristine interface which constantly draws my eye and incites anger.  Acceptable solutions include making it possible to drag it off the toolbar using the ""customize toolbar"" feature, allowing users to right click it and click ""remove from toolbar"", or allowing it to be removed using about:config. </p><p>Why would the devs alienate a significant portion of their user base by insisting that this be on the toolbar?  Are they so out of touch?  The devs need to wake the F up!  Many users do not habitually keep a large number of tabs open and do not want or need this feature taking up real estate on the toolbar!
