I have never seen this on Firefox with non-Google sites, nor on Chrome/Edge with Google sites. I have tried the other suggestions here, such as disabling anti-virus, clearing proxy (not that I use one anyway) etc, and clearing the DNS and HTTP caches, to no avail. I have no relevant extensions. What is particularly strange is that when a URL is not loading, if I open Chrome and type in that same URL, it will load immediately there and also immediately in Firefox (sometimes needing a refresh). I have seen other reports online of similar issues in recent weeks from other users, which makes me feel that it may be related to a recent Firefox update. </p>",firefox;windows-11;browse;firefox-1310;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",Nigel123
