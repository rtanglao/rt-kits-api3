Last night it would not complete the login process. I tried several different accounts, typed in the information rather than using the auto-fill and also cleared the cache. Multiple attempts. No luck. Then I tried using the browser, Edge, and it completed the login.  There was a new update to Firefox in the last couple days. Could that be the problem? I contacted the tech support at the Pearson Assessments and they tried it from their computer, on Firefox, and it worked.

When browsing YouTube and right-clicking a video thumbnail on the homepage, suddenly a lot of new options have been added to the right-click menu related to playing the video, such as 'Pause', 'Unmute', 'Speed' etc. </p><p>One of the shortcuts is 'Ton' (German for Audio), which leads to the right-click menu option for 'New Tab' and 'Ton (Audio)' being the same, both are selected using Strg + T. This means that now I cannot simply use Strg + T to open the video in a new tab, I have to tap an additional key to select which of the 'T'-options (New Tab or Ton) I want to choose, since simply using Strg + T will just keep switching between the options in the menu instead of selecting it. It's a small but at the same time incredibly annoying change.  </p><p>Since this problem doesn't exist when using the English interface, I switched to that as a short term solution. But I would really like to know why this choice was made for the German interface, considering how often the New Tab shortcut will be used and that I don't need those video settings on the homepage at all. </p><p>Is there a way to change this or edit the right-click menu? Or could you consider this fact in your next update? Please make the shortcut for 'Ton' something other than Strg + T... </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",mmammimumemo

I have tried the other suggestions here, such as disabling anti-virus, clearing proxy (not that I use one anyway) etc, and clearing the DNS and HTTP caches, to no avail. I have no relevant extensions. What is particularly strange is that when a URL is not loading, if I open Chrome and type in that same URL, it will load immediately there and also immediately in Firefox (sometimes needing a refresh).
