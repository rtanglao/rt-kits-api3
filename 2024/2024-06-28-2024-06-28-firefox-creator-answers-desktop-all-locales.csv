When I click on the link instead of opening as Save As, which I think it should, it immediately gives me that error.  I have the ask me where to save thing checked. My home directory is ecryptfs.  Ecryptfs says it has a max file name of 143 characters. Mine stops working after 140 characters or 144 including "".pdf"". Anyways I think the file name breaks my file system.  I was trying to download two pdfs.  This is another one I tried to download earlier that gave me the error. It's definitely above the characters my file system can handle.  https://download.library.lol/main/2860000/6148479dea7d8c9661201ecfc6108525/Alexander%20Brown%20-%20The%20genesis%20of%20the%20United%20States_%20a%20narrative%20of%20the%20movement%20in%20England%2C%201605-1616%2C%20which%20resulted%20in%20the%20plantation%20of%20North%20America%20by%20Englishmen%2C%20disclosing%20the%20contest%20between%20E.pdf It's public domain from the 1800s.  I don't pirate. I was able to download it with wget while choosing a shorter filename. I don't know why it wouldn't let me choose after clicking the link. Additionally clicking save link as allows me to choose a file name and continue normally. I have a few more problems I'd like to put in this ticket. A. After giving me the error Firefox crashed immediately afterwards. This was a few days ago. Firefox has never crashed like that before in months. I don't remember exactly what happened but it did crash. If crash logs are needed I can find it.  B. After attempting to downloading a video (mp4) file this happened. The mp4 file didn't show up anywhere but a -1 byte part file showed up. It took the name of a subfolder in the folder I had intended to download the image file. I'll explain it in further detail below.  I attempted to download an image in /home/user/Documents. In the Documents folder I had another folder which I'll call example. So /Documents/example. I did save the video in Documents but I don't think that mattered. After closing the save as box that popped up after clicking save video I noticed the weird file show up in the Downloads tab. It showed up in the ""example"" folder and took the name ""example"".part. Remember I never chose the ""example"" folder but I did choose the Documents folder.  All my files inside the ""example"" folder broke and I couldn't delete the weird part file.  Clicking properties showed the permissions could not be determined. When I interacted with it (I think I tried deleting it) it gave me an error with ""gvfsd-admin daemon"". I don't remember what it said exactly. I applied my folder's permissions to its contents and I was able to delete it. It doesn't show up in my downloads manager now. I ran clamav and everything was fine.  Note I downloaded the video from a trusted source, twimg or the twitter video host.  C. Finally when downloading a pdf link that worked, I didn't get the file app box that allows you to save as. I stated above that I have the ask me where to save thing turned on. I don't know if that was a feature or what. Here's the link. It's also an public domain work. <a href=""https://libgen.li/ads.php?md5=2bce68b1eb5b7dd81ccd4bda4a9ed76b"" rel=""nofollow"">https://libgen.li/ads.php?md5=2bce68b1eb5b7dd81ccd4bda4a9ed76b</a> That's all. I'm almost certain it's due to the filename length. Why didn't it open a save as box though? My third question B is a bit more serious. Surely these are bugs? </p>",linux;desktop;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",stver
