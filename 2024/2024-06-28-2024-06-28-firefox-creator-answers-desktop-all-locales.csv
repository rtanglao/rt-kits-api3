It is a credit card statement downloaded off the issuer's website.  The PDF file Properties dialog shows Page Size 6.92 x 14 in (Portrait).   The thumbnail preview of the document shows the pages in the 6.92 x 14"" format. I want to print this document to 8.5 x 11"" paper WITHOUT HAVING THE DOCUMENT SHRUNK TO FIT THE SMALLER PAPER.  Shrinking the document results in a printout that I cannot read without a magnifier.  This is unacceptable. I don't care if the bottom 3"" of each page are cut off (mostly that 3"" is blank anyway).  All I want is to be able to print out a document I can read. NOTE:  I have tried using the print dialog option ""Size to [choose % magnification],"" instead of ""fit to page width."" This does not work.  The print image stubbornly refuses to magnify, the print preview still shows a legal sized document crammed into letter sized paper, and I'm still stuck with a shrunken document with teeny tiny text that I can't read. NOTE:  I have also explored using the ""simplified"" print setting instead of ""original.""  All that gives me is a text explanation and the original document itself disappears.   So no joy there either. </p><p>Firefox 127.0.2 (64 bit), Windows 11. </p><p>Suggestions? </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,other,en-US,"",smittydm

When I close FF with the windows x on the title bar it closes and when I click the FF logo pinned on the taskbar FF opens with my previous session tabs, this is normal way work. Then for some reason it suddenly changes so when I open FF I get a new window with no tabs. I usually can recover this with &gt;History&gt;Recently closed tabs. But if FF is started with a link in a document, I deal with that and when it closes I realise that it had opened a new window, when it closes there is no recently closed tabs history and I've lost them all. I think this happens because the link opened a new window and closed it automatically and now because it had no more tabs open there is no tab history to recover. But then it stays like that. Every time I open FF it opens a new blank window, I click the &gt;Recently closed tabs and get it back. Then close the new blank window then close FF but it doesn't re-open with the previous tabs even though it's set to do so. It works OK for a while and then suddenly starts this aberration.  I've tried getting help on this before and was advised to close FF &gt;3Bars&gt;Exit but that closes all open sessions rather than just the one I want to close. This problem has been on going for a long time and is extremely annoying when all the tabs are lost. I even suggested that there could be a session stack maybe 10 or 20 so we could open that and recover any of the stack sessions we wanted. I'm sorry to say that FF is not the reliable browser it once was. </p>",windows-7;desktop;tabs;firefox-115120;firefox-11512;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",Vicr

I don't pirate. I was able to download it with wget while choosing a shorter filename. I don't know why it wouldn't let me choose after clicking the link. Additionally clicking save link as allows me to choose a file name and continue normally. I have a few more problems I'd like to put in this ticket. A. After giving me the error Firefox crashed immediately afterwards. This was a few days ago. Firefox has never crashed like that before in months. I don't remember exactly what happened but it did crash. If crash logs are needed I can find it.  B. After attempting to downloading a video (mp4) file this happened. The mp4 file didn't show up anywhere but a -1 byte part file showed up. It took the name of a subfolder in the folder I had intended to download the image file. I'll explain it in further detail below.  I attempted to download an image in /home/user/Documents. In the Documents folder I had another folder which I'll call example. So /Documents/example. I did save the video in Documents but I don't think that mattered. After closing the save as box that popped up after clicking save video I noticed the weird file show up in the Downloads tab. It showed up in the ""example"" folder and took the name ""example"".part. Remember I never chose the ""example"" folder but I did choose the Documents folder.  All my files inside the ""example"" folder broke and I couldn't delete the weird part file.  Clicking properties showed the permissions could not be determined. When I interacted with it (I think I tried deleting it) it gave me an error with ""gvfsd-admin daemon"". I don't remember what it said exactly. I applied my folder's permissions to its contents and I was able to delete it. It doesn't show up in my downloads manager now. I ran clamav and everything was fine.  Note I downloaded the video from a trusted source, twimg or the twitter video host.  C. Finally when downloading a pdf link that worked, I didn't get the file app box that allows you to save as. I stated above that I have the ask me where to save thing turned on. I don't know if that was a feature or what. Here's the link. It's also an public domain work. <a href=""https://libgen.li/ads.php?md5=2bce68b1eb5b7dd81ccd4bda4a9ed76b"" rel=""nofollow"">https://libgen.li/ads.php?md5=2bce68b1eb5b7dd81ccd4bda4a9ed76b</a> That's all. I'm almost certain it's due to the filename length. Why didn't it open a save as box though? My third question B is a bit more serious. Surely these are bugs? </p>",linux;desktop;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",stver
