I looked at that and thought, ""That certainly cannot include passwords""; BUT the explanation for this permission is: ""The extension could read the content of web pages you visit in the specified domain, as well as data you enter into those web pages, such as usernames and passwords. "" </p><p>I was stunned.   </p><p>That means that addins that get this permission have access to my banking/medical/etc.  usernames &amp; passwords.  This is not acceptable.  Can a permission be developed that would be:   ""Access your data for sites in the “named” domain"" (except usernames/passwords).   </p><p>The permission ""Access your data for all websites"" is significantly worse in that it applies to all sites. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",pabsfx-config

However, under connected services, I still see the old (pre-reset) name of my MacBook Pro, in addition to the MacBook Pro's current name.  </p><p>Is it possible to retrieve my pre-reset passwords and bookmarks? </p>",desktop;sync;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",bl2589
