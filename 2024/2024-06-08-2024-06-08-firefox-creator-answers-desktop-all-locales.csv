I tried to watch Netflix when it said, ""Firefox is installing components needed to play the audio or video on this page. Please try again later."" </p><p>I found out this was due to Widevine not being installed AT ALL on my browser for some reason. The plugins manager has been saying that it will ""be installed shortly"" for a week now. I already tried toggling DRM off and on multiple times. I already tried using troubleshooting mode. I already checked GMP preferences to make sure nothing relating to Widevine was set to 'false'. I already tried turning off my antivirus long enough to try everything again and still nothing has changed. I do not have any VPNs running either. I am attaching a screenshot of what the browser console shows when I toggle DRM off and on again and try to run Netflix. I am also attaching what the gmp toggles say. Please help me figure out what is wrong! </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1260;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",om.turakhia

I have looked in the extensions settings and do not have any added extensions  so that did not cause the problem. I also run Norton antivirus and Norton Ultimate utilities software and regularly clean out files and scan my computer for malware. Not sure if Ultimate Utilities is the problem since I have had other problems in the past with that program. Also, I wonder if Windows updates caused this problem? This has also caused problems in the past.  To get around this problem I have to copy the link then right click on my mouse and open a new window the paste the link. Very annoying and time consuming.   How do I fix the continual tabs crashing  problem? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1656342;,cmar999
