I am using 126.0.1 on a mac desktop (and laptop) using 13.6.7 ventura. Long time user of firefox, but new to private windows. </p><p>1) I am using a popup blocker on firefox (UBlock Origin). Its icon shows on the browser window, but in a private window the icon disappears and I am getting popups. Do pop up blockers work in a private window? Is there a setting for that? 2) on my main browser Firefox home page I have 4 rows of shortcuts. On a private window home page there are none, and no settings icon to address this. Are shortcuts allowed on a private window home page and, if so, how to add? </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",JayElDee

The most recent one is <a href=""http://TireRack.com"" rel=""nofollow"">TireRack.com</a>. I'm shopping for tires for my car and Firefox is loading all the other sites I've visited but it won't load any page from TireRack. They are a legitimate shopping site. It happens from results of a Google search but I've also tried typing the main page of the site's address into the address bar, clicking various other links that display below the actual search result that go to other pages within the site, etc. The site loads fine in both Chrome and Edge. This happens every so often and it's always a legitimate site and the exact same behavior. I can't recall any other specific sites at the moment but it's enough to have me pretty irritated today as when I'm shopping I like to have multiple tabs open with all my options for comparison and price considerations and today I have to have one of them open in a different browser which makes it much more difficult to keep tabs on especially where I'm used to only having one browser open for all instead of having to remember that one of my options is open in another browser. I have glanced through my browser setting as well as my windows security settings but I could spend hours in there trying to figure out things and potentially breaking other things myself, which I don't like doing. Any suggestions or other info on what could be going on will be much appreciated, and thanks in advance. </p><p>Ray. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1260;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1656371;,r.dunne71
