I'd like to keep 2FA enabled. I'd just like to know <strong>why </strong>Firefox doesn't appear in my Google or Microsoft Authenticator apps. I end up having to use recovery codes which makes the process a pain. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",craigandrew

How to prohibit those? </p><p>The problem in DuckDuckGo search is that one cannot readily edit the original search word/phrase, as the suggestions take over that area; can't do a quick LnUp or LnDn, can't do a quick LeftArrow or RightArrow if a correction is needed -- the suggestions just decide to bully their way in at every inopportune opportunity. </p><p>I've changed whatever settings in Duckville that I can find, but it doesn't care what I need or think.
