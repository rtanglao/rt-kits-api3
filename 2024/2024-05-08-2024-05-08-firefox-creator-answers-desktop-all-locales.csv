For example, trying to upload photos to my website or upload files to a platform. Frustrating. To work around it I've been using a separate tab of Google chrome but it's such a pain to keep swapping back and forth.

Whenever I try to watch videos on YouTube in resolutions above 1080p, they tend to randomly buffer. It's quite frustrating, especially when I know my internet connection is stable and other browsers don't seem to have this issue. Has anyone else experienced this problem with Firefox? And if so, do you have any tips or solutions to share? Thanks in advance for any insights! </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1651865;,ThanosZ97
