See in the picture that much of the text is in English - the selected and preferred language. It is what the Settings are set to. But notice that bits and pieces are in some other language. I recently made a trip to Spain and used translation features while there - but those was all reset to English. I've gone into Troubleshooting mode; I've restarted; I've reset and restarted. But I can't seem to get rid of the gibberish. WTH!!!! All copies of Firefox, on all owned Mac machines (i-Phone; Mac Mini; I-Mac Pro; I pads) are set to English. About the only thing I haven't done it uninstall and reinstall Firefox.

Whenever I try to watch videos on YouTube in resolutions above 1080p, they tend to randomly buffer. It's quite frustrating, especially when I know my internet connection is stable and other browsers don't seem to have this issue. Has anyone else experienced this problem with Firefox? And if so, do you have any tips or solutions to share?
