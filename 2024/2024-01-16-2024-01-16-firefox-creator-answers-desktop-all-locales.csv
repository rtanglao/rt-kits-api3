It works, no problems. </p><p>My issue is that, when I re-size the window that lists current cookies, that window size does not hold. The next time I access Manage Data the window is back to its original, small size. </p><p>Up until v121, the window has retained the size it was previously. </p><p>I have the same problem on my laptop using Firefox v115x. It used to keep the same size window, but a few months ago stopped that behavior and always starts with the small-sized window. </p><p>It is not the worst problem to have, but I keep track of multiple cookies on a regular basis. Leaving the window the same (larger) size would be nice. </p><p>It also would be nice for that window to retain the view last used. I usually check cookies that were most recently used, but the window has always defaulted to the largest cache size for cookies. </p><p>These are minor niggles, but it would be nice if they could be addressed one day. </p><p>Attached is a screenshot of my extensions. These did not seem to interfere with Firefox functions before. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,other,en-US,1630789;,DeSelbyofDalkey
