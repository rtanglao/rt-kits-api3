The arrows which should shrink the size of the window appear at the edges but they do not work.   </p><p>Screenshot 1 shows the print page as it appears on the monitor.  When I click on PRINT, I get Screenshot 2.  What the screenshot does not show is that the arrow to change the window size was at the edge at the bottom (but unlike other such windows it did not move the window boundary) and the toggle to change to full screen or vice versa has disappeared. </p><p>This has gone on for years despite regular updates to my Firefox version.  It appears that nobody at Firefox/Mozilla is interested in fixing this.  So, is there a simple way for a non-geek to work around this? </p><p>My current work-around is to copy the URL and open it in Chrome.  Chrome does not have this problem. </p><p>ramschpost@gmail.com </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ramschpost

At any given time when I try to run the application, it never lasts for more than a couple seconds before it suddenly stops with no warning. Whenever I get these crashes, the Crash Reporter never opens. Because of this issue I can't open it in troubleshooting mode. At this point I have tried fully resetting my PC twice, uninstalling McAfee, had multiple malware scans, and have uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox itself multiple times. I'm really not all that good at operating computers, I just kind of know how to navigate files. I don't know what else to do at this point. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1630831;1630832;1630833;1630834;,jake.dm527

Now when I try to access the account, Wells Fargo no longer recognizes my sign-in information.  The Wells Fargo internet customer service person I spoke to said I was the second customer within the last few days with a similar problem with Firefox.  Both Chrome and Edge are not having similar problems.  I have the latest version of Firefox, so possibly Wells Fargo changed something.  I do not want to use Chrome or Edge because of the hundreds of trackers they allow.  Does anybody have any ideas?  How does Firefox check on the compatibility of Firefox with websites? Thank you.

It used to keep the same size window, but a few months ago stopped that behavior and always starts with the small-sized window. </p><p>It is not the worst problem to have, but I keep track of multiple cookies on a regular basis. Leaving the window the same (larger) size would be nice. </p><p>It also would be nice for that window to retain the view last used. I usually check cookies that were most recently used, but the window has always defaulted to the largest cache size for cookies. </p><p>These are minor niggles, but it would be nice if they could be addressed one day. </p><p>Attached is a screenshot of my extensions.
