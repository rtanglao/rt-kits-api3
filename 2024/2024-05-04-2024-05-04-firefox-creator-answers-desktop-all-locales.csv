You still see the usual file info but now the progress bar of the download is gray instead of blue and is  extremely hard to see. You have to look closely but in the first screenshot you can see where the shade of gray of the progress bar changes, just under the ""6"" of the ""x86"" part of the file name. But if you click on the ""show all downloads"" link, then the blue progress bar will show as usual for any in-progress downloads in the Library window, as shown in the second screenshot.   </p><p>It isn't a huge issue but is still annoying when you just want to quickly see the progress of downloads in Firefox. I haven't changed any of the colors in Firefox or in Windows for that matter, I'm currently running Windows 10. All other dialog boxes, windows, etc. all display normally on my system. Just curious if anyone else is having this problem and hopefully a future update can take care of it. </p><pre>Thanks very much! </pre>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",jbb2004g

In Firefox - only (this works fine in Chrome) - if I open the LastPass Firefox Extension, find a Site, and Copy the password, then go directly to an open AnyDesk remote access connection, and Paste (or, lightning bolt menu, Insert from Clipboard), what gets pasted is a single wrong character, NOT the password that IS in the clipboard. (If I paste instead into e.g. a local Notepad window, the actual password gets pasted). I asked AnyDesk support about this, and they confirmed that it's something that Firefox is doing. It shouldn't. Copy is copy. Paste is paste. Why would Firefox do something so that copied text (which just happens to be a password from a password vault extension) pastes wrong when the destination just happens to be a remote desktop client (AnyDesk) to send the password through to complete a login at the remote end? Anyway, how to turn off this wrong behaviour? thank you.
