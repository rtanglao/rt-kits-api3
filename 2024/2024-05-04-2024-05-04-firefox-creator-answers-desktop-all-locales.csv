They have names like ""wal3A7109C6"" (no file extension). Usually 4-5 will be generated at the same time (ie, same timestamp, so within the same second).  </p><p>When I first noticed them, I (nervously) deleted a batch with no apparent consequences - but I had to activate Administrator privileges to get rid of them. I ran virus scans but have seen nothing unusual. </p><p>A few minutes ago, I had Firefox open but minimized to the task bar. I also happened to have c:\ open in a Window I could see. As I tapped to expand the browser, another of the files appeared, and the browser window behaved oddly for a moment, as though about to crash. The last few versions - I'm at 125.0.3 (64 bit) - have been crashing more than I'm accustomed to, but this is the first time I'd considered the browser to be a likely suspect. </p><p>Does anyone have any clues/possibilities to offer? It would be much appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",bantarleton

In Firefox - only (this works fine in Chrome) - if I open the LastPass Firefox Extension, find a Site, and Copy the password, then go directly to an open AnyDesk remote access connection, and Paste (or, lightning bolt menu, Insert from Clipboard), what gets pasted is a single wrong character, NOT the password that IS in the clipboard. (If I paste instead into e.g. a local Notepad window, the actual password gets pasted). I asked AnyDesk support about this, and they confirmed that it's something that Firefox is doing. It shouldn't. Copy is copy. Paste is paste. Why would Firefox do something so that copied text (which just happens to be a password from a password vault extension) pastes wrong when the destination just happens to be a remote desktop client (AnyDesk) to send the password through to complete a login at the remote end? Anyway, how to turn off this wrong behaviour? thank you. (Windows 11 Pro, 64-bit, 23H2, Firefox current - 125.something today, but this has been going on for some weeks at least, AnyDesk version 8 current) </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1651313;,libove

My primary email has been breeched and because I was honest with the service --instead of just saying I need help resetting my password. Thay are asking me to send them a copy of my drivers' license and a photo ""selfie"" of myself to recover my account.  </p><p>This is where I draw the line -- all invasions of privacy we have learned to live with but not this -- I could give them the transaction ID from my last Payment from Paypal period -- but that was not good enough. If I was being deceitfull I could easily provide the crdentials they ask for and it could all be fake; so I told them to get lost as I was paying for the Premium service anyway. I can contintue to use that as my ID but sonner or later someone is going to want to send me a code there and I can't retrieve it. Tonight they did not ask so I was able to get in here. </p><p>Everybody has a place to change your password but few have a place to change your sign-in ID. If I can get back into Firefox with a new ID and set 2 step validation I shouls be okay as faras the average user gors. The other option that I know of is to stary a new Firefox account. I alread have a lot of people and business's that I have to get my new email to. </p><p>Thanks To Anyone with any ideas. </p><p>Sincerely  Paul </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1651297;,kendall20202020
