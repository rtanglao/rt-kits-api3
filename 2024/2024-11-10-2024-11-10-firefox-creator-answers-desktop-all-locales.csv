It lets me search videos and open the page, but the player sits and loads without playing.  <a href=""http://Music.youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Music.youtube.com</a> doesn't respond at all to the play button; it continues to show the play button and doesn't play. I tried removing all my extensions, clearing history, cache, site settings, et. al., but it didn't work. Only on Chromium does YouTube work.  I heard Youtube was cracking down on adblockers, but I have tried removing it already and reloading to no avail. Next I'm trying to refresh firefox in about:support. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",bradleybaas
