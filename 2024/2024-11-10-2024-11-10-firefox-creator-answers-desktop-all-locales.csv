About a week or so ago I did a refresh on my FF due to another issue.  So, after that was done I went through and looked at my settings and made the changes to get back to my previous choices.  Now when I sign onto FF it opens up to a blank page, which I chose it to do, but my bookmarks are not on the left side.  I have to click on my tool bar to put them there and also adjust the width of the size. Before I did the refresh the bookmarks would remain on the start page unless I had closed them before I signed off.  I signed on using my wife's profile and the bookmarks remain on the start up ""blank"" page like they've always done.  I did notice on her settings page that the option to always check to make sure FF was the default browser was ""not"" checked.  I went back to my profile settings and the same box ""was"" checked for the FF default checking but it's shadowed out and I can't change it.  I do have my ""old"" profile data saved if needed.  How do I fix this issue where my bookmarks on the left side of the start up page ""stays"" that way when I close out and the next time I sign on they are still there? </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",donP22
