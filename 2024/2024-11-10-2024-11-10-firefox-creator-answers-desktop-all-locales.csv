But I forget to do it often. </p><p>I like testing new features and giving feedback about bugs, also I am always  running the latest macOS Developer Beta on my Mac and use Nightly as my main browser most of the time. But I am still using 1Password 6 for several reasons. </p><p>It seems (I noticed it only today) the update to version 134 made my already officially unsupported 1Password extension unusable. </p><p>I am using the one that you only see if you activated the checkbox for showing betas on this website but that version doesn’t make a difference. Just to explain why it’s labeled beta in my screenshot, it’s not one of the new betas. </p><p><a href=""https://app-updates.agilebits.com/product_history/OPX4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://app-updates.agilebits.com/product_history/OPX4</a> </p><p>So now, I can’t even download the file with a right click from there, to install it again. </p><p>I am sure I will find it somewhere in my backups but I fear that doesn’t help. </p><p>Did anything change regarding the handling of Extensions in version 134? </p><p>Is it possible to reactivate it somehow? Maybe somewhere in about:config? </p><p>I would be really happy for your help. </p><p><br> And another question: </p><p>Is there a way to install Nightlies for iOS too? I only have the TestFlight beta there. </p><p>I already have an Alpha version of an app on one of my iPhones. The developer needed a UDID or so for that. </p><p>Before everyone used TestFlight I could also install pre-release versions like Proton Mail or the Readdle apps by installing a profile. </p><p>And now there are even more ways for EU located devices. </p><p>Now the text got even longer, than the original one. Sorry for that.&nbsp;;) But I don’t read it again for correcting typos. </p><p><br> Kind regards, Julie </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",bmk8fq86qs

It even does this with the icons for websites in the bookmarks bar. It happens like this for almost every single one and so many things I've tried doing doesn't fix it; installed latest version, restarting the browser, troubleshoot mode. Nothing works.  </p><p>The image that is bright and washed out is a screenshot of a weighted blanket on its website while using Firefox.
