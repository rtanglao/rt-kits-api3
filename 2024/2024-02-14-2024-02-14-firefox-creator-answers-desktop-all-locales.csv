I use Firefox to create my websites, but the browser no longer saves (file:///C:/sukujut/list_1/Mattimakinen.htm) htm data and images. It only stores small files and image quantities, but not the size I need (e.g. 22mt). I create an htm file and an image file through family stories, open them in the Firefox browser, and after the page opens, I save them as a web page, the whole thing - in a Microsoft Expression Web program file. At this point, if the file is even slightly larger, it will save the htm file, but not the image file at all. A warning triangle appears next to the save button and the message: download failed. Mattimakinen.htm - download failed - local file. </p><p>I have reinstalled firefox, no help. The browser saves the plain htm file, but not with the photos. I am currently doing genealogy and an important area is photographs. </p><p>Best Regards from Finland, Kalevi Ojanen </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",kalevi.ojanen
