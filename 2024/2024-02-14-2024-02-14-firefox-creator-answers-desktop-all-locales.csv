I tried reseting the cache and booting in safe mode, but it doesn't seem to work. I changed things like themes and made the site be able to choose its own, but nothing seems to work. One option I found online but I'm not to happy to try is to make another profile, but I have all my passwords and bookmarks on this profile. </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",malosalexandru2004

The concept of new window is not only inconvenience but also anti-user since I have to use chromium browser (using cococ browser (<a href=""https://coccoc.com/en"" rel=""nofollow"">https://coccoc.com/en</a>, alongside to manage bookmarks and history due to firefox shortcomings). Even edge has option to choose how to open history and bookmark manager in new tab. </p><p>I cannot find an option to choose how to open the bookmark manager (chrome://bookmarks/) and history manager (chrome://history/) new tab rather than window otherwise it would have worked. Plus no flags in about:config like chrome adds new features and options via chrome flags. </p><p>Is firefox usable for an average user jumping from chrome and chrome using habits in 2024? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,1636741;1636762;,Net_Hunter_90s

So a new update has appeared - but I can't download it until I restart. So I will have to restart, reload session, download new update, restart again, reload session again. </p><p>So it would be great to be able to tell Firefox to forget about the already-downloaded update and just download the latest one. Can this be done? </p><p>(The reason why I delay restarting is because I have an unhealthy amount of tabs open, typically with many things in flight; so restarting makes me lose those things, plus there's always the possibility of some trouble while restoring all the tabs) </p><p>FWIW I'm in the Beta channel. </p>",desktop;beta;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1230;,firefox,other,en-US,"",hmijail

So I have no idea what is going on. I reset cache as I had read that from a post (though their issue was similar but not the same) I would appreciate any and all help you can give me.
