So I open up maps in its own tab and type in the address and I get same results. But if I use either of them in edge, I have no problems. I only have Mate Translate on in add ons. So I have no idea what is going on. I reset cache as I had read that from a post (though their issue was similar but not the same) I would appreciate any and all help you can give me.
