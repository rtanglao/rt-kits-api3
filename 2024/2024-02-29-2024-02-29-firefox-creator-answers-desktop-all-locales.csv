When I click on the email link ""Start with a free scan"", <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> appears at the bottom left and nothing happens, not just with your link but with all. I have waited many minutes just to see if it will link. Sometimes, after minutes, it connects. I have been trying to get Google out of this in ""mailto"" but cannot. If I right click ""open in a new page"", google does come up, the target site does (I think) and we move along normally. </p><p>Can't you fix this? Google it and you'll see it everywhere. Mozilla has a suggested approach online which does not work. Please help all the AVG and Firefox folks who suffer with this. </p><p>Thank you, </p><p>Charles McKeown </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",bevchasm
