I have waited many minutes just to see if it will link. Sometimes, after minutes, it connects. I have been trying to get Google out of this in ""mailto"" but cannot. If I right click ""open in a new page"", google does come up, the target site does (I think) and we move along normally. </p><p>Can't you fix this? Google it and you'll see it everywhere.
