I deleted cache, cookies, resetted Firefox, hard refresh, uninstalled extensions and all... still didn't work. The thing is that this doesn't happen in the app or other browsers like Edge, it only happens on Firefox for some reason, and yes it's updated in the latest version. Only way I can actually access this person's DMs is when I use the extension Old Twitter Layout... but I don't want to use that layout... so I'm not sure what is happening. </p><p>I would appreciate the help, please. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,fix-problems,es,"",fragasbar
