When I click on the email link ""Start with a free scan"", <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> appears at the bottom left and nothing happens, not just with your link but with all. I have waited many minutes just to see if it will link. Sometimes, after minutes, it connects. I have been trying to get Google out of this in ""mailto"" but cannot. If I right click ""open in a new page"", google does come up, the target site does (I think) and we move along normally. </p><p>Can't you fix this? Google it and you'll see it everywhere. Mozilla has a suggested approach online which does not work. Please help all the AVG and Firefox folks who suffer with this. </p><p>Thank you, </p><p>Charles McKeown </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",bevchasm

I deleted cache, cookies, resetted Firefox, hard refresh, uninstalled extensions and all... still didn't work. The thing is that this doesn't happen in the app or other browsers like Edge, it only happens on Firefox for some reason, and yes it's updated in the latest version. Only way I can actually access this person's DMs is when I use the extension Old Twitter Layout... but I don't want to use that layout... so I'm not sure what is happening. </p><p>I would appreciate the help, please. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,fix-problems,es,"",fragasbar
