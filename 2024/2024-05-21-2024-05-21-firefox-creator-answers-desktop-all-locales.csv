However, I must use it 4-5 hours a day and this is extremely annoying. Is there any way to fix this issue? In today's technology and the fact that most of us use multiple monitors, I would think this browser would be up-to-date in its options and ability to handle this.

I went back the profile I had before the XUL error because my bookmarks were there.  Still slow.  I cleaned out the cache, in both Firefox and my Windows 10.  made no difference.

Then I switch off the PC, restart it, and watch the movie for next 15 minutes., then again black screen.This cycle goes on. But When I watch the film continuously, without pause-start function, then there is no black screen problem.  In my opinion this repeated pause-start function causes the black screen problem.

It started this year right after an update. It suddenly locks up! Completely! Sometimes I cannot get it to close. I have had to shut down my pc to get rid of a locked up Firefox browser. These days I only need to right click the Firefox tab on the task bar and click ""Close Window"". That has been a big help.  </p><p>So, I give up on Firefox and made Chrome the default browser. Then behind the scenes, someone installs a  patch to the main server and fixes the problem. </p><p>I check it often and when I see that you fixed it, I set it back to default browser for about 2 or 3 weeks and then Firefox locks up again. I shut it down and switch to the Chrome browser again. </p><p>Back and forth I go. It locks up. I switch to Chrome. You finally fix it yet again. I try it after a few days and discover that you fixed it and make it default browser again. </p><p>And here I am again! I cleared the lock up by right clicking on the taskbar Firefox tab. Now I get a dialog box that has an option to shut down Firefox. Then I see a time bar move across the dialog box and close.         Nice touch! </p><p>Now I switched to the Chrome Browser again and I am waiting for you to fix your Firefox browser for the 5th or 6th time this year.  </p><p>Let me give you some advice.
