It started this year right after an update. It suddenly locks up! Completely! Sometimes I cannot get it to close. I have had to shut down my pc to get rid of a locked up Firefox browser. These days I only need to right click the Firefox tab on the task bar and click ""Close Window"". That has been a big help.  </p><p>So, I give up on Firefox and made Chrome the default browser. Then behind the scenes, someone installs a  patch to the main server and fixes the problem. </p><p>I check it often and when I see that you fixed it, I set it back to default browser for about 2 or 3 weeks and then Firefox locks up again. I shut it down and switch to the Chrome browser again. </p><p>Back and forth I go. It locks up. I switch to Chrome. You finally fix it yet again. I try it after a few days and discover that you fixed it and make it default browser again. </p><p>And here I am again! I cleared the lock up by right clicking on the taskbar Firefox tab. Now I get a dialog box that has an option to shut down Firefox. Then I see a time bar move across the dialog box and close.         Nice touch! </p><p>Now I switched to the Chrome Browser again and I am waiting for you to fix your Firefox browser for the 5th or 6th time this year.  </p><p>Let me give you some advice. Burn it to the ground and start over. What you are doing does not help! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",TedN91740
