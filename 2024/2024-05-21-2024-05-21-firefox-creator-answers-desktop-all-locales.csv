What I've tried - restarting PC, router, full re-install of Firefox, disabling all add-ons and uinstalling them (7tv and FFZ), private mode, troubleshooting mode, creating a new profile in Firefox, checked firewall settings, checked AV settings and did multiple scans - nothing was found, tried changing Firefox security Settings, also cleared cache and cookies. </p><p>I think that's everything - I was doing everything that was in the article: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-and-diagnose-firefox-problems"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-and-diagnose-firefox-problems</a> </p><p>Regarding other websites - this is completely random, mail works, some websites also do, but on some it gets stuck, like for example when I have to do a 2FA somewhere and get a pop-up window to click ""login"" or type a code, it just gets stuck and nothing shows up. </p><p>Not sure if this helps, but exactly same issues appear on different browsers - Chrome, Edge, but only on PC.

I am very much fond of watching English/Foreign language movies having English CC/Subtitles, online streaming, generally on paid channels e.g. Netflix, prime video, Hotstar, you tube etc. I am not proficient in English language. To read the English CC/subtitles, I have to pause the streaming, read the subtitle and then start the streaming (pause-start, pause-start). After about 15 minutes watching the film, the screen becomes black (no video), with a no signal detected message. But audio/sound remains continue. Then I switch off the PC, restart it, and watch the movie for next 15 minutes., then again black screen.This cycle goes on. But When I watch the film continuously, without pause-start function, then there is no black screen problem.  In my opinion this repeated pause-start function causes the black screen problem. Without pause-start function, I cannot watch these movies. I tried some online mentioned solutions without success.  Please help me in solving this problem in a simple way as I am not perfect in computer science.  Regards. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1260;,firefox,other,en-US,"",cheenamds13
