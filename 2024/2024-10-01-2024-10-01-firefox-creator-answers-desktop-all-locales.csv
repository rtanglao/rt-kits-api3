Loses tabs, opens new windows with the tabs, does not completely close","<p>Hi I  replaced chrome with firefox last 2 days but I am having a host of problems since then I only use ublock origin as addon. This one I always used on chrome too OK so I have checked ""open previous windows and tabs"" but it is not respected. I open firefox, it's blank I look into the little icon to the top left and see a list of tabs that are split between a window 1 (current) and another window. </p><p>So, it informs me that magically I have more than 1 window firefox open I am not aware of. </p><p>Next, closing firefox, doesn't actually close it. I mean the usual x, alt-f4 In the task manager I still see firefox; some 8-12 processes. So this could mean that when I hit firefox shortcut thinking I have no firefox open and waiting to come back to my tabs, I get a blank firefox. </p><p>Next, wishing to perform an uninstall, I ...can't. It says firefox is running, it must first be ended(!) and if I want instead a cleanup </p><p>Next, some weirder things. With firefox open, opening spotify web in a new tab triggered the opening of a new firefox window with tabs I deemed lost. </p><p>I only use a single profile, that addon and all happens on a Windows 10 x64 machine with i5, 16GB RAM and NVME storage on which the single most recent modification was the replacement of chrome with firefox. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1678203;,woof
