Sometimes old settings come back, for example older start pages, even if I change it to the default firefox page, at varying intervals the setting reverts to a setting from several years ago. Also, the machine comes from Germany and was installed in German. It should be used in Hungarian, but after changing the language, it forgets the Hungarian language days, weeks, months later. As time changes, the Hungarian language disappears from the installed ones and reverts to German. Also, the German language cannot be removed from the list. </p><p>I have a question, is it possible to permanently delete the settings and restore the default settings without having to harm the profile. I can't find the button to reset everything. Although, since changing the settings doesn't usually help for a long time, it probably wouldn't help either. </p><p>I think the machine was installed by a German internet service provider with its own settings. The user does not want to reinstall </p>",desktop;windows-10;customize-settings-and-preferences;,firefox,customize-settings-and-preferences,hu,"",laszlo.bakoczy

This typically goes on for several minutes, and if I close and reopen Firefox, the process begins again. It's enough CPU that the fans kick on high through most of the process, and considering I'm only opening the browser (not even switching tabs to actively load any other pages), I don't know why it would do this. Similarly, if it were related to typical startup behavior, why doesn't it do this every time? </p><p>While I generally trust that this is intentional and is unlikely the result of malware, I'd still like to know why Firefox does this at all and what it's doing. I'm not sure if I can collect any logs or get any other info about this. From process monitors, it appears to be the main executable that's consuming the additional CPU and not any of the isolated instances. </p><p>I collected the troubleshooting information, and saved it, but I am hesitant to share without knowing what type of information is contained (and I can see some sensitive stuff like file paths) </p><p>OS: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (Linux 6.8.0-36-generic) Firefox Version: 127.0.2 (deb) Build ID: 20240624183754 </p>",linux;desktop;troubleshooting;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",Silntknight
