There is no gear to the right of my extensions; i show an  enable/disable switch and a 3 dot menu ""..."" remove/report/manage. I have attempted to reinstall both extensions without success.  I have never had problems installing any of my previous extensions, so this has been interesting.  firefox esr&nbsp;?..  Current version is installed.   </p><p>Why do i have a different extensions page than described, and is there a way to pin my extensions differently? </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-115120;firefox-11512;,firefox,other,en-US,"",whynot.pclinux

It did. I have tried restarting my computer. Didn't work. I have tried disabling and re-enabling the options. Didn't work. I have tried all this on my work and personal computer. Same results. (They do not share the same settings) </p><p>I feel like Firefox opens my previous tabs, opens Firefox once again on the homepage and then closes the window with all tabs. I'm saying this because it happened 2 to 4 times that after I restart my computer, it opens 2 windows on 2 different windows desktops like I did when I worked before. (with the previously closed window on the second window opened...) Also, another reason for me to believe this is&nbsp;: the newly opened windows have a format which I used to open my second and third Firefox windows with that were very different from my first one (usually full screen). </p><p>I am lost at what I could try to do to fix the issue. I'm not sure how much of what I shared can help to find a solution so I tried to dump as much related info as I could. </p><p>Thanks for reading me, Ludovic </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",l.eugenot

Delete history &amp; cache - no change. But able to access via my generic Android phone. Did just email one of those sites - via my phone. (Noticed both sites are somehow related when I found a contact email.) Have already tried Apple Community but no help there. </p><p>Is there anything I could be trying via FireFox.  Have the most current update for my older MAC - El Capitan OS 10.11.6 - have tons of memory. Thanks for your help! Tried screen shots - think only the bottom of the Q comes up but you get the idea. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1011;firefox-7815;firefox-78150;,firefox,other,en-US,"",CharlotteSterling
