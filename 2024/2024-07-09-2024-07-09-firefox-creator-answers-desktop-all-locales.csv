Firefox, while still maintaining a loyal user base, has seen a gradual decline in market share, currently holding around 8% to 10%. This trend reflects Chrome's widespread adoption due to its speed, integration with Google services, and extensive ecosystem of extensions. Firefox, known for its emphasis on privacy and open-source ethos, appeals to users valuing these features. Despite its smaller share, Firefox remains a respected alternative, particularly among privacy-conscious users and certain niche communities. <a href=""https://liteblue-usps-gov.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">[[  Click Here for further information </a>] <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Click Here for further information</a>] </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",liteblue609

For the past few months, when using Firefox in Mac's full-screen mode, I've been experiencing an issue where one of the multiple open tabs unexpectedly displays in a separate window the moment I click on it. </p><p>This behavior didn't occur previously, and I believe it started happening about 3 months ago. It doesn't happen every time, but occurs a few times a day when I least expect it, making it difficult to identify the specific conditions that trigger it. I use a Magic Trackpad, and after switching to full-screen using the three-finger gesture, the moment I try to activate a specific tab, that tab alone displays as a separate window in full-screen mode. </p><p>Is it possible that a Firefox version update has changed this behavior? If this is a Firefox issue, is there a way to capture debug logs to have the developers investigate it? </p><p>Alternatively, if there's an option to prevent tabs from opening in new separate windows, that would be an effective workaround. Could you please let me know if such an option exists? </p><p>Best regards, </p>",desktop;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1661021;,ate.fleeced05

Sometimes old settings come back, for example older start pages, even if I change it to the default firefox page, at varying intervals the setting reverts to a setting from several years ago. Also, the machine comes from Germany and was installed in German. It should be used in Hungarian, but after changing the language, it forgets the Hungarian language days, weeks, months later. As time changes, the Hungarian language disappears from the installed ones and reverts to German. Also, the German language cannot be removed from the list. </p><p>I have a question, is it possible to permanently delete the settings and restore the default settings without having to harm the profile. I can't find the button to reset everything.
