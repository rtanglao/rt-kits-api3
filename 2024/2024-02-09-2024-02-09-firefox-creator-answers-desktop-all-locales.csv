Then, I try to navigate to the second site and I never get prompted to pick a cert for the second site (CertB is what it should prompt for) and the connection attempt fails with a ""Secure Connection Failed, Error code: SSL_ERROR_UNKNOWN_CA_ALERT"" message. </p><p>If I go and delete the Authentication Decision for CertA, then go to the CertB site, I get prompted for the cert decision and I am able to login just fine.

Decision) option in Firefox, then have to remember to close the browser each time I want to navigate from one site to the next.
