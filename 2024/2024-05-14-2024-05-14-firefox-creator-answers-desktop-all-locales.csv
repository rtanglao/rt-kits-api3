The site has numerous high-quality images and interactive elements which seem to cause slower load times and occasional lag. </p><p>Are there any specific Firefox settings or extensions that could help improve the performance for such media-heavy websites? Would enabling or adjusting hardware acceleration settings make a significant difference in this case? Are there known issues with Firefox handling similar content-rich websites, and if so, are there any recommended troubleshooting steps? I appreciate any insights or recommendations to enhance my browsing experience on SG Eats and similar sites. </p><p>Thanks! </p><p>potential resources for addressing performance issues in Firefox: </p><p>Troubleshooting and tips to make Firefox faster How to adjust performance settings in Firefox Looking forward to the community's feedback! </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",hanzala22m

After a while of running, however, the site starts to get increasingly laggy, in a way that simply reloading the tab does not fix. (I am aware that this is likely a result of one of the extensions I have installed that affects Youtube's behavior, specifically SponsorBlock and Return Youtube Dislike, but I am not willing to uninstall these.) I also know of a ""force reload"" - pressing ctrl + shift + R instead of just ctrl + R in order to clear the cache or something.  </p><p>However, whenever Youtube starts getting really slow, I instead like to do something I call ""crashing the tab"" - I open my system monitor, look for the current most CPU-intensive ""Isolated Web Co"" process, and end it. This pops up an error message in Firefox that says ""Gah - your tab just crashed!"" and offering me the option to restore it. After restoring it from this window, the performance is back to normal. </p><p>My question is, is this beneficial, or is it functionally identical to a normal force-reload? Is the improvement I see between this method and force-reloading the page just placebo? And if not, is there a simpler way to do it without opening a second program? </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1250;firefox-12502;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",alanwilson772

Sometimes I have no interest in doing either, and just want the damned dialog out of my face. The page seems to work otherwise, but the stupid browser keeps the dialog over top of things, and clicking outside of it, and hitting Esc, don't make it go away. I think those actions used to work, and I think there, sensibly, used to be a dismiss option, but that seems to be absent now. There's no sense to trying to force me to make a decision I don't want to make, and doesn't even need to be made, and I want this thing to cut it out. </p>",linux;desktop;beta;fix-problems;firefox-1250;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",PAGulley

However that repo can be incredibly slow and after reading about the new Firefox deb packages [1] from the Mozilla APT repository we would like to move to them.  The problem is that these packages lack Apparmor profiles, so unfortunately my security team won't let me use them. </p><p>Would it be possible to add Apparmor profiles to these packages please? They would need to be applied only when an OS has Apparmor enabled, which may not be the default for Debian. </p><p>Thank you! </p><p>[1]: <a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/4-reasons-to-try-mozillas-new-firefox-linux-package-for-ubuntu-and-debian-derivatives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/4-reasons-to-try-mozillas-new-firefox-linux-package-for-ubuntu-and-debian-derivatives/</a> </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Partially_Anonymous
