After a while of running, however, the site starts to get increasingly laggy, in a way that simply reloading the tab does not fix.

I also know of a ""force reload"" - pressing ctrl + shift + R instead of just ctrl + R in order to clear the cache or something.  </p><p>However, whenever Youtube starts getting really slow, I instead like to do something I call ""crashing the tab"" - I open my system monitor, look for the current most CPU-intensive ""Isolated Web Co"" process, and end it. This pops up an error message in Firefox that says ""Gah - your tab just crashed!"" and offering me the option to restore it. After restoring it from this window, the performance is back to normal. </p><p>My question is, is this beneficial, or is it functionally identical to a normal force-reload?

How do I do that?  This is a bug reported in Firefox 57 and **still** not fixed in Firefox 125.  I cannot find any support category anywhere in the Mozilla website that covers appealing a decision by one of their employees.  The last comment from this uncooperative indivisual is ""But given we support it on macOS and Windows yeah, it seems not very objectionable.""  Who is this **clerk** to override the fact that a number of customers very much find this ""objectionable"".  I cannot find anything on <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contact/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contact/</a> that addresses this issue.  I cannot find even a surface mail address for Mozilla.  For example my complaint has nothing to do with any of the following: </p><pre>   I’m having problems with using Firefox    I want to donate to Mozilla    I have questions about using Mozilla’s trademarks    I’d like to report misuse of a Mozilla trademark    I want to hold an event in a Mozilla space    I want Mozilla to sponsor my event    I’d like permission to use a Mozilla logo    I’m interested in Pocket’s sponsored content on Firefox    I’m a member of the Press and have a question for Mozilla </pre> <p>Yes I am having a problem with Firefox, but the clerk responsible has, through sitting on this issue for **seven years**, basically told the entire community that he doesn't give a reservoir. </p><p>In particular I feel this unacceptable behaviour should be brought to the attention of senior management, but there are no contacts for anybody in senior management. </p>",linux;desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1652730;1652742;1652794;,jamescobban
