For a variety of reasons we avoid using Canonical's Snap package version of Firefox. </p><p>Currently the fleet is using Firefox installed from the Mozilla Team PPA repo.  However that repo can be incredibly slow and after reading about the new Firefox deb packages [1] from the Mozilla APT repository we would like to move to them.  The problem is that these packages lack Apparmor profiles, so unfortunately my security team won't let me use them. </p><p>Would it be possible to add Apparmor profiles to these packages please? They would need to be applied only when an OS has Apparmor enabled, which may not be the default for Debian. </p><p>Thank you! </p><p>[1]: <a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/4-reasons-to-try-mozillas-new-firefox-linux-package-for-ubuntu-and-debian-derivatives/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/4-reasons-to-try-mozillas-new-firefox-linux-package-for-ubuntu-and-debian-derivatives/</a> </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Partially_Anonymous

Currently, it appears that all profiles on a device (or within the same user profile on a Windows computer) are treated as the same entity by Sync. </p><p>Any ideas on how to achieve what if trying to do?  Is it possible with Firefox/Mozilla Sync? </p><p>Thanks for your time. </p><p>BTW., for clarity, if it matters, the devices listed above are all Windows.  FWIW., I also use FF on Android and Linux ... and MacOS. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",graeme20
