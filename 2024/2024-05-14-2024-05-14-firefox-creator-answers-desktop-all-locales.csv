After a while of running, however, the site starts to get increasingly laggy, in a way that simply reloading the tab does not fix. (I am aware that this is likely a result of one of the extensions I have installed that affects Youtube's behavior, specifically SponsorBlock and Return Youtube Dislike, but I am not willing to uninstall these.) I also know of a ""force reload"" - pressing ctrl + shift + R instead of just ctrl + R in order to clear the cache or something.  </p><p>However, whenever Youtube starts getting really slow, I instead like to do something I call ""crashing the tab"" - I open my system monitor, look for the current most CPU-intensive ""Isolated Web Co"" process, and end it. This pops up an error message in Firefox that says ""Gah - your tab just crashed!"" and offering me the option to restore it. After restoring it from this window, the performance is back to normal. </p><p>My question is, is this beneficial, or is it functionally identical to a normal force-reload? Is the improvement I see between this method and force-reloading the page just placebo? And if not, is there a simpler way to do it without opening a second program? </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1250;firefox-12502;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1652795;,alanwilson772
