I would like to sync opened tabs, but my two desktop devices are seen one by <a href=""http://accounts.firefox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">accounts.firefox.com</a>. It shows only a phone and a single desktop device, whose name is switching between the names of the two desktop instances, according to which one of them has synced recently. Also the Android application sees only one of the two sets of tabs (switching between them), always from the PC that was used recently. I guess the problem is that I have copied all the dotfiles at the installation of the second PC. Can you suggest a quick solution that does not involve the deletion of all mozilla related dotfiles and reinstallation of the browser? </p><p>Thank you for your help! </p>",firefox;accounts;,firefox,accounts,en-US,"",danithered

I contacted the bank, and their instructions were to clear cookies and cache, close Firefox and re-open the browser, and this should clear up the problem; or, update the browser.  my Firefox is the latest version 131.0.3.  the issue still existed after performing these steps.  I tried using MS Edge and all screens loaded correctly.  Firefox is my browser of choice, and I have not had this issue previously.  please respond with feedback, so I know how to move forward.  thank you. </p>",firefox;windows-10;performance-and-connectivity;firefox-1310;firefox-13103;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",cvaughn1010
