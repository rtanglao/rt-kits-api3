Specifically because the domain <a href=""http://player.hotmart.com"" rel=""nofollow"">player.hotmart.com</a> is blocked. But this domain itself isn't used for tracking. Hotmart uses <a href=""http://tracking-api.hotmart.com"" rel=""nofollow"">tracking-api.hotmart.com</a> for tracking. So ETP breaks all websites that serve their courses via Teachable and there is no workaround other than disabling ETP for that site.

I contacted the bank, and their instructions were to clear cookies and cache, close Firefox and re-open the browser, and this should clear up the problem; or, update the browser.  my Firefox is the latest version 131.0.3.  the issue still existed after performing these steps.  I tried using MS Edge and all screens loaded correctly.  Firefox is my browser of choice, and I have not had this issue previously.  please respond with feedback, so I know how to move forward.  thank you. </p>",firefox;windows-10;performance-and-connectivity;firefox-1310;firefox-13103;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",cvaughn1010
