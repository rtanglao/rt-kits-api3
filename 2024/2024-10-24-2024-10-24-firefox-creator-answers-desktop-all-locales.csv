I am running Kubuntu 24.10 having just upgraded from Kubuntu 24.04. After the upgrade, when I click on email links in Thunderbird, a new tab is created in my Firefox window but the focus does not switch to the Firefox desktop and window as it has always done in the past. This is especially annoying since I run Thunderbird and Firefox in different virtual desktops. So, after clicking on a link, I then have to switch virtual desktops in order to see the link's webpage in Firefox. </p><p>I've done some testing and I suspect that this problem is specific to Firefox. That is, when I use Chrome instead of Firefox then the Thunderbird link works properly and changes the focus to the desktop and window with Chrome running as it should. I have tested this problem on my installation and on a fresh installation. In both cases, the focus does not switch to the desktop with Firefox when Firefox is set to the default browser. Likewise, in both cases, the focus switches properly to the desktop with Chrome when Chrome is set to the default browser. </p><p>My google searches indicated that, in the past, this type of issue has been related to xdg activation bugs or configuration issues under Wayland on Linux. </p><p>In other words, this looks like a Firefox bug in Kubuntu. </p><p>Does anybody know where I should seek support and file a bug report for this? With Mozilla or Kubuntu or Ubuntu? </p><p>Does anybody have any other ideas? </p><p>How do I fix this? </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Gordon </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",gldickens3

It may be missing or inaccessible""","<p>Hi, this question, or complaint, is addressed to the devs. I must to express in beforehand, that firefox is my preferred browser, but i hate to update it, because after every update, the program gets deteriorated instead to improve. This time I have an issue that never happened me before. I use since a long time, the multiprofile feature without any issue. Practically for that feature, is why i prefer this browser over any other  But after the latest update (131.0.3 version) i cannot open any of those profiles and the program shows me this warning ""your firefox profile cannot be loaded. it may be missing or inaccessible profiles"".  The possible cause resides because I store the profiles outside C: partition. I have C: and D: partitions on my disk, and I store them in D: partition because it has more free space. So I know perfectly the location of the profile folders and they still exist of course. Besides, i have another pc with the same specs, and happened the same. I experimented, and I could see  that the new firefox, cannot detect the old profile folders' path when you select them at firefox's profile manager.  The fact is, that if i copy one of the profiles to the default profile folder, firefox can perfectly recognize it and open it. Also if i create a new  profile inside the custom profile folder (which as I said, is outside C: partition) it also can open it. So i don't know why it can't open the other old profiles. So, copying all the old profiles to the default profile folder IS NOT an option. NEITHER recreating all those profile folders. Remember, firefox was working fine, until the latest update, so please fix that or tell me please how  to override that issue. Thanks for your attention </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,es,"",CAMILOGIL7474

I would like to sync opened tabs, but my two desktop devices are seen one by <a href=""http://accounts.firefox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">accounts.firefox.com</a>. It shows only a phone and a single desktop device, whose name is switching between the names of the two desktop instances, according to which one of them has synced recently. Also the Android application sees only one of the two sets of tabs (switching between them), always from the PC that was used recently. I guess the problem is that I have copied all the dotfiles at the installation of the second PC. Can you suggest a quick solution that does not involve the deletion of all mozilla related dotfiles and reinstallation of the browser? </p><p>Thank you for your help! </p>",firefox;accounts;,firefox,accounts,en-US,"",danithered
