The old Firefox process must be closed to open a new window."" I have refreshed and re-installed Twice! I have followed the instructions to go to file (using %APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\) and make sure it is NOT Read-Only and to delete the parent.lock in it. Yet it keeps going to Read-Only and the parent.lock keeps re-appearing. The day before everything was working. I have tried Protective Browser with other browsers and it works. 1. Why is the Protective Browser not working? 2. Why is the File going to Read-Only and 3. Why is the parent.lock keep returning?

I've been logging into it on my library computers, which I access through log in info that expires after 12 hours. For this reason, I didn't think to sign out of Mozilla before logging out of my sessions, thinking the info would be inaccessible after 12 hours. However, I've come to suspect that my Mozilla log in persists locally on the computers regardless of what user is signed in. I've noted that someone else's saved username and password now appears as an option in some logins, which has led me to believe that I am still signed into some devices. I'm currently going to change my password, and I've selected to unsync all the connected accounts as was instructed here (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/remove-synced-device-firefox-accounts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/remove-synced-device-firefox-accounts</a>).
