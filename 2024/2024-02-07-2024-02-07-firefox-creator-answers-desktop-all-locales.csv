All the Google services (Youtube, search, Gmail, Drive, GMeet) sometimes randomly do not load. The GET request is sent, but there is no answer. All the other websites work perfectly, and when I make the same Google related request via a private window, it (usually) works. So it does not seem to be a connection issue. </p><p>This was due to an update to Firefox I did recently. I already encountered that problem after an update end of 2022, and I reverted to an older version to remove the issue (106.0.3). Unfortunately some services don't work with it anymore, so I updated to the most current version (122.0.1 64 bits) thinking that the issue would be fixed. Unlucky for me, the problem came back. </p><p>I tried quite a lot of the basic things: </p> <ul><li> Remove all the plugins </li><li> Remove cache and cookies </li><li> Uninstall Firefox </li><li> Restart the computer (Windows 10 by the way) </li></ul> <p>I saw on a lot of forums pages that what worked for most people was to to set <strong>security.tls.enable_0rtt_data = false</strong> on the about:config, which I did, but the problem persists. I also noticed that when I reset Firefox, some visuals from Google services will have trouble to load the first few times I go on the page (as shown on the image attached). Not sure if it is relevant though. </p><p>Would you have any idea what I could try? My job is primarely focused around the Google Suite, so that is becoming a significantly painful problem to deal with... </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1635483;,DalaFirefox
