Urgent help needed!!!,"<p>Hello </p><p>I was taking a Government mandated test conducted by NTN, this exams are proctored and I have to run lock down software in order to take them, have webcam on etc. Part of the process is making sure that no other software is open and running in my task bar, which the proctor verifies. While I was about an hour into the test everything was shut down and I was notified by browser that the proctor shut my exam down and I needed to contact support.  </p><p>So I opened a ticket and they told me that their software detected Firefox launching in the background. Because of that the proctor took action and disqualified me for cheating/opening software during an exam.   </p><p>The huge frigging issue is, I DID NO SUCH GODDAMN THING. Firefox was 100% off and I never even went near the goddamn thing, they watch everything you do on screen as well and my mouse never even moves towards the taskbar at all. I was in the  middle of watching a video clip in the exam to answer questions about it. </p><p>Long story short, I'm in a lot of trouble. I'm not going to jail or anything like that, but I am being accused of cheating and have had the job offer rescinded. I really needed this job and wouldn't jeopardize it in a million years. Like come on ffs it was a video about what you would do in a situation, what the hell am I going to Google?? </p><p>Can anyone offer any insight, or some way to prove to them that I didn't do anything. Is there some Windows log or Firefox log or something that would show that I never launched it? NTN Tech support feels  that it was some sort of background process or update, but the rules are the rules.  </p><p>ANY HELP AT ALL would be GREATLY appreciated!!!!
