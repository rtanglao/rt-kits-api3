Only the sync data from my laptop, but even on my laptop it no longer lists my old computer, it is as if my PC from before the new OS has simply been deleted from the sync logs. In fact, my sync logs only go back to the moment I changed my password. I am not sure how to proceed as it appears that there aren't even any traces of my sync from before this point. </p><p>It would be nice if I could get the old tabs I had open on my desktop before I changed my OS, but it's not exactly a ""world ending"" situation. </p>",firefox;accounts;,firefox,accounts,en-US,"",liam.m.connorb
