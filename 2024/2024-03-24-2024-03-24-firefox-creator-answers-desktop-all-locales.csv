Unfortunately this is a different set, so I no longer have access to the Protected passwords etc.    Although Firefox has just updated to 124.0.1 the About display in Protected Browser insists ""Firefox is being updated by another instance"".  Kaspersky have studied the GetSystemInfo report and cannot find anything amiss, so is Firefox causing the problem?  e.g. where in Firefox did Kaspersky manage to find a three-years-out-of-date set of bookmarks and passwords? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1240;firefox-12401;,firefox,other,en-US,"",sarahsbillwelland

Although the automatic form filling continued to work on every page I tested. </p> <ul><li> FF version is 115.9.0esr (64-bit) on Debian 12 Linux </li><li> I use Master Password </li></ul> <p>According older questions for the similar topic: </p> <ul><li> there is no logins.json.corrupt file in the profile directory </li><li> I'm running FF on Linux and there is no ""Old data"" or similar subdirectory </li><li> for the same reason, I do not run AVG or any other MS Windows utility and no external program touched directories with FF profiles </li><li> FF restart did not help but, surprise, the form filling continued working </li><li> I tried to create new empty profile, copy logins.json and key4.db files into it and start FF with this new profile - resulted same behavior </li></ul> <p>After more debugging, I've found the probable cause: in logins.json file, the first item contains unecrypted username and password instead of encrypted ones. As a test, I stopped FF, removed this item from logins.json and restarted FF. Now, everything looks OK, for the first sight. </p><p>1. Is it really OK or something else crashes tomorrow?&nbsp;:) 2. What's the correct way to fix such issue? 3. Is it a known problem? I cannot reproduce it in any way nor I know what caused this corruption. So I cannot report new Bug. </p><p>Thanks for your answers. Milan </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-11590;firefox-1159;,firefox,fix-problems,cs,"",milan16
