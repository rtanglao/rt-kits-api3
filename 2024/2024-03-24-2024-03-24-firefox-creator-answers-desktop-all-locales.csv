I have tried changing out my RAM and updating my drivers. I have ran all the system check programs (""sfc /scannow"", ""chkdsk"" and the Windows Memory Diagnostic) and they all report no problems. Please help me as soon as possible as I just can not continue using the browser like this. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1240;firefox-12401;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",slomovicv

A situation often arises when you open a website and cannot watch a video there made by customers about a product. There is no option to select resolution on many sites, and browsers by default try to play videos at the maximum resolution, ignoring the capabilities of the laptop. The essence of the question is, is it possible to limit the video resolution for all sites in a browser or system? </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1150;,firefox,other,en-US,1643884;1643898;,amper500

(^_^) I highly dislike quite a few of the settings on firefox, especially considering they're turned on by default. The setting I <strong>abhor </strong>is the experiment setting because mozilla is <em>quite literally</em> experimenting on myself and other users. You may have a different perspective on the matter but I find it <strong>disgusting</strong> that there's nothing overtly telling you that your instance of firefox is different than other peoples just so they can run experiments (technically, on YOU) but I digress. I noticed the experiment option was turned on after I thought I had turned it off. Since I turned it off, I've had to update firefox every time I start it. I happened to look at the settings and noticed that the experiment option was turned back on without my consent or knowledge. After turning it off again, firefox updated <em><strong>once again</strong></em> and guess what, the experiment setting was turned back on. Why is that and how can I prevent that from happening in the future because, again, that's a disgusting practice in my eyes. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1240;firefox-12401;,firefox,customize,en-US,1643890;,silverstrings026
