1443102,2024-03-23 19:02:54 -0700,2024-03-23 19:02:54 -0700,Firefox corrupted the database of passwords (logins.json),"<p>In the middle of my FF session, about:logins stopped showing any stored logins/passwords. Although the automatic form filling continued to work on every page I tested. </p> <ul><li> FF version is 115.9.0esr (64-bit) on Debian 12 Linux </li><li> I use Master Password </li></ul> <p>According older questions for the similar topic: </p> <ul><li> there is no logins.json.corrupt file in the profile directory </li><li> I'm running FF on Linux and there is no ""Old data"" or similar subdirectory </li><li> for the same reason, I do not run AVG or any other MS Windows utility and no external program touched directories with FF profiles </li><li> FF restart did not help but, surprise, the form filling continued working </li><li> I tried to create new empty profile, copy logins.json and key4.db files into it and start FF with this new profile - resulted same behavior </li></ul> <p>After more debugging, I've found the probable cause: in logins.json file, the first item contains unecrypted username and password instead of encrypted ones. As a test, I stopped FF, removed this item from logins.json and restarted FF. Now, everything looks OK, for the first sight. </p><p>1. Is it really OK or something else crashes tomorrow?&nbsp;:) 2. What's the correct way to fix such issue? 3. Is it a known problem? I cannot reproduce it in any way nor I know what caused this corruption. So I cannot report new Bug. </p><p>Thanks for your answers. Milan </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-11590;firefox-1159;,firefox,fix-problems,cs,"",milan16
