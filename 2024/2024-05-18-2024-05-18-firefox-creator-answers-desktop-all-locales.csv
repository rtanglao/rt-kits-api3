As for my cell phone, I've never liked using it and unless someone helps me learn how to use all the available features in Firefox (plus everything else in a smart phone which I call that stupid phone) then I will probably end up throwing it in the garbage and will sit in waiting rooms reading a book or magazine instead of doing whatever it is everyone else is doing on their phones. Most likely they're texting which I just learned how to do a few months ago. I never thought texting was necessary for me to know but now it seems to be the only way my adult children keep in touch these days.  </p><p>How can I possibly learn everything I can or should do with Firefox? I barely know how to use all the basic features even though I've used Firefox for years. Your updates come so frequently that I will never be able to catch up! Why don't you offer some courses strictly for seniors who need a lot or even just a little bit of guidance when it comes to tackling technological issues? I dislike new technology but we have to use it, don't we? So, make life easier for us older folks and offer a few virtual courses to help us learn what we need to know. Come on Mozilla you can do it. You offer the technology now show us how to use it! </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1260;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",E-or

I love the feature that you can save a url complete with that website name, icon, and colors. My desktop is very colorful. I just did an update on Firefox in the last two days. Lets just call it the last update. After the last update an hour ago I just received a notification that Malwarebytes blocked what the call  Malvertising. As I said, I have been using Firefox since the 90's as my default browser and I have never seen this before on any browser. There were an few short periods in the last few months when Firefox would just lock up my pc, and I switched  browsers to Chrome. But as soon as you corrected the issue, I switched back to Firefox. I got to admit that this Malvertising notification has disturbed me a little. I have Edge, Chrome, and Opera  browsers installed as well but I like you the best.  Please explain to my why I got this notification from Malwarebytes.  BTY, Malwarebytes found a keylogger in my PC that Eset, and Windows Defender scans did not find. So, I am a fan of Malwarebytes as well. I downloaded the Malwarebytes notification of the Malvertising Notification into .txt format, but the button below this says images. If I can send it, and you want it, just let me know. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1260;,firefox,other,en-US,"",TedN91740

The PDF is an odometer statement from the Michigan Secretary of State. I am able to complete all fields except for the 6 separate odometer boxes. I can move the cursor to each box but when I go to type a number, nothing shows up. I have used Firefox in the past while completing this PDF form without any problems. I have tried filling in the odometer boxes using various versions of Windows (7, 8.1, and 10) and various versions of Firefox (126, 115, and 109), but none of them will allow me to enter the numbers. As a test, I downloaded Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome, and both of those browsers allowed me to fill in the odometer boxes. I've included a link to the PDF form.
