Some elements seem to be rendering incorrectly or not displaying at all. I've tested the website on other browsers, and it appears to be working fine there. Could someone help me troubleshoot this problem? Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Additionally, the navigation menu appears to be misaligned, overlapping some of the content on the page. This issue is consistent across multiple pages of the website. Steps Taken to Resolve the Issue: I've tried clearing the browser cache and cookies, as well as testing the website on different devices and networks to rule out any local issues. However, the problem persists only on Mozilla Firefox. Browser Version: Mozilla Firefox version 98.0.1 (64-bit) Screenshots or Error Messages: Attached below are screenshots illustrating the rendering issues encountered on Mozilla Firefox. Additionally, there are no specific error messages displayed; the elements simply fail to load or display incorrectly. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1644098;,Terry452342
