Even said give it a try on a option block. Then it displayed a form with blanks to enter name etc.  However I wasn't able to enter name or data in the fields they sent me for trying it out.  I could do other things with PDF FF displayed, draw, add text box, but not enter data on the form they sent to try it out.   Wish I had saved the PDF they sent to show the new feature. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1240;firefox-12401;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",diverjer

So once I'm into a game or web site, it's taking over half of my memory (showing like 11 firefox windows open). I can't play any of my games, even minecraft (which is odd). This didn't happen til this last update. Right now I'm stuck at home mending a broken hand, so I kinda need my browser games where I only use my mouse. If there's an easy fix, I'd really like some help in fixing this issue please.
