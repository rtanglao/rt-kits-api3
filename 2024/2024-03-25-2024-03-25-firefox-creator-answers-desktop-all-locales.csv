So once I'm into a game or web site, it's taking over half of my memory (showing like 11 firefox windows open). I can't play any of my games, even minecraft (which is odd). This didn't happen til this last update. Right now I'm stuck at home mending a broken hand, so I kinda need my browser games where I only use my mouse. If there's an easy fix, I'd really like some help in fixing this issue please. Thank you, Lisa Pearson </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1240;firefox-12401;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",collectingdust

There seems to be no solution option in firefox settings to adjust the screen size. The View tab does not help because it just offers zooming of the data on the screen, not the actual size of the screen. </p><p>I am going to use Chrome and/or MS Edge until this screen size issue is resolve by firefox, and I may not come back to using firefox any more - including cancelling my subscription to Mozilla VPN. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1240;firefox-12401;,firefox,other,en-US,1644001;1644016;,chezmich
