Every so often I did a manual sync too. I also imported into Edge occasionally and I noticed a few sites' details there that I had deleted from FF.  Strange! Anyway, I finished the tidy up and went to my Android phone (set up to sync) and did the sync there and it looked OK.  I then had the idea to look here for the 'extra' one I had seen in Edge and sure enough it was there!  I also noticed lots of others I had deleted from the 'Master'.  Changes to passwords had been replicated successfully though. What is the logic for syncing in these instances? I then signed out of FF on the phone to stop the sync and deleted one that was common to both and then signed back in and synced - it did delete it from the PC when I synced that.  This makes me nervous to delete them all from the phone when signed out and syncing upon re-connect. So, what is the safe way to make the password details from the PC be an exact copy on the phone - no extras?! My thoughts were to disconnect the phone (but hoped it would remove things), delete the details manually if required, sign back in and re-sync.  But I don't want to risk the sync actually wiping out the contents of the PC! Thanks! TL;DR - how can I safely remove the synced contents from one device and then resync it.  Currently, the contents across devices is different after a sync. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1240;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",SJW211

I researched how to get the Search Engine back but nothing worked. I thought System Restore would solve the problem. Now I can't restore my previous Firefox session. And I can't find a sessionstore.jsonlz4 file. I read you have to rename a file in sessionstore-backups folder to sessionstore.jsonlz4 but I don't know which file to rename. I also read you can restore a recent upgrade.jsonlz4 but that is dated 3/5/24. I loaded previous.jsonlz4 file using the Scrounger tool but that didn't restore the session I had. (The previous.jsonlz4 file is dated 3/22/24 about 45 minutes ago.) I want to restore the session I was using earlier in the day. And ""Restore Session"" option has disappeared from the Firefox History dropdown menu. I tried the ""Restore Firefox"" option but that didn't help anything and it made my dropdown menus disappear. I have no idea how to get the session back that I was using earlier in the day. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1240;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",rjc7394
