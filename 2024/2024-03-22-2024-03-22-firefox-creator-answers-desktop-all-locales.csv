I researched how to get the Search Engine back but nothing worked. I thought System Restore would solve the problem. Now I can't restore my previous Firefox session. And I can't find a sessionstore.jsonlz4 file. I read you have to rename a file in sessionstore-backups folder to sessionstore.jsonlz4 but I don't know which file to rename. I also read you can restore a recent upgrade.jsonlz4 but that is dated 3/5/24. I loaded previous.jsonlz4 file using the Scrounger tool but that didn't restore the session I had. (The previous.jsonlz4 file is dated 3/22/24 about 45 minutes ago.) I want to restore the session I was using earlier in the day. And ""Restore Session"" option has disappeared from the Firefox History dropdown menu. I tried the ""Restore Firefox"" option but that didn't help anything and it made my dropdown menus disappear. I have no idea how to get the session back that I was using earlier in the day. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1240;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",rjc7394
