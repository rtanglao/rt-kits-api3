While the browser does reach the next video in the playlist once the previous one ended, more often that not, the video won't play. As I said, the behavior is unpredictable. There are times when it'll work right of the bat, but stop working after a few videos, and there are times when it won't be working at all from the very beginning.  </p><p>I did enable FF's autoplay setting (or so it would seem from what I can see), for it says:""Autoplay: Allow audio and video"" when I click on the icon next to URL bar.  </p><p>I have not yet tested with my addblocker disabled, for ublock origin being fairly widely used I assumed I would have ran into far more issues akin to mine when I googled my issue.  </p><p>Thanks in advance for your help.  </p><p>Cordially, </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1240;,firefox,other,en-US,1643497;,facorreg

Still works on other programs though. I made sure the speakers are on, restarted the browser, computer checked the setting to allow audio. Everything in your help guide but it still won't work. Though sometimes the audio will play with headphones and sometimes not. Any ideas of what else I can do? I like the browser but with no audio, I can't really use it. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",captaindouchebag82

Thing IS - it's left my Outlook/Hotmail E_mail page in Russian - and I can't select 'change to English' because all the sub-menus are in Russian and I don't know what to click on!  </p><p>Now when I first load up the page, I get a lovely-looking little box 'Firefox has detected this page is in Russian, would you like to translate to English' (or words to that effect, y'know.) But the box appears and disappears so fast I don't have time to click on it.  I managed to get to it a couple of times and it worked perfectly.  But normally it vanishes before I can get there.   </p><p>How do I make the little box stick around longer so I can click on it? Or is the same option hidden in a Firefox menu somewhere - I'm not the world's greatest Internet browser geek, so please keep answers simple! - and I could click on it in a Firefox menu? Like I said - if I GET to it in time, it works like a dream.  It's just GETTING to it fast enough before it vanishes that's the problem!  </p><p>Just ad an 'orrible thought.  I hope that if it's in  a Firefox menu, that's not been turned into Russian too!  </p><p>Yours respectfully </p><p>Chris. </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,tips,en-US,1643488;,ulrichburke

I researched how to get the Search Engine back but nothing worked. I thought System Restore would solve the problem. Now I can't restore my previous Firefox session. And I can't find a sessionstore.jsonlz4 file. I read you have to rename a file in sessionstore-backups folder to sessionstore.jsonlz4 but I don't know which file to rename. I also read you can restore a recent upgrade.jsonlz4 but that is dated 3/5/24. I loaded previous.jsonlz4 file using the Scrounger tool but that didn't restore the session I had. (The previous.jsonlz4 file is dated 3/22/24 about 45 minutes ago.) I want to restore the session I was using earlier in the day. And ""Restore Session"" option has disappeared from the Firefox History dropdown menu. I tried the ""Restore Firefox"" option but that didn't help anything and it made my dropdown menus disappear. I have no idea how to get the session back that I was using earlier in the day. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1240;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",rjc7394
