When I close tabs but later restart the browser or come out of ""sleep"" - they are repoened. I'm not talking about the ones I left open. I closed them and they don't stay that way. They insert themselves into their original positions as if I had told them to reopen, and accumulate.

In the profile folder, the recovery and previous files in the sessionstore-backups have been deleted. I tried to recover them using shadow explorer, but these files are corrupted, so I've had no success reading them. Is there a way to fix the corrupted files? Alternatively, because I've had sync enabled for open tabs, is there a log for past open tab synchronizations? If this was stored on the cloud, it may be possible to retrieve that table and restore the list of open tabs that way? </p>",firefox-13303;firefox-1330;firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,1695796;1695801;1695815;,Darkmight11

Thank you. Also FYI, I indicated that I was continuing to use Firefox V 94.0.1 (64-bit) on Windows 7 Professional. This is because all versions later than 94.0.1 modified settings which had to be reset after an update. This was not necessary up to and including V 94.0.1 Cheers Graham Garden </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,1695786;1695791;,grahamgarden
