This is happening on all 3 of my computers. </p><p>The weird thing is that when I use Chrome, open the web app and click the ""My Account"" box on all 3 computers, Dashlane works perfectly.

For example, when I set a date on a website it automatically changes to something other than what I set it to.  Sometimes it's off by a day, sometimes it's off by a dozen days.  Sometimes when the site displays a calendar navigator (showing the year and a monthly calendar where you can cycle through the year and month to select a specific day on the calendar) there's no calendar to select from.  There might be a year and month selector that I can cycle through but there's no calendar to make a selection.  If there is a calendar and I select a date, a different date is displayed in the entry box.  This also happens when I manually enter a date.  I could type 3/8/2024 and when I hit tab or click off the box it will change to 3/6/2024 or something like that.  It's not always the same number of days off.  I could then enter 3/10/2024 to try to trick it, but it might display 3/9/2024.  The issue seems to extend behind the scenes.  For example if I'm paying a bill online the site will automatically show today's date as the day the payment should be made, and it will display correctly, but when I submit my payment an error indicates that the payment date occurs in the past.  I have to change the date to a day or two in the future in order for the site to process the payment.  I recently noticed in my Geico Timeline, where I can see a history of events, as I scroll, the dates will flicker to a day prior and sometimes they will stay on the day prior until I scroll again and it changes back.  Only the day number changes, the time and year remain the same, and it's always to one day prior. </p><p>I've run Malware Bytes, Spybot S&amp;D, and Windows virus scan.

Also, when I navigate to a new page my bookmark tool bar at the top disappears. I only have the bookmark tool bar on my home page. I want it to show on every tab I open so I can easily navigate from there rather than having to go back to my home page every time. This problem started when I got a new computer. The browser works fine on my old computer. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1230;firefox-12301;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1641042;,beestung
