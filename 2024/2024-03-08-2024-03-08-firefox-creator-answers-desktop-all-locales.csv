Our last step is to see if it will copy the drive and makeup a backup of the C drive and still keep the files.  If not then I have lost my Lenovo bookmarks.  </p><p>I am on my old HP Desktop and the bookmarks are older on that one as I have used the Lenovo for the last two years. </p><p>Both the Lenovo and the HP have the Sync option on.  The last time the Lenovo was Synced was Feb 24 I think it was.  I thought we could sync the Lenovo to the HP but that doesn't work. We have enough copies of the data from the HP and can reinstall those if need be.   </p><p>We took FF off the computer and reinstalled like it was a new machine and was looking to see if we would sync with the Lenovo, but somehow it synced with some version and pulled up the Old HP info. </p><p>Questions: 1 - Is the anyway to find the file in the CMD Notepad version when you can't get a search or look for hidden files option. 2 - Is there any way to get the accounts to sync with the Lenovo if there is even a backup?   3 - Any other help or suggestions would be helpful! </p><p>Thank you sooo much!! </p><p>Steve </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1230;firefox-12301;,firefox,sync,en-US,1641043;,steve.truels

Also, when I navigate to a new page my bookmark tool bar at the top disappears. I only have the bookmark tool bar on my home page. I want it to show on every tab I open so I can easily navigate from there rather than having to go back to my home page every time. This problem started when I got a new computer. The browser works fine on my old computer. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1230;firefox-12301;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1641042;,beestung
