Once it has loaded, whenever I pause it for more than a few seconds, or if I try to skip around the video (either by clicking around in the loaded section of the progress bar or using +/- seconds buttons), the video begins buffering again before the video resumes. This makes it extremely difficult and frustrating to watch anything that requires me to pause, rewind, or fast forward. I've noticed this issue affect multiple video viewing sites, such as YouTube, Vimeo, and Netflix. My roommate also uses Firefox, but doesn't have this issue, so I know it's not a problem with my internet. I thought it might be a problem with my computer, but I tried to replicate the issue in Chrome and everything worked fine there. The issue has persisted almost a week. I have: </p> <ul><li> Rebooted my computer several times </li><li> Deleted my history/cache </li><li> Disabled my extensions </li><li> Turned off Java scripts in firefox (this disabled my ability to load sites like YouTube completely, so I turned it back on) </li><li> Updated my computer </li><li> Updated my graphics drivers </li><li> Refreshed firefox </li><li> Uninstalled and reinstalled firefox (and rebooted my computer) </li><li> Uninstalled and reinstalled firefox AND deleted all the data it stored on my computer (and rebooted my computer) </li></ul> <p>I am currently using version 123.0.1 of Firefox.

I've tried everything short of a drive wipe and OS reinstall; I've tried making a new profile, disabling extensions, disabling hardware acceleration, the troubleshoot mode, and even a complete wipe and reinstall of both Firefox and FL Studio. Nothing has worked. </p><p>​Has anyone else had that issue and hopefully been able to fix it? Or does anyone know any way to alleviate this? Thank you! </p><p>​I'm using Windows 11 Pro on a Framework 13 with an AMD 7840U with all the latest updates and drivers, and can provide specifics if needed. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1230;firefox-12301;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",tawmi
