For example, when I set a date on a website it automatically changes to something other than what I set it to.  Sometimes it's off by a day, sometimes it's off by a dozen days.  Sometimes when the site displays a calendar navigator (showing the year and a monthly calendar where you can cycle through the year and month to select a specific day on the calendar) there's no calendar to select from.  There might be a year and month selector that I can cycle through but there's no calendar to make a selection.  If there is a calendar and I select a date, a different date is displayed in the entry box.  This also happens when I manually enter a date.  I could type 3/8/2024 and when I hit tab or click off the box it will change to 3/6/2024 or something like that.  It's not always the same number of days off.  I could then enter 3/10/2024 to try to trick it, but it might display 3/9/2024.  The issue seems to extend behind the scenes.  For example if I'm paying a bill online the site will automatically show today's date as the day the payment should be made, and it will display correctly, but when I submit my payment an error indicates that the payment date occurs in the past.  I have to change the date to a day or two in the future in order for the site to process the payment.  I recently noticed in my Geico Timeline, where I can see a history of events, as I scroll, the dates will flicker to a day prior and sometimes they will stay on the day prior until I scroll again and it changes back.  Only the day number changes, the time and year remain the same, and it's always to one day prior. </p><p>I've run Malware Bytes, Spybot S&amp;D, and Windows virus scan.

Once it has loaded, whenever I pause it for more than a few seconds, or if I try to skip around the video (either by clicking around in the loaded section of the progress bar or using +/- seconds buttons), the video begins buffering again before the video resumes.
