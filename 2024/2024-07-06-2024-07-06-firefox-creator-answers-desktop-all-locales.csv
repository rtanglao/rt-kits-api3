1451586,2024-07-05 20:25:33 -0700,2024-07-05 20:25:33 -0700,Apple TV+,"<p>I was in the middle of watching the Phillies and the Braves play on Apple TV+ 7/5/24. While watching the game, the screen flashed a message I couldn't catch and that was the end of viewing Apple TV+. From that moment on all that was displayed was the original promotional page (attached) that seemed to have all it's links disabled. After playing with it for awhile with no success I switched to Chrome and the streaming ran okay. I then reinstalled a clean Firefox but I still have the same issue. A dead Apple TV+. I am baffled by this. Need help. Please see attachment. I am running Windows 11 </p><p>Regards, ctg </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",precertguy
