However, both websites usually open when I try for the second time.  This never happened before. For both sites I log on from Windows 10 desktop icons.  This defect is now annoying me so much I am inclined to switch to Chrome or Microsoft Edge as default browsers where the problems do not occur.  I have tried a number of suggested solutions shown on line but nothing has worked to date. Before I switch default browser I will try further suggested solutions if anyone has any. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",grtate

I have Firefox on all my devices (Android phone, iPad, PC, work laptop and a laptop in a cabin) and while I'm browsing, I do send tabs to other devices a lot, because it's a cool stuff to checkout, but not in the moment, or not in that context: news articles or blog posts discovered on the couch but relevant to work, some items I see in the shop but I want to check dimensions prior to buying, some cool idea to check out while at the cabin, etc. My day-to-day browsing experience relies heavily on that feature.  </p><p>My issue is that one of the device (laptop in the cabin) is used only randomly, with sometimes weeks between it's turned on again. And after around 2 weeks, that entry disappears from the possible devices I can send the tab too. I do understand where it comes from, as it allows keeping a clean and meaningful list, I can live with that, no worries. </p><p>But is there a way to ""keep alive"" a device beyond these two weeks? At the minimum, something on the mozilla account's device list, like a ""confirm still relevant"" button next to the ""sign out"" one. </p><p>Thanks Dietmar </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",dietmar.descamps

When I clicked on the icon, it reopened, with all my bookmarks and history, but no tabs! I stupidly shut it down again. The forums all said to just go to History &gt; Restore Previous Session, only there was no such option in History. I tried to do a Windows System Restore to several days ago, but it keeps failing and suggesting that I turn off my anti-virus, which I have. Further reading in the Mozilla forums said to take an old upgrade.jsonlz4-20240618110440 (or whatever date) file from the sessionstore-backups folder and move it into the main profile folder and rename it sessionstore.jsonlz4 (I can no longer use the recovery.jsonlz or previous.jsonlz files because I'd stupidly shut down Firefox after it had loaded with no tabs). I have done this and restarted Firefox, but still get no tabs. That file is huge (22MB) and I've examined its contents and can verify that the tabs are there. So why isn't Firefox reading it when I run it and displaying my tabs? I did see that other people on the forums had this problem but I didn't see a solution. One remote possibility may be that my current version is 127.0.2 (64-bit), while the upgrade.jzonlz... file was clearly generated as a snapshot of when the version was 127.0.1. What can I do to restore my tabs, in light of the fact that I don't have a recovery.jsonlz or previous.jsonlz file with the tabs any more and Windows System Restore is unable to restore my system to several days ago? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1660536;1660570;1660575;,summit_ca
