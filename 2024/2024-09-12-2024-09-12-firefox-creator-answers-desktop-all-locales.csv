I turned it back on again. It told me it could not restore the tabs, so I started a new session. Firefox behaved normally, went to the sites I asked, and in approximately two minutes, did the same thing.  Simply closed as if I had closed it.  Turn it back on. It says it cannot restore previous tabs.  It will come on, go to requested site, operate normally for a very short time, then close without warning. Made sure I had the latest version of Firefox. I do. Have tried hard restart, turn computer off, turn it back on. Same.  Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox. Behaves the same on reinstall. Says it cannot restore tabs. Start new session. Brief period of normal behavior, then all windows close as if turned off.  Does not matter what the site is I go to. </p><p>Please note that I am an older autistic person who is very computer illiterate and is extremely distressed by these events. Please bear with me and please be patient with me. </p>",firefox;windows-10;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",godunderfoot
