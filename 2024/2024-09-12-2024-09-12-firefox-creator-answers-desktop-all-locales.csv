Nie wiem od czego on zależy, ale to mało istotne, najbardziej zależy mi na przywróceniu zakładek. Już raz miałem podobny problem, ale przymknąłem na to oko i zacząłem ustawiać wszystko od nowa i machnąłem ręką na zakładki. Teraz po raz kolejny mam ten sam problem. Włączyłem laptopa (był w uśpieniu), miał już włączoną przeglądarkę i jakieś dwie karty (nic nadzwyczajnego), chciałem jeszcze coś wyszukać otworzyłem więc nową kartę, wpisałem co tam chciałem w pasku wyszukiwania i nic... ładuje się bez końca, włączam kolejną kartę i to samo po wpisaniu czegoś innego. Wróciłem na te pierwsze dwie karty otworzone już wcześniej, one działały normalnie. Więc sobie pomyślałem że jak wyłączę przeglądarkę i włączę ponownie to zadziała... Nic bardziej mylnego. Wyłączyłem, i klikam tam gdzie zawsze włączam żeby ją uruchomić. Wyskakuje błąd że skrót jest w innym miejscu czy coś takiego. Na pulpicie jest jakby plik podpisany jako Firefox ale bez ikonki (jest tylko ikona pustej kartki), na pasku zadań już ikonka była ale błąd ten sam. Wpisałem więc w pasku zadań Firefox wyskoczył mi instalator, zainstalowałem ponownie, i przeglądarka w tym momencie działa ale nie mam wcześniejszych zakładek. Zalogowałem się na konto Firefox ale przywróciło mi jakieś bardzo stare zakładki (nie te co miałem ostatnio). Proszę o pomoc w przywróceniu tych zakładek które miałem jeszcze kilka godzin temu, oraz ewentualnie o wyjaśnienie przyczyny takiego problemu.<strong>bold text</strong> </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,1674166;1674167;,kacper.tokarz01

I do. Have tried hard restart, turn computer off, turn it back on. Same.  Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox. Behaves the same on reinstall. Says it cannot restore tabs.
