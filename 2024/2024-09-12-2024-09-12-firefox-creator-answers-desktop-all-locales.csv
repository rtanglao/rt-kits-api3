It says it cannot restore previous tabs.  It will come on, go to requested site, operate normally for a very short time, then close without warning. Made sure I had the latest version of Firefox. I do. Have tried hard restart, turn computer off, turn it back on. Same.  Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox. Behaves the same on reinstall. Says it cannot restore tabs. Start new session. Brief period of normal behavior, then all windows close as if turned off.
