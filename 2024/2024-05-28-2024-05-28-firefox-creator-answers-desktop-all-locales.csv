Each new tab opens as blank,  bookmark icons are missing. I used to have a search engine when i opened Mozilla but now it's totally blank. I need to click on the bookmarks icon to open the list of bookmarks saved instead of seeing them on the toolbar. I didn't change anything and now it's all gone.

I try to refresh the page, but the refresh 'circle' is greyed out and doesn't work. Then it's as if my mouse pointer is broken; I can't click on anything. Everything works fine in EDGE and other browsers. This seems to have happened after the last Firefox update. I have cleared my cache and data, and refreshed Firefox. So far, no good. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-11;firefox-1260;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",Hebegb2
