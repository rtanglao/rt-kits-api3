I am desperately trying to manage my social media addiction and to help support that I am wondering if its possible to disable the privacy window. I know I can install a website blocker - which I have, but it does not apply to the private window so I have full access to social media on it, I just have to log in. I want to COMPLETELY block Facebook and Instagram off of my laptop. Is this possible? Thank you! </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1260;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",anya.cherepanova131018

I never in my life thought an internet browser displaying the forums for the browser would require so many processes. </p><p>Am I the only one? I have a pretty basic experience going on here but this is causing such a struggle I might need to find a new browser. I just don't understand how this even gets to be this way. </p><p>I am very grateful for a couple of advantages this browser occasionally showcases and I really don't want to migrate to another browser across my devices.  All of the options I have read in this forum are pretty much disabled by the updates to Firefox but I am willing to try just about anything within reason that won't be quickly screwed up by another update. </p><p>My apologies if I sound frustrated, but come on that's a lot of processes to show your support page and it's eating up so many resources that could be used to trouble shoot my projects in a timely manner. This impacts performance to the point that I can't watch a tutorial with nothing else going on while working with GDevelop. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1260;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1654765;,honorable1

I try to refresh the page, but the refresh 'circle' is greyed out and doesn't work. Then it's as if my mouse pointer is broken; I can't click on anything. Everything works fine in EDGE and other browsers. This seems to have happened after the last Firefox update. I have cleared my cache and data, and refreshed Firefox.
