I am desperately trying to manage my social media addiction and to help support that I am wondering if its possible to disable the privacy window. I know I can install a website blocker - which I have, but it does not apply to the private window so I have full access to social media on it, I just have to log in. I want to COMPLETELY block Facebook and Instagram off of my laptop. Is this possible?
