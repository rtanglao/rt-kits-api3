I am desperately trying to manage my social media addiction and to help support that I am wondering if its possible to disable the privacy window. I know I can install a website blocker - which I have, but it does not apply to the private window so I have full access to social media on it, I just have to log in. I want to COMPLETELY block Facebook and Instagram off of my laptop. Is this possible?

I have a pretty basic experience going on here but this is causing such a struggle I might need to find a new browser. I just don't understand how this even gets to be this way. </p><p>I am very grateful for a couple of advantages this browser occasionally showcases and I really don't want to migrate to another browser across my devices.  All of the options I have read in this forum are pretty much disabled by the updates to Firefox but I am willing to try just about anything within reason that won't be quickly screwed up by another update. </p><p>My apologies if I sound frustrated, but come on that's a lot of processes to show your support page and it's eating up so many resources that could be used to trouble shoot my projects in a timely manner.
