While the majority of applications under the Test Pilot project are essentially plugins for the main Firefox browser, Send is a standalone service, that can be accessed via any browser. It works on a web interface and allows the user to easily upload any file to Mozilla’s servers and then download it to the other device with the help of a shareable link. What’s more is that Mozilla offers great privacy due to the encryption of the data being transmitted.

You’ve been playing around with what was a good and functional printer interface to one that is now a pice of junk!  I have been using Mozilla since it was Netscape 2.0 </p><p>I am running firefox Ver 115.3.1 esr 64 bit on a Dell Desktop running Win 7.  In the past I go to a print preview and see how the print out would look on the page.  I could also control, my printer functions, like color or black and white, and the quality of the printout. </p><p>Today my wife (not real computer savy) started printing several PDF files for compilation into a book/user help package.  After she had printed out several articles and well over 20 pages she mentioned to me that the printer wasn’t printing correctly.  I asked her what she ment.  She showed me.  She was printing double sided (to conserve paper).  After she went to the printer and looked at the printout they were all wrong.  The front side was fine, but the back side was upside down.  So when she would put them in a binder, should could the 1st page fine, then flip the page, and you’d have to turn the binder over to read the 2nd page, then turn the binder around again to read the 3rd page. </p><p>This isn’t my idea of double sided.  It would be fine if I was using a flip chart but not in a binder.  So now I’m sitting on over 20 pages of scrap, not to mention how much ink I wasted at about $50/Black cartridge. </p><p>I sit down and try to see what she’d done.  So I bring up a document, and want to print ONLY page 1 &amp; 2 doublesided so I limit my waste of paper and ink.  Sure enough it prints the backside upside down.  So I change from flipping long side to flipping short side and try again.  Same problem, 2nd page is upside down.  I also notice that there is NO print preview, and I can no longer have access to “Printing Preferences” which allow me to change from black &amp; white to color and vise versa, set the quality of the printout.  All I can control is Black &amp; White vs. Color, what pages I want to print and portrait &amp; landscape. </p><p>I go over to my other desktop running Win 11 and Firefox V 119.0 (64 bit) and try printing double sided.  It gives me the same options as Ver 115.3.1 esr 64 bit, AND it gives me a preview screen.  So I select double sided printing and it prints the 2nd page upside down.  UNSAT! </p><p>I’m in this fix because sometime in the past I did an update and you had changed the printer interface.  I don’t know when it was changed, maybe before COVID.  But it sure hasn’t helped me.  So far I’m out over 20 pages of paper, don’t know how much printer ink, and over 3 hours in trying to figure out what’s giong on, then trying to get help, and then having you web sit drop the page I was working on so I lost this posting.  Then I got smart and did it in my word processor.  All in all a really frustrating day!! </p><p>Hope someone has some ideas. </p><p>JohnT   jblair1948@cox.net </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1190;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jblair1948

I'm like a developer nowadays so I thought I would introduce my ideas to a group that may be able to let me skip to the front of the line of coding class de italiano y espanol y chinese y japanese that I'm concurrently doing for the Discord shadow hacking community. I work IRL as a medic/nurse/medical professional with some veterans. I've been hitting the books about coding for about 4 years straight without emergency relief for bunk, deprecated boiler plate code. </p><p>To get to the point, I'm not an Apple genius, I'm a literal genius, but I got dis sweet little Macintosh so I figure i should use it for something other than my girlfriend. I have great ideas about what to do with the global fiscal markets and I want to test my chops writing either a Python or Javascript Macintosh bot to read the stocks in ~5 second intervals for arbitrage points during trade floor shenanigans, buy into the market with a bank, and sell them just as quickly to maximize profits; all autonomously and independently running on one of my computers that could serve as a retirement plan if I can do the maths well enough to catch a record breaking jump to trade some floor minimums and make a fairly strong return, on the order of a trade every 6 months of market reading. </p><p>That brings me to the point finally. Even if I can do it in Python or Javascript, I could also work with your developer tools to do something similar on Firefox. Is it possible to get an add on that will scrape a crypto stock exchange website and write the prices to an Open Office spreadsheet to collect some data for the project? I've been drowning in deprecation hell for sometime and I don't know where to start to look into your company's capabilities in this sphere. I don't want a pre-built add-on unless I can peak under the hood and play with the stock data. I would be interested in networking with your coding ninjas if they are interested. I have a non-offensive Discord server that we could chat in if anybody wants a face to face. I've been working in Discord as my own CEO of cLuStErFLuX LLC, est 2022 (1985). I went and got an EIN for my engineering work a couple years back and I have been unemployed for about 4 working my ass off writing books, music, various code, and my own personal clinical study. All while getting fiscally reamed by the local economy. Hence the reason I am finding myself cashing in the computer studies to make a robot that I can live off of the profits.  </p><p>Thanks for the very weird online experiences, your browser is real nice and privacy oriented.
