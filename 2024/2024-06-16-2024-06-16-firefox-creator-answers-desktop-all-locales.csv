I'm like a developer nowadays so I thought I would introduce my ideas to a group that may be able to let me skip to the front of the line of coding class de italiano y espanol y chinese y japanese that I'm concurrently doing for the Discord shadow hacking community. I work IRL as a medic/nurse/medical professional with some veterans. I've been hitting the books about coding for about 4 years straight without emergency relief for bunk, deprecated boiler plate code. </p><p>To get to the point, I'm not an Apple genius, I'm a literal genius, but I got dis sweet little Macintosh so I figure i should use it for something other than my girlfriend. I have great ideas about what to do with the global fiscal markets and I want to test my chops writing either a Python or Javascript Macintosh bot to read the stocks in ~5 second intervals for arbitrage points during trade floor shenanigans, buy into the market with a bank, and sell them just as quickly to maximize profits; all autonomously and independently running on one of my computers that could serve as a retirement plan if I can do the maths well enough to catch a record breaking jump to trade some floor minimums and make a fairly strong return, on the order of a trade every 6 months of market reading. </p><p>That brings me to the point finally. Even if I can do it in Python or Javascript, I could also work with your developer tools to do something similar on Firefox. Is it possible to get an add on that will scrape a crypto stock exchange website and write the prices to an Open Office spreadsheet to collect some data for the project? I've been drowning in deprecation hell for sometime and I don't know where to start to look into your company's capabilities in this sphere. I don't want a pre-built add-on unless I can peak under the hood and play with the stock data. I would be interested in networking with your coding ninjas if they are interested. I have a non-offensive Discord server that we could chat in if anybody wants a face to face. I've been working in Discord as my own CEO of cLuStErFLuX LLC, est 2022 (1985). I went and got an EIN for my engineering work a couple years back and I have been unemployed for about 4 working my ass off writing books, music, various code, and my own personal clinical study. All while getting fiscally reamed by the local economy. Hence the reason I am finding myself cashing in the computer studies to make a robot that I can live off of the profits.  </p><p>Thanks for the very weird online experiences, your browser is real nice and privacy oriented. I've learned a lot using all sorts of products but your browser is my go to for my internet studies now. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1270;,firefox,other,en-US,"",marblegitcounter
