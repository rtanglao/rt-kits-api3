These elements work perfectly in other browsers like Chrome and Safari. </p><p>Specifically, I've noticed that some JavaScript-based interactive features, like quizzes and drag-and-drop activities, either don't load or don't function as expected. I've already cleared the cache and ensured that Firefox is updated to the latest version, but the problem persists. </p><p>Has anyone else encountered similar issues, or does anyone have suggestions on how to troubleshoot and resolve this compatibility problem? Any insights would be greatly appreciated! </p><p>Thank you, fatemahx </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",Fatemahx

I feel like this problem has only shown up in the last couple months but for some reason, on firefox, when say watching something on youtube and I go to pause or skip around in the video I'll get this very unpleasant distorted digital noise sound very briefly. I've tried turning off and back on hardware acceleration and some other things but no dice. I can hear the distortion on my onboard sound, my usb headset, and hdmi audio through the graphics card so I don't think its my hardware. This distortion also doesn't happen with say MPC/VLC or watching Youtube via Edge or Chrome. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1270;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",snakemanzero

We have a web audio player on the website and recently I noticed it stopped working in Firefox.  Looking closer at the issue, I realized that Enhanced Tracking Protection is blocking one of the scripts (<a href=""http://pdst.fm"" rel=""nofollow"">pdst.fm</a> - Spotify).  Because ETP is turned on by default, I'm hoping there's a way to help bring this part of the site back to functioning without bypassing the Spotify script, as currently that's out of my power.  Any help would be appreciated. </p><p>Thanks very much, Mark Nicola </p>",linux;desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",mark.is.at.a.computer

I'm like a developer nowadays so I thought I would introduce my ideas to a group that may be able to let me skip to the front of the line of coding class de italiano y espanol y chinese y japanese that I'm concurrently doing for the Discord shadow hacking community. I work IRL as a medic/nurse/medical professional with some veterans. I've been hitting the books about coding for about 4 years straight without emergency relief for bunk, deprecated boiler plate code. </p><p>To get to the point, I'm not an Apple genius, I'm a literal genius, but I got dis sweet little Macintosh so I figure i should use it for something other than my girlfriend. I have great ideas about what to do with the global fiscal markets and I want to test my chops writing either a Python or Javascript Macintosh bot to read the stocks in ~5 second intervals for arbitrage points during trade floor shenanigans, buy into the market with a bank, and sell them just as quickly to maximize profits; all autonomously and independently running on one of my computers that could serve as a retirement plan if I can do the maths well enough to catch a record breaking jump to trade some floor minimums and make a fairly strong return, on the order of a trade every 6 months of market reading. </p><p>That brings me to the point finally. Even if I can do it in Python or Javascript, I could also work with your developer tools to do something similar on Firefox. Is it possible to get an add on that will scrape a crypto stock exchange website and write the prices to an Open Office spreadsheet to collect some data for the project? I've been drowning in deprecation hell for sometime and I don't know where to start to look into your company's capabilities in this sphere. I don't want a pre-built add-on unless I can peak under the hood and play with the stock data. I would be interested in networking with your coding ninjas if they are interested. I have a non-offensive Discord server that we could chat in if anybody wants a face to face. I've been working in Discord as my own CEO of cLuStErFLuX LLC, est 2022 (1985). I went and got an EIN for my engineering work a couple years back and I have been unemployed for about 4 working my ass off writing books, music, various code, and my own personal clinical study. All while getting fiscally reamed by the local economy. Hence the reason I am finding myself cashing in the computer studies to make a robot that I can live off of the profits.  </p><p>Thanks for the very weird online experiences, your browser is real nice and privacy oriented. I've learned a lot using all sorts of products but your browser is my go to for my internet studies now. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1270;,firefox,other,en-US,"",marblegitcounter
