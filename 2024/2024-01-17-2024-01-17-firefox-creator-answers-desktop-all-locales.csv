Upon login, Firefox is started automatically in kiosk mode via a customised shortcut placed in all users' Startup folder. </p><p>The problem is that if Firefox crashes, at the next logon it shows a blank dark violet screen and it never gets to load the home page. </p><p>I noticed that if I kill it from Task Manager and I re-launch it from the Start menu in normal mode (not Kiosk), then I am presented with the Restore Session tab - see attached screenshot. </p><p>Clicking any of the options (restore or start new), just to make Firefox open, then closing it gracefully from the top-right X makes the autostart in kiosk mode work as expected. </p><p>I speculate that Firefox just lacks the smarts to ""known"" that in kiosk mode it is restricted from displaying the dialog, thus no user input will arrive ever. </p><p>I am not interested in any previous sessions, I just want Firefox to ignore the previous crash and open the home page. </p><p>I saw that various sources suggest fiddling with the user profile via about:config. This is NOT an option because in VDI I do not save users' profiles, and it should apply to any and all users, regardless which virtual desktop they log into. </p><p>Is there a way to achieve this using Group Policy? </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ekzp

Snoozes tabs go to a bookmark, but what about sent ones? </p><p>The reason I ask is because my Firefox instance, oddly, created itself a new profile one day. I don't know why, I didn't ask it to (as far as I recall), I only noticed because when I wanted to send tabs from my phone to my desktop I noticed I had a new ""so-and-so's Firefox on xyz computer"" appear, then on inspection I realised that my old profile has been mothballed by Firefox. When I loaded up the old profile it no longer had the browser name that I'd previously given it in Firefox Sync settings, and the tabs I'd previously sent to it did not appear. Whilst I'd like to understand why all this happened, it's not critical to my question, I just provide it as background. </p><p>So, where do these tabs go? If they never arrive at their destination then where can I find them again? </p><p>Cheers&nbsp;:) </p>",desktop;beta;sync;windows-10;firefox-1220;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",madb1lly
