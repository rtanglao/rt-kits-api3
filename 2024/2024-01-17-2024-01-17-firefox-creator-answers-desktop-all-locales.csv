Instead, it appears that I deleted everything from the computer, or perhaps moved everything from the computer to the tablet. I'm not sure. How can I tell if everything is on the tablet? Is it possible to move everything back from the tablet to the computer? If so, how? I'm not very computer literate. Guess that's obvious. I'm also older, 77, and visually challenged, so please be patient with me. I'm not even sure where to find this question and any answers people may suggest on this website, so perhaps you could drop me a hint by email at wdentry@yahoo.com? Thanks in advance.
