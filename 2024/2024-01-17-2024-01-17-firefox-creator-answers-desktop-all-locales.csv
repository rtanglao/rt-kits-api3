Nothing particularly stood out about this search and when I was done, I closed the tab. I didn't do anything different. I didn't save a bookmark or change any settings. I just looked at the webpage and then closed it when I was done. (It was a web article on some random tech site, if that matters) </p><p>Anyway, now whenever I open up my Firefox browser there seems to be a <em>random chance</em> that this previously closed tab will open on loading. And when I say random chance, I'd say about 1 in 5 chance. It doesn't always happen. </p><p>Just to be clear: I do have the browser set to restore my previous sessions. This is a setting I want to have on. However, this tab was <strong>not</strong> part of my previous session as I specifically closed it - and continue to close it every time it opens itself. Also, my Homepage is set to default and nothing else.  </p><p>Not only that, but there are two very peculiar details about this case that make it very, very strange: 1. When I originally opened (and closed) this tab, I was using normal Firefox. I have since switched to Firefox Nightly. All of my other tabs that I like to keep open had to be searched and loaded up manually, one by one, after I did the switch. This one tab, however, is just showing up on its own.  2. Opening Firefox on a separate devices (second desktop PC, laptop, android phone) will occasionally load up this tab.  </p><p>I do have my browsers set to sync, which is what I'm assuming is why it's following me around. But I don't understand why nor how to stop this specific page from loading after I keep closing it time and time again. Plus, why aren't any of my old tabs from my old Firefox browser following this same behavior after moving to Nightly? - I've closed hundreds, if not thousands of tabs. Why is this one following me around? </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1631172;,R315r4z0r

They have a facility whereby the delivered cold packs and insulating material can be returned to them via DPD free of charge. To achieve this a form has to be completed on Eversfields site to enable a returns label to be printed. When attempting to complete this form one line of this form will not accept an input. This item is called the “Country” which should read “United Kingdom”. I cannot input this manually or by my password manager “RoboForm” which temporary inputs United Kingdom until I release the mouse button when it goes blank again.  I have tried the Google Chrome and Opera browsers which work perfectly using this system. So logically it would appear that there is a fault with Firefox which is a shame since it is my preferred browser. It would be appreciated if you can provide a solution to this problem.

It sometimes partially and sometimes completely displays all the page content. But all the controls are dead. Firefox seems to be very busy doing something. I told Hostinger and they spent some time looking into the problem. They got Firefox to load the h-panel but said that it was vastly slower than other browsers in doing so. With me, Firefox still stops doing anything once the content is loaded and ALL controls on the page are still dead. When closing Firefox in this state, there is considerable delay before the window actually closes. </p><p>I thought that perhaps Hostinger had done an update that called in some proprietary JavaScript extensions that Firefox couldn't handle. I get the impression that in trying to display the h-panel pages, Firefox is trying to acquire some content from an external site, as requested somewhere within the HTML/JavaScript source code. </p><p>Any ideas? robert_john.morton@yahoo.com </p>",linux;desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",robert_john.morton

When I loaded up the old profile it no longer had the browser name that I'd previously given it in Firefox Sync settings, and the tabs I'd previously sent to it did not appear. Whilst I'd like to understand why all this happened, it's not critical to my question, I just provide it as background. </p><p>So, where do these tabs go?

Instead, it appears that I deleted everything from the computer, or perhaps moved everything from the computer to the tablet. I'm not sure. How can I tell if everything is on the tablet? Is it possible to move everything back from the tablet to the computer? If so, how? I'm not very computer literate. Guess that's obvious. I'm also older, 77, and visually challenged, so please be patient with me. I'm not even sure where to find this question and any answers people may suggest on this website, so perhaps you could drop me a hint by email at wdentry@yahoo.com? Thanks in advance.
