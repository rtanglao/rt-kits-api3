It appears that approximately every one second plays its frames in reverse order. This occurs with most video streaming services and major sites. For example, all Amazon, Sam's Club, Walmart and other website product videos. Occasionally, Amazon product videos just say not compatible. However, YouTube videos with very rare excepts play fine in Firefox. Those problem sites play the videos fine under Edge for Linux. But, I would much rather use Firefox. I'm sure this a codec related issue. Possibly related to the NVIDIA GeForce GT 1030 video card in this computer running openSUSE 15.5.
