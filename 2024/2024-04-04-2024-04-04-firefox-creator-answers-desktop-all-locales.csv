Earlier today on the Messenger side, after reopening the Messenger tab after it crashes, it crashed again. It doesn't occur on other websites and the app doesn't crash, only the tab. </p><p>Using Firefox on ""troubleshoot mode"" doesn't have an issue when accessing when I visit those for a few minutes and with only one or two tabs open, and I'm afraid of visiting these sites for a while because it may crash again. Occurs on <strong>both Windows and Mac</strong>. </p><p>Crashed signature leads to: ""js::gc::AllocSite::incTenuredCount"", and I have no idea what does it mean. For my Mac the reason for the crash is ""EXC_BAD_ACCESS / KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE"", while for Windows, reason is ""EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION_READ"".  </p><p>Heres from my Mac: bp-b882a473-a8a5-496f-8a14-d9d190240403 </p><p>I will add additional crash IDs from my Windows. Idk what is the problem currently, is it with the add-ons installed, Facebook, or Firefox itself? The RAM is fine. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",matthewjosephfopalan
