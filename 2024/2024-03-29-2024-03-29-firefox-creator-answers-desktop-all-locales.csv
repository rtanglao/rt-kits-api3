Ever since Firefox 124, these pop-out windows include the tool bar and bookmarks bar, eating up a bunch of space. I do want those bars displayed on my main firefox window, I don't want them displayed on the pop-up Gmail compose windows. Is there anyway to get Firefox revert back to this old behavior? </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1240;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",rhinoscope

If I right-click to download an image, or click a link to download a PDF or other file, or Save HTML, I see the ""Save file"" dialog, click Save and then Firefox freezes up for a while, maybe a minute or two.

Chromium is not affected, Thunderbird is fine, and all other software continues to be fine as before, including when saving files. Only FF has this problem. </p><p>What is the problem and solution?
