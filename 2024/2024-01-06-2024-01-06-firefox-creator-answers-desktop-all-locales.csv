I currently only use 5 of them, meaning there are 3 empty boxes left over. I don't want to have them show history, or recommended websites, or anything of the sort that might distract me; the shortcuts should only be those I actually intend to use, of which there are only 5. To my knowledge, the only easy way to add/remove shortcuts is to adjust the number of visible rows, but this only allows modifications based on multiples of the original 8. Like in Chrome, can I actually <em>remove</em> any excess shortcut boxes I don't want to use? I feel this is a very basic customization I'm sure Firefox should be able to accommodate. </p><p>I've included a screenshot of my FF new tab, where the three empty shortcut boxes I'm referring to can be seen. Thank you in advance for any assistance! </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1210;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",marcialmachado0522
