This has happened in two different windows.  I have no idea how to hide tabs and don't want to.  How can I unhide the tabs.  When I try to do it one by one, the first tab rehides when the 2nd one appears.  Can I unhide multiple tabs at once?  Do I have to unhide them one by one, and if so how?  How do I stop Firefox from hiding tabs? </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1200;firefox-12001;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",mbxls
