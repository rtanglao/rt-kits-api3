Can I enable this somehow? </p><p>(Btw, I know that there is an extension for this specifically for YouTube, but I'm referring to other streaming sites, and just videos in general) </p><p>Any help is appreciated, thanks! </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",gusthesupercoolseal
