It is the only site that i can't type on and oddly I can type in their support box.  They are offering no help. I have tried clearing history and cache but still no joy.  I'm running the most up to date version on a windows 7 OS it's so strange how it's just those two places i can't type. Any advice would be very welcome. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",paul104

I like to have a video playing in the background as I do other things on my PC but it stutters really badly and is so far behind the audio and it is genuinely infuriating. I have a high-end PC so it should not be an issue. I have Tried all the ""fixes"" I have found, safe mode, hardware acceleration, disabling media.wmf.vp9, nothing works. </p><p>Is there an actual fix for this or is it a case of dealing with it or going back to another browser? </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",5ryan.smith5
