My issue is that Firefox continues to proxy several websites to bring me to my school login, which I no longer can use. I went to the settings feature and changed the proxy from manual to ""no proxy"" however it still takes me to my university login. Is there something else I have to do to stop this redirect from occurring? </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",graceanna1223

Also if I use the search facility I can find the bookmark and when I select it the star appears filled in indicating it really is a bookmark.  SO I have a lot of saved bookmarks but cannot access them.  How can I get the structure back?  Note that recently when I started Firefox it claimed to hae found an error and I had to restart in safe mode and go back to default settings.
