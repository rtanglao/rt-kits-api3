ALT is still working like intended. </p><p>I don't know what triggers this and what makes it go away (it's not permament).

Is this true. When you start up Chrome, it asks you which account you would like to use, and switching between accounts is as simple as a click on your account icon. This feature is invaluable and the only reason i still use Chrome. I keep checking back on Firefox every month or two, just to see if they have done it yet.

Or at least like all others do... Also there is no date for when the entries were created like other browsers also have. In fact there's no other information at all nor is there a link to the site that the passwords are for. I find this very primative compared to other browsers. </p><pre>I'm trying to clean things up in there as far as getting rid of old or duplicate entries because I've had a hard time logging into websites that I normally use because of the confusion with some of the entries. It seems like the old information is just bumped when I update passwords and this also seems like an issue that needs attention. </pre> <pre>I don't experience these issues with either Chrome, Edge, or DDG however they are not quite ready to become my default browser as I've been using Firefox for a very long time compared to those ones and I have most of my saved info for all the sites I use with FF and trying to get any of the others up to where I am with FF would take a lot of work even with an automated import  to one of the others.  </pre> <p>On top of that I'm just more comfortable using FF because of how long I have been. I have some other issues I may have also posted about but it seems that my lack of fluffiness doesn't sit well with the fluffers who seem to respond with comments about how I word things and how much info I include, which is only meant to help someone who actually wants to help rather than critique my post structure and content and I don't understand why they even feel compelled to comment other than to be somewhat offensive with the intent to make it seem as though my posts are offensive. </p><pre>In any sort of real world environment my posts would be totally acceptable and would get answers that were actually answers to my questions rather than rhetoric. If this one becomes more of the same with what I've just said, then possibly it will be time to do what I have to on order to become more familiar with a different browser and make it my default.  </pre> <p>I hope this will not be the case however I feel that I don't get proper support out of the communities and the actual Mozilla FF support seems to have vanished in lieu of this highly opinionated and subjectively oriented group of users, most of which have nothing to do with the development of the browser. I guess we will see... </p>",firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",r.dunne71
