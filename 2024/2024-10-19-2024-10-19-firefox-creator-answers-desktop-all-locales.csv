Before upgradeing, the wordpress blog's plugin, namely 'Vertical News Scroller' pulled up the news' titles by unite 5 in the side bar of the right top. That means news titles including links and short comments move upward slowly in the case of access to the blog, and visitors can see those titles, comments, and move to the real article through the link. </p><p>But now the plugin works not good. 2 or 3 titles moves upward, and then returns abruptly to the first news title, and that behaviour repeats again and agian. I have a doubt about any kinds of bugs in the version 128.3.1-esr or the above version, because in other browsers, for example konqueror (linux browser), the plugin works with no problem like earlier, that is to say, the news titles move up by unite 5. </p><p>I suppose that the plugin's actions work right in another browser(ms explorer, chrome etc). In the case of using other desktop I have no problem with that too. </p><p>So I want to know why this error happens. Does have the latest version of firefox(desktop) have bugs related to this plugin-failure? </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1682578;1682581;,cordiale
