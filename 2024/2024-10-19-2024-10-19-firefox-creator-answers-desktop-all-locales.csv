Before upgradeing, the wordpress blog's plugin, namely 'Vertical News Scroller' pulled up the news' titles by unite 5 in the side bar of the right top. That means news titles including links and short comments move upward slowly in the case of access to the blog, and visitors can see those titles, comments, and move to the real article through the link. </p><p>But now the plugin works not good. 2 or 3 titles moves upward, and then returns abruptly to the first news title, and that behaviour repeats again and agian. I have a doubt about any kinds of bugs in the version 128.3.1-esr or the above version, because in other browsers, for example konqueror (linux browser), the plugin works with no problem like earlier, that is to say, the news titles move up by unite 5. </p><p>I suppose that the plugin's actions work right in another browser(ms explorer, chrome etc). In the case of using other desktop I have no problem with that too. </p><p>So I want to know why this error happens. Does have the latest version of firefox(desktop) have bugs related to this plugin-failure? </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1682578;,cordiale

Custom ettings and extension storage are gone.,"<p>It's a bit weird, I got the thing you get when you migrate to a new browser - asking if you'd like to migrate history and bookmarks. I closed it because I've used firefox for years.  </p><p>When firefox opened proper, I got a tab asking to restore the previous session, along with a ""Welcome to firefox"" tab. As well I got a few popups for other things, basically just stuff you see when you open firefox for the first time. A couple of extensions opened up a landing page that should only open when you first install them. </p><p>All my bookmarks and browser history is there. The settings have all been reset to default. The extensions are there but all of their storage seems to be gone, like my dark reader extension no longer has the exception sites on it. Ublock has the ad count reset and most importantly all my custom rules are gone! I have spent years making hundreds of custom rules, and quite a few took hours to get right. I am sad about losing that. </p><p>Does anyone know what might have happened? </p><p>When I was looking at my about:config to see I saw these things in the modified settings.  </p><p>there's quite a few settings here and IDK which are relevant.
