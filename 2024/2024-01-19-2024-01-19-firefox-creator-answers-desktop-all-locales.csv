Ogni azione porterà la relativa scheda a rimanere bloccata cercando di caricare la pagina successiva. Una volta che ciò accade in una scheda, accadrà per tutte le schede aperte nella stessa finestra, rendendo l'intera sessione di Firefox inutilizzabile.Bisogna dunque chiudere il tutto, riaprire una nuova sessione, ripristinare le schede chiuse di recente e fare da capo quel che si stava facendo. Ad esempio, mi conviene copiare il contenuto di questo messaggio in quanto, no appena proverò ad inviarlo, l'intero sito potrebbe bloccarsi costringendomi a chiuderre la finestra e scrivere tutto da capo. Inutile descrivere quanto limitante questo problema sia, specialmente se ci sono anche altre schede aperte che diventeranno inutilizzabili di conseguenza. Il problema si sta presentando da circa un mese, Firefox dovrebbe già aver rilasciato un paio di aggiornamenti (che ho immediatamente installato) ed io non ho modificato alcuna impostazione in quel periodo. Spero in una risposta e/o soluzione, altrimenti mi troverò costretto a cambiare browser a causa delle limitazioni qui spiegate. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;needsinfo;windows-11;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,fix-problems,it,1631506;,cava98andrea
