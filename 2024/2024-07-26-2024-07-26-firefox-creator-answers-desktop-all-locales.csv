So that other profile never really synced as in it did not grab from the cloud but rather it only upped and with that I guess overwrote everything what I had there? None of my later bookmarks are there, I only have what I had as a physical backup now. Why does sync work so? Not my first fight with sync, but I never lost data like this. </p><p>Kinda wish the sync interface was user-friendlier, where I can see what is overwritten or at least that I can choose to upload or download from sync when I log in.
