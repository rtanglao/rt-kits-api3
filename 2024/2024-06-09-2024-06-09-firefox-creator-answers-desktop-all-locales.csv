The site appears to load correctly on other browsers like Chrome and Edge, but certain elements are not displaying properly on Firefox. </p><p>Website Details: </p><pre>   Main URL: <a href=""https://pokemoninfinitefusions.us"" rel=""nofollow"">Pokémon Infinite Fusion</a>    Specific Pages with Issues:        <a href=""https://pokemoninfinitefusions.us/pokemon-infinite-fusion-sprite-installer/"" rel=""nofollow"">Pokémon Infinite Fusion Sprite Installer</a>        <a href=""https://pokemoninfinitefusions.us/calculator/"" rel=""nofollow"">Pokémon Infinite Fusion Calculator</a> </pre> <p>What I Tried: </p><pre>   CSS and JavaScript Debugging: Checked and validated CSS and JavaScript for compatibility issues.    Browser Cache Clearing: Cleared the cache and cookies in Firefox to ensure it wasn’t a caching issue.    Add-ons Disabled: Ran Firefox in Safe Mode with all add-ons disabled to see if any extensions were causing the issue.    Responsive Design Mode: Used Firefox's Responsive Design Mode to check how the site renders on different screen sizes.    Error Console: Reviewed the Error Console in Firefox to identify any specific errors or warnings. </pre> <p>What I Expected: </p><p>I expected that the website would display consistently across all browsers, including Firefox. </p><p>What Actually Happened: </p><p>Despite my efforts, certain elements on the site, such as images and interactive features, still do not display correctly on Firefox. These issues are not present on other browsers, which suggests a compatibility problem specific to Firefox. </p><p>Questions: </p><pre>   Are there any known compatibility issues between Firefox and certain WordPress themes or plugins that might cause this problem?    Could there be specific CSS or JavaScript practices that work in other browsers but not in Firefox?    Are there additional tools or techniques in Firefox that I can use to diagnose and fix these display issues? </pre> <p>I would appreciate any advice or suggestions on how to resolve these display issues. Ensuring a consistent user experience across all browsers is important for my website. </p><p>Thank you in advance for your assistance! </p><p>Best regards, Saimhbx </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",saimhasan359
