Firefox was using a whopping 5GB of memory on Windows 11. I then looked at about:process and it reported that extensions were using 4GB. I disabled each of my extensions and it still said it was using 4GB of memory. I then uninstalled two of them and re-enabled some extensions and it dropped to 781MB. This is still to much in my opinion, and I want to know how to figure out which extension is being so wasteful. Even a technique on how to figure it out would be appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1220;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1638335;,elijahllopezz
