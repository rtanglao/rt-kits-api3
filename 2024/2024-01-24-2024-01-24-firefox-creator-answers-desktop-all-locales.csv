Is there a way to add this functionality? </p><p>Some additional points: i) Currently, if I highlight a text and right click and search Google for it, the new tab opens in the same container (or no container). I don't want to remove this option, I just want to add the option to be able to do this search in any container I have available. ii) Functionality I want is very similar to how it works when you highlight links, where you have option to open in new tab or open in new container tab you choose. iii) I don't want to assign all my searches to a specific container by forcing ""always open [domain] in [container]"". For example, I already have a Google container, I do not want searches to go to that container by default, I want to be able to choose where they go. Assigning all Google links to a container makes it hard for me to segregate searches from containers where I use other Google services. iv) The way I do this currently is by highlighting text and then opening a new tab in a container and then searching separately, which is inconvenient. v) If this feature doesn't exist, is it possible to request this feature? How would one go about doing that? </p><p>Thank you very much for any help.
