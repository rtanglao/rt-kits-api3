Earlier today it blue screened my laptop. I have never experienced any kind of bluescreens before. Event ID was listed as 2. I was not attempting to open a new tab or had any abnormal tabs open, I was simply clicking back into the browser from another application. The application was the Fortnite launcher, which I doubt would have created serious conflicts with Firefox. Attached to this report is a screenshot of the event on my laptop. My laptop is an OMEN HP gaming laptop. It has an i7 12700H and an RTX 3060 (Laptops). It has 952 gigabytes of storage, 418 used. It has 16 gigabytes of ram. The only applications opened at the time were discord and steam. It is now running fine with no files lost, however I'm reporting this at it may be a deeper issue with Firefox itself as I don't presume I was taking any actions that would have resulted in a blue screen. I don't necessarily need help but this was the only avenue I found to submit a bug report. Apologies if this is clutter to the site and not the proper avenue for this sort of issue. However I felt it was important to report any form of bluescreens as those are rather severe issues. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1210;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",t202732
