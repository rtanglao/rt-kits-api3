Still can’t get login with the privacy mode. But the normal mode works. When I adjust the settings checking “Do not keep history” and “Clear cookies and website data when closing firefox”. It returned.

So from here, I am wondering if there is a way to automate closing the tab after the site is blocked? Am I approaching this from the wrong angle maybe? Any advice appreciated!  I just really don't like microsoft thinking it can open tabs on it's own to advertise a thing I clearly don't want. </p><p>PS if I am posting in the wrong topic, I apologize. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1210;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",MBShade

In Firefox preferences I have made Quant my default browser so why is this so difficult? I vaguely saw a little warning message saying that Mozilla was not allowing this but this warning was hidden and I can't find it again. Firefox guided my to 'pin' Quant to the Firefox toolbar but every time I open a page to search I have to remember to hit the Quant pin. This is absolute nonsense. Please email me back and tell me how I can add Quant to my Firefox so that every time I open Firefox the Quant homepage will just be there. Thank you.

Earlier today it blue screened my laptop. I have never experienced any kind of bluescreens before. Event ID was listed as 2. I was not attempting to open a new tab or had any abnormal tabs open, I was simply clicking back into the browser from another application. The application was the Fortnite launcher, which I doubt would have created serious conflicts with Firefox. Attached to this report is a screenshot of the event on my laptop. My laptop is an OMEN HP gaming laptop. It has an i7 12700H and an RTX 3060 (Laptops). It has 952 gigabytes of storage, 418 used. It has 16 gigabytes of ram. The only applications opened at the time were discord and steam. It is now running fine with no files lost, however I'm reporting this at it may be a deeper issue with Firefox itself as I don't presume I was taking any actions that would have resulted in a blue screen. I don't necessarily need help but this was the only avenue I found to submit a bug report. Apologies if this is clutter to the site and not the proper avenue for this sort of issue. However I felt it was important to report any form of bluescreens as those are rather severe issues. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1210;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",t202732
