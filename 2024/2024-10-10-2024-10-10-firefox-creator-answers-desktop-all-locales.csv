Maybe you've heard about it when you meet a competitor at a party, etc. If you ever choose to use it (a pretty big ""if""), you might install it in your forums. Nah, that ain't likely. But here's the question: How can I get FF to quit closing pages (photos, music, Word docs) when I want to save them?  One of the problems is your FAQs are programmed to read CRASH, when they ""see"" CLOSING PAGES. I know, FAQs are there to make Mozilla more $$$$. They have nothing to do with customer service. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",DBergendorf
