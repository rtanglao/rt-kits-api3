However I have discovered that when viewing product videos on ebay on a laptop/desktop, the videos are significantly reduced in size for 3 or 4 seconds with part of a dialogue box showing and then suddenly increases in size (still not full size though). Very unprofessional looking, very glitchy, very ugly. It would discourage sales rather than encourage them. Please investigate and fix asap.
