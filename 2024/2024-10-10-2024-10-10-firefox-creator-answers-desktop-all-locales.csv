I was getting hundreds of copies of some bookmarks, I ended up having to sign out of sync to allow me to clear them. I now cannot use nightly, every time I try to do anything, like open a new tab, or try to check if my bookmarks have been imported from another browser, which so far they have not, nor resynced from another PC, nightly freezes, and I have to close it. I had to manually reinstall my extensions as they did not resync either. Before doing that, I refreshed nightly, but that didn't seem to have any effect. I still have no bookmarks and a very hesitant browser. </p><pre>   I'm just about to check my other PC running Win 11 and nightly, hopefully that will behave. </pre>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",mick_w

One of the problems is your FAQs are programmed to read CRASH, when they ""see"" CLOSING PAGES. I know, FAQs are there to make Mozilla more $$$$.
