Starting several months ago, first one company, and now several, are failing to resolve their document names into humanly-readable names I would have seen a year ago.  When I talked by phone with a tech from that first company, he blamed it on Firefox falling behind the tech curve.  Not long after that, I read an article saying Firefox was down to 4% user share, and in danger of falling out of the ""must support"" group of browsers.  Now, in these last two months, I'm having that same problem with at least three other companies I download statements from. </p><p>To clarify a little, each institution of course has its own naming scheme.  But before this problem, the name attached to the pdf file that I received was easily understood and I had no problem revising the name to the naming-scheme that I use.  Now, these non-cooperating companies send me files with an 8-12 character code that looks like it may have been a base-32 math number. </p><p>I have NO DESIRE to migrate to any other browser.  But all the other stuff you're talking about means nothing if long-time industry standard processes like these start breaking.  I'm not a 30-year-old semi-geek anymore.  I'm on the far side of 70 and feeling it.  (I've already tried MS Edge, and it gave me fits.) </p><p>PLEASE make sure that Firefox remains a stable and viable browser. </p><p>Sincerely, Tim Deaton tim@timdeaton.org </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",tim0926

I have always used Firefox as my Primary Account therefore, once I have logged into Firefox I then log into my other programs such as <a href=""http://Outlook.Live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.Live.com</a>. Yes, I know that is a MS program. When I say I cannot log into <a href=""http://Firefox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Firefox.com</a> this is what I mean. I click on the Firefox ICON in my task tray and Firefox appears only because I am NOT logged into Firefox. Then I am asked to Download Firefox for my PC. Of course, I know it is already downloaded and depending on the day I will receive a message saying Firefox is already downloaded or it may download it again. No matter my decision, I rarely have an opportunity to log in, unless I use a round-about way of going through Microsoft. Most of the time the application menu does not appear and when it does appear, and if Firefox allows me to use my credentials to log in, then I wait and wait and wait and the only thing that happens is NOTHING. I'm left staring at a blank screen. Since I've always used Firefox as my PRIMARY, after logging into it I then log in or open other programs I use such as <a href=""http://Outlook.Live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.Live.com</a> (yes, I know that is a MS program). After years of using Firefox I have never had to look at a blank screen and when I'm lucky enough to see the log in, I attempt to log into Outlook. But, I haven't seen Outlook in weeks. I have to use a round-about way of logging into Microsoft to log into Outlook, sometimes that works and sometimes it doesn't work. It's as though Microsoft and Firefox have found a way to merge their programming. As you may imagine it takes me over an hour to use the programs I need. '<em>AND, here is the icing on the cake</em>. Mozilla Firefox no longer monitors Trend Micro Security which I have used at least 15 years. At one time, Firefox did monitor TM as an add-on but no longer, and when I checked to see the latest update you were showing, it is obvious you are not keeping up with TM's many updates. I have received some very strange messages from websites I previously log into on a daily basis, such as Grammarly and Pocket and have been redirected to a Microsoft page indicating I owe money, which I DON'T so that was another waste of my time clearing that up. Now, I have gone days without logging into my PC out of sheer frustration.  I don't know what else to do and now I'm not protected with a Security Program although I do update and run it everyday. Yes, I am aware of Microsoft's firewall but I'm not sure how well that is working since my PC is now out-of-date. I suppose I could start a Go Fund Me page to earn enough money to buy a new computer...lol  I desperately need help. BUT, I CANNOT understand your computer talk, I need things explained to me in everyday language. I hope this makes some sense.
