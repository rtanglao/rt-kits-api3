As this concerns all Firefox versions newer than Firefox 95 that has the same requirements concerning Linux system and is functional in my system I have filed a bug report to <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1938497"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1938497</a> Almost immediately I have seen the comment below my report, ""Fedora 20 saw its end of life 114 months ago. Nobody cares about supporting Fedora 20 anymore."" with status RESOLVED WONTFIX that means, ""The problem described is a bug which will never be fixed."" This means that some other requirements exist whence maybe a minimal number of Linux distribution should be noted as required for new Firefox versions to work. For ""older"" Linux users this would save them a lot of time. </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",koz55pl

Porém, tenho consciência de que não gastei os 95 robux em nenhuma compra de skin ou game pass.
