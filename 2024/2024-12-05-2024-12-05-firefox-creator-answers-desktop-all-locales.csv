I grabbed my keyboard and had a menu pop up on the left side and after i closed it noticed my google results had a scroll bar now.  The results page only presents itself on the left half of the screen and a scroll bar has appeared on both the right side, cutting off text, and bottom of the page.  These scroll bars only move a tiny bit and are quite unnecessary, but makes scrolling a pain as I have to be sure I am outside the new scroll bar area as they take precedent from the main scroll bar.  I have googled Firefox's keyboard shortcuts and haven't found the one i need to fix this.  Before I'm asked, no I do not have crazy zoom on and no zooming in does not fix this problem. </p>",firefox;browse;firefox-1330;,firefox,browse,en-US,1692144;,awesomo100

Quiero cambiar la forma en la que aparece el scroll cuando navego, ¡que se ponga pequeño al alejar el cursor y al revés se ve genial!, pero en algunas paginas que ponen botones y demás en la zona donde aparece el scroll lo hace molesto al momento de presionarlo ya que el scroll se hace más grande y no permite hacer clic.
