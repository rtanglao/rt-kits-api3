The combination of the previously 2 mentioned settings will allow hyperlinks and such to work fine, but not on bookmarks. this makes it tedious when I wanna just have something ready in the background. </p>",settings;firefox;firefox-1330;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",Froggy67823

Also missing is the ""arrow"" for clicking tabs rightward (the left ""arrow"" for clicking tabs leftward is still present).  After a Firefox update today, I had hoped it would come back but it is still missing.  I opened ""customize toolbars"" and clicked ""restore defaults"" but the New Tab ""+"" button is not listed as an option!  Is this yet another bug that Mozilla claims is a ""feature"" that no one asked for (like erroneously moving the tabs bar to the top)? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",jdoll021
