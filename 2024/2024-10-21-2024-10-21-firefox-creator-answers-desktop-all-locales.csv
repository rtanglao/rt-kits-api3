So I recall maybe a year or 2 or even 3 ago, i read an update that said Firefox browser supposedly now had option to delete browsing/form etc data with options like ""delete data from 15 min ago, 1hr, 2 days, last 7 days,"" like Chrome has.  I was excited about that, so that i didn't have to keep clearing all the data and places i was signed into after typing in personal info on a site.  BUT to this day,I've still not seen that option.  Did Firefox never actually come out with those options or?? What is the deal? I am on a pc. but i have it on my android phone as well, and don't see those options there either.  What's the deal? Can someone offer some insight on this?  Been using firefox for many years. thanks in advance. </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",assistme

I have reinstalled Firefox on the PC but of course, all my bookmarks and passwords are missing. I had set up syncing between my PC and my Android mobile devices (phone and tablet). Can I restore or sync from the mobile device back to the PC?  I have searched and found nothing.  Even when signed into Firefox on the phone, it does not bring up ""Sync"" when I go to settings.  I truly appreciate  your help. </p>",firefox;windows-11;backup-recovery-and-sync;firefox-1310;firefox-13103;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",s_beecher
