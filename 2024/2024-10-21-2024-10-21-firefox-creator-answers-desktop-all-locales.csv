So I recall maybe a year or 2 or even 3 ago, i read an update that said Firefox browser supposedly now had option to delete browsing/form etc data with options like ""delete data from 15 min ago, 1hr, 2 days, last 7 days,"" like Chrome has.  I was excited about that, so that i didn't have to keep clearing all the data and places i was signed into after typing in personal info on a site.  BUT to this day,I've still not seen that option.  Did Firefox never actually come out with those options or?? What is the deal? I am on a pc. but i have it on my android phone as well, and don't see those options there either.  What's the deal? Can someone offer some insight on this?  Been using firefox for many years. thanks in advance. </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",assistme
