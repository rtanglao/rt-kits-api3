I have reinstalled Firefox on the PC but of course, all my bookmarks and passwords are missing. I had set up syncing between my PC and my Android mobile devices (phone and tablet). Can I restore or sync from the mobile device back to the PC?  I have searched and found nothing.  Even when signed into Firefox on the phone, it does not bring up ""Sync"" when I go to settings.  I truly appreciate  your help. </p>",firefox;windows-11;backup-recovery-and-sync;firefox-1310;firefox-13103;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",s_beecher
