Next, restart Firefox to see if that resolves the issue. If the problem persists, disable other extensions to identify potential conflicts. You can also try starting Firefox in ""Safe Mode"" (without extensions) to check if the extension is causing the issue. Lastly, reinstall the extension or clear Firefox's cache to ensure proper functionality. </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",rassopro

Sometimes i have three or more suggestions that are all wrong but the correct username i used before is not suggested? For local Websites this is nearly never correct and Firefox suggests really strange words that have been used months ago on some other website.  </p><p>What can i do to get the very simple Username to domain matching back? Is there an extension?  </p><p>That behaviour is repeatable. New WIndows Mashine, new Firefox install, a few logins, reboot and visit some of the pages you logged in: wrong suggestions from completely different domains.  </p><p>I added a screenshot where firefox sugests 2 usernames, none of which was ever used on that domain. Even better, the username i use everyday to login is not shown at all.  </p><p>PS: I never ever safe passwords in browser. PPS: This problem exists for every input field, but i kept it at usernames because thats whats everyone using.  PPPS: Dont get me started at form data like addresses. That never works.
