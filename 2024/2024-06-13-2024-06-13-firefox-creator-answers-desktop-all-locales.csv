I'm getting it a lot trying to visit totally legit sites and it's pi$$ing me off. It's not happening in Chrome or Edge but I don't like using those for other reasons. Would like to know what's going on with this crap. It used to be only once in a while and a couple of clicks to other links would get me around it but now it's happening a lot and won't let me get to the intended site at all. Very frustrating! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1270;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",r.dunne71
