In Firefox in Windows, you used to be able to specify where your bookmarks were located.  I store all my files (documents, spreadsheets, etc) in a complex structure on my C drive and, ideally, I should be able to store my Firefox bookmarks in the same structure.  It just doesn't make sense to store the bookmarks in a separate location.  I'm pretty sure you used to be able to do this by specifying the root of the bookmarks structure as c:/Documents, but I can't see how to do it in the current version. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1120;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",DaleLaceyNZ
