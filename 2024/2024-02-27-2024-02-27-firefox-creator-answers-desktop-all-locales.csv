I'm Dr. Sobya owner of the sobya's skincare website. I'm seeking clarification on Firefox's password management security, considering the prevalent practice of users saving passwords for convenience. I'm keen to know if Firefox has robust measures in place to safeguard sensitive information, addressing potential risks similar to those raised about other browsers like Chrome. Given our skincare focus and the trust our users place in us, assuring the safety of their credentials is paramount. A detailed response on Firefox's security protocols would not only alleviate user concerns but also enhance trust and credibility for our platform. I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and look forward to your insights. </p><p>Best regards, Dr. Sobya </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",umaralyani
