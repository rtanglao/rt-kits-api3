I realize this is simply never going to change, and I need to take steps to prevent her from ever seeing any sponsored results of any kind, or any kind of address bar autocomplete suggestion. </p><p>I have taken several dozen hours of my personal time this past month to repair the damage from her first scam experience (that I know about!), and today's incident made me realize that I have to do much more customization of her browser than I previously imagined. When I told her to never fully trust a Google search, her reply was ""but I used Firefox!"", and that told me everything I needed to know. It simply cannot be left to her understanding of the internet. </p><p>The intended setup is an iPad and a Win11 laptop. I would like to set up Firefox so that the address bar is nothing but an address bar without any kind of autocomplete at all. Is this even possible? </p><p>Also, I obviously can't filter every scam known to man, but I would like to specifically block the kind of pop-ups and ads that scammers use. What is a good strategy for this specific purpose? I don't care about legitimate marketing ads, even though they're annoying to me personally. </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1250;firefox-12502;,firefox,customize,en-US,1649524;,townie

Enhanced Tracking Protection will automatically add the URL of a webpage (that you currently have open) to the Enhanced Tracking Protection screen whenever you disable the shield in the search bar. This will turn off tracking for that website until turn you it back on. You can also manually add websites to the Enhanced Tracking Protection screen if you have mulitples to add. This whitelist will stay active until you delete them or click on the shield to turn it back on.  </p><p>The Cookies and Site Data section further down, allows you to create a list of sites that you want to BLOCK, ALLOW FOR SESSION, or ALLOW cookies and site data to be used, and retained or not. This differs from the Enhanced Tracking Protection section.  </p><p>Today, I wanted to delete one of the websites listed in the Enhanced Tracking Protection, and did so manually. But since there were only a couple listed (I rarely add to this screen), I simply clicked on ""Remove All Websites"" instead of ""Remove Website."" Unfortunately, when I went down to the Cookies and Site Data list (which I use all the time) to add a new URL today, my entire list was gone! I did not remove or enter anything in the Cookies and Site Data screen today, prior to using the Enhanced Tracking Protection screen. </p><p>As you can guess, I am sick because I had over 100 sites listed in the Cookies and Site Data section, and lost them all when I removed the few websites in the Enhanced Tracking Protection section. I don't know why or how this happened, but it is worth noting that I did just update Firefox this morning to vs 125.0.2 (from 124.0.2). My list is gone, but does anyone have a reason why it happened and is there a way to prevent that in the future? Or is it some kind of bug with the latest release or an earlier one. (I haven't opened the Enhanced Tracking Protection screen for a long time, so it could be from any past release.) Sorry I don't have more info than that. Any solutions would be appeciated. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1250;firefox-12502;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",sand1

Have a freshly setup install of Debian 12, using Sway (wayland) as my Window Manager. I am really struggling with slowness in Firefox, page loads take easily 15 seconds whereas loading the exact same page in another window at the same time with Chromium Debian build has near instantaneous load times. I've tried the following troubleshooting steps: - Created a new firefox profile - Tried ""Troubleshooting Mode"" in Firefox - Disabled ipv6 in firefox about:config and in Debian - Tried different DNS servers - Tried different non-debian specific builds of Firefox - Tried Firefox Beta and Firefox Nightly for Debian </p><p>None of these steps made any difference, and Chromium has continued to be significantly faster. Am really stuck here and would love to get to the bottom of this as Firefox is <em>the only</em> browser that works with a HiDPI display in Sway without blurryness. Happy to provide any and all diagnostics and reports that are needed. Thanks in advance! </p><p>EDIT: It seems to be some kind of networking issue, using a VPN solves it.
