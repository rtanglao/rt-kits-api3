I kept a 12X version of Firefox on my Mac because since 13X, it looses access to my mic after few seconds (all settings okay, no security issue, no warning or anything, just lost signal - working fine on all other apps). Browser-based applications requiring audio like Teams are not usable at all.  This morning, the 13X update went through, even though I had deactivated all the auto updates. I tested my mic again and the issue persists - it does work well with all other apps, the issue is only with Firefox 13X. I have searched for a bug report but couldn't find any.  Has anyone experienced this issue? Would you have a link to a bug/forum/anything? What other options do I have now if it keeps updating without consent?
