I authorized yes to install the helper tool, and then the Firefox icon bounces on the dock indefinitely and Firefox is ""not responding"" and never opens.  If I force quit and try again, I get the same prompt to install the helper tool and the cycle begins again. </p><p>I think this started after I updated a BitWarden extension on Firefox on my wife's account, but not sure if that is what provoked the problem.  The same Bitwarden extension exists on Firefox on the admin account, and that Firefox works fine. </p><p>What I have tried so far: Shut down all BitWarden apps.  Refreshed Firefox on the admin account - which deletes the BitWarden extension.  Moved Firefox to the trash.  Restart the computer.  Re-install Firefox from the admin account (Firefox again works just fine when admin is the user).

I have gone through the Linux KDE System Settings and the Settings in Firefox and Thunderbird several times trying to find it. I will note that I set up Firefox and Thunderbird in the same Linux distro on a laptop also using Firefox Sync and do not have this problem with the laptop.

Several community members mention that Google has owned Captcha since spring 2024.  Has it made additional changes?  Are you working with them to resolve this issue?  I want to keep using Firefox but this is frustrating.  I'll admit I have never liked Captcha, and wish someone would come up with a better option for it. </p>",firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1687915;,dastratton
