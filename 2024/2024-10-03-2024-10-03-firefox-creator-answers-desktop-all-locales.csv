The problem being, it only offers the password options if one the sign up users page, which that URL default to. It will show the drop down menu with your login options. Once selecting login, FF no longer offers any password options, even with a right-click. Wix has a two page login, one with email, then the next with the password. It is like FF does not even recognize that first page properly. Only after manually entering the email, does the password just appear on the second page (if saved).  </p><p>This is really sloppy functionality. It really stinks if it has been awhile since logging in, and you cannot remember what email was used with the account if several are related. It requires then manually going into setting and looking it up in the passwords section. I have never experienced this problem with other browsers. </p><p>It is there any way to get it to work normally with Wix (and possibly other similar two-step logins)? </p>",firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",JJ80

I have tested Youtube as well and the issue is not present on those videos. To give you a better picture of what it is like, it is like watching a video on an OLED screen with pixel shift enabled but it's super aggresive and is incredibly distracting. </p><p>To my memory I am pretty confident that the video player used on Crunyroll's website is a HTML5 player with DRM security and videos are in mp4 format. </p><p>I am running Firefox 131.0 (64-bit) completly fresh on Windows 11 with an RTX 30 series GPU. So far I have tried the following with no success and the jiggle remaining: </p> <ol><li> Cleared the site data and cache </li><li> Disabled Add-ons one-by-one to identify a potential culprit </li><li> Disabled Hardware acceleration </li><li> Ran Firefox in Safe Mode </li><li> All of the above in combination </li></ol> <p>I am stumped as to why this might be happening especially with a fresh out-of-box experiance. Any assistance you can provide on this would be greatly appreciated, as I would prefer to avoid Chromium browsers going forward. </p><p>Many thanks, Phreaky </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",Phreaky
