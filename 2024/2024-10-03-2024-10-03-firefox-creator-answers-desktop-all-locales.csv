The problem being, it only offers the password options if one the sign up users page, which that URL default to. It will show the drop down menu with your login options. Once selecting login, FF no longer offers any password options, even with a right-click. Wix has a two page login, one with email, then the next with the password. It is like FF does not even recognize that first page properly. Only after manually entering the email, does the password just appear on the second page (if saved).  </p><p>This is really sloppy functionality. It really stinks if it has been awhile since logging in, and you cannot remember what email was used with the account if several are related. It requires then manually going into setting and looking it up in the passwords section. I have never experienced this problem with other browsers. </p><p>It is there any way to get it to work normally with Wix (and possibly other similar two-step logins)? </p>",firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",JJ80
