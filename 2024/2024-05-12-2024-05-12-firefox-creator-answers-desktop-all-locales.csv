Since then I cannot open Youtube without it crashing. When I ask it to restore the tab (one of 2 choices offered, it crashes again.  After 4 or 5 times I close the tab and switch to another browser.  I shut off the one extension I had running. That fixed nothing.

It's just this one instance it won't connect. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",josh.a.menzel
