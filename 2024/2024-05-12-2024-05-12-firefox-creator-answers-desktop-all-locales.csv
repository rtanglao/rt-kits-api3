Ho provato da Edge e funziona ( ma generalmente non lo utilizzo non è il mio predefinito ) e quindi ora ho tutte le password vecchie .... ( ho di recente cambiato email e diverse passowrd sono state modificate ). Cosa può essere successo visto che ha sempre funzionato e che con edge comunque va presumo sia cambiato qualcosa in Firefox. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,other,it,1652484;,deantoni.lusvardi

I rebooted the laptop then tried scanning the it with WindowsDefender and Malwarebytes, and refreshing the application. On my desktop which is synced, there is no issue. I thought I was seeing things at first until I focused right on the bookmark tool bar and every 10-20 seconds one will just pop into a new position. Will a fresh install work? That's my next step, but wanted to see if there is a better solution. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",verc3tti
