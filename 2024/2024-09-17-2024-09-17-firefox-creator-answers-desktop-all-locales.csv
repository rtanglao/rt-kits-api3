This issue only happens with Firefox, and I previously fixed this by changing the bitrate in my audio output settings. However, after an update, this issue has returned, and the bitrate settings I was using that were able to fix this issue now doesn't allow me to play audio on Firefox at all. So now I have no way to avoid the strange bug that causes audio to cut out. </p><p>I would love some advice- is this on Firefox's end, or my computer's?

When watching videos and reels on Facebook (Desktop version), videos will flip-flop between normal and really bright and washed-out. I'm currently on Firefox 130.0 on Windows 11, and I always have HDR on. The imagery is silly, but these two screenshots (using win-shift-s) are from the same video only seconds apart, and this happens on almost all of them. Not yet tested to see if it also happens on Youtube or Twitter videos. </p>",firefox;windows-11;firefox-1300;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",piccolo113

I also am having problems with sites like Petsmart where I keep getting logged off and nothing actually ends up in my cart.  I don't like Chrome and I won't use Edge under any circumstances.  What is the problem that these sites are having with Firefox?  I have been using Firefox from it's first being offered (yes I'm that old) and I don't want to change.  I use DuckDuckGo with both Firefox and Chrome so I'm reasonably certain that the issues I am experiencing are Firefox issues.  I have tried turning off the add blocking extensions and even my firewall but that hasn't helped. I get the feeling that these sites (and others) are part of an effort to get rid of Firefox in favor of the 2 giants Google and Microsoft.  Am I just paranoid or what? </p><p>I use Windows 10, McAfee Security software,  Firefox browser with DuckDuckGo search engine.  I also use Chrome browser with DuckDuckGo search engine.
