PG&amp;E (Pacific Gas &amp; Electric) does not support Firefox (I get a message telling me that Firefox is not a supported browser and I need to use Chrome, Edge.  I also am having problems with sites like Petsmart where I keep getting logged off and nothing actually ends up in my cart.  I don't like Chrome and I won't use Edge under any circumstances.  What is the problem that these sites are having with Firefox?  I have been using Firefox from it's first being offered (yes I'm that old) and I don't want to change.  I use DuckDuckGo with both Firefox and Chrome so I'm reasonably certain that the issues I am experiencing are Firefox issues.  I have tried turning off the add blocking extensions and even my firewall but that hasn't helped. I get the feeling that these sites (and others) are part of an effort to get rid of Firefox in favor of the 2 giants Google and Microsoft.  Am I just paranoid or what? </p><p>I use Windows 10, McAfee Security software,  Firefox browser with DuckDuckGo search engine.  I also use Chrome browser with DuckDuckGo search engine.
