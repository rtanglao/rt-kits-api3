However I have added <a href=""http://youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com</a> to the exceptions list for each cookies setting mentioned but yet every time I load youtube on a fresh mozilla instance it makes me send a verification to youtube on my phone, then loads a oops sorry we cant load this page with a youtube search bar on it.
