Every now and then I get to a website which asks about cookies permissions and then proceeds to give me a huge list, hundreds of alleged companies which have a ""legitimate interest"" in me having their cookie, which I have to individually search through and deselect. Is there a way around this please? Does firefox ignore/prevent the cookies under the ""Enhanced Tracking Protection"" policy? or by accepting them do I still get them?

So I use <strong>Send tab to device</strong> feature.

But I find that annoying and unintuitive. </p><p>Is there a solution for it? For instance, syncing Firefox devices more often, maybe just for the sending tabs feature because <strong>sync-now</strong> also syncs history, and bookmarks. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",naykuku228

Every time I try to use Firefox, it crashes randomly, especially when I'm loading multiple tabs or watching videos. I'm running the latest version of Firefox, Version 130.0 and my laptop is using an Intel laptop <a href=""https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/faqs/intel/best-intel-processor-laptops/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.lenovo.com/au/en/faqs/intel/best-intel-processor-laptops/</a> i7 processor with 8GB of RAM. </p><p>I've tried some basic troubleshooting like clearing cache, disabling add-ons, and updating drivers, but the issue keeps happening. My laptop runs everything else just fine, and other browsers like Chrome work without any issues. I'm not sure if it’s a Firefox bug or something specific to my system. Has anyone else faced this issue with Firefox on an Intel machine? Any suggestions on how to resolve this? I would appreciate any help or advice on what to try next!

I use DuckDuckGo with both Firefox and Chrome so I'm reasonably certain that the issues I am experiencing are Firefox issues.  I have tried turning off the add blocking extensions and even my firewall but that hasn't helped. I get the feeling that these sites (and others) are part of an effort to get rid of Firefox in favor of the 2 giants Google and Microsoft.
