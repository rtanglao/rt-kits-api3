I was unable to load email today until I spoke with live ATT tech support. He instructed me in clearing cache and cookies, had me open a private window, then asked me to open another window. He did get my ATT email restored, but when I had 2 windows open I accidentally closed my main window which had many pinned tabs and other tabs I wished to get to. Yes, too many tabs! So I have a new browser which does not have the configuration I want which is the one I had when I first called ATT. So I made a mistake and closed the wrong browser, I knew it as it happened but it was too late, I guess speaking with and listening to the tech messed up my concentration. I have made this mistake before and closed the wrong browser but fumbling around somehow I managed to recover the browser I wanted, I don't remember how exactly. I think it has been a couple of years since I screwed up this way. The History section of my Firefox menu does not offer a selection called 'restore previous session' that the instruction page shows, the only options at the top are Recently closed tabs, Recently closed windows, Search history. Then a bar followed by Clear Recent history, then today's history in the new browser. So I only get history from today's new browser.  I am old and not tech savvy there is a lot of terminology I do not understand, I need a kindergartner's step by step instruction on this I am afraid, in clear English. I am afraid to do things like refresh or reinstall without knowing what I am doing. I appreciate your help. I use desktop Firefox for email, reading items of interest, social media, ordering merch. I do not do gaming, I have no website. It is late and I am going to bed soon. You can email me at jaelizlang@att.net.
