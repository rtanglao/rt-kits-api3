Now that I do not have a phone, this went from mildly annoying to really messing up my day-to-day life. As a result, I researched, found and followed <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1426184"" rel=""nofollow"">this question-and-answer proposed solution</a> to my issue but it didn't work. Now, I've been pushed a step backward because I have also lost the ability to view TV shows and movies on third party websites because the player will not load and a 'Website will not allow Firefox to display the page if another site has embedded it' notice will pop up (image for reference). This is super infuriating due to the fact that my PC is older and genuinely cannot run any kind of chromium browser and Firefox is the only way I can access said third party sites. It would be wonderful is anyone had a solution for both issues; thank you! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1240;firefox-12401;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1644146;,sagaofyou

I have used Firefox as my browser and DuckDuckGo as my search engine. Just recently, I went to install the latest version of vpn and had issues. Went to their support page: <a href=""https://www.expressvpn.com/support/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.expressvpn.com/support/</a> and could not access their Live help (messaging)? If I use another browser, say Chrome, and go to the same support page, I CAN use the Live help messaging section.  This peoblem happens on my Desktop and also my laptop. When using my iphone, i don't have this issue. Can you Help? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1240;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1644139;1644142;1644145;,crusin50
