Ao acessar novamente o navegador, a sincronização sempre fica desativada. Reativo, reconfiguro as extensões e utilizo, mas ao desligar e religar o PC, perco as configurações das extensões. As únicas coisas que permanecem na sincronização são: os favoritos, o historico e as senhas. Já desinstalei e reinstalei o firefox, já criei outra conta mozilla para tentar sincronizar e até formatei o PC, mas o problema persiste. São somente as configurações das extensões que são perdidas com a desativação da sincronização. Isso só acontece no PC de casa, no trabalho está normal. Utilizo as extensões MaisPje, AVJT, <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> mailto e Web PKI.
