Ao acessar novamente o navegador, a sincronização sempre fica desativada. Reativo, reconfiguro as extensões e utilizo, mas ao desligar e religar o PC, perco as configurações das extensões. As únicas coisas que permanecem na sincronização são: os favoritos, o historico e as senhas. Já desinstalei e reinstalei o firefox, já criei outra conta mozilla para tentar sincronizar e até formatei o PC, mas o problema persiste. São somente as configurações das extensões que são perdidas com a desativação da sincronização. Isso só acontece no PC de casa, no trabalho está normal. Utilizo as extensões MaisPje, AVJT, <a href=""http://outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">outlook.com</a> mailto e Web PKI.  Como posso resolver essa questão? </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,pt-BR,"",brunohsndf

I have saved a back-up of all original files before attempting the update. The update did not take effect, and I subsequently lost all previously saved bookmarks and passwords on Firefox. I have also disabled all restrictions, including ad blockers, ""Recommend extensions as you browse,"" and ""Recommend features as you browse."" </p><p>I successfully imported my bookmarks from an HTML file into Chrome, which worked on the first attempt, and they are now saved there. Despite this, I have been working with AI for the past few days to troubleshoot various steps without success. </p><p>Currently, Firefox is unable to save anything in ""Favorites,"" including recent ""Log-ins &amp; Passwords"" nor can I upload bookmarks: Export from Chrome or from my hard drive. </p><p>Whenever I try to upload, the process stalls and never finishes. While I successfully imported saved logins from Chrome, Firefox does not recognize any bookmarks, and I am still using version 11.5 despite Firefox indicating that I am up to date. </p><p>I would greatly appreciate your assistance in resolving these issues. </p><p>Update: Every time I restart my computer everything gets lost all over again and having to start from scratch. </p><p>Thank you for your help. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",leoniewithane
