I have saved a back-up of all original files before attempting the update. The update did not take effect, and I subsequently lost all previously saved bookmarks and passwords on Firefox. I have also disabled all restrictions, including ad blockers, ""Recommend extensions as you browse,"" and ""Recommend features as you browse."" </p><p>I successfully imported my bookmarks from an HTML file into Chrome, which worked on the first attempt, and they are now saved there. Despite this, I have been working with AI for the past few days to troubleshoot various steps without success. </p><p>Currently, Firefox is unable to save anything in ""Favorites,"" including recent ""Log-ins &amp; Passwords"" nor can I upload bookmarks: Export from Chrome or from my hard drive. </p><p>Whenever I try to upload, the process stalls and never finishes. While I successfully imported saved logins from Chrome, Firefox does not recognize any bookmarks, and I am still using version 11.5 despite Firefox indicating that I am up to date. </p><p>I would greatly appreciate your assistance in resolving these issues. </p><p>Update: Every time I restart my computer everything gets lost all over again and having to start from scratch. </p><p>Thank you for your help. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",leoniewithane

Now, I have uninstalled the firefox and then Im trying to install it in another unit in the same PC, but the installer detects that it was installed previosly and  doesnÂ´t offer the option to choose de unit. I would like to install it on the new unit and conserve all of my data but moved to the SSD.  Could you tell me how can I do that step by step?
