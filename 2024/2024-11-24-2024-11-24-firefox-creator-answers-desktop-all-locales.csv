However, if I do so right now (for example, Wikipedia's Mozilla article), I will not bring that page back but instead an older, longer-closed tab from some days ago. I can keep trying to close and reopen tabs, or just keep reopening tabs, and I will continue to dig up older and older tabs from longer and longer ago. </p><p>Is this a known issue, what might have changed that behavior, and how do I restore the expected functionality of tabs correctly being reopened in the reverse order that they were closed? </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",HayFeverGrotto
