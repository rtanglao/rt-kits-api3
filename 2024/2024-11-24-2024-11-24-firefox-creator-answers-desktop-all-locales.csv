L'immagine si sposta o si deforma, con dei tagli netti obliqui. A volte sembra che faccia il refresh a seconda di come si sposti il puntatore del mouse. La cosa succede solo con Firefox, non con Safari, Duckduckgo o altri browser. Ho provato sia reinstallare Firefox ultima versione ma nessun miglioramento. La cosa succede sia con MacOs Sonoma o Sequoia, anche su iMac diversi. Se provo a fare uno screenshot della pagina con firefox, l'immagine salvata è normale. Quindi il problema è solo alla visualizzazione e solo con firefox. Qualcun'altro ha sto problema e come ha risolto? Grazie. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,it,"",dnvmwvyh2j

I believe I have everything set correctly, please see attachment, but FireFox is not asking me to save my sign in credentials for my Apple account. It was working two days ago when I had to count on it remembering those credentials from over 2 years ago in order to change my password. After changing it I have signed in a few times to get it to remember my new password but it isn't asking me. Any idea why and how I can correct it? </p>",firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1689811;,hlewton

I greatly appreciate the efforts of your team in developing such a convenient and secure product. I would like to express my gratitude for the excellent work on Firefox and would like to propose a few ideas that I believe could enhance the user experience. </p><p>Selective Tab Removal Feature Often, when working with a large number of tabs, there's a need to close only some of them. It would be very useful if there were a feature that allows users to select multiple tabs and close them simultaneously. This would significantly simplify the organization of work with tabs and allow users to manage open pages more effectively. </p><p>Adding Ukrainian Language to the Page Translation Tool For Ukrainian users, it is important to have the ability to translate web pages into Ukrainian directly in the browser. Given the significant number of Ukrainian-speaking users, this would be a very important and helpful addition. I hope that such an option will be implemented in future updates. </p><p>I would be very grateful if you could consider these suggestions for inclusion in future updates. I believe these changes would be useful for many users and would enhance their experience with Firefox. </p><p>Sincerely, Bohdan </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",bogdanserg48
