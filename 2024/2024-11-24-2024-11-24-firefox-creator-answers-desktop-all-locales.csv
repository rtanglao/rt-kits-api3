I greatly appreciate the efforts of your team in developing such a convenient and secure product. I would like to express my gratitude for the excellent work on Firefox and would like to propose a few ideas that I believe could enhance the user experience. </p><p>Selective Tab Removal Feature Often, when working with a large number of tabs, there's a need to close only some of them. It would be very useful if there were a feature that allows users to select multiple tabs and close them simultaneously. This would significantly simplify the organization of work with tabs and allow users to manage open pages more effectively. </p><p>Adding Ukrainian Language to the Page Translation Tool For Ukrainian users, it is important to have the ability to translate web pages into Ukrainian directly in the browser. Given the significant number of Ukrainian-speaking users, this would be a very important and helpful addition. I hope that such an option will be implemented in future updates. </p><p>I would be very grateful if you could consider these suggestions for inclusion in future updates. I believe these changes would be useful for many users and would enhance their experience with Firefox. </p><p>Sincerely, Bohdan </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,1689816;1689819;,bogdanserg48
