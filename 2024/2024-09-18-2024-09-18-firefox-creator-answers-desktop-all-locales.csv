It only hangs, requiring me to Force Quit","<p>I'm using Firefox 130.00 on a MacBook Pro (15-inch, mid-2012) running Catalina (10.15.7). It has run flawlessly for years, but suddenly won't open, and only hangs, requiring me to Force Quit. It stopped working on Thursday, 9/12, which, I notice, was the day it was last modified with an automatic upgrade. I have quit and tried restarting multiple times, but am unable to get into it at all and, therefore, cannot access Troubleshooting Mode. I have NOT yet tried deleting it and downloading a fresh copy. I would like, if possible, to retain my open tabs, Bookmarks, and History. </p><p>Please advise—and many thanks! </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",jt26

That prevents Firefox browser from using ASLR capabilities and to a large degree prevent Buffer overflows attacks.

Similarly the output of the second command has a Key, Type, whose value is <strong>EXEC (Executable file)</strong>. However for a PIE binary the value would be <strong>DYN (Position-Independent Executable file)</strong>. </p><p>Can Mozilla please compile the binaries and shared libraries with the PIE/PIC flag and then host them in its repositories? Many of Linux Distros do not have the bandwidth to take the source and compile binaries for different architects and are dependent on Mozilla to provide the same.  Doing so would be appreciated and would help in enhancing safety of Linux users who use Firefox as their primary browser. </p><p><br> PIE = Position Independent Executable PIC = Position Independent Code ASLR = Address Space Layout Randomisation.
