Apparently Sync wont do it for some reason that I fail to comprehend. By searching this site I have found answers that say the file ""prefs.js"" hold these values. However, I have copied that file from my old PC onto the new PC but no result? Where should the file be copied from and to (full path from and to)? i have used ""about:profiles"" but then there are paths to ""default"" and ""root"". (2) I have exported the the Bookmarks from my old PC to the new PC but in one particular case the bookmarks are not the same. In this case I have a particularly large bookmark that contains three (3) Sub-Folders plus many individual bookmarks. When importing the file it does not include all the sub-folders - only two. This baffles me because if is exported with three sub-folders I don't understand how the imported Bookmark file can be different. Any advice would be most appreciated. </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",Sandgroper48
