That prevents Firefox browser from using ASLR capabilities and to a large degree prevent Buffer overflows attacks.

If it had been a PIE executable then it would have been <strong>ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable</strong>. Similarly the output of the second command has a Key, Type, whose value is <strong>EXEC (Executable file)</strong>. However for a PIE binary the value would be <strong>DYN (Position-Independent Executable file)</strong>. </p><p>Can Mozilla please compile the binaries and shared libraries with the PIE/PIC flag and then host them in its repositories? Many of Linux Distros do not have the bandwidth to take the source and compile binaries for different architects and are dependent on Mozilla to provide the same.  Doing so would be appreciated and would help in enhancing safety of Linux users who use Firefox as their primary browser. </p><p><br> PIE = Position Independent Executable PIC = Position Independent Code ASLR = Address Space Layout Randomisation.
