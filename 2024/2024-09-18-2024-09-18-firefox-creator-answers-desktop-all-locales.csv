This routine occurs even if I am hundreds of miles from home.  Lately  however, and for the past month+ or so, the first 5 or 6 downloads happen quickly as stated above but then the next email may take minutes.  Additional emails may also take a minute or more apiece.  Then the remainder may download as super-fast as the first ones.  Also, some of the earliest ones will download in triplicate.  Sometimes a window will display the message: “Error with account:  Unable to write  the email to the mailbox.
