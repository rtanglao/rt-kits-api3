I noticed that a second profile had been created, so I copied the same list of files to the bookmarksbackup folder under that profile. Still no help.

The same links work fine with Roboform when tested in Edge and Chrome browsers which frustrates me as I do not want to switch from Firefox. I have tried removing the extension and reinstalling a fresh download, same for uninstalling Firefox. I have tried setting up a new Firefox profile. I have gone through every Firefox setting many times trying with or without although I have not actually modified any setting recently so I am fairly confident that this problem is due to a change in either Firefox or Roboform. I am using Firefox version 124.0.2 in Windows 11 23H2 (currently 22631.3374) and also use two other extensions, being Kaspersky Protection and Facebook Container which have been resident for a few years now. I can remove the other two extension individually but it is only by disabling the Roboform extension that enables me to view these troublesome links without any issue. An example is <a href=""https://www.hughes.co.uk/product/kitchen-appliances/cooking/microwaves/hisense/h29mobs9hguk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.hughes.co.uk/product/kitchen-appliances/cooking/microwaves/hisense/h29mobs9hguk</a> whereby if I click on any of the three ""Flexi-Pay"", ""Delivery &amp; Collection"" or ""Services"" buttons on the right, there is no response when Roboform extension is installed. What can be unique/different about these links? I have naturally been in touch with Roboform but so far they have sadly not been able to help find me a solution, so I thought I should ask the experts at Firefox hoping that someone out there might just have experience of such an issue. Just as a separate observation, the Roboform extension is missing its icon when viewed in Add-ons Manager and also when viewed in the Firefox Add-ons library which I find very odd as that wasn't always the case. It is appearing normally in my Firefox Toolbar.

In reference to earlier comments elsewhere about the tab bar, I like having the tab bar across the top of the browser window, and I don't need the additional vertical space. </p><p>I've read the conversations about grouped or nested tabs, and I've looked at the add-ons for tab grouping. The add-ons seem inelegant, and they don't really do what I want them to do. It seems to me that the best way to approach grouping tabs is keeping the existing tab bar and adding a layer of function to it. </p><p>I have 117 tabs open because I'm approaching antiquity, something of a slob, a bit of a hoarder, need to have reminders for the rabbit-holes I plumb, and I find the Bookmarks cumbersome. Firefox doesn't seem to bog down under the load, which is great. </p><p>How about this: Rig the Tabs function to accommodate two or three levels. Along with the New Tab button, make a button to open a Tab Drawer, which can be named and would always be visible. Related tabs could then be dragged and dropped into the relevant Tab Drawer, and the Tab Drawers can be dragged to arrange them among exposed tabs on the Tab Bar. Tab Drawers could contain Tab Drawers to create one or two sublevels. (Even one-level tab grouping would be a huge improvement.) </p><p>Opening a Drawer would be by clicking on it; this would open a drop-down menu of the contents. Selecting a tab in a Drawer would open a that tab next to the drawer; selecting a Drawer would The right-click menu for the Drawer could include options for Open Drawer in New Window and Open All These Tabs and Drawers in One New Window. As the user would be navigating through tabs, the drop-down menus would not be too much of an intrusion. </p><p>As an example, I could have Tab Drawers to collect the 17 recipe tabs I have open, or the six peculiar Ebay search pages I keep, the twelve crossword and game tabs I visit regularly, the eight or so YouTube tabs I maintain and the multitude of medical, banking, utility and governmental tabs I need for logging in more often than I'd prefer. And it would be nice to have a Drawer for the tabs I have for online shopping; opening them all in a new window would be useful. </p><p>I don't know jack doe about coding or what bugs could possibly arise from such a feature, but this seems a reasonable approach to the problem of tab grouping. It keeps tabs as they are (It might require a few more vertical pixels so Drawers could be outlined for visibility), and allows one to fine-tune their use in a manner similar to using other features on Firefox. It doesn't require a new window that takes up space on the desktop as the current add-ons do. </p><p>Does this seem reasonable and possible? I'd do it myself, but I can't. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>Windows 10, Firefox v. 124.0.2 </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",AlphaCat

Thank you! </p><p>I'm using </p> <ul><li> Firefox DevEd (manually installed) as my primary driver and </li><li> the standard Firefox (installed from the package manager) for leisure/hobby related browsing </li></ul> <p>each with its own Mozilla account and profile, on Manjaro KDE. Sadly, either Firefox sees all the profiles. They have usually different versions. If I mistakenly start one of the Foxes in the other Fox's profile, the newer version of Firefox (usually Firefox DevEd) autostarts migrating that profile. Which it renders the profile ""corrupted"" for its intended Firefox. </p><p>I'd like to have Firefox DevEd unable to see profiles (or anything else) intended for the standard Firefox and vice versa. Or at least unable to botch profiles. I do not want to disable migration or use no. Given that Firefox configuration location is hard-coded, I'm not having high hopes for my wish. </p><p>I'm wondering if there is a way to keep two Firefox installations completely isolated, other than running them in containers. </p><p>Thank you for your time! </p>",linux;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-1240;firefox-12401;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1645731;,the.ge

I had Yahoo open on my browser. Now, no matter what I do (including uninstalling and reinstalling firefox), I get the message every time I try to open a link from a particular email to a website totally unaffiliated with facebook. It looks like facebook grabbed onto the open tab and I can't get rid of it. I'm using a different browser to access that url, but I'd like to get facebook out of my yahoo business. It looks like FB is trying to track my activity on the web. Please help. BTW, Yahoo was in a personal container and the url for zoom opened up when I joined the zoom meeting from facebook, so all 3 of those tabs were open for a couple of hours.
