When trying to search, only a blank area came up. When I tried to go directly to a channel, the same happened. Loading a direct link from a video let me play the video, but everything around it was gone, no recommended, no channel, no likes, nothing.  </p><p>I have tried clearing the cache and cookies. My Firefox version is up to date as of right now. I restarted the browser several times and restarted my computer.  </p><p>Other solutions suggested going to about:config and changing image.webp.enabled to true, but when I search under about:config, that option is not there.  </p><p>Youtube works if I open a private window and sign in. I have tried opening Firefox in troubleshooting mode and this did not solve the problem. Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;website-breakages;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1645692;1645700;1645703;,dogloverbh
