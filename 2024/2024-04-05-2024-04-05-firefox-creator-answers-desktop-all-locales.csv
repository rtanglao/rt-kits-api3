I had Yahoo open on my browser. Now, no matter what I do (including uninstalling and reinstalling firefox), I get the message every time I try to open a link from a particular email to a website totally unaffiliated with facebook. It looks like facebook grabbed onto the open tab and I can't get rid of it. I'm using a different browser to access that url, but I'd like to get facebook out of my yahoo business. It looks like FB is trying to track my activity on the web. Please help. BTW, Yahoo was in a personal container and the url for zoom opened up when I joined the zoom meeting from facebook, so all 3 of those tabs were open for a couple of hours. Thanks for your help. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ellenandrethy

I have tried everything and I can't fix this.  Do I need to uninstall Firefox and reinstall or can you please help me.  I hope this is enough information.

This works fine. However, if I double click on that field, an option is displayed, happening to be my email address, which will not work in this case; a numeric value is required. </p><p>So, knowing a prompt is enabled, I have entirely failed to get 'it' to save the correct ID. I have also find a place in Firefox settings where I can see and modify the value that comes up. I do however remember doing exactly that for some other site. </p><p>So, as I have said, I cannot find this in the Passwords nor the Settings pages. What am I missing? </p><p>Help would be much appreciated. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",peterFisp

My Firefox version is up to date as of right now.
