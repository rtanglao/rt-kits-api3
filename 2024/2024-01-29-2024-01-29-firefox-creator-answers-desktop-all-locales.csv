Every time I log into Instagram, Twitter, etc... after typing my username and password (or backup code), and also after checking the ""save browser"" box.

But nothing is saved because it keeps appearing. </p><p>No matter how much I check the box, ""save browser"", if I close Firefox and reopen it, I have to check ""save browser"" again if I go to Facebook. </p><p>It is the only website that gives me this problem, which does not save the browser and therefore does not save the Facebook session. </p><p>I repeat, Twitter, Instagram... they don't give me that problem, only Facebook. </p><p>How could it be solved??? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1220;,firefox,fix-problems,es,"",kembus20

It only works temporarily and dropdowns disappear every 5 minutes. And Firefox is not saving passwords when I visit websites. (I checked and I still have all my passwords saved in Firefox Settings.) And I have ""Fill usernames and passwords automatically"" checked in Firefox Privacy Settings. </p><p>I started having problems with Firefox when I installed ""Hide my IP"" add-on because I wanted to change my IP address. I added it because I was getting website advertisement popups telling me to buy a VPN. I disabled ""Hide my IP"" yesterday. And I'm also getting more website popups now.

When I opened a third tab and started typing Google the following FireFox suggestions appeared (see attached screen print) showing a Google slide show of a friend who passed nine years ago.

I may have a couple windows open - I close one and they all close - not TABS - WINDOWS. As I am handling personal finances, academics and business, I cannot work like this. I cannot keep every window I open forever open so that I do not loose another. I am forced to use another browser until the problem is fixed. </p><p>I was also VERY disappointed to find that I could not just ask a question without signing in. This is absolutely ridiculous. Just help people who use your stuff. Why do I have to be a member to point out a problem or ask a question? I'll bet you are missing volumes of helpful feedback because folks are tired of having to announce themselves before pointing out a glitch and just move on as I almost did. That in turn leaves dedicated users dealing with a glitch for longer. </p><p>I am using the latest Windows 10 on a modern machine. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1220;,firefox,other,en-US,"",vicocles
