It only works temporarily and dropdowns disappear every 5 minutes. And Firefox is not saving passwords when I visit websites. (I checked and I still have all my passwords saved in Firefox Settings.) And I have ""Fill usernames and passwords automatically"" checked in Firefox Privacy Settings. </p><p>I started having problems with Firefox when I installed ""Hide my IP"" add-on because I wanted to change my IP address. I added it because I was getting website advertisement popups telling me to buy a VPN. I disabled ""Hide my IP"" yesterday. And I'm also getting more website popups now. Do I have to tweak Firefox Settings to stop all of these problems? </p><p>Firefox has been up-to-date and I'm using Windows 10. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1220;,firefox,other,en-US,"",grov10

When I opened a third tab and started typing Google the following FireFox suggestions appeared (see attached screen print) showing a Google slide show of a friend who passed nine years ago.  How is it that this came up on my computer?  I have NEVER searched for this using this unit nor have I ever downloaded the link.  So my question is ""Just how secure IS FIreFox?""  ""How is it possible that Google knows this computer and its owner?""  ""And given that I use a Norton VPN it further exasperates my concern."" </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1220;,firefox,other,en-US,"",m.dedrick1

However about a day ago I closed a window (ei. X'ed out) and all of my windows closed AND were unrecoverable via 'restore session' </p><p>This now happens all the time. I may have a couple windows open - I close one and they all close - not TABS - WINDOWS. As I am handling personal finances, academics and business, I cannot work like this. I cannot keep every window I open forever open so that I do not loose another. I am forced to use another browser until the problem is fixed. </p><p>I was also VERY disappointed to find that I could not just ask a question without signing in. This is absolutely ridiculous. Just help people who use your stuff. Why do I have to be a member to point out a problem or ask a question? I'll bet you are missing volumes of helpful feedback because folks are tired of having to announce themselves before pointing out a glitch and just move on as I almost did. That in turn leaves dedicated users dealing with a glitch for longer. </p><p>I am using the latest Windows 10 on a modern machine. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1220;,firefox,other,en-US,"",vicocles
