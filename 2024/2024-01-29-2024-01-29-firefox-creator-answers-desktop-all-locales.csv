I've tried disabling my adblocker, my other various plugins, even opening the blocked content in a private window or troubleshooting mode - still no dice. Is this yet another one of Youtube's anti-firefox tricks? is there any way to fix/bypass this? </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1220;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",bb98baitv2

However about a day ago I closed a window (ei. X'ed out) and all of my windows closed AND were unrecoverable via 'restore session' </p><p>This now happens all the time. I may have a couple windows open - I close one and they all close - not TABS - WINDOWS. As I am handling personal finances, academics and business, I cannot work like this. I cannot keep every window I open forever open so that I do not loose another. I am forced to use another browser until the problem is fixed. </p><p>I was also VERY disappointed to find that I could not just ask a question without signing in. This is absolutely ridiculous. Just help people who use your stuff. Why do I have to be a member to point out a problem or ask a question? I'll bet you are missing volumes of helpful feedback because folks are tired of having to announce themselves before pointing out a glitch and just move on as I almost did. That in turn leaves dedicated users dealing with a glitch for longer. </p><p>I am using the latest Windows 10 on a modern machine. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1220;,firefox,other,en-US,"",vicocles
