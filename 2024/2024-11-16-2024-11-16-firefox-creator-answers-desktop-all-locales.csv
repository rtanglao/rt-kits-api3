I was given an option to replace the original Firefox or install a second version, so I chose ""replace,"" thinking I was keeping it simple. I updated Mac OS to Catalina 10.15.7--an action I've been avoiding due to all of my most important documents being on an older version of Word for Mac 2011, and TBH I resent having to pay for a subscription to access my Word &amp; Excel documents for revision or printing, and don't like keeping my documents on the cloud...as required by newer versions of MS Office.

Another point of consideration: Waterfox can access the internet in Safe Mode. </p><p><br> I consulted this <a href=""https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-waterfox-not-loading-webpages/"" rel=""nofollow"">handy-dandy page</a> before bothering you: </p><p><br> <strong>7 Fixes to Try When Waterfox Is Not Loading Webpages on Windows</strong> </p><p><br> 1) <em>Weak internet connection. </em>(Nope.) 2) <em>Corruption in Waterfox installation files.</em> (This possibility seems remote. After all, it was working well until now. ) 3) <em>Malicious extensions</em> (I have tried disabling all extensions, and there aren't that many.) 4) <em>Webpages will also fail to load if there's something wrong with the browser's code. </em>(This ""code,"" whatever that is. was working fine for all this time. A quick look-see led to this meaning of ""code"": ""..Code is made from C++ and C. Also javascript, pyhton, ruby, and many other languages."" That seems to be a long shot.) </p><p><br> Their recommendations (leaving out the ones that are not relevant): </p><p><br> 2) <strong>Update Waterfox</strong>. (I'm trying to avoid that. Of course, this might be the solution; however, It's not as though my version is that old and would have stopped working. Of course... who knows.) </p><p>4) <strong>Check Your DNS </strong>(Sounds like a lot of trouble; I don't think this will make a difference, as other browsers present no problem, <strong>and</strong> WF works in Safe Mode.) </p><p>5) <strong>Clear Waterfox Cache and Cookies</strong>  (I did that.) </p><pre>6)  <strong>Remove Unwanted Extensions</strong>  (I did that, by disabling the toggles, as suggested.)  </pre> <p>7) <strong>Reset Waterfox</strong>. </p><p>That might be the last resort, and I have the feeling a reset is not going to do the trick. Doing this will get rid of the video downloading extension I'm trying to preserve, and instead I'm hoping one or more experts might come up with another suggestion that will work.  </p><p><br> As an additional point, under Waterfox's ""Options"" &gt; ""Network Settings"" &gt; ""Settings,"" where the default choice under ""Configure Proxy Access to the Internet"" is ""Use system proxy settings,"" I fooled around by checking the first two, ""No proxy"" and ""Auto-detect proxy settings for this network,"" and neither selection did anything. I could not try the remaining choice, ""Manual proxy configuration,"" because I have no idea what figures or numbers to place for that one. If the BB code for the screenshot below does not show, here is the <a href=""https://imgbox.com/AqBgHdib"" rel=""nofollow"">direct image</a>; I'm also using the ""attachment"" option below. </p><p>[URL=<a href=""https://imgbox.com/AqBgHdib][IMG]https://thumbs2.imgbox.com/2c/b2/AqBgHdib_t.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://imgbox.com/AqBgHdib][IMG]https://thumbs2.imgbox.com/2c/b2/AqBgHdib_t.jpg</a><a href=""/IMG"" rel=""nofollow"">/IMG</a><a href=""/URL"" rel=""nofollow"">/URL</a> </p><p>It's really odd Waterfox suddenly stopped working; it was so reliable. </p><p><br> Thank you. I would be very grateful for your help. </p><p><br> </p><p><br> </p><p>. </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,1688162;,DropDrip
