I was given an option to replace the original Firefox or install a second version, so I chose ""replace,"" thinking I was keeping it simple. I updated Mac OS to Catalina 10.15.7--an action I've been avoiding due to all of my most important documents being on an older version of Word for Mac 2011, and TBH I resent having to pay for a subscription to access my Word &amp; Excel documents for revision or printing, and don't like keeping my documents on the cloud...as required by newer versions of MS Office. Now I have Catalina &amp; the newest version of Firefox and can't do the two most important things I need to do on my computer: Work with my Word docs and Firefox STILL PRODUCES BLANK SEARCH RESULTS PAGES.

A quick look-see led to this meaning of ""code"": ""..Code is made from C++ and C. Also javascript, pyhton, ruby, and many other languages."" That seems to be a long shot.) </p><p><br> Their recommendations (leaving out the ones that are not relevant): </p><p><br> 2) <strong>Update Waterfox</strong>. (I'm trying to avoid that.
