(had to have something for A/B testing.) </p><p>I've tried entering the url of file:///var/www/index.html, I've tried selecting 'open with...' from the files app, etc.  Nothing works.  </p><p>I can get to the file through http://localserver/index.html with no issues.  I've verified permissions on the entire directory tree to the file. Everything from end to end has read permissions for all, 755.   </p><p>I've checked the following advanced settings: security.sandbox.content.level..............................0     (started at 4, now at 0, no effect or change.) security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy.........................false       (default setting as installed.) </p><p>I am able to open file:///  and get a dir listing.  BUT, if I click on var, it gives ""Access to the file was denied.""  I even tried changing the permissions on /var to 777, but no change.   </p><p>This seems to be a Firefox only problem, since Google Chrome works where firefox doesn't.  </p><p>I've spent several hours searching for ways to fix this, all with no success.   Does anyone have any idea how to fix this, or even what to look at??? </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1688165;,cliffb1

1474616,2024-11-15 22:21:23 -0800,2024-11-15 23:34:07 -0800,Waterfox Browser No Longer Connecting,"<p>Hello! My computer is Win 7 (my <a href=""https://imgbox.com/wlMg47SY"" rel=""nofollow"">system info</a>; the same with <a href=""http://speccy.piriform.com/results/LyDtqTRiM6xNfKlbbBoMufK"" rel=""nofollow"">greater detail</a>). I've been relying on Waterfox (mainly to download videos; it's not the browser I use regularly) for years, and it has never given a problem, far as web access. I have not updated the browser, main reason being my downloading add-on (which happens to be the popular ""Video DownloadHelper"") behaves in a less preferred way in my other browsers. (I fear an update would put the kibosh on the better way that program functions in Waterfox.) </p><p>Suddenly Waterfox has become moody (I don't know if BB code is going to work here, but the following image is a scrrenshot of <em>""Hmm. We're having trouble finding that site.""</em> If not showing below, the <a href=""/en-US/kb/new?title=direct+link"" class=""new"" title=""Page does not exist."" rel=""nofollow"">direct link</a>.): </p><p>[URL=<a href=""https://imgbox.com/hXEimf6M][IMG]https://thumbs2.imgbox.com/62/ca/hXEimf6M_t.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://imgbox.com/hXEimf6M][IMG]https://thumbs2.imgbox.com/62/ca/hXEimf6M_t.jpg</a><a href=""/IMG"" rel=""nofollow"">/IMG</a><a href=""/URL"" rel=""nofollow"">/URL</a> </p><p><br> I am hoping the ones reading may have suggestions for me to get my Waterfox back. </p><p><br> I did install a VPN recently, but I don't think that's an issue. Another point of consideration: Waterfox can access the internet in Safe Mode. </p><p><br> I consulted this <a href=""https://www.makeuseof.com/windows-waterfox-not-loading-webpages/"" rel=""nofollow"">handy-dandy page</a> before bothering you: </p><p><br> <strong>7 Fixes to Try When Waterfox Is Not Loading Webpages on Windows</strong> </p><p><br> 1) <em>Weak internet connection. </em>(Nope.) 2) <em>Corruption in Waterfox installation files.</em> (This possibility seems remote. After all, it was working well until now. ) 3) <em>Malicious extensions</em> (I have tried disabling all extensions, and there aren't that many.) 4) <em>Webpages will also fail to load if there's something wrong with the browser's code. </em>(This ""code,"" whatever that is. was working fine for all this time. A quick look-see led to this meaning of ""code"": ""..Code is made from C++ and C. Also javascript, pyhton, ruby, and many other languages."" That seems to be a long shot.) </p><p><br> Their recommendations (leaving out the ones that are not relevant): </p><p><br> 2) <strong>Update Waterfox</strong>. (I'm trying to avoid that. Of course, this might be the solution; however, It's not as though my version is that old and would have stopped working. Of course... who knows.) </p><p>4) <strong>Check Your DNS </strong>(Sounds like a lot of trouble; I don't think this will make a difference, as other browsers present no problem, <strong>and</strong> WF works in Safe Mode.) </p><p>5) <strong>Clear Waterfox Cache and Cookies</strong>  (I did that.) </p><pre>6)  <strong>Remove Unwanted Extensions</strong>  (I did that, by disabling the toggles, as suggested.)  </pre> <p>7) <strong>Reset Waterfox</strong>. </p><p>That might be the last resort, and I have the feeling a reset is not going to do the trick. Doing this will get rid of the video downloading extension I'm trying to preserve, and instead I'm hoping one or more experts might come up with another suggestion that will work.  </p><p><br> As an additional point, under Waterfox's ""Options"" &gt; ""Network Settings"" &gt; ""Settings,"" where the default choice under ""Configure Proxy Access to the Internet"" is ""Use system proxy settings,"" I fooled around by checking the first two, ""No proxy"" and ""Auto-detect proxy settings for this network,"" and neither selection did anything. I could not try the remaining choice, ""Manual proxy configuration,"" because I have no idea what figures or numbers to place for that one.
