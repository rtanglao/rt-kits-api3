Both of them reformat the layout of websites to make them more usable, and using sites without them is basically impossible for me. I have tried: </p> <ul><li> Restarting Firefox </li><li> Disabling the add-ons, refreshing, enabling the add-ons, and refreshing again </li><li> Checking for add-on updates (everything is updated) </li><li> Deleting and reinstalling the add-ons </li><li> Restarting my computer </li><li> Checking the permissions in the extension menu </li><li> Turning off all other extensions except for one of the ones with issues </li><li> Reading through the FAQs and help pages and following the instructions on some of them </li></ul> <p>Nothing has worked. Every time I reload one of the sites affected by this to check if it's finally worked, the site takes a very long time to load. Since these add-ons are for different websites and both aren't working, I know that the problem is not with the sites themselves.

Despite being unsure of the cause, if this problem occurs for a third time, I'm considering discontinuing the use of Firefox and advising others against it. I've lost my bookmarks multiple times, which is concerning. Although I initially attempted to recover my account using my email, I couldn't recall my password. Consequently, I utilized Mozilla's account recovery key. However, even after this process, my bookmarks, which were saved in the toolbar Come back  but shortcut labeled ""ROW""  Bookmarks are not come back. I'm seeking assistance to retrieve them or clarity regarding Mozilla's responsibility in this matter. While apologies are not necessary, I am focused on restoring my bookmarks or exploring options for compensation for the loss incurred. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1646816;,msehaljaved

However, if there is a way to keep tracking protection in place and only add an exception for ZScaler, that'd be great. Adding ""<a href=""http://zscalerthree.net"" rel=""nofollow"">zscalerthree.net</a>"" in the exceptions didn't do the trick. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1240;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",the.music.of.the.ainur
