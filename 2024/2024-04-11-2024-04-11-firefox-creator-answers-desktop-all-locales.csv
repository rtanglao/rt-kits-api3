All js, css, images came back with a 307 and the corporate authentication page, immediately followed by a call to the redirection, coming back as 200 ... but with the same auth page. I saw that the original request (the base html) was always sent with ""ssm_au_c"" cookie but page resource requests were not. </p><p><strong>I did solve the issue. I had to change the tracking protection options from ""Standard"" to ""Custom"" and uncheck ""Cookies"". </strong> Now everything works.<strong> </strong> </p><p>I don't really need an answer but, as others may have the issue and I can't post in the original thread (which is archived), I figured that I should post it somewhere. However, if there is a way to keep tracking protection in place and only add an exception for ZScaler, that'd be great. Adding ""<a href=""http://zscalerthree.net"" rel=""nofollow"">zscalerthree.net</a>"" in the exceptions didn't do the trick. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1240;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",the.music.of.the.ainur
