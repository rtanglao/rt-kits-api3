The profile completes successfully and shows it is disabled, but Firefox will still show it is enabled.  Has anyone else encountered this?  We are using our own DNS Resolvers and need to not have Firefox force theirs.  BTW, in order to avoid confusion, this is specific to MAC OS machines only.  Thank you! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",don.horvath

Despite being unsure of the cause, if this problem occurs for a third time, I'm considering discontinuing the use of Firefox and advising others against it. I've lost my bookmarks multiple times, which is concerning. Although I initially attempted to recover my account using my email, I couldn't recall my password. Consequently, I utilized Mozilla's account recovery key. However, even after this process, my bookmarks, which were saved in the toolbar Come back  but shortcut labeled ""ROW""  Bookmarks are not come back. I'm seeking assistance to retrieve them or clarity regarding Mozilla's responsibility in this matter. While apologies are not necessary, I am focused on restoring my bookmarks or exploring options for compensation for the loss incurred. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1646816;,msehaljaved

All js, css, images came back with a 307 and the corporate authentication page, immediately followed by a call to the redirection, coming back as 200 ... but with the same auth page. I saw that the original request (the base html) was always sent with ""ssm_au_c"" cookie but page resource requests were not. </p><p><strong>I did solve the issue. I had to change the tracking protection options from ""Standard"" to ""Custom"" and uncheck ""Cookies"". </strong> Now everything works.<strong> </strong> </p><p>I don't really need an answer but, as others may have the issue and I can't post in the original thread (which is archived), I figured that I should post it somewhere. However, if there is a way to keep tracking protection in place and only add an exception for ZScaler, that'd be great. Adding ""<a href=""http://zscalerthree.net"" rel=""nofollow"">zscalerthree.net</a>"" in the exceptions didn't do the trick. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1240;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",the.music.of.the.ainur
