Ik vind een artikel op Marktplaats en wil dat via een e-mail onder de aandacht brengen van een vriend. Op de web-pagina van Marktplaats staat een knop met een enveloppe. Als ik op die knop druk wordt er een beperkt scherm geopend van Firefox met in de kop ""about: blank"" en vervolgens opent zich een scherm van Thunderbird met de URL en het onderwerp van de pagina reeds ingevuld. Maar ook het e-mailadres van de afzender (ik dus) is reeds ingevuld. En daar zit mijn probleem want hier wordt steevast mijn oude vervallen e-mailadres ingevuld. En ik weet niet waar Firefox (of Thunderbird) dat adres vandaan haalt. Dus kan ik het ook niet verwijderen en gebeurt het me regelmatig dat er een bericht verstuurd wordt met de verkeerde afzender. Weet u wat ik moet doen? Met vriendelijke groeten, Carel Paradies </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,customize,nl,"",Quercusrobur999
