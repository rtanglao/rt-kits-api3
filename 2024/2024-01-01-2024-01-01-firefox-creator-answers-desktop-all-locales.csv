Apart for some curiosity attempts with other browsers, I always used Firefox. Back then you either could do some DIY or you were done for. So, I am not a noob. And yet I am not a programmer, and do not have to damn be in order to use a damn internet browser. I have no words to express how negatively the choice of changing the behavior of the X button, to make it disappear when a certain amount of tabs are open, affects my user experience with Firefox. I tolerated it version after version. Found mentions of about:config tweaks which never worked. Found mentions to css codes which seemed so complicated that I just gave up (I also don't have much capacity for such things atm). I was ready to get rid of Firefox today after all this time of being loyal. I would have, if it was not for Cor-El. (Cor-El you can put this testimonial on your website if you'll ever start a consulting business). </p><p><br> <strong>Little rant:</strong> I SO SO SO SO SO SO MUCH HATE bad UX Design! And the FIRST definition of bad UX Design is when a designer imposes their own tastes and preferences on the users, or makes assumptions (based on their own usage) about how users would do things. I don't give the lesser s... if Firefox's UX Designers usually only have few tabs open, or don't mind clicking on a tab to make the damn X button appear, or don't mind selling their beloved ergonomic mouse to buy a standard one with a mid button only to close tabs without opening them, of whatever the f... was going on in their minds when they decided to take out such an ESSENTIAL FEATURE!!! This change is WRONG! Nobody asked for it, nobody wants it, nobody likes it. The X button was not disturbing anybody. WHY must we tweak some f... about:config setting or ask in this Community for some css code to get back what should have never been removed!!!??? DO YOUR JOB, which is to make OUR user experience better, OUR, not yours!!! </p><p><br> <strong>Little help from my friends:</strong> After quick searches over a long time where I couldn't dedicate more resources to this, I came here determined to dig deep to find a solution. And I've found a few posts with answers from Cor-El. I followed his instructions in <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1403369"" rel=""nofollow"">THIS</a> post to configure a css file with the code that he provided in <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1413355"" rel=""nofollow"">THIS</a> other post (because I don't want the delay of the code he provided in the other post). Problem solved. </p><p>Now a question for Cor-El: Is it just me or the solution with the two browser.tabs settings does not work? It's the first thing I tried. I went from 50/50 to 200/200 to see if size matters. But no chance. Maybe there is another setting that must be activated for this to have an effect? Or was it prevented in newer Firefox versions (like the UX Destroyers really hate us)? Btw, I just noticed that the code you gave in the first post, the long one with delay that you use, doesn't work for me. While the code you modified for a guy in <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1403517"" rel=""nofollow"">THIS</a> post works perfectly. What could be the reason? </p><p>And 2 requests: - can you make some guide or pinned post about this, where you put together the info you gave in different posts? Something with your super easy instructions how to create a css file, and the two codes (with and without delay). And if the browser.tabs solution can still work, that too. All info in one single place, easy to find. - can you point me to a (possibly ADHS friendly) resource to more css codes for other useful tweaks, and to an explanation of what all about:config settings do? I like to tweak things to my needs. But I get overwhelmed if I have to read through tons of material. Thanks&nbsp;:) </p><p><br> </p><p><br> <strong>Bonus Material, Little Rant part 2:</strong> It's good and nice that people help each other and I am thankful, but it does not need to come to this. Sure, I've read that the (ridiculous) reason behind the choice of making the X button disappear was to avoid accidental closure of tabs. But WHY taking for granted that we are some&nbsp;!diots who can't even use a mouse properly? And even if it happens once, we can still go to the damn ""recently closed tabs""! But no, they had to remove the X button for all of us, to prevent a bunch of&nbsp;!%#@! from maybe sometime accidentally closing a tab. Why not just adding an option in the settings (NOT in some hidden ""about:config"") to let us choose if we want to have the damn button or not? Actually, a lot of these about:config tweaks are really useful and not dangerous at all and should imo be included in the normal settings. Keeping things simple and tidy does NOT mean reducing options. Unless you're Apple. </p><p>Please God-zilla let these <em>[censored content]</em> UX Designers read this post. </p><p><br> </p><p>Amen and happy new Xear. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-11;firefox-1210;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",Internetsaint

Having happily used Firefox for many years, I'm now finding two related issues: </p><p>1) Firefox is automatically increasing the font size on webpages (not all webpages, but many, inc. Google searches, Amazon, the Guardian). I have to refresh the page to get it back down to regular size. For example: I do a Google search; click on a link; return to the Google search, and at that point the text jumps larger. It keeps getting larger until I refresh, when the process starts again. </p><p>2) My Yahoo mail is unreadable in Firefox. The text is either too big or unreadably small - even within the same email. For example: I open an email that is a response to one I sent; the text of my original email is really large, and the text of the response is really small (like, 5 points or less).  </p><p>I can't think of anything that I did that acted as a trigger for these problems.  My Firefox is up to date. I'm using a Mac, and running Ventura 13.4; I recently upgraded from Monterey and had both these issues on Monterey and on Ventura. </p><p>Any advice would be much appreciated! </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1210;,firefox,other,en-US,"",roberts_jo

Ryzen 5700G, 32GB Ram, 2TB Storage, and a Radeon RX 580 (just to give some insight into the system in case it is useful). I use multiple mozilla services and haven't had many issues up until now. Everytime I open Firefox it immediately it fires right up, the moment I try to open a tab, search, etc.. it begins to lag. It will then freeze the browser and my entire PC soon follows suit. I have had to hard reset the PC about 3 times now. I originally had the snap version installed and thought that installing the deb package would fix the issue. I completely uninstalled the snap version and turned off unattended installations in case the system tried to reinstall the snap. I then installed the deb package and fired it up again, only to have the same issue. I have ruled out a couple of things on my end. I entered Firefox Safe Mode and unchecked all of my extensions (the only ones I run are Ublock, Bitwarden, and Relay). I ran a mem test and have been monitoring Psensor to ensure the CPU wasn't overheating (both of these tests were fine). I also scanned my entire PC to ensure I did not have any viruses (clamscan reported no viruses). I have been running my PC for about an hour now without starting Firefox and using Chrome, and I have had no issues with freezing or anything similar to what happened with Firefox. Not sure where to go from here. I love using Firefox and would love to get back to surfing as soon as possible! Any tips/help would be greatly appreciated! PS I could not find any logs about the session. I looked in ~/.mozilla/firefox/Crash Reports/events and couldn't find anything. If there is another place they are stored let me know and I would be happy to send them. I just don't want to open Firefox until I feel it is safe for my PC. </p><p><br> </p><p><br> I forgot to add: I disabled hardware acceleration as well, did not fix the issue. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;ubuntu-2204;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1627676;,aaronlnewman

This ESR is only good until September 2024.  I don't think it's supposed to be on the ESR channel since the OS is now 12.7, rather, it should just be on a ""regular"" update channel.
