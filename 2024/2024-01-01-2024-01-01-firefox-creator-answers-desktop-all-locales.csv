Having happily used Firefox for many years, I'm now finding two related issues: </p><p>1) Firefox is automatically increasing the font size on webpages (not all webpages, but many, inc. Google searches, Amazon, the Guardian). I have to refresh the page to get it back down to regular size. For example: I do a Google search; click on a link; return to the Google search, and at that point the text jumps larger. It keeps getting larger until I refresh, when the process starts again. </p><p>2) My Yahoo mail is unreadable in Firefox. The text is either too big or unreadably small - even within the same email. For example: I open an email that is a response to one I sent; the text of my original email is really large, and the text of the response is really small (like, 5 points or less).  </p><p>I can't think of anything that I did that acted as a trigger for these problems.  My Firefox is up to date. I'm using a Mac, and running Ventura 13.4; I recently upgraded from Monterey and had both these issues on Monterey and on Ventura. </p><p>Any advice would be much appreciated! </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1210;,firefox,other,en-US,"",roberts_jo

Ryzen 5700G, 32GB Ram, 2TB Storage, and a Radeon RX 580 (just to give some insight into the system in case it is useful). I use multiple mozilla services and haven't had many issues up until now. Everytime I open Firefox it immediately it fires right up, the moment I try to open a tab, search, etc.. it begins to lag. It will then freeze the browser and my entire PC soon follows suit. I have had to hard reset the PC about 3 times now. I originally had the snap version installed and thought that installing the deb package would fix the issue. I completely uninstalled the snap version and turned off unattended installations in case the system tried to reinstall the snap. I then installed the deb package and fired it up again, only to have the same issue. I have ruled out a couple of things on my end. I entered Firefox Safe Mode and unchecked all of my extensions (the only ones I run are Ublock, Bitwarden, and Relay). I ran a mem test and have been monitoring Psensor to ensure the CPU wasn't overheating (both of these tests were fine). I also scanned my entire PC to ensure I did not have any viruses (clamscan reported no viruses). I have been running my PC for about an hour now without starting Firefox and using Chrome, and I have had no issues with freezing or anything similar to what happened with Firefox. Not sure where to go from here. I love using Firefox and would love to get back to surfing as soon as possible! Any tips/help would be greatly appreciated! PS I could not find any logs about the session. I looked in ~/.mozilla/firefox/Crash Reports/events and couldn't find anything. If there is another place they are stored let me know and I would be happy to send them. I just don't want to open Firefox until I feel it is safe for my PC. </p><p><br> </p><p><br> I forgot to add: I disabled hardware acceleration as well, did not fix the issue. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",aaronlnewman

This was expected and worked just fine.  I recently updated the MacOS to 12.7 (Monterey) but Firefox desktop updates are still on the ESR channel.   </p><p>When I go to Firefox -&gt; About Firefox it says the desktop browser is up to date and that it's on the Extended Support Release.  This ESR is only good until September 2024.  I don't think it's supposed to be on the ESR channel since the OS is now 12.7, rather, it should just be on a ""regular"" update channel.  Is that correct?   </p><p>If no, will updates for MacOS Monterey cease in September 2024 too? If yes, how do I get back to the regular updates? </p><p>TIA </p>",desktop;other;firefox-11560;firefox-1156;,firefox,other,en-US,1627670;1627671;,dklballen

I migrated Firefox to them (as well as a iphone or even Amazon Fire) without their being ruined..don't understand why they, and any other folder on the macbook show under head category of 'mobile bookmarks'. That seems contradictory.  B/C I was concerned about the lack of support on firefox (and my mail server-another story),  I noticed these files and the folder do not transfer, say, to Chrome (or icloud). What little info there is on mobile bookmarks doesn't have real workaround.  I tried creating HTML or JSON folders on my desk top but those too aren't picked up by another browser like Chrome...furthermore, Firefox ""export bookmarks"" doesn't allow individual folders to be exported, only the whole lot (except those mobile ones!). NO one told me using sync (or even icloud for storing desktop files/folders) would mean I can never export to other browsers! </p>",desktop;tips;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1210;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",buggeroff6969
