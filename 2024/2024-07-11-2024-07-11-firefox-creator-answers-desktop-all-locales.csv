The only thing i can possibly associate this with is the fact that I've been installing fonts onto my Mac for use within a new graphics design suite that I purchased. While i have been performing that task, i cannot possibly come up with a reason as to how this has happened. Google does not operate like this on Safari. I typically don't use Safari and I use any Google products as little as possible... my primary browser is Firefox .. i tried to reset the configuration using the info i found to reset Firefox to it's defaults... i even tried to uninstall and reinstall Firefox... If the font had changed to something farily legible it wouldn't be so bad, but this horrific looking 'Asian style' font is barely legible.. any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1280;customize-settings-and-preferences;,firefox,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",erik.nica.2019

My security programs are Malwarebytes Premium, Windows Defender.Security, and Acronis. There is an Extension called, 'Protect My Choices'. Love It! I have it on all my Browsers. It keeps alot of junk off from my PC. In all my other Browsers, in the Extension details it states ""Automatically allow access on the following sites:"" I just don't move the button over to on, and the Extension keeps all that junk off from my PC. In Firefox, the above statment and the botton is absent, and all that junk is allowed onto Firefox (Yikes!). I went through Mozilla's Help, Troubleshotting, and Search. I haven't been able to find any clue as to how I can get this Extension to work in Firefox. Any assistance in this matter will be greatly appreciated.
