I have a lot of graphics design that I will be doing for an unknown period of time. I have over the years collected many free fonts and I started installing them about 5 days ago. I don't believe my installing fonts wouldf have affected anything within Firefox, but Firefox is the only browser that I'm having this problem with. I checked Safari and google displays everything as it should as well; my graphics deisgn software forums are displaying fine. I have not used google for anything during the period that I was installing the fonts, so I don't know exactly when this started but yesterday I discovered it. </p><p>I tried going to the menu on the top right hand corner -&gt;  Help -&gt; More Troubleshooting Info -&gt; Refresh Firefox. I then went into MacCleaner Pro -&gt; Clear Cache and Clear Purgable Data. Then restarted the machine. No change. </p><p>I then saved my passwords and bookmarks, then uninstalled Firefox using MacCleaner Pro and then went to Remove Remaining files. </p><p>Downloaded a new copy of Firefox and the problem still exists. </p><p>I tried changing the theme to others. Went to Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Language and Appearance. Set theme to dark, then back to automatic. Changed the main font from (Default) Times to Times New Roman and back to (Default Times) ... but still this problem exists... </p><p>Help...

These new AI firewall systems are installed in some countries by their governments to suppress free speech, or just spy on its people. These firewalls, as you may already know, uses DPI-SSL system, which decrypts packets traveling from user to the main website. To decrypt the HTTPS packets, these firewalls uses its own self signed CA certificates.  So I am asking the firefox developers, that why you guys allow this privacy issue? Does the packets sent from a firefoxe browser to other websites are also decrypted, by these firewalls? If yes, then why you guys allow this? Firefox must ONLY allow a specific CA certificate made for firefox browser only. Firefox browser must never let other third party softwares, or any software, to decrypt its encrypted packets. This is a serious privacy issue. With these firewalls, they can see what users write in chats, or posts, they can see witch content we are watching on a website, they can see who we follow on social media platforms, they can see which content or posts we like and etc. Even passwords are not safe anymore, which e use for any website of platform. When passwords are not safe, so does our accounts of various websites. This is a serious privacy breach.  </p><p>These firewalls is a weapon for those countries which want to suppress free speech or suppress opposition sides in a government or spy on its own people.  </p><p>Please let me know if I am mistaken or my concerns are genuine. </p>",desktop;needsinfo;windows-10;firefox-1280;protect-your-privacy;,firefox,protect-your-privacy,en-US,1661307;1661308;1661309;1661327;,ivonikzoraf

Due to some company policies, I had to uninstall it. Eventually, I was able to overcome some oddities and finally could reinstall Firefox. But when I logged in, sync was neverending (matter of hours, if was just stuck); thus I refreshed it, but no luck whatsoever, still neverending sync. Tried a few refreshes and reinstalls until eventually everything was fine.  </p><p>Unfortunately, during this process something must have been damaged as I lost most of my extensions and themes. So I decided to reinstall them one by one. For some of them everything went just OK, but some others (e.g. FoxyTabs) cannot be installed anymore, see screenshot. The path is: </p> <ol><li> Click add button </li><li> confirm I want to add the extension </li><li> that error is shown (translate from italian: An unexpected error occurred during the installation) </li></ol> <p>I really don't know what to do.

Like for example <a href=""http://reddit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">reddit.com</a> or <a href=""http://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">twitter.com</a> does not appear even though I visit those pages often and more than any other page. It doesn't make sense that a random website shows up immediately as I visit it once, but not the websites I visit often. So I have to type in manually in the search bar to get there instead of just clicking the shortcut on the startpage. </p><p>I COULD pin the websites on the startpage, but the pictures only show up as the automated pictures such as ""R"" or ""T"" for Reddit and Twitter respectively. I'm also having problems using my own pictures for the shortcuts and I'd rather fix the problem instead of having to pin websites as shortcuts. It also looks a bit ugly in my opinion. </p><p>This started happening after I switched Microsoft accounts on my PC and started using Firefox on another user account. By the time I switched, I was logged into the same account on two different users on my PC, and I synchronized several times. That other logged in user is now removed from my Firefox account and I also completely deleted the other user on my PC to free up space. I have completely uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox and deleted all the files on my PC, but it still doesn't work.

The only thing i can possibly associate this with is the fact that I've been installing fonts onto my Mac for use within a new graphics design suite that I purchased. While i have been performing that task, i cannot possibly come up with a reason as to how this has happened. Google does not operate like this on Safari. I typically don't use Safari and I use any Google products as little as possible... my primary browser is Firefox .. i tried to reset the configuration using the info i found to reset Firefox to it's defaults... i even tried to uninstall and reinstall Firefox... If the font had changed to something farily legible it wouldn't be so bad, but this horrific looking 'Asian style' font is barely legible.. any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1280;customize-settings-and-preferences;,firefox,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",erik.nica.2019

My security programs are Malwarebytes Premium, Windows Defender.Security, and Acronis. There is an Extension called, 'Protect My Choices'. Love It! I have it on all my Browsers. It keeps alot of junk off from my PC. In all my other Browsers, in the Extension details it states ""Automatically allow access on the following sites:"" I just don't move the button over to on, and the Extension keeps all that junk off from my PC. In Firefox, the above statment and the botton is absent, and all that junk is allowed onto Firefox (Yikes!). I went through Mozilla's Help, Troubleshotting, and Search. I haven't been able to find any clue as to how I can get this Extension to work in Firefox. Any assistance in this matter will be greatly appreciated. Thanks so for your time and consideraton of my sad saga </p>",desktop;windows-11;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;customize-settings-and-preferences;,firefox,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",justsleeping33

Then, it stopped, but since I don't use Chrome very often, perhaps the behavior was still the in the right circumstances. </p><p>Happened today.
