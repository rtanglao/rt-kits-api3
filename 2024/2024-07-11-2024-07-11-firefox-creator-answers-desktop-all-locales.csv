The solution suggested under [1] is how to make Firefox usable again, stopping it from open this particular markdown file. But it doesn't solve the actual problem: either Firefox is capable of rendering markdown in which case it should do it; or it's not in which case it shouldn't try. Does anyone have a thought on that? </p><p>[1] <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/de/questions/1436228"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/de/questions/1436228</a> </p>",linux;desktop;troubleshooting;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",s.witzel1

Like for example <a href=""http://reddit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">reddit.com</a> or <a href=""http://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">twitter.com</a> does not appear even though I visit those pages often and more than any other page. It doesn't make sense that a random website shows up immediately as I visit it once, but not the websites I visit often. So I have to type in manually in the search bar to get there instead of just clicking the shortcut on the startpage. </p><p>I COULD pin the websites on the startpage, but the pictures only show up as the automated pictures such as ""R"" or ""T"" for Reddit and Twitter respectively. I'm also having problems using my own pictures for the shortcuts and I'd rather fix the problem instead of having to pin websites as shortcuts. It also looks a bit ugly in my opinion. </p><p>This started happening after I switched Microsoft accounts on my PC and started using Firefox on another user account. By the time I switched, I was logged into the same account on two different users on my PC, and I synchronized several times. That other logged in user is now removed from my Firefox account and I also completely deleted the other user on my PC to free up space. I have completely uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox and deleted all the files on my PC, but it still doesn't work. I have checked in about:profiles and it says there is a ""default-release"" and ""default"" profile. </p>",desktop;windows-10;firefox-1280;customize-settings-and-preferences;,firefox,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",jorgjolars
