One is my desktop which has Windows 10 Home.  The other is my laptop which has Windows 10 Pro.  The Windows 10 Home was installed most recently and is the latest version of Windows 10, my tech guy told me; and also the latest version of Firefox 123.0.1.  The laptop version of Windows 10 is older.  The Firefox version is also 123.0.1. </p><p>My hope is that there is a setting I have not uncovered that lets me put some kind of mark on a new tab, as my laptop has had for a few years.  This makes it very easy to open.  The newer, later Windows version but same Firefox 123.0.1 on the desktop must be right-clicked in the space to the right of any open site, and then the user must scroll down to the ""New Tab"" line and click on it.  Obviously this requires my user clicks and more time, simply to get a new tab that gives me a blank site that I prefer. </p><p>I appreciate whatever guidance or suggestions anyone can give. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1230;firefox-12301;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1642860;,LManross
