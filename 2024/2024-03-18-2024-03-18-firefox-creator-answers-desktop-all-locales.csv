The alternative is to continually move my hand back and forth to the other ""/"" shared with ""?"". Both are annoying and unnecessarily take extra time.  </p><p>I would very much like to disable the keyboard shortcut attached to the ""/"" key on the numerical keypad. </p><p>Thank you! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1230;firefox-12301;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ilkilzer
