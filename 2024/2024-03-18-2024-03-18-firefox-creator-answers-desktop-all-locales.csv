I'm used to pressing Super(Win key) + Grave(`) to type ""`"" because the Grave key itself is a global shortcut for opening the terminal window. It works as expected in the other applications, but not in Firefox input fields. If the site is capturing the key presses, it will handle the super + key as usual. For example, GitHub will surround the selected word with ` symbols on grave key press. This problem is not limited to super + grave, but any other letter. For example, Super + q is expected to produce the letter ""q"", but in Firefox it produces nothing. </p><p>I'm trying to identify why the Super + key behavior in Firefox is different from other systems and if I should open a bug or not.
