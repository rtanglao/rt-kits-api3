After years of being ok, the link won't download or it downloads partially and the wheel of death keeps spinning. The only solution I have found is to switch to Google. This time my earthlink email downloaded but would not allow me to scroll down on an individual page. Then it wouldn't download at all.  I don't know if it is connected but an odd graphic has been showing up just before the email loads.  Picture a U facing right with jagged teeth closing the U.  I really don't want to switch to Google. Please advise. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",chelleym

Then when it opened, all that was on the screen was the menu (file edit view history bookmarks tools help), the ""search or enter address"" box, and in the upper right hand corner the words ""private browsing"" with the purple circle and eye eyeglasses icon.  That's all.   I have tried looking at my profile. It seems to still be there. This seems to be a problem with the Firefox software itself. I have re-downloaded the software three times, the last time I uninstalled Firefox from my laptop and totally reinstalled. Every time I get the same results. This almost blank screen. Let me be clear. There is no purple background, there is no Firefox icon, there are no tabs, there is no customized menu bar, there is no search box in the middle of the screen. I'm working on a Windows 10 laptop 64 bit. Please don't tell me to upgrade the Windows 11, the laptop won't take Windows 11.  I get the same window whether I open the regular fire fox or the private browsing Firefox. </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",maryjtynes

My Mac Pro laptop was too old and would not support the newer OS.  In installing a OS, I lost my bookmarks and the menu bar that gave easy access.  I've since purchased a new Apple Air laptop and everything from the old laptop has been migrated over. </p><p>However, working with Apple support and the local genius bar Apple store rep., nobody has been able to help me rebuild the links to a menu bar for quick access.  Presently I have some bookmarked.  I have to go to the book marks to access any particular URL.  All the directions on the web have not provided way to do this! </p><p>Thanks, Barry &lt;Interns2llnl@charter.net&gt; </p>",macos;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",interns2llnl
