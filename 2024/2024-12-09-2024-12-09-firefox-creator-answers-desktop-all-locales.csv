Then when it opened, all that was on the screen was the menu (file edit view history bookmarks tools help), the ""search or enter address"" box, and in the upper right hand corner the words ""private browsing"" with the purple circle and eye eyeglasses icon.  That's all.   I have tried looking at my profile. It seems to still be there. This seems to be a problem with the Firefox software itself. I have re-downloaded the software three times, the last time I uninstalled Firefox from my laptop and totally reinstalled. Every time I get the same results. This almost blank screen. Let me be clear. There is no purple background, there is no Firefox icon, there are no tabs, there is no customized menu bar, there is no search box in the middle of the screen. I'm working on a Windows 10 laptop 64 bit. Please don't tell me to upgrade the Windows 11, the laptop won't take Windows 11.  I get the same window whether I open the regular fire fox or the private browsing Firefox. </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",maryjtynes
