I tried going back to an earlier installation of Firefox and reinstalling that, but still have no luck.  Please tell me (although not by email, obviously) how I may access my emails.   Telephonic communication is difficult because of weak or often absent signal, but people seem able to reach me on WhatsApp - same number: (027) 083 686-7539. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",asstute

See Computer2.png </p><p>At first, I thought it was a problem with the computer, but I tried using Chrome on Computer 2 and it works fine . See Computer2A.png </p><p>I cannot think of anything that might be causing this. I have even gone through the Settings pages side-by-side to make sure all the checkboxes are identical. Nothing different that I can find. There are other web pages that do similar things with fields that are not usernames or passwords, but all passwords and usernames for the other website I login to are remembered fine, and they are all listed in the saved passwords section of Settings. </p><p>Any help or ideas I could try would be appreciated. </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",cooky1

I don't know if it is connected but an odd graphic has been showing up just before the email loads.  Picture a U facing right with jagged teeth closing the U.

Then when it opened, all that was on the screen was the menu (file edit view history bookmarks tools help), the ""search or enter address"" box, and in the upper right hand corner the words ""private browsing"" with the purple circle and eye eyeglasses icon.  That's all.   I have tried looking at my profile. It seems to still be there. This seems to be a problem with the Firefox software itself. I have re-downloaded the software three times, the last time I uninstalled Firefox from my laptop and totally reinstalled. Every time I get the same results. This almost blank screen. Let me be clear. There is no purple background, there is no Firefox icon, there are no tabs, there is no customized menu bar, there is no search box in the middle of the screen. I'm working on a Windows 10 laptop 64 bit. Please don't tell me to upgrade the Windows 11, the laptop won't take Windows 11.  I get the same window whether I open the regular fire fox or the private browsing Firefox. </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",maryjtynes
