The old SATA SSD was removed from old PC, had W10 on it and that had FFx 133.0 installed; successfully transferred the bookmarks to another W10 PC but not the Passwords/logins.  Transferred all the information from the Mozilla folder (per Firefox/Mozilla help) to a USB: plugged it into my new computer and did the same transfer of the Places, Key4, logins, and favacons to the new computer: no change. Just finished uninstalling FF and removing the Mozilla file from App Data, then doing a complete reinstall; then added the old places etc. to the new install.  Nope, didn't work. So what's going on with FF and W11?? Is there a solution?  I have been with Firefox now for over 10 years and have never had these kinds of problems moving my information. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",NoStall
