This seems like a no-brainer and should be a standard function on any browser. It only shows that Mozilla is getting left behind, even Edge has this feature, what makes it worse...IE had this feature and that is considered ancient tech now. from:  kenmendell Now that I've got you and we're on the subject, Firefox seriously, MOST seriously, needs to bring back the ""Bookmark All Tabs"" command and have a ""Save All Tabs"" command of its own. There are no third-party apps and Add-Ons that do this very well anymore or at all, the older ones that used to do this no longer work well or at all. Firefox needs them in the browser to stay. It's never been the same without the ""Bookmark All Tabs"" command and trying to ""Save All Tabs"" the same way you would save a single page with ""Save Page As"" is frustratingly impossible to do. Any older Add-On or program that did this no longer works well or at all and hasn't for almost a decade or longer. It needs to be a standard function of any advanced browser. Firefox needs these functions as the normal standard. So, bring this up with your design team as an imperative because my having to migrate to these other lesser capable browsers the way others have doesn't appeal to me when Firefox should be a decade beyond their design and development, especially for functions that shouldn't be difficult hurdles for any modern browser to have. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",charles.r.krause
