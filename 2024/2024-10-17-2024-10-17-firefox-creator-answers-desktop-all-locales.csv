When I choose ""Default"" Margins, the document is printed in the correct size, but without any margins. When I choose ""Minimum"" Margins, the document is printed with acceptable margins (12mm left, 4mm top), but the document is only printed in about 50% (or even less) size. Scale is set to 100 each (assuming those are percent) This is also visible in the print preview. </p><p>For the second printer, same issue (at least on print preview, didn't actually print) No issue (in print preview) when selecting ""Microsoft Print to PDF"" When choosing ""OneNote (Desktop)"" printer, the image is even smaller. </p><p>Tested around with custom margins a bit and it handles even worse. With my primary printer with 0.5 inches (defaults?) set, the size is ok but no margins are applied. Headers and footers are not shown (so the checkbox is checked - for some unknown reason) - Changing top margin to 0.49 or 0.51, the document is not shown, but the headers and footers are. Setting all margins to 0.00, both document and headers and footers are shown, but all overlapping / within the 4x2 document (paper size is set to Letter). Increasing the top margin (all others on 0.00) now makes the document shrink even more (Print preview, I didn't actually print) </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",reti
