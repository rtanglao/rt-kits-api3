If I instead use the scrollbar I have no issues at all. But when using the touchpad, firefox is not responsive. The scrolling delays several seconds or does not even work at all.  I am using PiHole  and probably firefox still tries to load ads which are blocked by PiHole. But as I am not interested in ads, I would like to be able to scroll throught the page while firefox still tries to load the ads.  That is perfectly possible without any delay by dragging the scrollbar.  But it's not possible without lags using the touchpad. There is no issue using chrome or edge.

Once authenticated, the website receives a session cookie that it uses for subsequent API requests. </p><p>I've configured the CORS headers on both Apache and Nginx, but I can't get it to work in Firefox. Interestingly, the same setup works perfectly in Google Chrome. </p><p>Here's an example of the headers I receive using a curl call: </p><p>curl -X OPTIONS <a href=""https://crlliria.moval.es/web/session/authenticate"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crlliria.moval.es/web/session/authenticate</a> \ -H ""Origin: <a href=""https://gis.moval.es"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gis.moval.es</a>"" \ -H ""Access-Control-Request-Method: POST"" -I -k </p><p>HTTP/1.1 204 No Content Server: nginx Date: Wed, 04 Dec 2024 10:23:24 GMT Connection: keep-alive Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <a href=""https://gis.moval.es"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gis.moval.es</a> Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS, PUT, DELETE Access-Control-Allow-Headers: DNT,User-Agent,X-Requested-With,If-Modified-Since,Cache-Control,Content-Type,Range Access-Control-Max-Age: 1728000 Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8 Content-Length: 0 </p><p>Despite these headers appearing correct, Firefox throws the following error: </p><p>""Credential is not supported if the CORS header ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ is ‘*’."" </p><p>I know the Access-Control-Allow-Origin value is not * (it's set to <a href=""https://gis.moval.es"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gis.moval.es</a>), so this message might not reflect the real issue. However, I can't figure out how to debug it further. </p><p>Questions: </p><p>Is there anything specific about Firefox's handling of CORS and credentials that might cause this issue? Are there tools or techniques I can use to diagnose the actual problem? Could there be a subtle discrepancy in the request or response that Firefox is stricter about compared to Chrome? Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1691923;,salvador.sanchez.aroca
