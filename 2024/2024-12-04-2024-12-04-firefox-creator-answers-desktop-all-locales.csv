However, the action has completed on the server. This only started happening in the last couple of weeks.

1477106,2024-12-03 17:18:17 -0800,2024-12-03 17:18:17 -0800,Old mac firefox failure,"<p>Over the last month or so Firefox has been failing on my old mac OS10.15.7. I go to my mac in the morning and firefox just won't start. I try to rebuild but holding down the option key when starting the app does nothing. I restart, sometimes resetting PR. That has helped in the past but doesn't now. I have re-downloaded and re-installed. I have deleted the firefox folder in library App support. As soon as one thing works it happens again after a day. I don't know what the hell is going on but I don't like it. I have run anti-virus software and malwarebytes. They are not picking anything up.  </p><p>I have another mac which uses up to date OS and that works fine. </p><p>Is it a case of using a specific older version of firefox? I have tried an older version from another boot drive (startup disk) using OS10.13 once and it also only worked for a day or so. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",richman2

When I add a new bookmark, my routine is to open Manage Bookmarks, drag the new bookmark to the second (lower) Other bookmarks folder, then choose Sort &gt; Sort by Name. I have also tried A &gt; Z Sort Order. The sorts work within the Manage Bookmarks window, but they are not saved automatically, and I do not see a way to save them manually. Also, if I go to the Other Bookmarks folder on the far right side of the Bookmarks Toolbar, I have to scroll down to the bottom of the list to see my new bookmarks. They are not in ascending alphabetical order the way I want them. </p>",firefox;accounts;firefox-1330;,firefox,accounts,en-US,1691857;1691879;,betheloveyouare
