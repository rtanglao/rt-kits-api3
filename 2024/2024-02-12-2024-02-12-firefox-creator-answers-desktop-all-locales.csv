Currntly I'm using 123.0b9 (64 bit) beta FF on W10 and I have this undefined problem with sound when use firefox (problem has start about two months back)- until today I couldnt find the way to make it sound correct with no rattling in the background.  Situation occurs when watching any youtube videos od listining some live  audio stream (probobly html5 audio in both cases). I was looking for some answers and find out that there was some simillar html5 sound rattling problem already solved some time ago- but this solution does not work for me (I have try to make some settings ""false"" in ""about:config""). I have also try to manually disabled all the extensions and to run firefox in the ""problem solving mode"" - both with no luck. The solusion for me was to enable ""Use hardware acceleration when available"" - but I already disable it for a reason - scroll and other extra mouse functions works only when this function is disable... Now i finally have the good sound quality without scrolling or poor sound and scroll - but not both. I hope we can fix this somehow </p>",desktop;beta;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",cekin86
