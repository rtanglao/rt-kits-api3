I never had a problem with Windows 10, but since I got a Windows 11 Dell laptop a couple of years ago I have been unable to use some websites. This one in particular: <a href=""http://french.typeit.org"" rel=""nofollow"">french.typeit.org</a>. It allows me to write in French, with French accents and some special characters and letters that do not exist in an English keyboard. Always worked flawlessly with FF on Windows 10, but with Windows 11, I am able to write in English, but when I hit a French character nothing happens. I tried disabling all extensions, deleted history, etc., in vain. I contacted the app developer, and after a back and forth exchange with him he determined Firefox sees my laptop as a mobile device, and that is why his app will not work. He said he thought there was nothing I could do on my end, so FF needs to do something.  I use this app with the Brave and Edge browsers with no problems at all, but I would much prefer to use FF if I can.

I have also try to manually disabled all the extensions and to run firefox in the ""problem solving mode"" - both with no luck. The solusion for me was to enable ""Use hardware acceleration when available"" - but I already disable it for a reason - scroll and other extra mouse functions works only when this function is disable...
