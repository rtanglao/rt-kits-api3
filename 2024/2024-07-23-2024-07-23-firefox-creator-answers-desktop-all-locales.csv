Roughly, in the last 2-4 months, all the sudden, opening up new youtube webpages, tabs, videos, takes a while, 5-20sec to fully load a new page, and when I open a new youtube tab, my laptop fan starts spinning loudly, for ~20-30seconds. Once the page is loaded its fine again. Basically opening up a youtube page is slow, and its acting like its same as playing a modern video game on my computer which is ridiculous.  I have edge installed, although I rarely use it, and it does not have this problem at all, its fast, and laptop fan does not spin. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1280;,firefox,other,en-US,"",hamsalty56

But the issue is even after using the biometric scanner or entering a PIN number, I still have to manually enter the payment information because the field does not autofill. What do I need to do in order to fix this? I have updated my payment information and ensured the information is correct. </p>",desktop;troubleshooting;windows-11;firefox-1280;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",arlittle13

All the files from my old computer were transferred into one big folder and placed on the Desktop of my new computer.  I don't know how to find the right file in the backup and where I need to copy it to on my new computer.  I know a while ago I had to recover my passwords, but I forget the steps I went through and it was all on the same computer so slightly different situation although as I recall it was not all that difficult.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1280;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1663598;1663599;,terriejky
