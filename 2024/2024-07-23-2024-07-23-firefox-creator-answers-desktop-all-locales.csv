Before this happened (and I didn't make any changes, just turned on my computer one day and things changed) I could open a new tab and it opened with my chosen URL, which happens to be <a href=""http://msn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">msn.com</a>, and say after opening I did a search for something and then clicked a link, it would open the link. Now I click a link and it shows a new tab up top, but never opens anything, just the circle going and going and going.  Also when I open a new tab I can only get a blank page or Firefox default page, where I used to get my msn page.  When the problem originally started I uninstalled Firefox and reinstalled in hopes it would fix this, but it didn't.  I have spent hours trying to Google an answer.  As soon as I use Edge, everything works fine, I can click links all day long.  I have used Firefox forever and don't want to give it up, but if I can't solve the problem, I can't use it because it's SO frustrating and time consuming not to be able to open a link.  The blank page or Firefox default I guess I could get used to, even though it's super annoying for it not to work, when it did for years.

Roughly, in the last 2-4 months, all the sudden, opening up new youtube webpages, tabs, videos, takes a while, 5-20sec to fully load a new page, and when I open a new youtube tab, my laptop fan starts spinning loudly, for ~20-30seconds. Once the page is loaded its fine again. Basically opening up a youtube page is slow, and its acting like its same as playing a modern video game on my computer which is ridiculous.  I have edge installed, although I rarely use it, and it does not have this problem at all, its fast, and laptop fan does not spin. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1280;,firefox,other,en-US,"",hamsalty56

All the files from my old computer were transferred into one big folder and placed on the Desktop of my new computer.  I don't know how to find the right file in the backup and where I need to copy it to on my new computer.  I know a while ago I had to recover my passwords, but I forget the steps I went through and it was all on the same computer so slightly different situation although as I recall it was not all that difficult.  Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1280;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1663598;1663599;,terriejky
