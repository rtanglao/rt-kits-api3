Recently I've noticed that the behavior for Firefox is significantly different and my initial guess is that something in Firefox is intercepting my shortcuts and resizing my windows instead allowing my window manager to handle it. For reference, the shortcuts I have for my third party window manager are listed below and result in different behavior when focused on Firefox compared to other applications: </p> <ul><li> Position window left: `Cmd + Ctrl + H` </li><li> Position window right: `Cmd + Ctrl + L` </li><li> Position window center: `Cmd + Ctrl + M`  </li></ul> <p>Is there a way to disable this? </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",phamcake

However, a short while after launch, it starts delaying about five seconds before opening the same, small PDFs, whether they are on disk or fetched via the network, and regardless of whether they are cached locally or downloaded. I've examined the performance profile of the slow loads, but I'm not sure what to look for. </p><p>Restarting the browser reliably makes PDF loads snappy again, but the effect doesn't last very long, less than an hour before the five second delay returns.  </p><p>I've seen this behavior on all PDFs, but here are two examples: </p><p><a href=""https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2468.pdf?q=20240122183210"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/2468.pdf?q=20240122183210</a> (68 KB) <a href=""https://s1.q4cdn.com/806093406/files/doc_downloads/test.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://s1.q4cdn.com/806093406/files/doc_downloads/test.pdf</a> (3.82 KB) </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ravron
