Firefox has truncated my ""History"" to 15 days and the only option I see to get elder entries is to combine a backupped history file with the current one. An easy-to-use tool for this task would be welcome. I did not change my config options after the update to 121.0.1 (64-Bit) (Windows 10pro) but I think I had the total history (from years) before the update. My current Options related to this topic are: browser.history_expire_days	false	 places.history.expiration.max_pages	false	 places.history.expiration.transient_current_max_pages	501234	 privacy.clearOnShutdown.history	false	 privacy.history.custom	true	 history	(*) Boolean Number String </p><p>I already sreened Help files of this Forum concerning lost history data but they all do not give  sufficient answers or I do not understand  them (as a German user).
