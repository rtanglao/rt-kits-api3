That seemed to have been picked up some time ago. I just moved over to Chrome until it was fixed. </p><p>Now we have problems again. This time, ebay recognises that I'm signed in, but when I do anything like try to add a product to my Watch List, I'm told to re-enter my password (or PassKey) but whatever I choose password or my PassKey, Firefox simply cycled back to the password screen. </p><p>I've attached a screenshot to show the screen I'm talking about. See attached. </p><p>When I move over to Chrome and follow the same process, everything works perfectly. Definitely a Firefox specific issue. As I have the same addons configured on both browsers, including my Keeper Password Manager. </p><p>This is a new issue since the last upgrade as I recall.

Mind you i do have several Firefox windows open in multiple workspaces comprising over 100 tabs on a good day.  However, most of these tabs had gone to sleep or were forced to sleep by me with the <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/auto-tab-discard/"" rel=""nofollow"">Auto Tab Discard add-on</a>.  I didn't notice anything obvious in about:performance.  ChatGPT said to try running `Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('video'))` in the console which returned an empty array.  I thought that command checked every tab but it only applied to the tab I started the dev tools from.  Maybe if there was a way to add a <em>for</em> loop to check all active tabs, it could be a useful command. </p><p>Since it was getting to the point I'd have to restart Firefox to fix this, I tried some more drastic measures first, like putting every tab to sleep with Auto Tab Discard.  Now about:processes only listed core Firefox processes like: itself, Fork Server, Network, Utility, Extensions, 3x About Pages, and 3x Preallocated.  Even then firefox was still inhibiting the idle action!  I think close all of the internals I just listed, so only ""Firefox"" was listed in about:performance, and still firefox was inhibiting the idle action! </p><p>Finally I closed Firefox and finally `gnome-session-inhibit --list` didn't list firefox anymore and screen started blanking again.  So I guess that was a bug?  How to troubleshoot that better and track down the cause?  or should I just go ahead and post this already as a Firefox bug? </p><p>Thanks </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",scarlion
