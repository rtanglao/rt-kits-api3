When performing search in Address Bar in Firefox before update (previous OS editions), pressing ""Control, Return"" automatically added the .com to the address and went directly to the site requested. Since updating to OS Sequoia, performing the same task, it will still take the user directly to the .com address, but now shows the following illustrated in the attached file. This does not occur when using Safari or Opera. Did the OS Sequoia update break something? </p>",firefox;browse;firefox-1310;firefox-13103;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",gwvwadc

Initially I copied the profile folder back, as I had a recent backup. However, when I sync'd, it deleted a bunch of extensions - which then sync'd and deleted them from laptop A too. </p><p>I got them back (manually) on A, deleted the new installation on B, then reinstalled and resync'd (without copying the profile folder). Same thing happened, except as I wasn't coming from the profile, I'd also lost a bunch of settings. So even worse. </p><p>My theory (based on the popup about syncing with a mobile device) is it is, for some reason, syncing with my Android phone config (which doesn't have all the same extensions, as they're not compatible) instead of my browser on A. </p><p>Has anyone else encountered this?
