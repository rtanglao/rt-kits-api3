Just got a brand new laptop and had everything set up but when I shut down system overnight, this morning I booted up and nothing was saved in Firefox!!!!  HOURS of work wasted.  So I again spent all morning doing it all again.  Just now -- my browser closed automatically in the middle of work I was doing and everything disappeared again.  I have been a LOYAL user of Firefox for years but I'm not doing this again.  I despise all other options but need urgent help NOW to guide me through.  Is it this Private Browsing? thing that showed up I didn't choose?  How do I get rid of it?  I'm a novice online but can be taught.  Waste of my life and time.... </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",joy4thejourney
