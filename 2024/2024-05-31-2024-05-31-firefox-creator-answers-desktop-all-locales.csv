However, even though Sync is activated, I cannot find my Mozilla Firefox password anywhere and am unsure of what it is. Is there anyway that someone who works at Mozilla can give me access to my password? </p><p>I am happy to verify my identity and prove that this is indeed my account, but I am not sure of how to go about doing so. I really need access to all of my data, and would be highly thankful for any assistance regarding this matter. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,other,en-US,"",mlicastri12

I don't have these problems if I switch to Edge. If I'm watching streamers on Twitch the streams pause while Outlook loads. It didn't used to do this. Something about that mail service is really hanging up the browser and it struggles more and more. There is always delay as it tries to load everything. The first email will take a while before it loads up. Sometimes if I close the tab and open a new one and try again it loads up faster. I've have all my cookies reset with this recent firefox update, everything got wiped for some reason, but getting them set up again doesn't help it. Clearing Cache hasn't helped it. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1655176;,yamano
