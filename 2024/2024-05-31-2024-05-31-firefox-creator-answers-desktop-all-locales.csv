I tried to play audio/video from 3 different websites - Youtube, <a href=""http://123greeting.com"" rel=""nofollow"">123greeting.com</a> and Gettr and while the video played, there was no audio coming out on any of the sites. I have no problems watching and hearing videos on my other browsers - Brave and Vivildi so this issue is with Firefox on multiple websites. Please advise as to where to look for some switch to turn the sound back on my Firefox browser. Thanks </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Curleyhead

Despite that version 126.0.1 (64-bit) was automatically installed. Which I only found out about because after causing FF to freeze, and basically crashing the work I was doing, and forcing me to kill the task with task manager, I get the ""FF is installing your update and will start in a few minutes"" at restart.  </p><p>After looking thru the help forums I have set app.update.background.enabled and app.update.background.scheduling.enabled to false. (They were both true despite the setting selected.) </p><p>Two things: </p><p>1. I DO want to be notified when updates are available. I just don't want them to happen at your convenience. Will I still be notified of updates with these config parameters set to false? </p><p>2. If you have a setting that says ""Don't Update"" and I select that option, you should not update. There is clearly a problem somewhere. </p><p>Edition	Windows 10 Home Version	22H2 Installed on	‎2024-‎04-‎09 OS build	19045.4412 Experience	Windows Feature Experience Pack 1000.19056.1000.0 </p><p>(Windows reinstall via Microsoft's cloud reset ""save my data"" option specified... though some stuff got wiped out due to hard drive issues) </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",DebraBk

It worked fine, and then stopped. I'm not sure what changed. It doesn't matter what printer I use. Even printing to PDF fails. No errors appear, and nothing shows up in the printer queue. All the other applications in Windows print just fine. It's just Firefox. And just for this one Windows user. </p><p>I tried clearing the saved printer settings in the about:support page. I tried refreshing Firefox. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox. I tried uninstalling, removing the mozilla folder in %appdata%, and reinstalling Firefox. No luck. </p><p>The only time I can get it to print anything is to log into a different user account on this same PC. Printing from Firefox seems to work then. </p><p>It seems there is some user-specific printer setting/file/whatever that is messed up.

I don't have these problems if I switch to Edge. If I'm watching streamers on Twitch the streams pause while Outlook loads. It didn't used to do this. Something about that mail service is really hanging up the browser and it struggles more and more. There is always delay as it tries to load everything. The first email will take a while before it loads up. Sometimes if I close the tab and open a new one and try again it loads up faster. I've have all my cookies reset with this recent firefox update, everything got wiped for some reason, but getting them set up again doesn't help it. Clearing Cache hasn't helped it. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1655176;,yamano
