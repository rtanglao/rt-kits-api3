Now it has stepped up a gear. I can use the internet for anything, but the moment I open my Hotmail account in Firefox my Lan card stops working. At first I had no idea it was Hotmail, I tried everything from switching cables to using wifi only. When it happened on wifi I realised every time I went into Hotmail on Firefox my network card stopped functioning and I had to restart the computer. The thing is, when I use Hotmail through Microsoft Edge nothing happens and all is well with the world!!! No network card shutdown. I could read between the lines but I'm no conspiracy theorist, however, I don't think the problem is with Firefox. Is there any solution? I don't use Edge and I don't want to start. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1250;firefox-12502;,firefox,other,en-US,"",markadonald

This needs to be fixed. YouTube offers their Premium subscribers videos which can be played at a higher bitrate, which means even 1080p can play at a higher quality. When setting quality on a video, in addition to the 1080p, you can choose ""1080p Advanced bitrate"" as an option. Firefox has trouble playing these files, whereas Safari and other browsers don't have a problem with YouTube. Please fix this. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1250;firefox-12502;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1649130;1649167;,silvermanpictures
