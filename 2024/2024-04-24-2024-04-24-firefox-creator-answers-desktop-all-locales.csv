It's fixed after another manual restart. This unfortunately breaks all the streamlining Firefox has done to restore the session after an update, because none of that stuff works the same after a manual quit and restart. This is happening on MacOS, and it happens across multiple computers. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1250;firefox-12502;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",uqrcobgezp

This needs to be fixed. YouTube offers their Premium subscribers videos which can be played at a higher bitrate, which means even 1080p can play at a higher quality. When setting quality on a video, in addition to the 1080p, you can choose ""1080p Advanced bitrate"" as an option. Firefox has trouble playing these files, whereas Safari and other browsers don't have a problem with YouTube.
