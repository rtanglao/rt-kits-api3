I tried the suggestions in order and the first one didn't  have a ""Restore previous session"" option and the second one had ""Recently closed windows"" greyed out! And, when I entered ""about.support"" in the address bar (top rightish), I received a notice that I couldn't reach Google (Remember that I don't currently have internet access on my laptop). So, no joy there either!
