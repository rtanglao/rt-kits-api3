For possible translations i have only put english. Some pages, for example, whatsapp web is showing in russian ( i mean the app data for sure, not the messages), also some homepages i use open automatically in russian. How can i put latvian by default or if its not available for the homepage, put english automatically? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",enammomugs

This needs to be fixed. YouTube offers their Premium subscribers videos which can be played at a higher bitrate, which means even 1080p can play at a higher quality. When setting quality on a video, in addition to the 1080p, you can choose ""1080p Advanced bitrate"" as an option. Firefox has trouble playing these files, whereas Safari and other browsers don't have a problem with YouTube. Please fix this. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1250;firefox-12502;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1649130;,silvermanpictures
