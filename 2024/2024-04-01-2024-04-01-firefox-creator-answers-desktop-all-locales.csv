Here's how it looks in pictures (moving ones&nbsp;:) ) to make it clearer <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrJa60LHEws"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrJa60LHEws</a> </p><p>2- Another question please, <em><strong>why are add-ons disabled on <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a> pages, and is there a way to enable some of them on there&nbsp;?</strong></em> </p><p>Thanks for your attention and any help you can provide.
