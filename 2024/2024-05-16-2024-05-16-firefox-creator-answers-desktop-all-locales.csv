I kind of believe a shift in Intel has caused some of these issues, but probably not important (and I've already contacted them and did not get anywhere) at the moment. </p><p>Essentially, having Firefox running crashes the Intel UHD Graphics system, <em>typically</em> it is the UHD 620, but I believe I have some systems with a UHD 630.  On Windows, I get a blank screen for 1.5 seconds, on macOS it crashes the entire Mac.  I...I have a hard time wrapping my head around the fact I'm the only one with the issue and has occurred on multiple computers over a period of 18 months.  The systems in question include the following: </p><p>Dell Optiplex 5040 MT - Fixed by putting a GTX 1650 in its 16x slot. Dell Optiplex 5060 MFF Dell Latitude 7290 Dell Latitude 7490 MSI GF63 (9th generation revision) MacBook Air 2020 w/ Intel i3 under macOS. </p><p>The thing is, with the exception of the MacBook, PCs don't report any issues apart from a ""Hardware Failure"" within the Reliability Monitor and the aforementioned screen shutoff.  With World of Warcraft I'm able to reproduce the issue consistently under both DX11 and DX9, but Firefox not so much.  I do see it occurring only on YouTube videos on the MacBook and is more common to occur on PC, but I have also had it happen on normal browsing. </p><p>I can turn off hardware acceleration and have done so, but I do wonder how much of an impact it will make on power efficiency on say, battery power.  Would be something that should be fixed and I would like to put effort into getting it resolved, but I have no idea where to start.  All drivers are up to date, Intel Boost is disabled (and I wonder if having it set as so causes this, though the MSI has no such BIOS setting) and it only occurs on Windows PCs with Windows 11. </p><p>Thanks for reading. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1260;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ikouy
