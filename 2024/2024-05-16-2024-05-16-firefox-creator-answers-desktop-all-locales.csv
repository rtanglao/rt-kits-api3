Then, I reset Windows, choosing the option that lets you keep your files (most of them it looks like) while it reinstalls everything else.  </p><p>I knew it'd wipe Firefox and I'd need to reinstall it, but when I synced my account, it didn't have logs. The logs are archives of various chats on a website I used to talk to friends. I know those used to be accessible through Firefox's directory under Program Files by checking the data saved for that website (something I had to do once before to remove corrupted logs), but that data obviously wouldn't be there now. </p><p>I should've considered this beforehand but I had no idea that data for different websites might not be included in a sync. It does have files for Firefox but I decided not to touch them, since I'd already synced and I didn't know if reverting to that Backup might break Firefox somehow. Or worse, cause me to lose MORE data. </p><p>Question now is, what's the chance those might be in that backup I saved?
