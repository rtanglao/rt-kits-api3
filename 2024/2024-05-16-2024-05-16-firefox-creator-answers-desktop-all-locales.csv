Then, I reset Windows, choosing the option that lets you keep your files (most of them it looks like) while it reinstalls everything else.  </p><p>I knew it'd wipe Firefox and I'd need to reinstall it, but when I synced my account, it didn't have logs. The logs are archives of various chats on a website I used to talk to friends. I know those used to be accessible through Firefox's directory under Program Files by checking the data saved for that website (something I had to do once before to remove corrupted logs), but that data obviously wouldn't be there now. </p><p>I should've considered this beforehand but I had no idea that data for different websites might not be included in a sync. It does have files for Firefox but I decided not to touch them, since I'd already synced and I didn't know if reverting to that Backup might break Firefox somehow. Or worse, cause me to lose MORE data. </p><p>Question now is, what's the chance those might be in that backup I saved? More specifically, data stored about websites I visited. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1260;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",freshfriedtrash

To get straight to the point, whenever I am watching a YouTube video on Firefox in full screen, every so often the screen goes black then slowly fades back in. I have no idea how to fix this issues and it is not my computer that is causing it (doesn't happen on other browsers, my computer was tested for a variety of problems and nothing was wrong, etc). I have also looked through Firefox Reddit help pages and the support articles on the Firefox support website but have found nothing to help. Any suggestions or help would be much appreciated! Thank you&nbsp;:) </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1260;,firefox,other,en-US,"",becca.l.laing
