I do not believe I ever set a Primary Password or Master Password with Firefox, and I have been using Firefox for many years.   When I go to the Settings page, it says to confirm my current Primary Password in order to change it.   But I need to know my current password to do that.   I also unchecked Primary Password, and got a pop-up that said if I remove my Primary Password my information will not be protected if my computer is compromised.   Obviously, I don't want that to happen.   Is it possible I am being asked for a Primary Password because I am using a VPN?   Please advise on how to resolve this problem.   I can't change my password, and I can't confirm ever setting one so I am concerned.   Thank you. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Bonniebc
