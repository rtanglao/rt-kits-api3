But lately, and apparently only in FF, the logos are discolored by some kind of overlay? </p><p>Please see attached comparison between Chrome and FF. Chrome displays the logos unaltered, and FF displays them with this crazy obnoxious overlay/ color correction. </p><p>As far as I can tell, this is coming from FF as I don't see it in any other browsers/ devices. Chrome, FF Developer Edition, MS Edge, and Safari do not alter the logo colors. </p><p>Is there anyway to request the Mozilla FF stop doing this?  I can't possibly begin to imagine how this is helpful in anyway to users... but of course I'm open to hearing any logic behind this decision, if in fact this is coming from FF. </p><p>Thank you all for your time and help! </p>",desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",muzzle

I tried troubleshooting (formerly ""safe"") mode, and the problem isn't as bad but is still present as far as I can tell. The only extension I can think that would be making it worse is Tree Style Tab, but I don't know enough about interpreting Firefox profiles to verify. </p><p>The only reason I consider this odd is because doing the same thing in Chrome doesn't have this issue on this same device. If I open many tabs quickly, Chrome itself is still responsive. Those newly opened tabs may take a while to load and become interactive, but it doesn't affect the rest of the application. I pay my ISP for gigabit DSL, and as far as I can tell that is roughly what I get. In my case, Firefox doesn't behave this way. </p>",desktop;beta;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1220;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",noah16

I have gone through your troubleshooting advice and googled various topics to figure this out. Nothing. It is frustrating, especially when one of the broken sites is my work portal. This cannot continue, so I will be forced to change browsers. I use both Mac and Windows computers if that helps.
