However, when viewing the account settings and the connected services section, I saw that Firefox was connected to ""[full legal name]'s Firefox on [laptop name]."" I did not supply Firefox with my real name, and I suspect that Firefox is simply reading the name of the account I used to log into my laptop. However, changing the name of the device account is not easy as it is linked to my Microsoft account, but even after successfully doing so using the command center, the connected services still reads my real name. How do I change this? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",FerrousOsteon
