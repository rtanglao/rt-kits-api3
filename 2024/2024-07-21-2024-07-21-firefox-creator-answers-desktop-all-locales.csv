Is Mozilla 'blocking' access?,"<p>Since doing an update on the Firefox browser, I am unable to access one specific website that had no issues prior.  The website that is no longer available to open in Firefox is owned/managed by an organization outside of the USA.  After 3 or 4 days of attempting to open this specific website, I launched a Google browser and had no trouble opening the website.  I am hoping that Mozilla is not going to the culture of suppressing religious freedoms by deciding which websites can and can not be accessed on that basis. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1280;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",travelrew
