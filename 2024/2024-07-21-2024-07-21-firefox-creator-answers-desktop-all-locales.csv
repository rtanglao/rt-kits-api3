Now I have a perfectly smooth scrolling on both displays, regardless of which GPU is used in Windows-&gt;Settings-&gt;GPU (nvidia's is arguably a little but more responsive). </p><p>Hope this helps someone, or maybe dev team could look deeper into this. </p><p>Thank you for the great browser! </p>",desktop;tips;windows-11;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",alexeysamosyuk
