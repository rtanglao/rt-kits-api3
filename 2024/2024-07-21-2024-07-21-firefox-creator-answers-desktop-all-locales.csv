Now, EVERY time I open FF (using W10), the sidebar will NOT show up unless I click CTRL + B or the icon on the bar on top of the window. I have installed nothing. Nothing crashed. FF is up to date. I refreshed it. I uninstalled it. I REINSTALLED it from scratch. I performed a system restore FOUR TIMES, yet cannot get back my sidebar when opening FF. Further, when I open the sidebar with CTRL + B, the column is VERY narrow and I have to widen it. So it appears that FF cannot remember the setting for the sidebar and defaults to a skinny one when activated. I ran troubleshooting mode and YES! The sidebar works as it should and opens with a new browser opening...ONCE. I disabled/deleted ALL extensions (I only use four), but I have not changed any parameters of FF or my system in general for this to be happening. I've checked EVERY setting in FF over and over, trying everything that could be relevant. Now what? After reinstalling I'm left with the same problem. What can I do? I cannot live with NO sidebar on startup. Oh and the silly Bookmarks bar DOES work, but I don't use it...it's stupid and I don't like the look or placement of it. This problem is SIDEBAR ONLY. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1280;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",jerrystigliano

Sites I remained signed into with 7 now have to be signed in every time with win11. Even if Firefox isn't closed between visits. ex: Youtube, forum sites, etc. I don't know if this is FF or win11 doing it. I didn't change any settings in FF on 11. Any help or direction appreciated. </p>",desktop;windows-11;firefox-1280;customize-settings-and-preferences;,firefox,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",johndapper
