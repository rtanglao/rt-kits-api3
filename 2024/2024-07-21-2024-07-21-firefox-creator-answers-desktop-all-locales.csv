Sites I remained signed into with 7 now have to be signed in every time with win11. Even if Firefox isn't closed between visits. ex: Youtube, forum sites, etc. I don't know if this is FF or win11 doing it. I didn't change any settings in FF on 11. Any help or direction appreciated. </p>",desktop;windows-11;firefox-1280;customize-settings-and-preferences;,firefox,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",johndapper
