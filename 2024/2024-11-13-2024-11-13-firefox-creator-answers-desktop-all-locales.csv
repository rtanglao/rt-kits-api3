I know I can use the CTRL+B key combo to get the bookmarks sidebar to show but I had it set-up such that I could close Firefox and later reopen it and the bookmark sidebar will still show upon reopening Firefox.  Now, each time I open Firefox, I have to hit CTRL+B again for the Bookmarks sidebar to appear again.  I can't seem to find the setting to keep the bookmarks sidebar to always show.  Any ideas? </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",mdb5016
