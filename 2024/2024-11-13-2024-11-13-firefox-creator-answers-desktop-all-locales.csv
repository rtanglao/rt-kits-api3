I never saw this before the Norton Graphics User Interface was updated to the most current one.  I tried completely uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox, but No change.  With some websites, for instance <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org</a>, I see the normal ""Connection secure  &gt;"", right underneath the ""Site information for <a href=""http://support.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">support.mozilla.org</a>"".  But with something like:  <a href=""https://www.att.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.att.com</a>, I see the error that I never saw before.  I sent a message to Norton with this information too, but I don't know if they will respond or not.  I know that I'm still getting the ""Connection secure  &gt;"", above the error, but it bothers me to see that error underneath.  I am on Windows 10, using Firefox 132.0.2, at the moment.  Also, Windows 10 is version 22H2 (OS Build 19045.5131), so I have all the latest patches.  On my Windows 11 PC, that Norton is still using GUI version 22.24.8.36, I Never see this error.  (Windows 11 is on the newest Windows version, with all patches installed; and Firefox is version 132.0.2) </p>",firefox;browse;firefox-1320;firefox-13202;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",phoneman762

I know I can use the CTRL+B key combo to get the bookmarks sidebar to show but I had it set-up such that I could close Firefox and later reopen it and the bookmark sidebar will still show upon reopening Firefox.  Now, each time I open Firefox, I have to hit CTRL+B again for the Bookmarks sidebar to appear again.  I can't seem to find the setting to keep the bookmarks sidebar to always show.  Any ideas? </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",mdb5016
