Since a few days, I cannot connect to any of my services in my local network. My MacBook has the ip 192.168.10.86, and I cannot connect with Firefox to an address in the subnet 192.168.10. or to any other directly connected (e.g. virtualized) services like a web server running on 192.168.66.4 with a virtual Nic (via UTM) 192.168.10.1 </p><p>Unfortunately, every other app on my Mac is able to connect these services, via terminal, Safari browser or with the brave browser. It is irrelevant if I use local names (either via a local dns-server or via /etc/hosts) or if I use the ip as the intended target. </p><p>What have I done so far: Re-installed Firefox  Started with a clean profile Started with private mode Nothing helps </p><p>I started the logging (when I tried to connect to my router 192.168.10.1), here is some of the output, which makes no sense to me: 2024-11-13 16:54:26.870426 UTC - [Parent 63592: Socket Thread]: V/nsHttp FindCoalescableConnection(..........[tlsflags0x00000000]192.168.10.1:80^partitionKey=%28http%2C192.168.10.1%29) no matching conn honestly, I have no idea, what a correct line would look like. </p><p>At the end, I captured the traffic with Wireshark. Here it is getting tricky: I see the successful dns-connection, but there is absolutely no request to the http(s) port to the intended system. If I use a vpn back to my home net, everything works fine. But if I am ""correctly"" connected, no connection is established. I tried to change some of the network parameters with about:config, but either did not hit the right one or it does not help. </p><p>Even if I use a proxy system in my local net and use it in Firefox, there is no successful connection to this local system, if I try to connect with Safari, it works like charm.  </p><p>So, does anybody of you have a good idea where to look or check internal details of Firefox?

I thought it would be great to share our favorite tips and tricks with each other! </p><p>Here are a few of my favorites to kick things off: </p><p>Boost Privacy with Enhanced Tracking Protection 🔒 Did you know Firefox has a built-in feature to protect your privacy? Under ""Privacy &amp; Security"" in the settings, you can turn on Enhanced Tracking Protection, which blocks third-party trackers and unwanted cookies. It’s a quick setting that gives extra peace of mind! </p><p>Organize Tabs with Simple Shortcuts 📑 I’m always juggling multiple tabs, so using keyboard shortcuts has been a lifesaver! Try pressing Ctrl + Shift + E (or Cmd + Shift + E on a Mac) to get a quick overview of all open tabs. You can then jump between them effortlessly. </p><p>Get Faster Browsing with Pocket Integration 🧳 Ever see a cool article but don’t have time to read it? Just save it to Pocket, which is integrated with Firefox! It’s perfect for building a collection of things to read later, even offline. </p><p>What are your go-to Firefox hacks?
