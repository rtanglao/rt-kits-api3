If FF is not running &amp; I click a link in another program (email, GIMP help menu link, etc.) FF opens the linked page but <em>also opens the home page (2 tabs)</em>. If FF is running, the linked page is opened in a new tab, leaving current tab(s) in place, the expected behavior. </p><p>FF is default browser. Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed is selected. Created a vanilla test profile with no modifications to settings, made it default, and got the same result. </p><p>On my previous laptop (don't remember FF version - whatever the latest Intel ESR version was about a month ago) opening FF from the OS opened to the home page. Opening FF (not running) from a link in another program opened <strong>only</strong> the linked page and <strong>not</strong> the linked page + home page.

If I manage to ""close"" the tab, it *appears* to close, but it's very clear that whatever Hulu is doing is still going on in the background. This time I was at least able to open the task manager and kill Firefox – which immediately alleviated the problem, and upon reopening Firefox, the Hulu tab was still there (indicating it never closed). </p><p>I don't know if this is possible, especially given I don't know what's causing the bug with Hulu, but it would be nice if Firefox was better able to handle a tab getting out of control like that. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",epiqu1n

The posted solution is to disable any compatibility options but in my case none are selected. This is driving me nuts, does anyone know of a solution?
