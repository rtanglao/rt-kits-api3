Now, the reason of contacting support is more of concern than anything. When I pressed it, a weird message has been attached to it, so I am wondering why, as it is confusing to say the least. I've attached a screenshot with the saves, which also has the weird message and YouTube for comparison next to it. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,other,en-US,"",321093798057623

If I manage to ""close"" the tab, it *appears* to close, but it's very clear that whatever Hulu is doing is still going on in the background. This time I was at least able to open the task manager and kill Firefox – which immediately alleviated the problem, and upon reopening Firefox, the Hulu tab was still there (indicating it never closed). </p><p>I don't know if this is possible, especially given I don't know what's causing the bug with Hulu, but it would be nice if Firefox was better able to handle a tab getting out of control like that. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",epiqu1n
