Non riesco più ad utilizzare Firefox, soprattutto perchè quando devo fare delle procedure online non vedo i campi da compilare! Ho seguito le istruzioni trovate: tolti i plugin (c'era solo privacy badger), svuotata la cache, provato in modalità risoluzione problemi, disintallato e reinstallato firefox, provato la navigazione anonima, ho disattivato windows defender.... MA NON HO RISOLTO NIENTE.  Quache ipotesi o suggerimento? Grazie Sandra </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,fix-problems,it,"",sandra.cerioni
