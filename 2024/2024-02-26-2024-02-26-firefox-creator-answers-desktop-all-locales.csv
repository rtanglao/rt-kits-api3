It shows up on the status bar at the bottom of the page (that's what it used to be called).   Sometimes I can't. </p><p>Somewhere around the same time as I started noticing this, I had just upgraded to a Win11 computer.  So, when I try to hover over a suspicious link, I get nothing!   </p><p>Is there code these people can put in that shields them from hover? So, we can't see what we're getting into?   If so, then I presume if I can't hover, don't click... Right?  </p><p>TIA </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jdelucien

Something odd has happened with Firefox. </p><p>When I select a different Window from the Window dropdown, or from the Dock, sometimes there is a ""sliding sideways"" effect. </p><p>And if I go into Firefox by going to the Dock and tapping its icon - it goes to one window; BUT if go to the Dock and tap again, it changes to another window. I think, always the same two. </p><p>So its sort of behaving like ""spaces"" does, but when I view all the ""desktops"" in the selection view at the top of the screen, I only see one containing Firefox windows. </p><p>Its really annoying when the window changes like that, and I don't know how to get them into a single grouping.  I have quit &amp; reopened many times, but it persists. </p><p>If I knew which of the Firefox Windows were in each of these glitchy ""pseudo-groups"" then I might quit all of one group, and then re-open them.  Not sure if there are just two such pseudo-groups, or more. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1011;firefox-780;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",s1s1s11
