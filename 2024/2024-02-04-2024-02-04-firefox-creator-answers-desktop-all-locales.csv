If so then I recommend you the thread handling of the movie where the playlist is the list of tabs and the movie is the current page used by the user. So tell me: what the hack takes so long to open the current so in priority order wished to see and access page. What the hack the firefox does in the background when its initialization takes for ten minutes and when that is done(firefox is responsive) then another five minutes to load the actual page? Firefox is pretty unprofessional as a software in many ways and it is bleeding from many of its basic development wounds just like the playlist idea. A big development in the name of modernity toward the future, meanwhile tens of years now there are 'that is such a basic thing so the developers should know and fix' things to be forgotten. </p><p>As so as: -The playlist idea (session management) How many movies do you watch at the same time? 20, 30, 50, 1000? Oh, then you are very lucky to be so 'talented' because most of people watches one mostly, i think. So when you have a huge session like mine with more thousands of pages in a session 'waiting in the background to its time to be visited' then why should i be wrong with lots of session pages meanwhile i visit only one at a time just like the other pages would not exist. So who is the wrong? Me the user who opens one page of its pagelist and can't access it because of EXTREMELY SLOW PERFORMANCE, or the developer team who obviously misses the 'BASIC IDEA OF BROWSING' for tens of years. How much time should i wait additionally to finally get a browsing experience? I am waiting for about 20 years now to Firefox finally figure out 'the basic browsing ideas' mentioned in this text. So since those are still not figured out i think its enough time to wait and tell you the obvious ideas. First of all that should be cleared that i know the Firefox's ideology where there is a 'basic functionality browser expanded by add-ons' where the developers does not want to realize an all in one browser but provide strong basics for extending and customizing. The second of all that should be cleared that is firefox is likely provides those basics (almost done) but that is not, So it is always almost working but not, and that is pointed/redirected to an add-on issue meanwhile that is a basic browser issue. Firefox is defending itself againts charges like mine which tells that firefox is slow. Rather than listening this thing firefox team simply denies this fact by telling 'firefox is not slow' it has a good performance, and you -the user - should align your add-ons etc. So this closedness against performance feedbacks are pulling back the development of the basic browser idea which is also can be called a browsing engine/shell etc. so that provides the functionality on a basic level. This section marked by hypen proves that you are the wrong ones. However Firefox seemingly manages resources in the background to provide performance and works as it's given in my advice there is something wrong in the realization because THERE IS NO WAY when you work with a so called linked list and selecting an item to use that results in ten minutes long loading except some really hard computing task like rendering or something which is far from the browsing section. So FIREFOX DEFINITELY DOES NOT WORK. A little bit programmatically for developers. When you have a 0..N-1 list loaded into the memory then a N=99999 element list is not a big deal to handle even an old computer. So this list can be stored the urls, and page titles and a pointer to the currently runing page which is a single index of the active tab. It can be extended by measuring performance to list of currents/actively parsed/running etc. indexes where the browser measures its own performance but the top of the priorites is always the current one which is SELECTED BY USER. So indeed there is not more task but one. And when there is only one task: the single page to handle then THERE IS NO WAY of ten minutes initializations and five minutes loading (parsing). So firefox is slow because it somehow tries to access a cache which is fragmented and it has a long access time which makes the performance extremely slow and/or slowly parses its 'json objects' and/or let the websites to hang the browsing by 'not answering'/service denial. This last one is pretty interesting because if there are lots of active pages without PROPER MANAGEMENT OF PRIORITY then a backgroundly parsed page can be hanged externally by a website and force tha browser to waiting for its answer, meanwhile the answering pages(websites) are not handled so they experiencing slow requests from the client (the basic firefox browser fuctionality). So if you are a professional system andminister and experience slow data streamings/rare reuests towards you then you will 'punish' that connection by several ways by drop/priorize to low/denie/report in a bad reputation service that connection. So if you want to avoid YOUR USERS TO BE PUNISHED BY YOUR PRODUCT then you care with the speed of 'BACKROUND PAGE' loading. The timout does not solve the problem caused by multithreded requests stucked but forced to wait for connection. You should care the basic browser functionality to defend the DOS(Denial of Service) kind of issues by priorizing the browser activity. The very first is always must be the current page so the browser can not let the other websites in the background to block the connection and enslowering the browsing cycles (the running of tasks). It is also true for  add-ons. So first load the answering then let the slow ones to perform their lazy working and not check that in every microseconds but let them hang, and limit the hanging number of hanging threads to avoid out of memory and other out of resources issues. So the resources can't let to be wasted by harmful activities. It is all about the priority of program running cycles according to the actual hardware resources. So when 90% of 100% is provided to handling answering processes and the remaining 10% is STACKED for and forced to wait until finish/timeout then your browser will never be slow except when the computer and/or the internet connection is completely slow and that is the full ability which can be used by A WELL ENGINEERED BROWSER. PLEASE NOTE THAT WRONG MANAGING OF NON-ANSWERING EXTERNAL SITES MAY CAUSE SLOW REQUESTS TOWARD OTHER SITES WHICH MAY PUNISH THE SLOW CONNECTION BY DROPPING/AND OR SLOWING (RARE ANSWERS/SLOWER SPEED) which may make the browsing even slower than that sholuld be, MEANWILE A BROWSER CAN NOT LET A SINGLE SIMPLY SLOW/AN ATTACKER WEBSITE TO EXTEND ITS EFFECT TO THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE BROWSER AND OTHER SITES. A single website simply can not let to enslower the other threads and the solution is the priorisation. Please note that indeed there is always only a single site to care with and that one is which is selected by the user. That does not really matter, how many windows or tabs are in a session because that is a simple list. This is THE BASIC BROWSER IDEA, meanwhile obviously there can be multiple opened windows with player but THE FIRST IS ALWAYS FIRST when there are two media playing site opened and one actively selected by user and the other is in the background then at low system resources the backround one is OBVIOUSLY should be limited to ensure the minimal performance for the current one. That is so obvious that letting multiple threads eating more and more resources leads to stucking of the browser and that won't be able to answering websites, collapsing because of out of resource issues etc. that i do not understend what the hack takes so long to finally properly manage the resources and place the most important current page to the top of the priority list of the browser session.  OK, this part marked by hypen is described pretty abundantly to solve that. A final notice (i mean something important to mark meanwhile you are not forced to do anything) is the DOS effect of rare answering which affects to every visited site which is may lead to a bad reputation issue for Firefox. Both eating resources or let infitely wait for an answer of a site meanwhile the others are forced to wait in the line and backrounded. The proper way of management has been described before in summary the first is always the current page which is selected by user which is followed by 'fast sites' which is followed by 'slow sites' so a bad site and/or bad guy is 'backrounded' so that 10% of resources won't make the browsing experience slow and/or unpleasant. That's all. </p><p>-The selection idea I really do not know and that is very hard to imagine where the 'BASIC BROWSER FUNCTIONALITY' minded developers experiences their adventures meanwhile so called development, but seemingly not about MULTISELECT. How the hack that 'MULTISELECT PAGES' can be forgotten for tens of years from history of firefox and multi-tabbed browsing?????? Not aggressively, but kindly ask: where is your mind meanwhile developing tabs? THE MULTISELECT IS DEFINITELY A BASIC FUNCTIONALITY. For example close, bookmark, move etc SELECTED. That is completely missing for very long time so please don't get hurt because of that where is your mind form of ask because i am wondering how such an every daily basic functionality which is partially available in Firefox and millions of lists of programs can be forgotten. I think that is a really urgent thing to rethink. A simple menu point with a key combination (hot-key) and/or shift and/or ctrl +left click on tab which should be work as it works all the other millions of softwsres with multiselect list like file explorers. (ctrl+left button click=single page; shift+left button click=from current to clicked; ctrl+shift+left button click=previous selection is kept meanwhile new selection is added/removed (if that is selected) between last selected item and left button clicked item). There are so many BASIC OPERATION blocked in realization by this missing fuctionality. Please imagine my 5000+ tabs session to handle without multiselect and with multiselect. For example youtube pages can be selected by also by search filter 'youtube' and those selected pages could be sent to a bookmark map then that saved pages would not be necessary to kept and those all can be closed so this way most of the 1000 of pages could be manage and close so the session pages including the resource related effects and performance of Firefox would be much-much better, meanwhile the pages which are not 1000 years old and inactive do not make a mass where from the wished ones is hard to find because there are so many pages. This makes the user experience worse bacause that is very exhausting especially compared to the described way. Unfortunately the firefox does not provides a list of its browser pages to manage so such things where from a such kind of list the user multiselect the list items and 'bookmark selected', filter and select by keyword etc. is impossible. I also NOTE THAT bookmark is only a single page but there is also NO WAY TO BOOKMARK PAGE TREE WHERE THE WHOLE NAVIGATION IS BOOKMARKED NOT ONLY THE LAST PAGE. Thanks for slow performance of firefox and its resource eating way of working sometimes i should navigate from a page away to a 'EMPTY NEW PAGE' until it is visited. This is because the basic idea of fast access where the pages are not bookmarked and 5 minutes later retrieved from not another window than the current browser window like a 'permanent bookmark' where from the opened page cannot be easily removed just like closing a tab but with double indeed triple syncronisathion way management where first the tab bookmarked, then browsed from bookmarks, then visited, then closed the tab, then retrieved from bookmark, then removed from bookmark. So basicly the problem is a page where there are multiple content to visit but its pages also have multiple contents. So walking this tree hierarchy, meanwhile some content is the same(repeated) some content is new can not be managed by bookmarks, but some site does not provide permanent content because that replaces/renews its content even by a simple reload and the precious one content wished to visit is gone forever causing some frustration. Typically a home page of youtube like streaming site where there are lots of interesting possibilites but without a way of remembering that is lost after refreshing/reloading after restart including the annoying forced collapse one, where the previous browsing is gone forever and that never be the same. So a fast and the only way is to visit and remeber is the right clik-&gt;open in new tab which is restored later. But in a list with 300 element may result in even 25/30 or the whole theoretically all the 300 element opened in a new page by the mentioned 'safe remembering' reason which is unfortunately not supported by browser and by websites because the opened new threads may be too much. So sooner or later collapse happens which results in granted session lost. I do not know what do you think about 'BASIC BROWSER FUNCTIONALITY' when restoring a previous browsing session incompletely this way, and what do you think about a good browser but i think that is highly recommended to rethink those basics because there are lots of permanent FIREFOX BASIC ISSUES UNSOLVED SINCE FIREFOX EXISTS. I am just waiting for the UPDATE which solves these problems and nothing happens. This is why i write these abundant lines because i am tired of this situation and my patience is over (the hope is totally lost) toward Firefox community to solve these trivially simple task by its own cold headed organizing thinking where they figure out and realize that is something wrong with Firefox and fix it in short term. So that is enough to be patiently waiting for fix a serious issue by 20 years, and i think that is the right thing to make some abundant helping toward the good direction words, and realizing some message to you, because that is seems to be necessary. Please don't be hurt by the truth, where the young user gets old meanwhile experiencing the same issues unsolved, and after that this fact gets honestly marked by these words. Better later then never so i hope this helps. That is not intended to make not constructive pure hurting people but the reason is based on the mistery of very long term unsolved issues to face with them. as a fact. So this is a feedback kind of note which is not for hurt but finally solve the long time missing by presentig the fact and by presenting the reason of why i should write such long reports when the developers handle the basics at least the 'very basics'. So please do not blame me or deny the necessary realization of fixes because you may do not like that that was an idea of a very frustrated user with some years of programming experience by the way.  So from analisation of personal relations back to the problems. Firefox should provide a way to manage its session which is can not be solved by bookmarking. This is because the lost data in connection with browsing history of a specific tab where that previous pages are all get lost because only the current page is bookmarked meanwhile using bookmark for browsing compared to tabs that can be called as the frustratingly exhausting browsing horror. The page is a good solution to create easy markings and this marking section(operation) can be easily realized with an open in new tab without visiting or visiting when navigated (selected as current). So over adding the new pages to the tablist the firefox has no any browsing activity to lunch, meanwhile tabs are opened fast as light immediately, and can be restored, even visited when the proper moment arrives for the user  to finally effectively visit that page which is 'marked by page'. Since Firefox imeddiately starts to visit new tabs without giving a chance to simply open a tab then that burns the processor in the hell, its able to send even a gamer computer to hell - i hope not this is the fire part of Firefox - meanwhile the current page starts lagging, stopping until THE BROWSER GETS TOTALLY UNRESPONSIVE UNTIL ALL THE PAGES ARE LOADED IF SO AND THAT DOES NOT COLLAPSES BEFORE FINISHING THE NOT NECESSARY TASKS. This is about the wrong way of managing the browsing itself because there is a wrong order, a wrong priority of visiting(browsing) sites which is the BASIC BROWSER FOR. So not i am the wrong when opening lots of new tabs and do not use bookmark or do not visit links one by one. The one by one way result in data loss in short, the bookmark way store a link for eternity which is not the same as closing a tab. A bookmark can not be 'closed' in place but can be deleted simultaneously by visiting which is absolutely not a handy browsing way because bookmark is not for that reason. So Firefox has a session but completely misses the session management where group of pages can be handled as is with the browser history but 1000 youtube pages could be compressed/exported into a youtube session, meanwhile every other sites can be organized into sessions. So the final result would be an active session where in/to (in and out) the pages of sessions can  be moved, opened, closed etc. So Firefox has only one - in my, and my multi tabber kind of people case - huge session which is in a big part is inactive so that is not necessary even for months but enhardening the browsing, the navigating across active/lots of inactive pages, enslowering the the current kind of browser so makes its performance worse than necessary. That is important of the above mentioned tab collecting browsing style that is not a style, but a compensation way of missing functionality where IN ORDER there is no better way to solve the data loss caused by refreshed (but renewed) content than to make the browser to remeber links by storing them in -compared to bookmark easily closeable - new tab which grants the accessibility of currently available links for later before the page gets refreshed and some or all of those links are refreshed and replaced into another links (please remember youtube home page for example where refreshing may give different content(data) compared to previous page under exactly the same url: <a href=""http://youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com</a>). So lets open 10 new pages for example which makes the browser slow and the current page laggy so for opening another 10 page is not an easy task anymore since the currently opened 10 pages block the access for the another then pages intended to save before its lost. So i have not better soultion but open 10 pages then visit them one by one meanwhile immediately navigating away from them to a less resource eating page: a blank page. So the browser is not loaded anymore by loading those pages, i got back the access for 'the current' page and THE BROWSER LETS ME open another then pages, meanwhile praying please browser do not collapse please. So WHEN EVERYTHING IS FINE the there are lots of -in my case blank pages- new tabs without any reference. So what the tab manager drop down list is good for is exacly nothing. That does not help in navigation in any way. So select the empty pages one by one and then positioning to the back arrow of navigation history - with lots of operation - shows the title of that pages which is intended to visit. So when by this exhausting lots of operations way of search and navigation gives the result and the intended link is finally identified and found then an elegant click on the navigate back arrow gives the result. So i hope that properly describes the horror of navigation bacause it is basically caused by the imedaitely accessing the newly opened pages behaviour of firefox. If Firefox would let simply open without access then the new page navigation and its further causations would be missed. So make things better is about the right click menu: 'open link in new tab without immediate access/navigation to it'. In other hand those unnecessary navigations eat resources (wideband, processor times, electric energy, maybe causing bigger price in Internet bill) so this permanent Firefox behaviour is definitely harmful and/or unpleasant in many ways. So basically firefox wastes resources for no reason because there are lots of preloaded content at the wrong time which is duplicated when after many restarts the page finally intentionally loaded. I know there are many kind of people and this is why the add-ons for, but that is not necessarily an excuse for you because there may be 'thematized' browser habit presets so tabless user may be default where the tab collectors may set their profile to 'tab collector' and then the browser won't visit the new tab until it is effectively selected and the user navigates to there. Lots of wideband gets freed and much more smoother and faster the browser/browsing will be even on slow and old systems. Another in other hand the server side where there are lots of punishment of multithreading access at the same time so Firefox  can make their life easier also. I think opening 10 youtube player simultaneously is not necessary by the nature of visiting sites one by one only the firefox forces the non-natural simultaneus way but why that is what i don't know. By the way that is also your problem in this section when the players AGGRESSIVELY starts and streams and buffering so when a user wanted to simply browse the side thumbnails in connection the video and navigate to another video bacause the current one is already visited then that is must to generate lots of additional streaming data amount forced by the misbehavior of streaming service habit. So when Firefox gives a free hand to support opening 10 pages where each one of it generates lots of unnecessary buffered streaming content then that is also not as good idea as the streaming itself. Unfortunately this silly not reasonable streaming service habit is more supported then the reasonable multi tabbed browsing since while the first is not about the browsing the second is definitely about that (as described before). </p><pre>-Furthermore tab, navigation and organization problems and bugs </pre> <p>There are lots of them. First the forgotten navigation: opening a new tab by an url gets forgotten and lost forever from navigation history after navigating away immediately for example in situation described before to a blank page. The page opener url gets forgotten, the navigation back arrow is disabled so the url is totally forgotten. The url is not enough to launch but it must be at least partially loaded before navigation from the definitely visible url of the according text field or else that link gets lost. </p><p>The second navigation problem is when the navigating to blank tab remembers the title and icon of the previous page. That is very annoying when that is hard to decide the current page is the new tab or the old. </p><p>The Left justified tabs horror: when the user would like to navigate backward in the timeline then the good firefox care for that pages to be hidden until using the navigation arrow which is absolutely not smooth. So clicking the previous tab nearby current is impossible without continuous additional backward navigation. So select, close immediately is not for previous tabs only for following tabs. A middle but at least 1/3-2/3 aligned navigation maybe would be much handy.  </p><p>The tab navigation arrow horror: One click scroll by one tab repeated click sensed as double click and scrolls home and end positions (first and last tab) which is in the middle of a 2000 opened pages session results in position loss. Maybe the 1000-2000 pages by two click is a little bit not smooth. A right programming solution is to counting clicks (the measuring the speed  of the continuous clicks so the rare is slow and smooth the massively and faster repeated clicks lead to faster and faster scrolling). </p><p>The cross-eyed horror:opening a new window (for collecting tabs for bookmarking for example) and drag-drop tabs from a left aligned tabs in order to the other right side of the new window is not very handy especially when the windows are not prealigned because the dragging operation hides the dropping target window which is an eXXXtra cross to drag from left to down to the tray then drop right on the top. This is a very long way compared to  down right to up right (because the tabs are on top) if tabs were at the bottom then up right to down right. Depending on mouse sensitivity that is a very annoying sweeping method compared to an elegant short and less hand movement method, which is much more productive and faster by the way. A possible more handy partial solution is the great golden middle-way alignment of the tabs. Other solution is a send tab to window menu on tabs because there are not so many windows which their are would not be easily found especially in a last used is first extra menu point. So the send to right click menu of tabs has subitems where the first is the last three in order for example then a divider and the complete list of available windows to send. That's all. The name of window is the current maybe with a number for example (1)New tab (2) New tab etc. the send position after, before current which may be predefined somwhere in a page sending method option. Or multiselect and drag-drop selected pages to anywhere. </p><p>The new tab horror:basically the new tabs are opened (open in new tab) at the last position of tabs. That is not pretty activity to drag 1000 pages back to the current. It is partially solved by add-on. Another dark side is the back to the previous tab when a user uses some kind of settings page typically related to add-on operations when that tab handled as individual active/current tab so after finishing an add-on/setting operation which is basically not a part of web browsing navigation then the closed setting page does not return directly back to the last current page but tab on its right so when that tab is inactive then that gets activeted/visited unnecessarily even if the navigation is managed back to the source current page. So first after closing setting tab the nearby right of current gets focused then that focused (and activated) tab lost its focus by navigation back to the originally current page but loading the tab will be finished at the activated right side tab. That is a strange and unnecessary navigation. The right method should be to open settings page before the current so after closing that settings the next tab will be the originally setting initializer current tab and gets it focus back without furthermore involving other tabs into the browsing. Anyway an option for open new tab at the left (and ensuring its visibility on the tab list without additional seeking) would be useful lots of descendant kind of links (for example download a file pages) where after lauching/finishing download there is no more reason to keep that page opened so opening 10 page on the left, download 10 file then simply close that page will result to getting back to the link source page and the browsing can be simply continued without clicking back continuously. So there are lots of cases when opening new tab by the left of current result in staying on the current tab because the very temporary kind of tabs are all gets to be closed so that is predictable by the intention of the user that the to the right direction closing tabs will lead back to the source page. The right opening way may be bad because a browser collapsing may keep download link pages opened. Why? Because of the continuous backward navigation. The user does not know from ten links which is done and which is not so while all the pages are not loaded then all pages are kept opened. So when browser collapsed (this is much more usual than it seems) then closing a page automatically navigate such kind of download starter page and the browser download files those are already downloaded and make a mass in the download folder meanwhile the from left to right closing is easy to real time managed from left checking and closing tabs until all done and arriving back to the source page or arriving to a download page without visiting extra right side tabs. So when collapse happens that happens on less then all tabs so downlads are easier to handle in the fly and the restored tabs (after collapse) mostly are such tabs which refers to a not downloaded yet content rather to an already downladed one. However the right side is available until the last tab but it won't never arrives back to the source page until it is directly navigated so this extra navigation is a demotivation of closing tabs one by one rather when all done then all close and navigate to the source page. So tabs are opened until all download has been finished and a collapse restores all the downloads not just some of them. In summary there are many cases of temporarily opened new tabs from a source page where that is not ideal to land next to the right of the source tab and countinuously navigate back, and back, and back till the world's end. So open 10 new tabs to the left of current closing them all lands back at that page which from the 10 page opened not its right neigbour which is pretty accurate in browsing history timline meanwhile it is achieved simply by finishing the visit of the branches of a tree (simply closing without any additional navigation to the backward neighbor). As solution: there may be options for new tabs which provides left, right to the current, at first, at last as default methods of new page opening so everyone can choose it preferred option. </p><p>The bookmarking horror: That is about multiselection mentioned before. The bookmark manager should be able to pick up pages for bookmarking from the pages of currently availabe (opened pages of the whole session). So window 1,2,3 =list 1,2,3 of multiselectable pages. So list in a tree structure in bookmark manager under an Active windows root Window1,2,3 list of those tabs and filtering that by using the search filter is a relatively simply task because it needs an extra Active/Session windows tree item on which the already exist search filter is applicable then by a bookmark selected way simplify the mass bookmarking operations. </p><p>The marking horror: That is not really the basic browsing functionality but that would be much help to mark the bookmarked links. It may be useful. But not this is the horror of the horrors in the dead or alive tab game but identifying which tab is actively restored and which one is passive on which the click results the loading the page in. That would be nice to somehow grey out the inactive and live colorizing the loaded tabs because that is very annoying when clicking back and forth between active window meanwhile  searching for a content at the edge of browser slowness to click an inactive page and load an extra load to the browsing meanwhile this cuckoo egg page is enhardening the mentioned searching activity by some extra content and by some extra slowness, </p><p>-The RE-fox horror Firefox collapses so many times so that would be proper to RE-naming from fiREfox for REfox. Sorry. I was bad, however there are problems with the Mozilla Maintenance Service also which is forgets to sense the collapse. The Firefox simply disappear without collapse report, or sometimes it does not start by the first click of launch icon only the second. That is strange. I do not know if that is in connection with 32 bit maintenance service 64 bit Firefox or not but that is my experience.  </p><p>-Something good Above the clouds the Sun is shining because the session restoring is 100% stable compared to the old versions so excluding the last page opened before collapsing the whole session is always restored does not matter blue death, power outage or simply collapsing the session is kept which is the most basic browsing function that is fortunately petty stable. </p><p>-Thank you for the chance to forced to be registered to help you, rather than anonymously!
