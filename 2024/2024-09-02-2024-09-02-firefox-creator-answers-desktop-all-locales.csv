The only way I have been able to restore them is to open each bookmark using ""Open All in Tabs"" for each Bookmark folder. As I have many hundreds of Bookmarks, this is an extremely time consuming process. I have done this twice. I have just encountered a third instance of this problem and would like to avoid doing it again if there is any other way to restore the favicons. </p><p>I had saved the favicons.sqlite files from the Profile, but I am unaware of any way to restore the favicons directly from this file. The favicons.sqlite file appears to be of the proper size, i.e. ~17KB. On the last occasion, following a suggested solution, I rebuilt the iconcache hoping it would also rebuild the favicons, but that was not the case. As a result, I used the above process. </p><p>Any solutions to restore the Bookmark favicons without opening all with ""Open All in Tabs"" would be greatly apprecuated. I don't know what has caused the favicons to disappear. I am running Firefox 129.0.2 on a Windows 11 Pro PC. </p><p>Allan </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1290;firefox-12902;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1672288;1672291;1672295;,Ulysses41

I've measured it most recently around every 10 seconds or so (manual stopwatch in another tab, so a little faster or slower possible).  </p><p>When in this state, I can often notice it frequently: on hovering over buttons the UI does not highlight them, the video controls will not appear, or the page will not fill the screen on resize, can't click into search, etc. Basically just full page freeze except for media playback. </p><p>It's disappeared and come back a few times, but tends to be more often there than not. This occurs on every page of Youtube.
