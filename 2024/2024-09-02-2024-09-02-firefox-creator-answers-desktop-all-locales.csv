The only way I have been able to restore them is to open each bookmark using ""Open All in Tabs"" for each Bookmark folder. As I have many hundreds of Bookmarks, this is an extremely time consuming process. I have done this twice. I have just encountered a third instance of this problem and would like to avoid doing it again if there is any other way to restore the favicons. </p><p>I had saved the favicons.sqlite files from the Profile, but I am unaware of any way to restore the favicons directly from this file. The favicons.sqlite file appears to be of the proper size, i.e. ~17KB. On the last occasion, following a suggested solution, I rebuilt the iconcache hoping it would also rebuild the favicons, but that was not the case. As a result, I used the above process. </p><p>Any solutions to restore the Bookmark favicons without opening all with ""Open All in Tabs"" would be greatly apprecuated. I don't know what has caused the favicons to disappear. I am running Firefox 129.0.2 on a Windows 11 Pro PC. </p><p>Allan </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1290;firefox-12902;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1672288;1672291;1672295;,Ulysses41
