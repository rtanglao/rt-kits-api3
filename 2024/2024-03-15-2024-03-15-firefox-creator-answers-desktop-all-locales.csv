Users can access the Bookmarks Manager by clicking on the ""Bookmarks"" menu and selecting ""Show All Bookmarks"" or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+B (Cmd+Shift+B on macOS).

Users can open the Bookmarks Sidebar by clicking on the ""Bookmarks"" menu and selecting ""Show Bookmarks Sidebar"" or by pressing Ctrl+B (Cmd+B on macOS). The Bookmarks Sidebar provides quick access to bookmarks and folders without interrupting the browsing experience. </p><p>Bookmark Tags: Firefox allows users to assign tags to bookmarks to categorize and organize them more efficiently. Tags are keywords or labels that users can add to bookmarks to make them easier to find later. Users can add tags to bookmarks when saving them or edit tags later in the Bookmarks Manager. </p><p>Smart Bookmarks: Firefox includes Smart Bookmarks, which are special bookmarks that automatically update to display dynamic content. For example, users can create Smart Bookmarks to show recently visited websites, recently bookmarked websites, or websites with specific keywords in the title or URL. </p><p>History Manager: Firefox provides a History Manager that allows users to view and manage their browsing history. Users can access the History Manager by clicking on the ""History"" menu and selecting ""Show All History"" or by pressing Ctrl+H (Cmd+H on macOS).
