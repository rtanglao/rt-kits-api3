I am unable to view streams on YouTube or Twitch (Twitch will show streams as offline, whereas YouTube will not even show streams), and I have encountered a new issue where YouTube allows only 360p on videos. I have used the HTML5 Video Capability Test and seem to have an issue in that department (images attached). Even in troubleshooting mode, the issue persists. Any help is appreciated. </p>",desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1230;firefox-12301;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",zephyrvalkyrie
