Sólo puede verse un mensaje que dice: «Se ha producido un error. Vuelve a intentarlo más tarde. (ID de reproducción: VNiWNSQkPtrPuDBs)». Obviamente, la ID de reproducción varía según el vídeo. El problema no ocurre con los vídeos «Shorts», sólo con los de duración normal. Mediante la extensión Easy Youtube Video Downloader, puedo descargar cualquier vídeo y verlo directamente en mi ordenador, pero esa no es la solución perfecta. También puedo copiar el vínculo, pegarlo en el navegador Safari y verlo desde ahí, pero tampoco resulta cómodo. He probado hasta la versión 123.0, pero el resultado es el mismo. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1013;firefox-11580;firefox-1158;,firefox,other,es,"",errenecu

Users can access the Bookmarks Manager by clicking on the ""Bookmarks"" menu and selecting ""Show All Bookmarks"" or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+B (Cmd+Shift+B on macOS). In the Bookmarks Manager, users can create folders, move bookmarks between folders, rename bookmarks, and delete bookmarks. </p><p>Bookmark <strong><a href=""https://pickerwheel.net/category/tools/"" rel=""nofollow"">Toolbar</a></strong>: Firefox includes a Bookmark Toolbar where users can save frequently visited websites for quick access. Users can easily add bookmarks to the toolbar by clicking on the star icon in the address bar or by dragging and dropping bookmarks from the Bookmarks Manager to the toolbar. </p><p>Bookmarks Sidebar: Firefox features a Bookmarks Sidebar that allows users to access their bookmarks while browsing. Users can open the Bookmarks Sidebar by clicking on the ""Bookmarks"" menu and selecting ""Show Bookmarks Sidebar"" or by pressing Ctrl+B (Cmd+B on macOS). The Bookmarks Sidebar provides quick access to bookmarks and folders without interrupting the browsing experience. </p><p>Bookmark Tags: Firefox allows users to assign tags to bookmarks to categorize and organize them more efficiently. Tags are keywords or labels that users can add to bookmarks to make them easier to find later. Users can add tags to bookmarks when saving them or edit tags later in the Bookmarks Manager. </p><p>Smart Bookmarks: Firefox includes Smart Bookmarks, which are special bookmarks that automatically update to display dynamic content. For example, users can create Smart Bookmarks to show recently visited websites, recently bookmarked websites, or websites with specific keywords in the title or URL. </p><p>History Manager: Firefox provides a History Manager that allows users to view and manage their browsing history. Users can access the History Manager by clicking on the ""History"" menu and selecting ""Show All History"" or by pressing Ctrl+H (Cmd+H on macOS). In the History Manager, users can view their browsing history, search for specific websites, clear browsing history, and delete individual entries. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Pickerwheel

Am I using something different? Everything points to me having the latest up to date version of Firefox. For example if I click on the four horizontal line hamburger on top right of the screen I do not see anything that begins with ""Tools"" in the menu options. I see ""Settings"" and ""More Tools"" but none lead to ""Options&gt;Content: Fonts &amp; Colors&gt; Advanced: [X]. simarly, If I click on ""Tools"" in the menu at the top of the Browser nothing leads to ""Options"".
