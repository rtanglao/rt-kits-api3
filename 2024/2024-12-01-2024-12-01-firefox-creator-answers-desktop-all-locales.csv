At the same time you want people to prefer your browser.  Why did you stop supporting Windows 7. I think that window 7 is an OS used from thousands of users. I prefer to use this OS and Linux Mint.

So I downloaded the full installer. - Cleared cookies and data: did not work - DNS over HTTPS: Swicthed it off, did it did not work, so I switched back to the default setting. - Logged in to the router from firefox using the router's IP address: Not sure why I thought this would work but it did not. </p><p>Any help would be appreciated to solve this issue once and for all. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1691259;1691260;1691267;1691273;1691274;1691275;1691281;1691282;1691284;1691286;1691291;1691301;1691305;1691309;1691310;1691311;1691312;,vipuls1408

When I want to change the way this setting is set in a Facebook group, when Firefox is full screen, the associated dialog is so placed and/or sized on the screen that it is partially truncated on the left by the left side of the display. I just checked in MS Edge and it displays normally there with full screen display. It displays normally in Firefox when I Restore Down. So this one at least does seem to be specific to Firefox. </p><p>I have a second full screen display issue that may be related, but this one isn't just Firefox; Ms Edge also shows it, and other applications also behave similarly: the right hand scroll bar disappears in full screen (as does the applicaion menu control)! I had some trouble taking a pair of images to illustrate this, using Snipping Tool. The second image, when Firefox is set to restore Down, shows the scroll bar and application menu control, which is what I see. The third image was more tricky to take because the first time I tried, the screen capture included a scroll bar and application menu control even though they were not visible on screen. I had to redo it and be very careful not to let the right hand side of the selection drift off the right hand side of the display. </p><p>It seems like the full screen display is just a little ""larger"" than the physical display. I have tried one or two other screen resolution settings and that has not helped. My best guess is that it's a monitor settings problem, but I've also fiddled with the monitor settings, again with no success. And even if a monitor setting explains the pervasive right hand side issue, it doesn't explain the Facebook dialogue issue, which does appear to be Firefox-specific. </p><p>So my current workaround is just not to have anything full screen&nbsp;:( </p>",firefox;windows-10;browse;firefox-1330;,firefox,browse,en-US,1691224;,spargeus.maximus

I've got a fresh install of Firefox version 133 running on Windows 10, and I can't seem to install any add-ons. When I click the install button from the add-on's page, it just sits there with the loading animation and seemingly does nothing for several minutes. Attempting to right-click on the download button, ""save link as"", and hitting ""install add-on from file"" using that saved link as another user suggested from a similar problem does nothing at all; there's no feedback whatsoever. The add-on I've been trying to install is U-Block Origin, but I've tried this with other add-ons to the same results. The only other thing I've tried is installing one of the recommended add-ons from the add-on page directly, Privacy Badger specifically. This causes an actual window to pop up telling me Firefox is verifying the add-on, but nothing happens past this point. It just sits there, eternally attempting to verify the add-on with no progress ever made, and no error message ever spitting out. I haven't found anyone else with this exact problem. Hopefully I'm missing something obvious and I can feel really silly about the whole thing soon. Thanks much! </p><p>All the Best, G.B.Bari </p>",firefox;escalate;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,1691268;,GBBari
