When I want to change the way this setting is set in a Facebook group, when Firefox is full screen, the associated dialog is so placed and/or sized on the screen that it is partially truncated on the left by the left side of the display. I just checked in MS Edge and it displays normally there with full screen display. It displays normally in Firefox when I Restore Down. So this one at least does seem to be specific to Firefox. </p><p>I have a second full screen display issue that may be related, but this one isn't just Firefox; Ms Edge also shows it, and other applications also behave similarly: the right hand scroll bar disappears in full screen (as does the applicaion menu control)! I had some trouble taking a pair of images to illustrate this, using Snipping Tool. The second image, when Firefox is set to restore Down, shows the scroll bar and application menu control, which is what I see. The third image was more tricky to take because the first time I tried, the screen capture included a scroll bar and application menu control even though they were not visible on screen. I had to redo it and be very careful not to let the right hand side of the selection drift off the right hand side of the display. </p><p>It seems like the full screen display is just a little ""larger"" than the physical display. I have tried one or two other screen resolution settings and that has not helped. My best guess is that it's a monitor settings problem, but I've also fiddled with the monitor settings, again with no success. And even if a monitor setting explains the pervasive right hand side issue, it doesn't explain the Facebook dialogue issue, which does appear to be Firefox-specific. </p><p>So my current workaround is just not to have anything full screen&nbsp;:( </p>",firefox;windows-10;browse;firefox-1330;,firefox,browse,en-US,1691224;,spargeus.maximus

I've got a fresh install of Firefox version 133 running on Windows 10, and I can't seem to install any add-ons. When I click the install button from the add-on's page, it just sits there with the loading animation and seemingly does nothing for several minutes. Attempting to right-click on the download button, ""save link as"", and hitting ""install add-on from file"" using that saved link as another user suggested from a similar problem does nothing at all; there's no feedback whatsoever.     The add-on I've been trying to install is U-Block Origin, but I've tried this with other add-ons to the same results. The only other thing I've tried is installing one of the recommended add-ons from the add-on page directly, Privacy Badger specifically. This causes an actual window to pop up telling me Firefox is verifying the add-on, but nothing happens past this point. It just sits there, eternally attempting to verify the add-on with no progress ever made, and no error message ever spitting out.     I haven't found anyone else with this exact problem. Hopefully I'm missing something obvious and I can feel really silly about the whole thing soon. Thanks much! </pre> <p>All the Best, G.B.Bari </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",GBBari

MAC,"<p>There are times where I like having the title bar appear on my laptop display of a webpage. Other times I want to take a screenshot of selected page content, and the title bar just obstructs ability to fit the bottom line or two of the page content I want to screenshot. Yes i know I can reduce the zoom size of the page display itself, but sometimes (often) due to the page layout's CSS, this results in both too-small type for me to comfortably read AND even with the text reflow, it's not enough to reveal the extra bottom of page content I am trying to capture. </p><p>The Firefox UI controls are very robust and well-appreciated how much customization can be had, but still, the number of steps required to go in and turn Title Bar off is just way too many for quick and efficient workflow -- especially when after getting the screenshot I want, I will want to just turn Title-Bar back on. Surely there must be a way to create an icon option that lives next to Home, Bookmarks, Downloads, Refresh whose function is to actuate a quick 1/2 second toggle off, then a quick toggle back on? </p>",settings;firefox;firefox-1320;firefox-13202;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",quicksite
