I already have an implementation using <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/VideoDecoder"" rel=""nofollow"">VideoDecoder</a> and <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Insertable_Streams_for_MediaStreamTrack_API"" rel=""nofollow"">Insertable Streams</a> that works in Chrome. Encoded VPX frames are being efficiently decoded and piped into an HTMLVideoElement via the MediaStreamTrack API. My understanding is that Firefox will soon have support for VideoDecoder (you can already enable it as an experimental feature and it works fine), but insertable streams is something that Firefox will not implement because it favors <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRtpScriptTransform"" rel=""nofollow"">RTCRtpScriptTransform</a>. Please correct me if I'm wrong. </p><p>Could you point me to a way how to efficiently get a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/VideoFrame"" rel=""nofollow"">VideoFrame</a> that I got from a VideoDecoder into an HTMLVideoElement without a MediaStreamTrackGenerator (part of the insertable streams API which Firefox will not implement)? I've already tried: </p> <ul><li> drawing to a canvas (instead of video element) </li><li> wrapping the (still encoded) vpx frames in a WebM container and using it with a MediaSource SourceBuffer (with a video element) </li></ul> <p>Both attempts worked in Firefox, but performance was nowhere near the Insertable Streams way. </p><p>The VideoDecoders work very well in both Chrome and Firefox (with WebCodecs API enabled) according to my benchmarks. It's really just the matter of getting the decoded frame displayed where I can't find an efficient solution for Firefox. </p><p>Thanks a lot in advance! </p><p>If this is the wrong forum, could you please refer me to a more appropriate place? </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1210;,firefox,other,en-US,"",maradus

The landing page at <a href=""https://safelite.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://safelite.com</a> asks for a zip code, and submitting that form puts you into the scheduling flow; after entering some details about a vehicle, I can click back and continue a few times (less than ten) to make my computer crash. I was able to reproduce the issue in troubleshooting mode. I also tried the same steps in Chrome, but it did not produce a crash.  </p><p>This computer has had an issue with crashing in this manner for a while now, but this is the first thing I've noticed consistently causes a crash. I'm not expecting a solution, but I am hoping to close in on the issue; whether or not Firefox is the source here is questionable, but it does seem highly entangled. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",drgn170

When I click in the URL window - I am presented with 6 website options along with various web search options. It would be helpful to modify the options since none of them apply to me. I tried deleting history, playing with the settings/search suggestions/change settings. I want to specify certain websites - and leave it that way. I've tried right clicking the site, shift deleting, contrl deleting. Nothing works. If it is possible - it is not intuitive. I notice that the list does slowly seem to update and evolve depending on where I have been. But I don't want that either.

I have two accounts, A &amp; B, on my PC. A is the default Administrator account, B is a regular administrator account. I have no problems whatsoever running Firefox in account B. Account A is a different story. As soon as I launch Firefox, its windows appears and immediately freezes up. Mouse doesn't move, Ctrl-Alt-Del doesn't work. I can do nothing but wait. After waiting for a few minutes, the blue death screen appears. I have to restart the PC. </p><p>Since Firefox runs fine in account B, I don't think the system has any problem. I ran SFC anyway. As expected, it reported no problems. </p><p>It seems this might be a registry problem or something that is specific to the setting of account A.
