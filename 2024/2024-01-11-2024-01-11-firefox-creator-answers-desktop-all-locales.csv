Starting yesterday I cannot post any comments at the site. I can go to Edge and all works fine, so  there is something with Firefox that is conflicting with Foxnews. At first I was not able to even read articles but removed all Addon's and that has been fixed--even after reinstalling all Addon's I can still read articles. I log into my Fox account and the webpage reflects that but when I try to post a comment it says I must sign in to post, yet I am signed in! However, I go ahead and follow the links to sign in (check e-mail/click sign in to Fox etc.), ultimately it tells me I'm now signed in. But when I go back to the comment section it still says I must sign in to post but I am signed in. Besides removing Addon's I also tried removing the FF browser (Win 10 recommended a refresh instead of uninstall so I did that). No help, I'm thinking whatever is causing the conflict when refreshing FF the sync simply puts the conflict back! I'm still requested to sign in when I am signed in! As stated earlier my Fox account in MS Edge works fine. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,other,en-US,"",wingrider6

I already have an implementation using <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/VideoDecoder"" rel=""nofollow"">VideoDecoder</a> and <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Insertable_Streams_for_MediaStreamTrack_API"" rel=""nofollow"">Insertable Streams</a> that works in Chrome. Encoded VPX frames are being efficiently decoded and piped into an HTMLVideoElement via the MediaStreamTrack API. My understanding is that Firefox will soon have support for VideoDecoder (you can already enable it as an experimental feature and it works fine), but insertable streams is something that Firefox will not implement because it favors <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRtpScriptTransform"" rel=""nofollow"">RTCRtpScriptTransform</a>. Please correct me if I'm wrong. </p><p>Could you point me to a way how to efficiently get a <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/VideoFrame"" rel=""nofollow"">VideoFrame</a> that I got from a VideoDecoder into an HTMLVideoElement without a MediaStreamTrackGenerator (part of the insertable streams API which Firefox will not implement)? I've already tried: </p> <ul><li> drawing to a canvas (instead of video element) </li><li> wrapping the (still encoded) vpx frames in a WebM container and using it with a MediaSource SourceBuffer (with a video element) </li></ul> <p>Both attempts worked in Firefox, but performance was nowhere near the Insertable Streams way. </p><p>The VideoDecoders work very well in both Chrome and Firefox (with WebCodecs API enabled) according to my benchmarks. It's really just the matter of getting the decoded frame displayed where I can't find an efficient solution for Firefox. </p><p>Thanks a lot in advance! </p><p>If this is the wrong forum, could you please refer me to a more appropriate place? </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1210;,firefox,other,en-US,"",maradus

The landing page at <a href=""https://safelite.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://safelite.com</a> asks for a zip code, and submitting that form puts you into the scheduling flow; after entering some details about a vehicle, I can click back and continue a few times (less than ten) to make my computer crash.
