I have two accounts, A &amp; B, on my PC. A is the default Administrator account, B is a regular administrator account. I have no problems whatsoever running Firefox in account B. Account A is a different story. As soon as I launch Firefox, its windows appears and immediately freezes up. Mouse doesn't move, Ctrl-Alt-Del doesn't work. I can do nothing but wait. After waiting for a few minutes, the blue death screen appears. I have to restart the PC. </p><p>Since Firefox runs fine in account B, I don't think the system has any problem. I ran SFC anyway. As expected, it reported no problems. </p><p>It seems this might be a registry problem or something that is specific to the setting of account A. I guess I could uninstall and re-install Firefox but wonder if anyone ever encountered the same problem and have a solution. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1210;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jk200
