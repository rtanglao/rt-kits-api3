The issue happens with any add-on, but the one I wanted to install is (<a href=""https://workspace.google.com/u/0/marketplace/app/todoist_for_gmail/815972520808"" rel=""nofollow"">https://workspace.google.com/u/0/marketplace/app/todoist_for_gmail/815972520808</a>) </p><p>When trying to install an add-on, I get directed through to give the add-on permissions and I get thrown to the following error 400 each time (see screenshots). I've already tried a few troubleshooting steps, such as clearing my browser cache and cookies, disabling other add-ons/extensions, and even restarting my browser, but unfortunately, none of these actions have resolved the issue. </p><p>I'm sure this problem is a more general issue with Firefox. I reached out go Google and they could not help and the installation was successful on Chrome. I also tried installing other add-ons and a similar problem occurs. If anyone else has experienced a similar problem or has any suggestions for troubleshooting steps I can try, I would greatly appreciate your insights. </p><p>Additionally, if there's any specific information or logs I should provide to help diagnose the issue further, please let me know, and I'll do my best to provide whatever is needed. </p><p>Thank you in advance for any assistance you can offer! </p><p>Best regards, Kamil </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",firefox.voice188

Deleting the Google cache and cookies helps, but only temporarily. This problem doesn't seem to occur when using a different browser, such as Safari, or when using the built-in MacOS email client. Therefore, I'm thinking it's a buggy interaction between Firefox and Gmail. I didn't used to have this problem, so perhaps it's related to a Firefox update? Anyhow, I'm hoping someone can help. Thanks! </p>",desktop;cookies;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,cookies,en-US,"",vgersigny
