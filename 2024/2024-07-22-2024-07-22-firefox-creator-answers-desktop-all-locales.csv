I've trashed and redownloaded it on my Mac multiple times and cannot even get into the options to toggle and choose. I have to usually quit firefox for anything to even happen when I click, but when I've seen it stop bouncing, it just shows it's stopped responding. I really like Firefox more than Brave and Chrome, if you could please help, I'd appreciate it. Other browsers like Chrome and Brave still work, and I just dowloaded and started using Brave in the meantime. </p>",troubleshooting;macos;,firefox,basic-browsing-firefox,en-US,"",charybdiskylla
