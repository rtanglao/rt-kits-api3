The site certificate is wildcarded, because the proxy server's name becomes the domain for the particular site to which the authenticated user is connecting.  This has been the recommended way for libraries to connect institutionally with commercial content providers since at least 2000.  The attachment shows the response that I get when I connect to my library with Firefox.  You aren't allowed the opportunity to tell Firefox to accept the certificate as legit and connect anyway, which is extremely annoying. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;website-breakages;firefox-1280;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",junk.ads9z

I've trashed and redownloaded it on my Mac multiple times and cannot even get into the options to toggle and choose. I have to usually quit firefox for anything to even happen when I click, but when I've seen it stop bouncing, it just shows it's stopped responding. I really like Firefox more than Brave and Chrome, if you could please help, I'd appreciate it. Other browsers like Chrome and Brave still work, and I just dowloaded and started using Brave in the meantime. </p>",troubleshooting;macos;,firefox,basic-browsing-firefox,en-US,"",Chya
