I enter the email address for the account and it says it can't find it.  Then Find Username link tells me to use the email it can't find.  Repeated several times. Even got online with SirusXM chat pop up and they told me to use the email it ""can't find"".  The email is/was typed correctly.  The FireFox is the latest update. The OS is Windows 11 (updated) and the hardware is an I9-12900HX, 32 gig laptop.  More than adaquate. So on a whim I opened the logon site in Brave and voila got right in.   Am I doing something wrong with Firefox? </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1220;,firefox,other,en-US,"",leoscott
