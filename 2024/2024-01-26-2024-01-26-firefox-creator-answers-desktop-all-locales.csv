The tabs keep refreshing when I switch apps or even when I stay on the browser, just by changing tabs and leaving it open within the session. I usually open a lot of tabs, and this has nothing to do with the inactive ones. 2. I used to be able to play YouTube videos in the background or with my screen off on the Firefox browser on my Android phone without problem. But now the audio keeps pausing and doesn't continue to load, even closes itself after a few seconds of loading. Nothing i've done, including downloading the video playback fix addon, clearing cache, restarting phone and turning off and on data saving mode/background data permission, has fixed this problem. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",funnyflute
