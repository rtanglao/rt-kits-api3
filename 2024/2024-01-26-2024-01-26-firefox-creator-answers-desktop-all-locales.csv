Opera is listed as a browser. it is actually spyware and i would like it if you guys did a bit of research to confirm and maybe put a warning sign next to opera so Firefox users can warn opera users to switch browsers </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1220;,firefox,other,en-US,"",rezinex1

Playback is no longer supported on this browser version."" But I do have the most recent version of my browser—Firefox—so I don't know how to fix the problem and make the audiobook play again. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-10105;,firefox,other,en-US,"",elizc100

I enter the email address for the account and it says it can't find it.  Then Find Username link tells me to use the email it can't find.  Repeated several times. Even got online with SirusXM chat pop up and they told me to use the email it ""can't find"".  The email is/was typed correctly.  The FireFox is the latest update. The OS is Windows 11 (updated) and the hardware is an I9-12900HX, 32 gig laptop.  More than adaquate. So on a whim I opened the logon site in Brave and voila got right in.   Am I doing something wrong with Firefox? </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1220;,firefox,other,en-US,"",leoscott
