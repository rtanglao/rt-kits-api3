Example the Firefox help pages where I scroll to bottom click on the next page number, and it goes to that page but stays at bottom. Or if on Hibid and want to look at a listing, look at the listing and then want to go back to the previous page, it opens the listing at the bottom of the page, not the top.  Sometimes it will open the new page where ever it wants </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1280;,firefox,other,en-US,"",alphateck
