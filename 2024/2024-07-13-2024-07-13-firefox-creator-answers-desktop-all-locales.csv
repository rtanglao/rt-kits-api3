I'm also having problems using my own pictures for the shortcuts and I'd rather fix the problem instead of having to pin websites as shortcuts. It also looks a bit ugly in my opinion. </p><p>This started happening after I switched Microsoft accounts on my PC and started using Firefox on another user account.
