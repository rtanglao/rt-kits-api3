Specifically, the descriptions for some of the game assets seem to be jumbled or overlapping in weird ways.  It makes it hard to read what each asset actually offers. </p><p>I've cleared my cache and tried a different browser (Chrome), and everything looks fine there.  So, it seems to be a Firefox-specific issue. </p><p>Anyone else encountered this on Next Level Gaming Store with Firefox?  Maybe there's a setting I can tweak to fix the formatting? </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help! </p><p>Using Firefox Version: 105.0.1 (as of today) </p><p>Website built with: (You can replace this with ""I'm not sure, but it looks like a custom build"") </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",jamesoleg2

Like for example <a href=""http://reddit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">reddit.com</a> or <a href=""http://twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">twitter.com</a> does not appear even though I visit those pages often and more than any other page. It doesn't make sense that a random website shows up immediately as I visit it once, but not the websites I visit often. So I have to type in manually in the search bar to get there instead of just clicking the shortcut on the startpage. </p><p>I COULD pin the websites on the startpage, but the pictures only show up as the automated pictures such as ""R"" or ""T"" for Reddit and Twitter respectively. I'm also having problems using my own pictures for the shortcuts and I'd rather fix the problem instead of having to pin websites as shortcuts. It also looks a bit ugly in my opinion. </p><p>This started happening after I switched Microsoft accounts on my PC and started using Firefox on another user account. By the time I switched, I was logged into the same account on two different users on my PC, and I synchronized several times. That other logged in user is now removed from my Firefox account and I also completely deleted the other user on my PC to free up space. I have completely uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox and deleted all the files on my PC, but it still doesn't work.
