It was easy enough to reinstall the add-ons that I needed, but I'm trying to get my bookmarks back. However, I can't seem to find them--the ""bookmarkbackups"" folders that come up are too new, and only one (the current one) has a file in it. </p><p>Any help will be appreciated!

It was even unable to reach <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a>! I am using Google Chrome at the moment to send this. I uninstalled Firefox a few times and reinstalled it each time trying different options without success. I downloaded and used the .exe installation file in my latest attempts. During every installation attempt (including during the initial automatic update) a crash reporter popped up.  I have used Firefox a good many years without problems and like it better than the other browsers but am now stymied. I include the troubleshooting data (beyond my complete understanding) for my current Firefox installation. Thanks for any clue to get it working like it used to. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",angelor
