When i use Firefox and save a password it says it has been saved but when I use the same site again the passwords don't fill in.

It's just a spinning circle in a video. I can refresh several times and then it plays. I cleared my cache, history, data...etc everything from Firefox. That seemed to help for a bit. Then it just resulted back to being slow. It's just in Firefox. I played videos in Edge. It was fine. No issues. It's just FireFox. It started most recently too. It wasn't happening a week ago. I even tried going back to an old version of Firefox. Didn't help. Anyone know how to fix? Not using ad blockers either FYI.  I just want videos to play normally and fast. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1230;firefox-12301;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1658445;,boohere21
