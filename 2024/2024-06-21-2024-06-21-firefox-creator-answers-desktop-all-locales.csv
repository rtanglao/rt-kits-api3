I turned off uBlock Origin for Youtube, and I have Youtube Premium, but this issue is still happening. Ookla speed test is 569.32 Mbps download, and 23.50 Mbps upload. My Firefox is set to automatically update. Current version is 127.0.1 </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1270;firefox-12701;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",mikeyvsaul

It's just a spinning circle in a video. I can refresh several times and then it plays. I cleared my cache, history, data...etc everything from Firefox. That seemed to help for a bit. Then it just resulted back to being slow. It's just in Firefox. I played videos in Edge. It was fine. No issues. It's just FireFox. It started most recently too. It wasn't happening a week ago. I even tried going back to an old version of Firefox. Didn't help. Anyone know how to fix? Not using ad blockers either FYI.  I just want videos to play normally and fast. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1230;firefox-12301;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",boohere21
