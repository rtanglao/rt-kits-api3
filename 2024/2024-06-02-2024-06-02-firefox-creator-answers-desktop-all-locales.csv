More often than not I can open MSN, load amazon, login, and find what I'm looking for before Firefox has completed signing me in or searching for an item. This is not a once in a while problem, it happens every time with amazon, some times worse than other times. Ive deleted and reloaded Firefox, cleared all history and tried as many other things that I could find online to try, none of which helped. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",echoesdn
