Regardless of whether I use Mozilla Firefox, the browser frequently crashes. This happens at least once a day, and it seems to be unrelated to the number of tabs open or the specific content being viewed. I did the help -&gt; diagnose mode without plugin and it crashed too, im not sure what this is realted to.  </p><p>The crashes often present with an error message suggesting a failure in the new tabs or trying to load a old one, despite the fact that my system's RAM usage is typically around 60-70%. I have already updated the BIOS, Lenovo drivers, and NVIDIA graphics drivers, but the issue persists. </p><p>I'm seeking advice on what might be causing these browser crashes. Is it possible that there's a compatibility issue with Windows 11 Home? Could it be related to the graphics card or its drivers, even though they are up-to-date? I have not changed the power cable from my old PC; could this be a factor? </p><p>Any insights, suggestions, or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. I'm trying to determine if this is a hardware issue, a driver conflict, or something else entirely. </p><p>Thank you in advance for your help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1210;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",socialpatrickk

I have noticed that at least for a few months Firefox password library on iPhone was missing some password I needed, but I could always look them up on either PC without problem. Usually i tried to fix this by manualy synchronizing Firefox on iPhone in settings, it always showed that it is synchronized.  Today I have discovered that i have only 19 passwords saved on my PC - same as on iPhone, but yesterday there were much more (probably all, but I can not be certain). Oldest one was created on 30. 10. 2023. All other are gone, I have managed to restore some old passwords (cca 370) from october 2021. I have disconnected internet and WiFi, placed old logins.json and key4.db in current profile, opened firefox and exported them. Once internet is restored, all passwords are deleted again, only those 19 recently created stay. </p><p>I did not delete any passwords or logins or anything on any device and did not delete any file or firefox profile. Why did it delete passwords without asking? And how can I prevent this from repeating? Because this is unusable password manager that randomly decides to purge login data from time to time. </p><p>thank you </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1210;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1629329;,peto819
