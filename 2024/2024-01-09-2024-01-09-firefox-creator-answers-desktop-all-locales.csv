I have hardware accelerated video playback on Youtube for VP9 but not for H.264 on YouTube and Twitch. I can verify that with intel_gpu_top. My hardware should be capable to do hardware decode. You can see in the provided screenshots, that it should work from the configuration standpoint. Do I missing something here or is this maybe a bug?

I have noticed that at least for a few months Firefox password library on iPhone was missing some password I needed, but I could always look them up on either PC without problem. Usually i tried to fix this by manualy synchronizing Firefox on iPhone in settings, it always showed that it is synchronized.  Today I have discovered that i have only 19 passwords saved on my PC - same as on iPhone, but yesterday there were much more (probably all, but I can not be certain). Oldest one was created on 30. 10. 2023. All other are gone, I have managed to restore some old passwords (cca 370) from october 2021. I have disconnected internet and WiFi, placed old logins.json and key4.db in current profile, opened firefox and exported them. Once internet is restored, all passwords are deleted again, only those 19 recently created stay. </p><p>I did not delete any passwords or logins or anything on any device and did not delete any file or firefox profile. Why did it delete passwords without asking? And how can I prevent this from repeating? Because this is unusable password manager that randomly decides to purge login data from time to time. </p><p>thank you </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1210;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",peto819

I had to setup an new iphone (13 Mini) from an ICloud backup. But somehow in the firefox-app under passwords I got all the websites, but no login and password safed. So I deleted all this information on the iphone, since I still got all the data on my laptop. I startet sync, but what happend was, that it somehow synced the other way around and all the Pw an the laptop disappeared. Of course I didn't make a backup before. Any chance to restore these data? At the moment I could restore the data on the Iphone from an Iphone-backup. But now the sync works properly and always deletes the data on the Iphone. Any chance to transfere these data from the Iphone to the laptop apart from wrighting them manually? Kindly Georg </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1210;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",georg_kirchner

Microsoft apparently auto-updated her to Windows 11, and now not only is the whole OS different but the scroll bars on everything are so thin that you can barely click on them to drag.  They only get fractionally thicker when you hover over them with the cursor.  This is not specific to any website. </p><p>The issue exists in both Windows and Firefox on her machine since the update, for some reason.  She and I both have the latest edition of Firefox, but I am still running Win 10.  I managed to find a registry edit to improve the scroll bar in Windows File Manager for her, but this had no impact on the scroll in Firefox.  Is there a way to fix this?  I could not find a setting for it. </p><p>I have attached a side-by-side screen shot of her scroll in Firefox on Google, before and during hover with cursor.  I have also included a screen shot of my scroll in Firefox on Reddit, which looks as hers did before the update and is much more user-friendly. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1210;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",wynden
