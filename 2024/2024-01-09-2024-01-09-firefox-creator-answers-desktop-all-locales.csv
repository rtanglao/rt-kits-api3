Regardless of whether I use Mozilla Firefox, the browser frequently crashes. This happens at least once a day, and it seems to be unrelated to the number of tabs open or the specific content being viewed. I did the help -&gt; diagnose mode without plugin and it crashed too, im not sure what this is realted to.  </p><p>The crashes often present with an error message suggesting a failure in the new tabs or trying to load a old one, despite the fact that my system's RAM usage is typically around 60-70%. I have already updated the BIOS, Lenovo drivers, and NVIDIA graphics drivers, but the issue persists. </p><p>I'm seeking advice on what might be causing these browser crashes. Is it possible that there's a compatibility issue with Windows 11 Home? Could it be related to the graphics card or its drivers, even though they are up-to-date? I have not changed the power cable from my old PC; could this be a factor? </p><p>Any insights, suggestions, or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. I'm trying to determine if this is a hardware issue, a driver conflict, or something else entirely. </p><p>Thank you in advance for your help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1210;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",socialpatrickk

Once internet is restored, all passwords are deleted again, only those 19 recently created stay. </p><p>I did not delete any passwords or logins or anything on any device and did not delete any file or firefox profile.
