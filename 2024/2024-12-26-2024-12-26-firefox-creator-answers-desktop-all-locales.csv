I guess I hadn't really noticed the changes until now. But it takes up half the page of my browser. Who thought this was a good idea? - to put it smack dab in the middle of the page?! Not me, that is for sure! Ok. So can we see a normal toolbar/ menu bar/ and optional toolbar at the top of the page, please? I like things the way they were. With various options to add buttons and pages or things that we need?? My toolbars were stacked appropriately in roles, with everything I needed on them.  And they were always in the same place. Not moving  around like toys on the floor. Please, please bring back the old toolbars for this old cranky punk chick. Thanks!!

Please give precise instructions how to accomplish both these tasks.  Im having great difficulty signing in and out of sites so until i figure out how and why things have changed i need a list of passwords. My device is currently unlocked.  I have trouble finding my way back to my questions here.  Why doesnt firefox have a history function?  Sometimes it does but its not recent.  I put all these questions together because its too difficult finding my way back to every individual question.  I have a hundred questions about firefox so many that its daunting to consider as it would take me days to do and its time i dont have.
