I use 1Password. I check all the urls on questionable email.  I use 2fa, and check for data briefs. </p><p>Firefox has built-in security. So does Apple.  And Firefox has all sorts of extensions that provide security.  Privacy Badger is from the EFF.  I don't know if they all do the same thing or cover things not covered. The descriptions say they protect me, but how do I know?  At times, I probably have overkill. </p><p>And this doesn't even address VPNs. </p><p>Searching for ""Security"" in extensions shows a list of about 2,000 extensions. ""Privacy"" returns a list of more than 2,600.  I would think that if you were confident in your security, there wouldn't be so many, and/or you wouldn't list them.  Do you have a gap that we need to find an extension to cover?] </p><p>There needs to be some consistency and clarity as to what you protect against and what they claim they protect against so we know which one we really need. It feels like buying a car and being told to go find our own tires in a vast warehouse, and then search for the gears we want, etc.  When we get on a plane, we don't select our own seatbelts.  If on a cruise ship, we don't choose our lifevests.  If that were the case, no one would get on boats or planes.  By letting us fend through thousands of security programs, you shift the responsibility to us.  And very few of us have enough training or knowledge to do so. </p><p>I don't expect you to be perfect, but helping us through this maze would be great.

Those of us who have limited, or impaired, motor control are particularly susceptible to this, though I have heard anecdotal evidence that other - unimpaired - users suffer from this as well. </p><p><strong>Example:</strong> There is a particular key combination that I periodically, (accidentally), hit while typing that immediately and irrevocably clears the dialog that I am entering text into - as I am doing here - with no possibility of recovery and no warning that a potentially disastrous action is about to take place. </p><p>My specific case, (that is, the most recent instance of my specific case), occurred last night while composing a reply to a topic within the Microsoft Flight Simulator forum addressing a particular, and popular, issue with the sim. </p><p>I spent a significant amount of time creating this message - setting paragraph formatting, creating tables, inserting images, carefully crafting the text and such like, that had taken me upwards of an hour to prepare.  </p><p>While typing - I managed to inadvertently hit a magical ""Nuke-and-Destroy"" key combination that caused all my lengthy, careful, painstakingly crafted work to immediately vanish with <strong>no chance of recovery</strong>. </p><p>To this very day I still have no idea what combination of keys does this - and if I knew, I would try to suppress it at the keyboard/system level so that Firefox never sees it. </p><p>When I searched for a solution to this problem, I found the following article on this site: [<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1364260"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/que.../1364260</a>] </p><p>In essence, (though it was worded much more politely), the answer was that Mozilla knows about the issue of potentially undesirable ""magic"" key combinations, has no plans to address it, and if you don't like it it just vacuums being you. </p><p>Though this particular key combination might be useful in certain cases, (though I cannot imagine what use-case would benefit from accidentally destroying hours of work), the utterly irrevocable nature of the action - and the <strong>absolute lack of any warning whatsoever</strong> - makes this a classic case in the annals of horrid user interface design; to the point of being a functional bug even though it works as designed. </p><p>A more desirable action would be to: </p> <ol><li> Allow it to be disabled entirely, along with the other potentially annoying/disastrous keyboard shortcuts. </li><li> Provide a (default) action that warns the user that this action is both immediate and irrevocable and allowing the (default) option to abort the action.  Extra credit: Allow the user to <strong>permanently disable</strong> the offending feature from the dialog. </li><li> In the unlikely event that a particular user might wish to use this regularly and deliberately, allow the user to bypass the warnings and permanently enable the feature - with the caveat that it vacuums being them if they do something wrong - not unlike the disclaimer when accessing about:config. </li></ol> <p>I would suggest that this action, and the action of other ""magic"" keys/key-combinations within Firefox represents a significant burden to those of us who may already be struggling to use a keyboard.  Perpetuating this class of issue, especially since it's a known issue and there's no desire whatsoever to accommodate those of us negatively affected by it, borders on both arrogance and ableism. </p><p>I would like to humbly place this request at the feet of whomever is responsible for this atrocious policy and earnestly request they reverse this unpleasant and destructive behavior. </p><p>Respectfully submitted: Jim Harris. </p><p>Added image: [a blank page representing the results of the magic ""Nuke-and-Destory"" key combination.&nbsp;:wink:] </p>",firefox-13303;firefox-1330;firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,1697764;1697765;,jharris1993

Please give precise instructions how to accomplish both these tasks.  Im having great difficulty signing in and out of sites so until i figure out how and why things have changed i need a list of passwords. My device is currently unlocked.  I have trouble finding my way back to my questions here.  Why doesnt firefox have a history function?  Sometimes it does but its not recent.  I put all these questions together because its too difficult finding my way back to every individual question.  I have a hundred questions about firefox so many that its daunting to consider as it would take me days to do and its time i dont have.   Somehow my firefox account has gotten too confusing and complex </p>,firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1697686;,kcsummer111
