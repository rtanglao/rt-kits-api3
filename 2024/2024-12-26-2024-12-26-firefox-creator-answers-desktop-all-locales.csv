Despite multiple attempts at troubleshooting—including uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox, clearing all caches, and other measures—the issue remains unresolved. </p><p>I’ve noticed that Firefox works for a few days after reinstallation, but then problems begin to surface, such as a half-screen display. Eventually, after restarting the PC, the browser starts crashing again. </p><p>Could you please investigate this matter urgently and provide a resolution? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could clarify whether this might be related to a RAM issue or some other underlying cause. </p><p>Looking forward to your assistance. </p><p>Best regards, zimmi </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;seg-linux;ubuntu;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",singhzimmi95
