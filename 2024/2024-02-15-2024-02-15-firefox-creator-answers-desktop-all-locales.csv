I found that all ""browser.fixup.alternate"" entries do not work anymore. After searching the web I found an answer that the fixup.alternate options don't work when the protocol is https. So, because today nearly all Websites use https, this options are completely without function. In my case I want to add the default TLD "".de"" if I do not enter the TLD. Is there any place (except source code, of course) to configure this behavior for https, too? </p><p>Many thanks in advance!
