I want to use Firefox exclusively for that purpose, so that all of Mozilla and Firefox staff can stop worrying about viruses, etc.   </p><p>The question is:  Is there such a setting on Firefox 115.7.0esr.dmg that would let me accomplish that.   I CAN follow long-winded &amp; complicated instructions to the letter, and as long as these instructions are correct and complete, there should be no problem.  If mission control for NASA's 1977's Voyager can still communicate and extend the useful of the Voyager probe, then I figure that you understand what it might take to keep a MacBook Air from 2015 going.   In other words: As long as it works, it's worth it to keep it going. </p><p>If Mozilla's mantra is: ""Lets destroy everything older than 4 years"", then you will not understand the issue.  </p><p>Does anyone on Support Mozilla know the secret magic software words to do this? </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1012;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",faithk101

I found that all ""browser.fixup.alternate"" entries do not work anymore. After searching the web I found an answer that the fixup.alternate options don't work when the protocol is https. So, because today nearly all Websites use https, this options are completely without function. In my case I want to add the default TLD "".de"" if I do not enter the TLD. Is there any place (except source code, of course) to configure this behavior for https, too? </p><p>Many thanks in advance!
