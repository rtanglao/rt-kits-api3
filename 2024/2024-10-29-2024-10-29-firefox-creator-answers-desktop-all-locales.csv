These can occur on the webpage itself, or they can occur in the URL/Tab bar.  Once the window exceeds a certain width (roughly 75% the width of my screen) I begin to see these artifacts (if that's what they're called).  If the window is downsized to half, or just slightly under 3/4 the width of the screen, these visual glitches don't appear.  I've tried disabling hardware acceleration as recommended, but this doesn't seem to fix the issue or change it in any way.

In Amazon, the issue is obvious and appears across the entire webpage, except for where the cursor has an interaction with the page (such as highlighting text, or hovering over something causing a transition).  In the Tab/URL bar, setting the window as wide as possible and then hitting the WIN button to open the Start Menu seems to cause the issue 100% of the time.  Running my cursor across a blurry section of the Tab bar seems to temporarily revert a portion of the it to looking normal again.

Problem: I have repeatedly selected all items in Firefox bookmarks sub-folders and then followed by importing html bookmarks  thinking that I was updating my bookmarks, so all my browsers had same. Instead, what I find is duplicated sets of bookmarks building up about 10-fold so that now any search for a site yields far too many duplicate listings and it is a mess. How do I prevent this from happening and how do I actually and truly delete all boomkarks in Firefox? </p> <ul><li><ul><li><ul><li> </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> <p>Aside topic: For all the folks who have accidentally lost bookmarks, my experience with losses has lead to always having backup files of bookmarks and backup listings in word or Excel of all my settings and extensions, etc. Automation has advantages, but it introduces new headaches. I can never allow myself to believe that everything will one day be just rosy. Also, multiple different browsers can be very helpful. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,1684756;,Firefox_Ji1H4m
