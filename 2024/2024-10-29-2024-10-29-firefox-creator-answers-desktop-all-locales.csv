My mac audio is routed to Apolos virtual 1-2 Channels. You can see the Audio Midi settings in the uploaded image. </p><p>Using Twitch there are some streams that play out of the wrong channels. For instance on one stream (<a href=""https://www.twitch.tv/datto"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.twitch.tv/datto</a>) the audio plays out of only the left side UAD Apollo Mon-L (the left channel of Apollos monitoring channel which is not virtual channel 1-2 my current Mac routing, but Monitor 1 only. Not even Monitor channel 2). </p><p>On other stream (<a href=""https://www.twitch.tv/aztecross"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.twitch.tv/aztecross</a>) it works correctly. I've tested on other browser including ARC and there was no issue. I've ran the troubleshooting mode and the issue is still present. I even changed my UAD Apollos to the normal Mon L-R channels and the issue is still present. </p><p>I'm wondering if Firefox has some issue with multichannel audio interfaces or audio interfaces in general? </p><p>I attached 2 images of my UAD console. You can see in the first image that on the MAC Channel there is no audio coming through while watching the Datto twitch stream. But you can see on the L monitor (all the way to the right) there is audio. </p><p>On the second image is a Aztecross twitch stream and audio is passing through the MAC channel correctly. </p><p>Any idea what is happening here? </p><p><strong>Reproducible?</strong>  I have checked that this issue is reproduced on Firefox, Firefox Nightly, Zen Browser. </p><p><strong>What platform are you seeing the problem on?</strong> macOS - aarch64 </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",thesoloist

These can occur on the webpage itself, or they can occur in the URL/Tab bar.  Once the window exceeds a certain width (roughly 75% the width of my screen) I begin to see these artifacts (if that's what they're called).  If the window is downsized to half, or just slightly under 3/4 the width of the screen, these visual glitches don't appear.  I've tried disabling hardware acceleration as recommended, but this doesn't seem to fix the issue or change it in any way.  I have a Samsung LS49CG932SNXZA (Odyssey G9 OLED) display running at 5120x1440 240hz on a 4070ti GPU.   </p><p>I am able to repeat this issue using Amazon as an example website, and I've attached some example screenshots.  In Amazon, the issue is obvious and appears across the entire webpage, except for where the cursor has an interaction with the page (such as highlighting text, or hovering over something causing a transition).  In the Tab/URL bar, setting the window as wide as possible and then hitting the WIN button to open the Start Menu seems to cause the issue 100% of the time.  Running my cursor across a blurry section of the Tab bar seems to temporarily revert a portion of the it to looking normal again.  If there's any more information I can give, or anything else I can try, please let me know.   </p><p><br> I also found this reddit post, which seems like others with ultrawide displays may also have this issue without a fix. <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1bcrsy8/ui_and_text_is_blurry_with_ultrawide_5120x1440/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1bcrsy8/ui_and_text_is_blurry_with_ultrawide_5120x1440/</a> </p>",firefox;browse;firefox-1310;firefox-13103;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",joelsclark30

Problem: I have repeatedly selected all items in Firefox bookmarks sub-folders and then followed by importing html bookmarks  thinking that I was updating my bookmarks, so all my browsers had same. Instead, what I find is duplicated sets of bookmarks building up about 10-fold so that now any search for a site yields far too many duplicate listings and it is a mess. How do I prevent this from happening and how do I actually and truly delete all boomkarks in Firefox? </p> <ul><li><ul><li><ul><li> </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> <p>Aside topic: For all the folks who have accidentally lost bookmarks, my experience with losses has lead to always having backup files of bookmarks and backup listings in word or Excel of all my settings and extensions, etc. Automation has advantages, but it introduces new headaches. I can never allow myself to believe that everything will one day be just rosy. Also, multiple different browsers can be very helpful. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,1684756;,Firefox_Ji1H4m
