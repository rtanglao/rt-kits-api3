Problem: I have repeatedly selected all items in Firefox bookmarks sub-folders and then followed by importing html bookmarks  thinking that I was updating my bookmarks, so all my browsers had same. Instead, what I find is duplicated sets of bookmarks building up about 10-fold so that now any search for a site yields far too many duplicate listings and it is a mess. How do I prevent this from happening and how do I actually and truly delete all boomkarks in Firefox? </p> <ul><li><ul><li><ul><li> </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> <p>Aside topic: For all the folks who have accidentally lost bookmarks, my experience with losses has lead to always having backup files of bookmarks and backup listings in word or Excel of all my settings and extensions, etc. Automation has advantages, but it introduces new headaches. I can never allow myself to believe that everything will one day be just rosy. Also, multiple different browsers can be very helpful. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",Firefox_Ji1H4m
