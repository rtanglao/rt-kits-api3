This creates on my desktop an identical version of the paper copy. It progressively uses more and more memory as I turn and enlarge/reduce page sizes to read articles etc. I have 32 gb of memory and it eventually runs out of memory with unpredictable results. I have to abandon Firefox and read the paper on Chrome. This behaves correctly and doesn't consume increasing amounts of memory. </p>,firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",pahh1

Problem: I have repeatedly selected all items in Firefox bookmarks sub-folders and then followed by importing html bookmarks  thinking that I was updating my bookmarks, so all my browsers had same. Instead, what I find is duplicated sets of bookmarks building up about 10-fold so that now any search for a site yields far too many duplicate listings and it is a mess. How do I prevent this from happening and how do I actually and truly delete all boomkarks in Firefox? </p> <ul><li><ul><li><ul><li> </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> <p>Aside topic: For all the folks who have accidentally lost bookmarks, my experience with losses has lead to always having backup files of bookmarks and backup listings in word or Excel of all my settings and extensions, etc. Automation has advantages, but it introduces new headaches. I can never allow myself to believe that everything will one day be just rosy. Also, multiple different browsers can be very helpful. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,1684756;,Firefox_Ji1H4m
