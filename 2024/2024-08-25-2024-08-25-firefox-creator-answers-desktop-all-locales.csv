But for the past few weeks, I’ve been having issues with this. </p><p>What happens is, when I type in something, press enter, most of the time nothing happens (but sometimes it works as it used to). I then have to mouse-click on the typed in search parameters in the search/address bar and press enter again. At that point it might “hold” and show me the search results. But other times, it doesn’t and I have to repeat the process up to 10 times before it finally holds and shows me the search results. </p><p>Even more annoying is when I’m already on some site in Firefox, and I want to type in a new site/search result over the existing one. It used to work just fine. But now, most of the time the same thing happens as above, except that when it doesn’t work the first time, typed in search parameters are gone, as it just shows the last site address in the search/address bar, so I have to go up to the search/address bar, type in the search parameters again, and press enter again, hoping that it will hold that time. If it doesn’t, I just have to repeat over and over again. So it’s basically easier to click a new tab, type the search parameters in there, and spam mouse-click, enter until it holds. </p><p>This is getting so annoying that I’m seriously considering moving away from Firefox and going to Chrome, which I honestly hate cause I really don’t want to support Chrome and want to stick with Firefox, but this issue is driving me nuts. </p><p>I have also tried troubleshooting the usual thing with “Refresh Firefox” and “Clear Cache”, removed all my extensions, and nothing helped. </p><p>Does anyone have any idea why this would be happening, and why I’m not finding any reports of a similar issue anywhere? What could actually be the issue here? </p>",desktop;windows-10;troubleshooting;firefox-1290;firefox-12902;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,1670436;,jernej.palcic

After close to two decades of using Firefox, I'm actually considering moving to something else at this point. It's getting to be remarkably inconvenient using Firefox recently. </p><p>Why the hell has Firefox been using such remarkable amounts of system-side HDD for prolonged amounts of time? (Primarily the System.exe process) on a ""Very"" annoyingly basis?? It's clearly Firefox causing the issue, stimulating the ""System"" process. It slows down the entire computer in entirety, including just trying to load a basic webpage (such as Google's homepage) for God's sake! </p><p>This needs to be fixed, it has been going on for far, far too long now! Even on a very up-to-date PC, it takes 10 or more minutes to get the damn browser to work, while it's killing everything else on said computer due to very, excessively, System HDD usage, without the ability to load a single page, or file, folder and etc...thus ruining the purpose of a 'browser' and the entire computer as well. </p><p>The 'System.exe' Overload needs to be fixed.
