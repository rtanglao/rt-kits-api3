After close to two decades of using Firefox, I'm actually considering moving to something else at this point. It's getting to be remarkably inconvenient using Firefox recently. </p><p>Why the hell has Firefox been using such remarkable amounts of system-side HDD for prolonged amounts of time? (Primarily the System.exe process) on a ""Very"" annoyingly basis?? It's clearly Firefox causing the issue, stimulating the ""System"" process. It slows down the entire computer in entirety, including just trying to load a basic webpage (such as Google's homepage) for God's sake! </p><p>This needs to be fixed, it has been going on for far, far too long now! Even on a very up-to-date PC, it takes 10 or more minutes to get the damn browser to work, while it's killing everything else on said computer due to very, excessively, System HDD usage, without the ability to load a single page, or file, folder and etc...thus ruining the purpose of a 'browser' and the entire computer as well. </p><p>The 'System.exe' Overload needs to be fixed. I, and all of my customers are tired of using Firefox because if this. It's pushing people away from what 'use' to be a wonderful browser. </p><p>I know factually it isn't a virus issue, or otherwise. </p><p>Please, fix this issue before it drives away the majority of your users. </p><p><br> -Carson </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",deadbolt1

The log in uses the usual steps: customer number - password - security code texted to be entered. That used to log you in. Now it takes you back to the log in screen. If you repeat the whole process, it might log you in, or it might take you back to the log in screen again. It does eventually log you in if you keep trying. Four times is the most so far. Log in still works as previously on other browsers. Just bloody annoying. </pre>",desktop;troubleshooting;firefox-1290;firefox-12902;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",rmorr0

Only live streaming on MacOS is affected. + Tried disabling all add-ons and toggling DRM but to no avail. + Checked Widevine is latest version (4.10.2710.0). </p><p>Appreciate any advice or help please.
