The log in uses the usual steps: customer number - password - security code texted to be entered. That used to log you in. Now it takes you back to the log in screen. If you repeat the whole process, it might log you in, or it might take you back to the log in screen again. It does eventually log you in if you keep trying. Four times is the most so far. Log in still works as previously on other browsers. Just bloody annoying. </pre>",desktop;troubleshooting;firefox-1290;firefox-12902;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",rmorr0

Here is some quick info and what I had tried: </p><p>+ Besides privacy reasons, I am unable to share the website address, as viewing is limited to my country's IP addresses by the national broadcaster. + I have a dual-monitor set up to a Windows and a MacOS machine, both installed with Firefox 129.0.2 with add-ons being synced. + Viewing live videos on the same website in Windows Firefox (HDCP-certified cable) has no issue but not on MacOS Firefox (same HDCP-certified cable but different HDMI port on the monitor). + Switching around the different HDMI ports and cables yield the same outcome. + No issue on either Windows or MacOS when viewing recorded videos though. Only live streaming on MacOS is affected. + Tried disabling all add-ons and toggling DRM but to no avail. + Checked Widevine is latest version (4.10.2710.0). </p><p>Appreciate any advice or help please. Thanks in advance. </p>",desktop;troubleshooting;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1290;firefox-12902;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",subdet
