I recently got a new computer &amp; a professional set it up for me. It appears he installed a more recent version of Firefox--and I can find no way to attach my library in the same, easily accessible fashion. Instead, I have to go through a number of steps to access the library. </p><p>I'm hoping there is a way to do this. Otherwise, this version is in no way as useful as the old one I had with W7. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",firefox;firefox-1300;installation-and-updates;firefox-13001;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",jcarnahan79

I only have BitdefenderVPN, which I no longer use, and ExpressVPN, which is what I now use. Today when I connect through Firefox, MozillaVPN keeps shutting down my ExpressVPN and opening itself. I have a tug-of-war between the two, even though I did not subscribe to nor install MozillaVPN. I believe this happened after the latest Firefox update. Any ideas? I run Windows 11 64-bit, which seems not to play well with LOTS of programs, include some browser extensions. </p>",firefox;windows-11;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",gcoregistrar
