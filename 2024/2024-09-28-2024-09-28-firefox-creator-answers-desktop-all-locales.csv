Pasting the YouTube video title into the search bar renders the text correctly in the search bar, but not in the actual search window or results page. I'm also seeing this issue on Instagram, Twitter, etc., so it isn't just a problem with YouTube/Google. The text renders correctly in Chrome and Safari, so I don't think it's necessarily a problem with my computer. </p><p>Here's what I've tried so far to diagnose/fix the issue: </p> <ul><li> Quitting Firefox and restarting my computer: didn't work </li><li> Opening Firefox in Troubleshoot Mode: the text remains messed up </li><li> Deleting prefs.js from my profile folder: my Firefox stops working and no pages load, not even the New Tab page </li><li> Firefox Refresh: also did not work </li><li> Creating a fresh Firefox profile: the new profile renders the text correctly, but signing into my Firefox account on the profile causes the issue to come up again </li><li> Uninstalling Firefox completely, reinstalling: the text renders, but once again signing into my account causes the issue to reemerge </li><li> Opening Firefox on my old computer (also MacBook Pro) while signed into my Firefox account: for some reason, the stylized text renders correctly on this computer </li></ul> <p>I'm at a dead end right now, and would appreciate any help. I could always just create a new profile and forget about it, but this has been driving me crazy for the past few hours. I really don't want to configure all my extensions and browser settings from the beginning, and I hope that I can keep using my original account. </p><p>Anyone have any idea what could be going wrong?
