I use Bitwarden for passwords. I also have UBlock Origin, but that should not affect logins. I clear cache and cookies upon browser close. I ended up resetting Firefox entirely, which was a royal pain, it worked for a few days and now is not working again. I have no problems logging in with Chrome but Firefox is my preferred browser. </p><p>Also having problems with the captchas on Etsy. I get endless captchas, like for five minutes. I set up 2FA in hopes it would stop with the captchas but that only worked once and now it's endless captchas again. Yet no problems on Chrome.  </p><p>The NYTimes problem is recent and started early to mid-August 2024. The Etsy problem started maybe late June? Same password manager, same extensions. I hate to go to Chrome every time I need to log in. So far these are the only two websites that consistently give me problems. Does anybody have a fix? </p>",firefox;windows-10;firefox-1290;firefox-12902;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1672796;,peasonearth
