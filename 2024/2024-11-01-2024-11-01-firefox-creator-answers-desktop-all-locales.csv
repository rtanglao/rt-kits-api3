It will occasionally display but usually doesn't. When it fails to display, the scrollbar disappears but nothing shows.  I tried clearing cache and cookies (Ctrl + F5, Settings + Clear data, etc.), refreshing firefox, and disabling all addons/extensions but the problem persists. I also tried turning off hardware acceleration and turned off proxies and secure DNS but nothing worked.  I noticed this ""_error.js"" message in the debugger: </p><p>module.exports = __NEXT_REGISTER_PAGE(""/_error"", function () { </p><pre> var e = webpackJsonp(    [566],    {      1789: function (e, r, o) {        e.exports = o(288)      },    },    [1789],  )  return { page: e.default } </pre> <p>}) </p><p><br> I do not have this issue on firefox android, only on desktop.

I could only scroll down so far -- there was nothing more, no page two, etc.   Email to City confirmed the problem with the form was on my end.  Then I used Safari to get that same City complaint form.  Same site, same form. But, on Safari there was about a full page more to the form that had been missing on Firefox. Additional questions, boxes to check, spaces to fill, places to upload photos/files.  And at the bottom of the form was the ""SUBMIT"" button.     I don't think I've had this particular issue with other forms, questionnaires, etc. elsewhere.  Is there a filter or something blocking random stuff? </p><p>I'm not able to Screenshot the page as shown in Safari, so: <a href=""https://www.portland.gov/homelessness-impact-reduction/report-campsite"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.portland.gov/homelessness-impact-reduction/report-campsite</a> I think I can ""Add image"" as a screenshot of the form as shown in Firefox . . . .           . . . . . . .  . . . oh well, turns out I don't know how to make all that happen.  Thanks for whatever anyone can come up with. </p>",firefox;browse;firefox-1310;firefox-13103;,firefox,browse,en-US,1685227;1685230;,jabarnas
