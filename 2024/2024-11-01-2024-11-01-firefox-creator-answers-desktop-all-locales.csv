I am running on a laptop with Windows 10 at the latest version.  Until the latest update to Firefox, all was great.  Now, only after the latest version of Firefox, I consistently get messages about link timing out when I click on anything.  Usually, it takes 2 or 3 clicks to open a new tab.  What has happened with the latest version?  Can I undo the latest version?  Thanks for any help.  I can't wait 30 seconds for every tab or window to open. </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",johnw2work

I'm asked to enter my authentication code. Years ago, I was given a list of 8 different 10-digit authentication codes as well as a 32 character ""Recovery Key"". None of them have ever worked. I end up having to sign back in to my account using my Apple or Google accounts.

It will occasionally display but usually doesn't. When it fails to display, the scrollbar disappears but nothing shows.

I could only scroll down so far -- there was nothing more, no page two, etc.   Email to City confirmed the problem with the form was on my end.  Then I used Safari to get that same City complaint form.  Same site, same form. But, on Safari there was about a full page more to the form that had been missing on Firefox. Additional questions, boxes to check, spaces to fill, places to upload photos/files.  And at the bottom of the form was the ""SUBMIT"" button.     I don't think I've had this particular issue with other forms, questionnaires, etc. elsewhere.  Is there a filter or something blocking random stuff? </p><p>I'm not able to Screenshot the page as shown in Safari, so: <a href=""https://www.portland.gov/homelessness-impact-reduction/report-campsite"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.portland.gov/homelessness-impact-reduction/report-campsite</a> I think I can ""Add image"" as a screenshot of the form as shown in Firefox . . . .           . . . . . . .  . . . oh well, turns out I don't know how to make all that happen.
