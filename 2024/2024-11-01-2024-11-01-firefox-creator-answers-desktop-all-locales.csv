I am running on a laptop with Windows 10 at the latest version.  Until the latest update to Firefox, all was great.  Now, only after the latest version of Firefox, I consistently get messages about link timing out when I click on anything.  Usually, it takes 2 or 3 clicks to open a new tab.  What has happened with the latest version?  Can I undo the latest version?  Thanks for any help.

I could only scroll down so far -- there was nothing more, no page two, etc.   Email to City confirmed the problem with the form was on my end.  Then I used Safari to get that same City complaint form.  Same site, same form. But, on Safari there was about a full page more to the form that had been missing on Firefox. Additional questions, boxes to check, spaces to fill, places to upload photos/files.  And at the bottom of the form was the ""SUBMIT"" button.     I don't think I've had this particular issue with other forms, questionnaires, etc. elsewhere.
