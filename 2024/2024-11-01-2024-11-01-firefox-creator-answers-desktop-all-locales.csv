I accessed X using Chrome, Brave and Edge on the laptop but not Firefox. I've searched high and low for a solution but without success. Does anyone have a possible solution?

Every time I install Browserguard on Firefox, it only works properly immediately after the installation, before I close Firefox. Once I close Firefox and then reopen Firefox, Browserguard will not function properly. It does not block anything. Example. I open Edge, go to classicalfm dot ca, and Browserguard blocks 19 items. Go to the same website using Firefox, it blocks zero items. Why? Again, immediately after a fresh installation of Browserguard in Firefox, it will block those 19 items. If I close Firefox and then reopen Firefox, Browserguard blocks nothing. I fail to understand why. I want to be able to use Firefox with Browserguard properly working. Thanks in advance for any help.
