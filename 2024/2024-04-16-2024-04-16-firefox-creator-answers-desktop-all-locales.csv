I tried going to the root directory in the about:profiles section of the more troubleshooting information section and renaming xulstore.json to xulstore.json.old, and each time it worked for a few days and then it just installed a new xulstore.json and went back to opening in the small screen. This is really annoying and I don't want to switch it manually every time. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1240;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",HunterWade2024
