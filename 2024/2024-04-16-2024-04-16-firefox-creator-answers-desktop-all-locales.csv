Since doing this, the taskbar icon is not the same as it has always been.  </p><p>It used to be that if I pinned Firefox to the taskbar, I would click on it and the default Firefox window would open. When the mouse was right-clicked, the icon showed there was a choice of the default Firefox window and an option for a privacy window I could choose. I did that frequently. </p><p>Now if I pin Firefox to the taskbar there is no privacy window option. If I pin the private browser to the taskbar, this becomes the default window with options for the non-private default browser available with a right mouse click. </p><p>I would like to know how to pin the default Firefox window to the taskbar and have the private window option show up when that icon is clicked please.  </p><p>Thanks for any help provided with this issue. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",lightshowe
