Making a Mozilla account for Sync is not worth it for the average user who likes to use this feature as a solution to writing down every password or saving sites as bookmarks. Without recovery keys if you must reset your password because you forgot, because it is unwise to write down passwords as well as use the same password for everything(for security reasons), Mozilla will wipe your data, for ""security reasons"". But, you can still see all of your past logins to Mozilla's services. Why isn't this data wiped? It is a poor excuse to say that sync wasn't designed to be used as a back up, which is ridiculous. I have no reason to keep an account with Mozilla and neither does anyone else who expects to use this to store or save internet data. Auto fill is useless if this data is unrecoverable. Making Firefox even less useful. Even though posts going back years state that it is moving in the direction of being a back up. I guess it is super secure when even you can't remember your passwords and rely on a service such as Mozilla's Sync. These are things they don't tell you nor is the info easily found unless you have an issue and need to search for it. Then you find it when it's useless. Do better Mozilla. Been using FF for decades never used sync until this month Worked 1 time. Did 2 re-installs of Win on same PC got locked out of my Mozilla acct. Didn't think something as trivial as a PW reset would wipe my data. User beware! Extremely annoyed. Hope this is searchable as this answered multiple questions about Sync. It is pointless for Mozilla to have your data that you cannot recover. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",user75446190825702568081229215255627871403

But for some time they can recall information and processes which were learned previously. </p><p>After some years, they will be unable to utilize any of the technology they depend upon - they will not be able to turn on their device to make a phone call.  They won't be able to locate the menu they need to utilize.  Because all that changes CONSTANTLY.  They will become helpless sooner than necessary.  They will strain their families and the taxpayer sooner than necessary. </p><p>The only solution is for software makers to roll out, every 5 or 6 years, a ""stable version"" where the user interface will not change one iota for 25 years.  Of course, they must still make internal updates for security and changes in the Internet Protocol layer system.  The portions of the code that deal with the user must be modular to be plugged into newer hardware and communication protocols. </p><p>When someone is diagnosed with memory impairment, they will have time to learn the latest Stable Version. </p><p>This is a very fundamental change to business as usual, but there is no other solution other than continuing to balloon the cost of elder car. </p><p>In the old days this would be a call for an RFP... </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1013;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,1650259;,s1s1s11
