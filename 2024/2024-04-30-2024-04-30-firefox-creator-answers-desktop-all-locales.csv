But for some time they can recall information and processes which were learned previously. </p><p>After some years, they will be unable to utilize any of the technology they depend upon - they will not be able to turn on their device to make a phone call.  They won't be able to locate the menu they need to utilize.  Because all that changes CONSTANTLY.  They will become helpless sooner than necessary.  They will strain their families and the taxpayer sooner than necessary. </p><p>The only solution is for software makers to roll out, every 5 or 6 years, a ""stable version"" where the user interface will not change one iota for 25 years.  Of course, they must still make internal updates for security and changes in the Internet Protocol layer system.  The portions of the code that deal with the user must be modular to be plugged into newer hardware and communication protocols. </p><p>When someone is diagnosed with memory impairment, they will have time to learn the latest Stable Version. </p><p>This is a very fundamental change to business as usual, but there is no other solution other than continuing to balloon the cost of elder car. </p><p>In the old days this would be a call for an RFP... </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1013;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,1650259;,s1s1s11
