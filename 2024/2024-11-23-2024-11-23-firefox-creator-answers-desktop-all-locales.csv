I can login using Chrome. Firefox worked fine until I tried logging in on November 21 and then I ended up in a loop. I can access other parts of Spectrum, just can't get to mail. I have it set up to transfer to Outlook and than works fine. Spectrum says there is nothing they can do about it. </p><p>Has anyone else had this experience? If so, were you able to resolve it? </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",joycehawkins
