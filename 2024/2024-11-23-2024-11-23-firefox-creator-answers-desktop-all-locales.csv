The Google login works fine in Chrome, but in Firefox, the page freezes during the login process. </p><p><strong>Here are the details:</strong> </p><p><strong>Issue:</strong> After typing two characters into the email field of the Google login, Firefox becomes unresponsive, and I see a ""Firefox is not responding"" message. <strong>Behavior:</strong> The issue only happens in Firefox. The login works perfectly in Chrome without any issues. <strong>Steps Taken:</strong> </p> <ul><li> Reinstalled Firefox. </li><li> Cleared the browser cache and cookies. </li><li> Disabled all browser extensions. </li><li> Verified that the login works in Chrome. </li></ul> <p>It seems to be a problem specifically with Google login in Firefox.
