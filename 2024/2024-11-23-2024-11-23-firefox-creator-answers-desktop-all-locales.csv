The crash happens on the screen where you enter your email address, before the page where you enter your password. I start to enter my email, and about 3 letters in to typing my entire browser freezes. The crash also happens in troubleshooting mode, so I know that it isn't a problem with one of my plug-ins. This isn't an urgent issue, I can get by with the gmail accounts that are already logged in, but it is really annoying. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",samhunt0212
