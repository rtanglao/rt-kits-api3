I have my files backed up with Carbonite.  I have found and downloaded a copy of my Firefox profile from Carbonite's website.  I wanted to restore the profile to the new Mac computer.  I have followed the instructions I found online to copy the specific files to the new profile.  I finally got the bookmarks file to work, so my bookmarks are now transferred to the Mac.  However, the passwords are still not showing up when I copy key4.db and logins.json to the new profile on the Mac.  What can I do to get the passwords copied and restored to the Mac? </p><p>I do not know what version of Firefox I was running when the profile file was last backed up, but it was supposed to be running the current version when the laptop crashed last week.  However, Carbonite shows the date of key4.db to be April of 2019 and the date of logins.json to be 10/8/2022.  Should the files be newer?  Would they be from an older version of Firefox that's not compatible with the current Mac version?  I also just noticed that even though the bookmarks folder was dated 6/9/2024 in Carbonite, the restored bookmarks do not show some fairly recent bookmarks I added earlier this year.  Is there any way to get my files back? </p><p>The Windows laptop that crashed is stuck in a loop and says it's trying to repair the hard drive.  Is there a way to get it turned on but not booted up and connect it via a USB cable and transfer files to the Mac that way? </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-1150;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",ajpeavler

This happens only on Firefox, only since the last update, and Firefox is the same browser we have been using for years with Instagram. The problem is the cookie permission window for Instagram a) will not make a selection and b) will not disappear/close. We have attached a screenshot. There are no close tabs/buttons anywhere on this window, and we have looked the full length of the expanded window. As we have not changed any other setting, have not added any software, and this only happens on Firefox, we can only conclude that we have missed something which may have changed or been upgraded with your last update. This is quite urgent, as this is to manage the Instagram account of a wildlife conservation charity. So far we have tried reinstalling Firefox, clearing cookies, and deactivating/uninstalling all add-ons, however this has solved nothing. Could anyone suggest a solution please? Thank you for your time and assistance. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",tpgsc

The entire interface is installed in Russian. Mozila has a service for automatically translating website content into other languages. Unfortunately, the set of languages ​​does not include Russian, so that I could automatically translate information from sites, for example in Spanish, into Russian and read such information. In the settings I found a function to switch the language translation, but unfortunately there is no Russian language again. Please tell me how can I set up such a translation? Or is there no such service at all for the Russian language? </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;,firefox,other,en-US,"",1896230232
