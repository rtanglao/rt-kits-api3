Eventually I was persuaded to reinstall firefox from the Mozilla oficial site using Edge, despite having reservations about losing my passwords etc. which has happened before. Fortunately, the installation routine included an update option which preserved all of that. However, my menus bar (File ...... History, Bookmarks...) is missing and I cannot find any way to get it back. I rely upon it to restore previous sessions, because I routinely have the same 7 tabs open and want to be able to get them back after an update or laptop shutdown, and also use it to search history and find bookmarks that are not in the bookmarks bar. Any help welcome. </p><p>As an asside, my pet hate is updates to any application that remove, move, or hide a very useful feature without explanation or warning and claim to be to ""improve the user experience"".

As we have not changed any other setting, have not added any software, and this only happens on Firefox, we can only conclude that we have missed something which may have changed or been upgraded with your last update. This is quite urgent, as this is to manage the Instagram account of a wildlife conservation charity.
