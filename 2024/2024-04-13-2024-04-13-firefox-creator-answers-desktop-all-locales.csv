The up/down arrow keys are no longer scroll me up and down a webpage like they always have in the past. Instead of doing smooth scrolling like they always use to, now they are scrolling me up and down the links on a web page. For example, if I were to be on youtube it would first want to scroll me down the left side links before taking me through each and every video link, when the page goes to load in more videos than it wants to go back and scroll me down the left side links again. It acts like it is taking me through the html code, line by line, instead of scrolling me smoothly down the webpage. The only way I can scroll smoothly down the webpage is to use the mouse on the scrollbar on the right side. It does this both in normal mode and in Troubleshooting Mode. </p><p>I have checked and beret scrolling is false as well as beret_shortcut. Use autoscrolling, use smooth scrolling, show scrollbars and always underline links are all clicked on. Always use the cursor keys to navigate within pages is unclicked.
