To get back to the ""normal"" video player, I have to log out of my Google account, restart Firefox, and then log back in. This problem only seems to occur a longer while after logging back into my account, but it is recurring. </p><p>This only started happening after I downloaded Google Chrome and installer two plugins as a part of testing (supposedly used to HTML code extraction). I did remove both extensions, and then uninstalled Chrome, but the issue persists. </p><p>Is there any way to combat this? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1230;firefox-12301;,firefox,fix-problems,cs,"",honza.kvapil.jk

After I logged into my firefox account it synced everything.  </p><p>When I check my password manager it said my passwords for 2 sites were last ""used"" today.  It's after midnight now so it would have been in the last 1 - 2 hours.   </p><p>One of the websites had a 2nd factor authentication and nothing came to my phone.  I am just wondering if this was a password manager glitch or something to worry about.  The place I synced is my family computer and no one else would log onto those sites since they are work sites.  And again it's midnight the other computer is off too. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",flints16

I have a concern about my saved passwords in Firefox. If I need to lookup a password, I go settings, saved logins, put in my pin# and search and copy my password.  Many times; however, when I get to the enter password on a website, Firefox comes up above my keypad and will let me just hit the down button to pick my credentials and automatically fills in my credentials without asking for my pin! It will also come up above keyboard to unlock Firefox? Please help me to clear this mess up. I want to have to put in a pin for my passwords. Anyone could get into my websites if my phone were taken, etc. I know I un-installed the app for passwords from Firefox when it was no longer available, sorry can't remember name of this app. I hope there is an easy way to make this happen. The only way I want to look for a password is with a pin #. It's a pain but I am OK with this. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",ingdas408

I have a number of videos on youtube and when I was doing some work in markdown I clicked on an older link and was redirected to a website with some bozo trying to promote something - not mine. I tried a few more times and got a bunch of different websites and bozos.  This is from clicking on the shared link on the the youtube page.   </p><p>I don't know whether I've something on my computer, your browser that's causing it, or something somehow on youtube???? </p><p>Got any suggestions? </p><p>Including a screen shot of the each clicks results. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1230;firefox-12301;,firefox,other,en-US,1641579;,2nzkhf2xts
