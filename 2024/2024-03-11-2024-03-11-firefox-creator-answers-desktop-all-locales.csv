I am attempting to add the same URL to two separate bookmark folders on my bookmark toolbar so that I may have a better chance of finding it in six months when I'm likely to need to visit that website again.    The reason is that the website in question fits neatly in terms of subject into two of my folders.    </p><p>At present in Firefox, if you place a URL in a bookmark folder then try to place it again in a separate folder then Firefox appears to remove the URL from the first bookmark folder and place it in the second.  It would be handy for Firefox to either just accept the second placing or display a dialogue box pointing out that the URL already exists in another folder and asking if the user wants to a) move the URL to the place where the user tried to place a new bookmark, or b) go ahead and place a duplicate in the newer folder c) cancel the request.     </p><p>I'm a long term user / fan of Firefox and have no intention of moving browsers.  This functionality would be very useful.  Hoping you can action this in the next update.   </p><p>Regards </p><p>Martin </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1230;firefox-12301;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",smiggy1968
