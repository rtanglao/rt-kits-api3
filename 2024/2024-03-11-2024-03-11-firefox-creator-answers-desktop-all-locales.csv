I have a concern about my saved passwords in Firefox. If I need to lookup a password, I go settings, saved logins, put in my pin# and search and copy my password.  Many times; however, when I get to the enter password on a website, Firefox comes up above my keypad and will let me just hit the down button to pick my credentials and automatically fills in my credentials without asking for my pin! It will also come up above keyboard to unlock Firefox? Please help me to clear this mess up. I want to have to put in a pin for my passwords. Anyone could get into my websites if my phone were taken, etc. I know I un-installed the app for passwords from Firefox when it was no longer available, sorry can't remember name of this app. I hope there is an easy way to make this happen. The only way I want to look for a password is with a pin #. It's a pain but I am OK with this. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",ingdas408
