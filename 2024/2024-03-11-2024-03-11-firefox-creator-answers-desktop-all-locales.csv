I have a number of videos on youtube and when I was doing some work in markdown I clicked on an older link and was redirected to a website with some bozo trying to promote something - not mine. I tried a few more times and got a bunch of different websites and bozos.  This is from clicking on the shared link on the the youtube page.   </p><p>I don't know whether I've something on my computer, your browser that's causing it, or something somehow on youtube???? </p><p>Got any suggestions? </p><p>Including a screen shot of the each clicks results. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1230;firefox-12301;,firefox,other,en-US,"",2nzkhf2xts
