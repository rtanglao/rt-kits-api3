I am currently having issues trying to log into my student Blackboard account on my college's website. I have played with Firefox's settings quite a bit turning different options and off like pop up blocker trying to get the page to load.I have tried closing and reopening Firefox. I have restarted Firefox, refreshed Firefox, have totally uninstalled Firefox and reinstalled it, and have used an older version of Firefox and still cannot get this page to load. At least with Firefox, on this particular computer. My laptop, which I have been using for the last 2 years for college, also has Firefox installed on it, and loaded up the website just fine, as it always has. Also, I am able to load the website perfectly fine, on this specific computer in question, with Microsoft Edge. I was also able to access the website fine with my phone, which uses Dolphin as its browser. So, my issue is either with Firefox, this particular computer, or a combination of the two in conjunction somehow. Because I can access the website just fine with Firefox, on my older laptop, and I can access the website on this particular computer, if I use a different browser than Firefox. Which I would not like to do. I even played around with setting the sites as exceptions in both my firewall and in Firefox itself. Attached is a screenshot of the code received when trying to load it with Firefox on this computer. </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",tsalagiwaya33

I have encountered this problem on many cases over the past decade, be it due to an update, a power failure, a BSOD, or just randomly (despite closing the application correctly); like a law of nature, eventually firefox will just forget to open a window, or the entire session. This issue has caused me to switch to other web browsers in the past, multiple times. They each struggle with this in their own way. </p><p>Sometimes I can save my session by finding it in the sessionstore-backups folder, but the problem I am talking about is that that does not always work! Often times the backups get overwritten when the problem occurs - even if I don't touch firefox or open it again or close it, even if I immediately notice that a window that was there when I previously opened firefox is no longer there, often times nothing in the backup files actually has the version that I want. It's always overwritten with the new/modified session that's missing hundreds or thousands or tabs from my session restore history. </p><p>I think that the ability to actually restore a session and not have to cross my fingers that it doesnt blow up and delete my entire history (which randomly occurs at least once every few months) is the biggest problem with firefox. It is the most frustrating thing that any web browser can do. And quite frankly even if I wanted to use Firefox Sync to store my session information on a remote server (which I do not!) I do not actually trust that firefox will actually not fumble it and randomly delete my session every few months, given the history of how this problem has existed as long as I have been using this software. At least with the local sessions, sometimes I can recover some of the data, which isn't an option when firefox sync inevitably drops my session history. I am on the verge of setting up some kind of recurring task to back up the session store files on a regular basis just so I don't go crazy. </p><p>So: why does this problem exist? Is there a long running thread about why the session restore system sucks? Will it ever get fixed (even having multiple backups or the ability to manually save a backup in the UI would be a major improvement)? Are there community supported tools to fix this problem by saving extra copies of the sessionstore files? </p>",linux;desktop;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",m128
