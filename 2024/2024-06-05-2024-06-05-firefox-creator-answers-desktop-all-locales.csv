I followed the recommended instructions to set one, but no matter what I entered, it would be unable to set. (Password quality meter was not full (75-80%~), if that is significant.) </p><p>After this, I would receive continuous pop-up windows asking to set a Primary Password, but all attempts to set such a password would fail (Window named&nbsp;:""Alert"", with text stating ""Unable to Change Password."")  These would persist until I shut down my computer, and I stopped receiving these popup windows, but ultimately, I am still unable to set a primary password., and thus, am unable to save passwords. </p><p>(Pop-up Windows were labelled ""Change Password"", and had text stating ""Security Device: Software Security Device"", along with having the password change form) </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",mezza9by9

On my Razer (so far) I've had no (new) issues with Dark Mode, but on my Macbook, the Firefox browser is always in dark mode when I search Google. It does not impact other sites (not even this one, where I'm typing this, or any of the other pages where I've looked for a fix). I have had this issue consistently with Firefox across mobile, my Razer, my old Windows computer, my Macbook, and everywhere I want to use it. In the past, changing the theme, going into the config settings (which I hate doing and am trying to avoid this time around), or using the Firefox Color custom themes have worked. I even checked my Google settings, and Dark Mode is completely disabled for search. So I know it's a Firefox issue.  </p><p>Is there a permanent, consistent solution to just completely disable dark mode?  I am never going to want to use it, and I am tired of having to go through some version of this every time I try to use Firefox on Mac -- especially since this time none of my normal workarounds are actually working.  </p><p>I'd eat nails before using Chrome, but I am extremely frustrated. </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",boromiirs
