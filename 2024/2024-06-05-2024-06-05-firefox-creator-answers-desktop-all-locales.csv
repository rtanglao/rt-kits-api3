Everything went well, my bookmarks appears, all (!) my extensions were installed, everything looked fine. Then I went about my way configuring unrelated Linux stuff, using Firefox as normal on both computers, no problems. </p><p>But at some point, I suddenly noticed that on both computers, the icons for most of my extensions had disappeared. And sure enough, looking in about:addons, all that was left were five addons (Dark Reader, Simple Translate, uBlock Origin, Dictionary Anywhere, OneTab). And on both computers, including my main laptop (!), where I hadn't done anything other than clicking around in websites. </p><p>And it only affected the extensions, my bookmarks, history, etc all is fine and synced between the computers. </p><p>No restarting of Firefox, choosing different profiles in about:profiles (there was only one other, a mostly empty one), nothing got them back. And looking in ~/.mozilla/firefox/, sure enough extensions.json and all extension related folders had been changed, looking as if I never had more than these five extensions installed. </p><p>And when I installed one of my usual extensions again, all of it's settings and customizations were back to default. So this is not just a case of having to reinstall a few extensions. All custom uBlock filters, all Tampermonkey scripts, etc, everything is gone. </p><p>I tried looking around on the web for solutions, but it appears that there is no one who has had this exact issue before, and I couldn't find any indication that there is any way to revert such an error by Firefox Sync. </p><p>To my luck, I have a secondary laptop where I should have a mostly up-to-date instance of my Firefox profile, from which I will now try to recover my extension data, but if that weren't the case, years of fine-tuned settings and customizations would be gone. </p><p>As people rely on Firefox Sync to <em>back up</em> their Firefox data, instead of backing up their Firefox data ""against"" Firefox Sync failing like this, I'd think this is not something that ever should be possible to happen. <strong>At the very least, there should be some way to revert errors like this.</strong> Perhaps Firefox Sync could store backups either server side or client side before syncing deletions like this? </p>",linux;desktop;sync;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,sync,en-US,1655916;,garbaz

On my Razer (so far) I've had no (new) issues with Dark Mode, but on my Macbook, the Firefox browser is always in dark mode when I search Google. It does not impact other sites (not even this one, where I'm typing this, or any of the other pages where I've looked for a fix). I have had this issue consistently with Firefox across mobile, my Razer, my old Windows computer, my Macbook, and everywhere I want to use it. In the past, changing the theme, going into the config settings (which I hate doing and am trying to avoid this time around), or using the Firefox Color custom themes have worked. I even checked my Google settings, and Dark Mode is completely disabled for search. So I know it's a Firefox issue.  </p><p>Is there a permanent, consistent solution to just completely disable dark mode?  I am never going to want to use it, and I am tired of having to go through some version of this every time I try to use Firefox on Mac -- especially since this time none of my normal workarounds are actually working.  </p><p>I'd eat nails before using Chrome, but I am extremely frustrated. </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",boromiirs
