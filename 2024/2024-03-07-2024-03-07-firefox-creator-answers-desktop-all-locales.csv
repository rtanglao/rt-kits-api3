Sometimes (or even quite often) we need to share the content with colleagues from Ukraine.  As it is a web-based app the content can be translated automatically from Polish by e.g. Chrome or Edge, however these solutions are blocked by the company firewall. Using Firefox Translations seems to be the only solution because it is the only one which translates locally without access to the internet. But... the Ukrainian is not supported... Do you know is it planned to add Ukrainian? Or maybe there are other solutions possible in our case? </p><p>Best regards Zofia </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1640844;1640846;1640847;,zofia.mas

It usually works fine, but I am trying to set a few services to bypass the proxy using the ""No proxy for"" box in the Firefox connection settings - specifically streaming sites like netflix, hulu, and plex. Despite putting these domains in the ""no proxy for"" box, the proxy still seems to be applied - ie. Netflix fails to stream as it would if I were connecting through the VPN. </p><p>To test, I also tried adding ""<a href=""http://whatismyipaddress.com"" rel=""nofollow"">whatismyipaddress.com</a>"" to the ""no proxy for"" box, and this <em>did</em> successfully bypass the vpn (showing my real IP), so it is working to some degree. I can also confirm that that site shows my vpn IP when it is not on the whitelist. </p><p>I assume that these streaming services are connecting to a different domain when streaming video, which is not on the whitelist to bypass the proxy because I have not added them. Does anyone know if this is the case, and if so, how I could fix the issue? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1640811;1640813;,isthissoup
