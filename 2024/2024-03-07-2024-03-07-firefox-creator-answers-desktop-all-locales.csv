It properly detects update and downloads it but when I click to restart browser and apply update (this should close browser and display update install bar) nothing happens - browser simply closes. When I launch it again and go into ""about firefox"" again I see spinning circle next to ""installing update"".  Of course this update never installs. When I close it for 2nd time and go into ""about firefox"" it goes back to ""update ready to install, click to restart"" - and again, when I click it browser simply closes without restarting and installing update. I tried removing my profile, using safe mode, disabling antivirus. Issue seems to be related to firefox itself. I also tried removing mozilla maintenance service but it did not help. It is weird that reinstalling firefox did not install this service again. Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this? For now only way for me to update firefox is manually download full installer from website and then it installs latest version without any problems - until next month comes and I have to update it again. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",Piterk

For Firefox one instance of the problem is then when I click a link on a Google search screen, it may give me a ""can't connect"" response. This also happens within certain websites involving a ""log in then redirect"" process (for example a university library access). For Thunderbird, it involves either the periodic saving of email drafts, the sending of email, or the copying of the sent message to the appropriate folder. Email is Gmail using IMAP. I am using Tbird 115.8.1 32 bit and Firefox 123.0.1 64 bit. The problem transcends ISPs (cable via Xfinity, then changed to fiber via Quantum / ATT so it's not the ISP, also, Ethernet cable to the modem), reasonably high speed (around 200 Mbs up and download). The problem never arises when I connect using Chrome. For Tbird, it is set to use <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a> (port 993), SSL/TLS and OAuth2. Windows 10, dunno what else would be relevant. </p><p>Generally, the solution is to ""just try again"", which gets a bit annoying, but with the Firefox login problem, this can require double or quadruple retries because ""retry"" causes the web page to complain that they will have to re-send the data (sure please do, then it may report a failure to resend ad infinitum). Offhand I would say this affects maybe 15% of my transmissions. Any suggestions for a cure or more diagnostic information? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",david.odden

Despite putting these domains in the ""no proxy for"" box, the proxy still seems to be applied - ie. Netflix fails to stream as it would if I were connecting through the VPN. </p><p>To test, I also tried adding ""<a href=""http://whatismyipaddress.com"" rel=""nofollow"">whatismyipaddress.com</a>"" to the ""no proxy for"" box, and this <em>did</em> successfully bypass the vpn (showing my real IP), so it is working to some degree. I can also confirm that that site shows my vpn IP when it is not on the whitelist. </p><p>I assume that these streaming services are connecting to a different domain when streaming video, which is not on the whitelist to bypass the proxy because I have not added them. Does anyone know if this is the case, and if so, how I could fix the issue? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1640811;1640813;,isthissoup
