It usually works fine, but I am trying to set a few services to bypass the proxy using the ""No proxy for"" box in the Firefox connection settings - specifically streaming sites like netflix, hulu, and plex. Despite putting these domains in the ""no proxy for"" box, the proxy still seems to be applied - ie. Netflix fails to stream as it would if I were connecting through the VPN. </p><p>To test, I also tried adding ""<a href=""http://whatismyipaddress.com"" rel=""nofollow"">whatismyipaddress.com</a>"" to the ""no proxy for"" box, and this <em>did</em> successfully bypass the vpn (showing my real IP), so it is working to some degree. I can also confirm that that site shows my vpn IP when it is not on the whitelist. </p><p>I assume that these streaming services are connecting to a different domain when streaming video, which is not on the whitelist to bypass the proxy because I have not added them. Does anyone know if this is the case, and if so, how I could fix the issue? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",isthissoup
