I have uninstalled and reinstalled, cleared cache and disabled add ons. I am using a vpn (PIA). Chrome and Edge both load and operate OK.  Thanks in advance.  </p><p>Captchas are an ongoing issue.  Firefox seems to have a LOT more captchas than other browsers.

I googled to find out how to disable it, and <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=how%20to%20turn%20off%20clipboard%20autocompletion%20in%20newest%20mozilla%3F"" rel=""nofollow"">the Featured Snippet said ""go to about:config and change clipboard.autocopy to false.""</a>  Sounded simple, so I did it, but subsequently found out that the article it quotes from is 10 years of age! </p><p>My first question, then, is: what does changing ""clipboard.autocopy"" to false do if it doesn't turn off the brand-new feature? </p><p>The second question is, how do I disable the new URL Paste Suggestion feature?  Will setting ""clipboard.autocopy"" disable it?  In particular, I want to make sure that the browser does <strong>not</strong> pre-load or pre-fetch the clipboard URL, and in fact, I wish to pop up a dialog box any time I do ""paste and go.""  People often copy URLs from e-mails to research them before visiting them directly; jumping directly will increase the likelihood of visiting an imposter site. </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1240;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",4232jl
