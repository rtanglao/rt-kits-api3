Desperate for help with Thunderbird lost all my emails - again!,"<p>Urgent Help Please as lost ALL EMAILS - I cannot get to post in Thunderbird: 1) I've now spent 4 hours, (from what was trying to sort a 'simple' problem on the server), as I couldn't send or receive any emails, as they think I've 6.5Gb of data on it, in spite of my deleting all my emails off it.  So they allowed some extra space to temp sort it again. It's been an issue for about 3mths now. But I deleted everything just the other day having confirmed that was not deleting them off my laptop and that the previously lost emails 2 yrs ago weren't still on their server.  </p><p>But now checked back on my email client Thunderbird, and I've no emails. They're all GONE bar the odd few I've put into folders (I stopped using folders years back as that lost all my emails way back then!), so I'd been keeping them all in the Inbox.  Although I've a few old Inbox files with previous old old emails in so I can access them if I need to. But at least their there! But now again I've just lost everything. This is such a disaster.   </p><p>Over the last 2yrs it's been going OK until today.  Now it's LOST ALL MY EMAILS.  I'm as per usual up to my eyes and have to travel this friday for meetings next week. The last thing I needed today was this.  I've lost so much data and info in those emails it's doesn't bare thinking about.  From show tickets that I need, medical info and data, to flight details to all sorts of crucial data.  My ONLY saving grace is that anything I've replied to, I have a copy in the sent folder.  </p><p>So Please Forgive this being in Firefox, as I can't even add it to Thunderbird help area!!  I've had to reset my pw too just to sign in.  Sadly right now it all feels so very upsetting I'm thinking I'll have to just have to start using another email client! If every 2 yrs I lose all my emails then this is just not acceptable.  I hope you can move this to the Thunderbird threads.  If you do please send me a link to it so I can try and find it.  </p><p>What's so upsetting is had I saved the Inbox file when I saw the 13Gb file size, a bit eariler then, I think I could have saved them.  I fear though that the remote server people deleted something, that was somehow still linked to my system and that's meant they've deleted my emails off my laptop too! Terrifying!  (Perhaps that is what happened before back in '22.&nbsp;???) I did look at a 'Sync' settings but not sure what they did so cancelled back out of them. </p><p>Running on Win 10 Pro 64Bit i7core 8Gb Ram Thunderbird 115.10.1 (64-bit) </p><p>Any and all help will be most gratefully received.  </p><p>Sub issue to get help&nbsp;:  2) Error to Sumbit to Thunderbird: Sadly I've gone around and around your system saying Ask Question when nothing answers my query on the Thunderbird email questions.  But when you click on Ask Question it just takes you back around the system again / Browse all Programs / re click on thunderbird/ reclick on Emails and back to list of FAQ's but nothing helps so click on Get Help and back around you go in a deja vu system. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,other,en-US,"",AuroraMagic

Application Menu unresponsive.,"<p>Whenever I type in a website URL in the search-bar, first of all, the drop-down menu of related searches and websites does not show up. When I press enter to confirm that's where I want to go, nothing happens. The URL just kinda sits there, no loading circle or anything... Just a blank page. Only two of the icons on my toolbar works. The ""Account"" icon, which takes me to my Firefox settings. And my Extensions icon. Clicking the three little lines does nothing. The only websites i have been able to get to work at all are the settings page, and the Firefox troubleshooting page. I'm using Version 125.0.3, I tried using the browser both with and without hardware acceleration with results being unremarkably the same. I restarted Firefox and my computer multiple times to no avail, and the only thing I could find out of the ordinary was an error with Importing data from Microsoft Edge, which was not something I consciously wanted to do, but there was an error that popped up regarding that when i went to the settings page. </p><p>All that being said, I'm confused and at a loss for options, and could really use a Mozilla Staff member or someone who knows what they're doing to work me through this. </p>",desktop;beta;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1250;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1650464;,vinesjay16

I googled to find out how to disable it, and <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=how%20to%20turn%20off%20clipboard%20autocompletion%20in%20newest%20mozilla%3F"" rel=""nofollow"">the Featured Snippet said ""go to about:config and change clipboard.autocopy to false.""</a>  Sounded simple, so I did it, but subsequently found out that the article it quotes from is 10 years of age! </p><p>My first question, then, is: what does changing ""clipboard.autocopy"" to false do if it doesn't turn off the brand-new feature? </p><p>The second question is, how do I disable the new URL Paste Suggestion feature?  Will setting ""clipboard.autocopy"" disable it?  In particular, I want to make sure that the browser does <strong>not</strong> pre-load or pre-fetch the clipboard URL, and in fact, I wish to pop up a dialog box any time I do ""paste and go.""  People often copy URLs from e-mails to research them before visiting them directly; jumping directly will increase the likelihood of visiting an imposter site. </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1240;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",4232jl
