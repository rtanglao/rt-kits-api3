Whenever i try to access my mailbox or gmail site in itself it transfers me to outlooks login.  I assume there's some setting or similar that i'm missing that's causing the issue but i haven't been able to find it. </p><p>I've narrowed it down to not being any add-on since i only got few but none of them should affect anything email related in anyway shape or form.  Also it works fine in Chrome which has been my go-to go around for the issue but honestly it's getting a bit annoying. </p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Desperate for help with Thunderbird lost all my emails - again!,"<p>Urgent Help Please as lost ALL EMAILS - I cannot get to post in Thunderbird: 1) I've now spent 4 hours, (from what was trying to sort a 'simple' problem on the server), as I couldn't send or receive any emails, as they think I've 6.5Gb of data on it, in spite of my deleting all my emails off it.  So they allowed some extra space to temp sort it again. It's been an issue for about 3mths now. But I deleted everything just the other day having confirmed that was not deleting them off my laptop and that the previously lost emails 2 yrs ago weren't still on their server.  </p><p>But now checked back on my email client Thunderbird, and I've no emails. They're all GONE bar the odd few I've put into folders (I stopped using folders years back as that lost all my emails way back then!), so I'd been keeping them all in the Inbox.  Although I've a few old Inbox files with previous old old emails in so I can access them if I need to. But at least their there! But now again I've just lost everything. This is such a disaster.   </p><p>Over the last 2yrs it's been going OK until today.  Now it's LOST ALL MY EMAILS.  I'm as per usual up to my eyes and have to travel this friday for meetings next week. The last thing I needed today was this.  I've lost so much data and info in those emails it's doesn't bare thinking about.  From show tickets that I need, medical info and data, to flight details to all sorts of crucial data.  My ONLY saving grace is that anything I've replied to, I have a copy in the sent folder.  </p><p>So Please Forgive this being in Firefox, as I can't even add it to Thunderbird help area!!  I've had to reset my pw too just to sign in.  Sadly right now it all feels so very upsetting I'm thinking I'll have to just have to start using another email client! If every 2 yrs I lose all my emails then this is just not acceptable.  I hope you can move this to the Thunderbird threads.  If you do please send me a link to it so I can try and find it.  </p><p>What's so upsetting is had I saved the Inbox file when I saw the 13Gb file size, a bit eariler then, I think I could have saved them.  I fear though that the remote server people deleted something, that was somehow still linked to my system and that's meant they've deleted my emails off my laptop too! Terrifying!  (Perhaps that is what happened before back in '22.&nbsp;???) I did look at a 'Sync' settings but not sure what they did so cancelled back out of them. </p><p>Running on Win 10 Pro 64Bit i7core 8Gb Ram Thunderbird 115.10.1 (64-bit) </p><p>Any and all help will be most gratefully received.  </p><p>Sub issue to get help&nbsp;:  2) Error to Sumbit to Thunderbird: Sadly I've gone around and around your system saying Ask Question when nothing answers my query on the Thunderbird email questions.  But when you click on Ask Question it just takes you back around the system again / Browse all Programs / re click on thunderbird/ reclick on Emails and back to list of FAQ's but nothing helps so click on Get Help and back around you go in a deja vu system. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,other,en-US,"",AuroraMagic
