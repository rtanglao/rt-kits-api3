But when I tried searching something today, I couldn't do it because of the recaptcha. It was stuck on infinite loading. Every website I visited the problem was there. I tried fixing it from the tips I found in the forum here but nothing seems to work. I was frustrated. Then I tried Brave browser and it was working. Please help me fix this problem.

Application Menu unresponsive.,"<p>Whenever I type in a website URL in the search-bar, first of all, the drop-down menu of related searches and websites does not show up. When I press enter to confirm that's where I want to go, nothing happens. The URL just kinda sits there, no loading circle or anything... Just a blank page. Only two of the icons on my toolbar works. The ""Account"" icon, which takes me to my Firefox settings. And my Extensions icon. Clicking the three little lines does nothing. The only websites i have been able to get to work at all are the settings page, and the Firefox troubleshooting page. I'm using Version 125.0.3, I tried using the browser both with and without hardware acceleration with results being unremarkably the same. I restarted Firefox and my computer multiple times to no avail, and the only thing I could find out of the ordinary was an error with Importing data from Microsoft Edge, which was not something I consciously wanted to do, but there was an error that popped up regarding that when i went to the settings page. </p><p>All that being said, I'm confused and at a loss for options, and could really use a Mozilla Staff member or someone who knows what they're doing to work me through this. </p>",desktop;beta;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1250;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1650464;,vinesjay16

I googled to find out how to disable it, and <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=how%20to%20turn%20off%20clipboard%20autocompletion%20in%20newest%20mozilla%3F"" rel=""nofollow"">the Featured Snippet said ""go to about:config and change clipboard.autocopy to false.""</a>  Sounded simple, so I did it, but subsequently found out that the article it quotes from is 10 years of age! </p><p>My first question, then, is: what does changing ""clipboard.autocopy"" to false do if it doesn't turn off the brand-new feature? </p><p>The second question is, how do I disable the new URL Paste Suggestion feature?  Will setting ""clipboard.autocopy"" disable it?  In particular, I want to make sure that the browser does <strong>not</strong> pre-load or pre-fetch the clipboard URL, and in fact, I wish to pop up a dialog box any time I do ""paste and go.""  People often copy URLs from e-mails to research them before visiting them directly; jumping directly will increase the likelihood of visiting an imposter site. </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1240;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",4232jl
