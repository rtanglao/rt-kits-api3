I was trying to make a hair appointment online, it was asking me to fill in my email, and the box wouldn't let me click on it. I used a different browser, and it worked just fine. Same thing today: I was trying to make a lab appointment, the next step was verifying I'm not a robot, I clicked the box, and it had a loading circle eternally. I tried it on a different browser, and it worked within seconds, no loading. I've never had this issue with Firefox before! I tried clearing my cookies and cache, and that didn't do anything unfortunately. Let me know what I can do to fix this problem! I normally loved Firefox and it's my main browser, so I'm hoping to resolve this issue.

I suppose I could just check every few seconds? That feels like a bit of a cop-out, though, and gets more and more inefficient the more windows are open. </p><p>There's an API for extensions to receive events when tabs open and close, so clearly this is possible. Where should I be looking for this functionality? </p><p>(I also don't know how I would go about unregistering an event listener (or cancelling a setInterval call!) when the window closes, assuming that's necessary to avoid leaking resources – is there an event like `chrome-document-global-created` I could listen for, but that fires during teardown of the window rather than when one is created?) </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1250;firefox-12502;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",sersorrel

I googled to find out how to disable it, and <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=how%20to%20turn%20off%20clipboard%20autocompletion%20in%20newest%20mozilla%3F"" rel=""nofollow"">the Featured Snippet said ""go to about:config and change clipboard.autocopy to false.""</a>  Sounded simple, so I did it, but subsequently found out that the article it quotes from is 10 years of age! </p><p>My first question, then, is: what does changing ""clipboard.autocopy"" to false do if it doesn't turn off the brand-new feature? </p><p>The second question is, how do I disable the new URL Paste Suggestion feature?  Will setting ""clipboard.autocopy"" disable it?  In particular, I want to make sure that the browser does <strong>not</strong> pre-load or pre-fetch the clipboard URL, and in fact, I wish to pop up a dialog box any time I do ""paste and go.""  People often copy URLs from e-mails to research them before visiting them directly; jumping directly will increase the likelihood of visiting an imposter site. </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1240;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1650494;,4232jl
