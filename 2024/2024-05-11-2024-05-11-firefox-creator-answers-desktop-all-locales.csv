I signed out and signed in. I googled what to do, updated Firefox, to no avail. Then I read to try another browser. Chrome worked fine for outlook/hotmail search function. </p><p>I need this search function.

Now I am unable to get the pages to work properly. I cannot list any items for sale nor can I change any of my items in my store. Nothing saves and then redirects me to the homepage. eBay is one of my trusted seitz so I have no idea what’s causing this. It’s not eBay because my other accounts work fine on Chrome and on Safari. It happened exactly when the last update happened. And the only way that I can actually get back to the original site is to clear all my cookies and log out and start all over again, only to have the same issues over and over. I don’t know who to contact. I’m losing money in my Business every day because of this so I’m going to have to change my browser unfortunately if I don’t get a solution as soon as possible. Thanks for anyone who can help appreciate it. </p>",desktop;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",shaunmarieschaffer

After each occurrence, I have to completely uninstall the browser and reinstall it from scratch. This means I have to reopen all my tabs, which is very annoying. In Chrome, I have had a large number of tabs open for many years and it works fine. </p><p>With Mozilla, something terrible is happening... I have many tabs open in Mozilla, and there comes a moment when, upon launching the browser and opening two or three tabs, Mozilla starts consuming up to 10 gigabytes of RAM. If I open a few more tabs, the browser crashes. I don't need to open 50 or 100 tabs, just 7-8-10 tabs are enough to make the browser crash. Moreover, if I open a new tab and go to <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a>, the browser takes a very long time to load, even if it's the second tab. </p><p>This problem has happened before. I don't do anything with the browser, just visit sites like YouTube. </p><p>Clearing the cache and other recommended actions do not yield positive results. This is very annoying. Mozilla is my first and favorite browser, which I have been using for almost 20 years. I wouldn't want to uninstall Mozilla. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Sanya_ln
