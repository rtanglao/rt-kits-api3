I have to sit and wait a super long time for everything I typed to finally show up.  Other times, I move my mouse over something I should be able to click on, and have to wait a long time for the arrow to turn into a hand, letting me click on it.  These periods of slowness will last a few minutes, then disappear. </p><p>What's really interesting is that when the slowness starts, I can type just fine up in the URL bar.  I might type my entire message there, then copy paste it down to where ever I was wanting to post it.  However, when I do that, if I have another tab open and that tab is playing music, the music will start to break up and lag as I type.  Again, after a while, the slowness disappears and we're back to normal. </p><p>Can anyone tell me what's going on? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",k.trenton.knight

I don't know why, but somehow at some point all my bookmarks got copied into other folders - Bookmarks Menu, Bookmarks Toolbar, and maybe something else. What's frustrating is that one of the folders is the one I use for convenience to access sites I regularly use, while saving to the other puts it somewhere I can't easily get to (I think it's the copies from Bookmarks Menu), so I have to make sure I'm putting it in the right folder - which is hard to do when they have the exact same name. Something I've found that works is to just find out which folder is the one that is in my toolbar and save it to those which pushes the ones in the Bookmarks Menu out of the quick access list, but that's not always convenient given how many bookmarks are in some folders. Using the bookmarks dupes extension, you can see just how many duplicates there are. I've also attached what I see when I save a bookmark, so you can see the duplicate folders. </p><p>Here are the results from my ""Verify Integrity"" test: &gt; Task: checkIntegrity + The places.sqlite database is sane + The favicons.sqlite database is sane &gt; Task: checkCoherence + The database is coherent &gt; Task: expire + Database cleaned up &gt; Task: vacuum + Initial database size is 15360KiB + The database has been vacuumed + Final database size is 15360KiB &gt; Task: stats + Places.sqlite size is 15360KiB + Favicons.sqlite size is 6560KiB + pragma_user_version is 77 + pragma_page_size is 32768 + pragma_cache_size is -2048 + pragma_journal_mode is wal + pragma_synchronous is 1 + History can store a maximum of 107879 unique pages + Table moz_origins has 687 records + Table moz_places has 14850 records + Table moz_places_extra has 0 records + Table moz_historyvisits has 23851 records + Table moz_historyvisits_extra has 0 records + Table moz_inputhistory has 94 records + Table moz_bookmarks has 6578 records + Table moz_bookmarks_deleted has 0 records + Table moz_keywords has 0 records + Table sqlite_sequence has 1 records + Table moz_anno_attributes has 2 records + Table moz_annos has 55 records + Table moz_items_annos has 0 records + Table moz_meta has 9 records + Table moz_places_metadata has 12975 records + Table moz_places_metadata_search_queries has 0 records + Table moz_previews_tombstones has 0 records + Table sqlite_stat1 has 20 records + Pages sequentiality: 43.5 + sqlite_schema: 32KiB (0.3%), 24.6% eff. + moz_origins: 32KiB (0.3%), 84.3% eff. + sqlite_autoindex_moz_origins_1: 32KiB (0.3%), 73.4% eff. + moz_places_extra: 32KiB (0.3%), 0% eff. + moz_historyvisits_extra: 32KiB (0.3%), 0% eff. + moz_inputhistory: 32KiB (0.3%), 7.3% eff. + sqlite_autoindex_moz_inputhistory_1: 32KiB (0.3%), 5% eff. + moz_bookmarks_deleted: 32KiB (0.3%), 0% eff. + sqlite_autoindex_moz_bookmarks_deleted_1: 32KiB (0.3%), 0% eff. + moz_keywords: 32KiB (0.3%), 0% eff. + sqlite_autoindex_moz_keywords_1: 32KiB (0.3%), 0% eff. + sqlite_sequence: 32KiB (0.3%), 0.1% eff. + moz_anno_attributes: 32KiB (0.3%), 0.2% eff. + sqlite_autoindex_moz_anno_attributes_1: 32KiB (0.3%), 0.2% eff. + moz_annos: 32KiB (0.3%), 16.5% eff. + moz_items_annos: 32KiB (0.3%), 0% eff. + moz_meta: 32KiB (0.3%), 1.5% eff. + moz_places_metadata_search_queries: 32KiB (0.3%), 0% eff. + sqlite_autoindex_moz_places_metadata_search_queries_1: 32KiB (0.3%), 0% eff. + moz_previews_tombstones: 32KiB (0.3%), 0% eff. + sqlite_stat1: 32KiB (0.3%), 3.5% eff. + moz_keywords_placepostdata_uniqueindex: 32KiB (0.3%), 0% eff. + moz_annos_placeattributeindex: 32KiB (0.3%), 1.8% eff. + moz_items_annos_itemattributeindex: 32KiB (0.3%), 0% eff. + moz_bookmarks_itemindex: 128KiB (1.2%), 54.8% eff. + moz_bookmarks_parentindex: 128KiB (1.2%), 62.6% eff. + moz_places_visitcount: 160KiB (1.5%), 74.6% eff. + moz_places_altfrecencyindex: 160KiB (1.5%), 72.5% eff. + moz_bookmarks_itemlastmodifiedindex: 160KiB (1.5%), 75.9% eff. + moz_bookmarks_dateaddedindex: 160KiB (1.5%), 64.2% eff. + moz_places_metadata_referrerindex: 160KiB (1.5%), 65.8% eff. + moz_places_frecencyindex: 192KiB (1.8%), 68.8% eff. + moz_places_originidindex: 192KiB (1.8%), 70.5% eff. + moz_bookmarks_guid_uniqueindex: 192KiB (1.8%), 66.9% eff. + moz_places_url_hashindex: 256KiB (2.5%), 79.3% eff. + moz_places_lastvisitdateindex: 256KiB (2.5%), 84.1% eff. + moz_historyvisits_fromindex: 256KiB (2.5%), 82.9% eff. + moz_places_metadata_placecreated_uniqueindex: 256KiB (2.5%), 84.2% eff. + moz_places_guid_uniqueindex: 352KiB (3.4%), 82.4% eff. + moz_places_hostindex: 384KiB (3.7%), 90.4% eff. + moz_historyvisits_dateindex: 416KiB (4%), 89.6% eff. + moz_bookmarks: 480KiB (4.6%), 88.6% eff. + moz_historyvisits_placedateindex: 480KiB (4.6%), 92.2% eff. + moz_places_metadata: 512KiB (4.9%), 89.7% eff. + moz_historyvisits: 640KiB (6.2%), 93.5% eff. + moz_places: 3712KiB (35.7%), 98.1% eff. &gt; Task: _refreshUI </p><p>Thanks. </p><p>(Ignore Norton 360 my dad installed it while it was on sale and now it's ended so I have to get rid of it) </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1250;firefox-12501;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",zeyangting
