It happens when I expand a collapsible on the web page (it's a site behind a login, so I can't provide a URL). As soon as I expand the collapsible, it opens all PDF's accessible from the contents in that collapsible. It does not do that on Edge, Chrome, Opera. Only in Firefox. </p><p>Nothing I do fixes the issue. I tried the MIME settings, open PDF's in external apps, and the solutions provided in above posts. </p><p>Anyone know how to fix this? This has long been an issue in Firefox and as this website is very important for our business, it stops me from using Firefox in our business. </p><p>Thnx </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1210;,firefox,other,en-US,"",p.r.vanden.berg

Nothing helps. Now if I use Edge or phone it works just fine and we can see each other. This has never happened before. Also, the messenger games wont work on firefox either, but will on others.
