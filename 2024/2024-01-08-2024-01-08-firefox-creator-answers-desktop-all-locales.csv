I have NEVER encountered this issue with any other browser. Once every week or two I will encounter a page with an MP3/MP4 file and will be presented with this error. I have already tried clearing cache, disabling addons, reloading, etc, but I guarantee the ""best answer"" will just be some rehashing of these steps. Something is fundamentally broken with this browser, and there are hundreds of people across various sites reporting it. Fix it. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1140;firefox-11401;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1628977;,samg381

I can log into my Google Photos via my Windows 10 PC and the video will play back properly. I also downloaded the video file (MP4) to be saved directly in my Videos folder on my Windows 10 PC. When I try to play the video by clicking / opening the downloaded file on my PC I get an error message. See that message attached. It is prompting me to ""download a new codec"". Why? In my Firefox browser I currently have the Open H264 Video Codec by Cisco plugin enabled. Why is the Cisco plugin not sufficient? Is the Cisco plugin being updated? Does Firefox browser need to be updated? Is Is Firefox working on a fix? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1210;,firefox,customize,en-US,1628985;,don.dac.fc
