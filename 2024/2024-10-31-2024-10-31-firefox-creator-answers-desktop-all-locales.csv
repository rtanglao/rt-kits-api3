I find this most often happens with streams but not exclusively. I also find that it's more likely to happen when I have a game in the focus on my main monitor. If I have the game open but not in focus I find that this issue happens significantly less (even if that doesn't significantly change the impact the game has on my computer).

For a few days now, something weird is happening with my Firefox. On browsing the internet with an image on a page and I right-click and save it, it gets properly saved to my downloads folder. Then, on Firefox, when I click on the downloads button and pick the just downloaded image, it opens the app with the image (in my case, irfanview), but the iview window does not get focus, it stays behind the Firefox window. If I click on the iview window on the taskbar, or minimize the Firefox window, I can see the image, the iview window is not minimized or anything. The problem is definitely with Firefox. I went to Windows settings, changed the image handling app to Windows Photos and the same thing happened. I have disabled all Firefox extensions and the issue still surfaces. Same thing if I start a new Firefox private window, so I am clueless as what is causing this. Even more puzzling, the problem only happens with images, PDF files, for example, open fine and Adobe Reader window gets focus and I can see the file right away.

When I came back, Firefox had closed two of my tabs and opened three new ones, 2 of which were youtube videos that were playing music <em>while my computer was locked</em>.  All of the tabs were centered around a gif that I looked up using a chat site's tenor keyboard and never actually sent.  Why in the world did my locked laptop have a bunch of random tabs open?  How do I stop this from happening in the future so I don't have to switch browsers?  I did not like coming home to this at all.  I ran a virus scan, but the only thing on my computer that was off was Firefox itself, so that's why I'm asking.  This has never happened before, but I had to reinstall this browser a couple days ago so I'm wondering if there's some sort of bug or something that came with the new install.
