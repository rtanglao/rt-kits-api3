I can't print them to a physical printer nor save them as PDF. Once I select to print an email the ""Preparing Preview"" page loads, but then get stuck.  </p><p>This happens even in Firefox Safe Mode.  </p><p>This happens with any email client - happens with Gmail and with AOL email accounts.  </p><p>I have no problems printing these same emails in Google Chrome browser.  </p><p>In addition, if I follow Firefox's steps to ""Clear saved print settings"" the problem is solved for only a single printing before reverting to getting stuck again.  </p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.  I have no idea how to get around this issue. I need to save multiple emails as PDF files and physically print them every day. This issue makes Firefox unusable to me. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",LK85

When I came back, Firefox had closed two of my tabs and opened three new ones, 2 of which were youtube videos that were playing music <em>while my computer was locked</em>.  All of the tabs were centered around a gif that I looked up using a chat site's tenor keyboard and never actually sent.  Why in the world did my locked laptop have a bunch of random tabs open?  How do I stop this from happening in the future so I don't have to switch browsers?  I did not like coming home to this at all.  I ran a virus scan, but the only thing on my computer that was off was Firefox itself, so that's why I'm asking.  This has never happened before, but I had to reinstall this browser a couple days ago so I'm wondering if there's some sort of bug or something that came with the new install.  Please ease my mind about this. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1685074;,loseyourhands
