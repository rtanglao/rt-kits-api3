I’m using my own HTML file as a custom new tab page, and I’ve designed it to load specific content and tools that I frequently use. The problem I’m facing is that when the new tab loads, the URL bar automatically takes focus, which disrupts my workflow. Instead, I want the focus to shift to my custom search bar so I can start searching immediately without additional clicks. How can I accomplish this? </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",elburritosupremospam

For a few days now, something weird is happening with my Firefox. On browsing the internet with an image on a page and I right-click and save it, it gets properly saved to my downloads folder. Then, on Firefox, when I click on the downloads button and pick the just downloaded image, it opens the app with the image (in my case, irfanview), but the iview window does not get focus, it stays behind the Firefox window. If I click on the iview window on the taskbar, or minimize the Firefox window, I can see the image, the iview window is not minimized or anything. The problem is definitely with Firefox. I went to Windows settings, changed the image handling app to Windows Photos and the same thing happened. I have disabled all Firefox extensions and the issue still surfaces. Same thing if I start a new Firefox private window, so I am clueless as what is causing this. Even more puzzling, the problem only happens with images, PDF files, for example, open fine and Adobe Reader window gets focus and I can see the file right away. Tried to create a new Firefox profile, just in case, and I have the same problem. What changed since this was working fine? Just Firefox and Windows updates, nothing else changed, I didn't touch Firefox settings at all. Any ideas? Thanks for your help. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",jcpinto0

When I came back, Firefox had closed two of my tabs and opened three new ones, 2 of which were youtube videos that were playing music <em>while my computer was locked</em>.  All of the tabs were centered around a gif that I looked up using a chat site's tenor keyboard and never actually sent.  Why in the world did my locked laptop have a bunch of random tabs open?  How do I stop this from happening in the future so I don't have to switch browsers?  I did not like coming home to this at all.  I ran a virus scan, but the only thing on my computer that was off was Firefox itself, so that's why I'm asking.  This has never happened before, but I had to reinstall this browser a couple days ago so I'm wondering if there's some sort of bug or something that came with the new install.  Please ease my mind about this. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1685074;,loseyourhands
