For a few days now, something weird is happening with my Firefox. On browsing the internet with an image on a page and I right-click and save it, it gets properly saved to my downloads folder.

If I click on the iview window on the taskbar, or minimize the Firefox window, I can see the image, the iview window is not minimized or anything. The problem is definitely with Firefox.

Same thing if I start a new Firefox private window, so I am clueless as what is causing this.
