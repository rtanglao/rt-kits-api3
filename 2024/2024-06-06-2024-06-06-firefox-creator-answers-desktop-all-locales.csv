I did read that the 3 dots will appear if I hover over a shortcut. I tried that several times on different shortcuts but the 3 dots never appeared. Is there another way to edit, delete, or dismiss a shortcut? Or even better is there a way to restore the 3 dots?  </p><p>I cleared my cookies, cache, history and data like I was told to when I connected a new router so all of my shortcuts have changed. A few that are there now I don't want and I do want to add several new ones.  </p><p>Thank you for your help! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,other,en-US,"",E-or
