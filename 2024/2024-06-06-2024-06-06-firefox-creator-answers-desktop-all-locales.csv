Message just hung up all day. I think the connection is secure (icon next to Firefox address bar does not have a slash thru it so I think connection is secure). That Firefox icon says it is blocking trackers and cookies on the website and ""Enhanced Tracking Protection"" is ""On"". And got message in bottom corner of website saying ""ERROR for site owner: Invalid domain for site key"". Using up-to-date Firefox browser, Windows 10 and Windows Defender Firewall. (Tried Windows Edge browser and it said connection was insecure so I followed steps to connect to it like changing Privacy settings and switching to a Private Window but it didn't help.) What else can I try to use this Japanese website?

Let me begin by saying I used to have this same issue with MS operating systems until I said goodbye to MS and went to Linux on one laptop and got a Mac for streaming and graphics. Here is the issue: MS had so many background processes running constantly, regardless of what I was using the machine for, that I regularly experienced crashes, warnings and slowed responses on my Windows machines. No matter how vigilant I was about settings and stopping processes and keeping system clean, I would regularly have to replace the fan on my machines as the constant overheating would eventually kill the fans. That has not been a problem since I made that switch away from MS. Until now. I keep clean machines and keep them updated religiously. But with the latest few Firefox updates the problem is now back on both my Linux built Lenovo and my MacBook Pro, especially the Mac. That regularly shuts down after an hour of streaming use. When I hear the fan constantly struggling and feel the machines heating up I check the background processes and find that Firefox has at least four running processes eating up resources. Force stop does not fix the resource hogging; by the time it is apparent and I respond the machine is already overheated and shuts itself down. Last night I started searching and found a (very) recent thread about this same issue. Most of the participants were attributing it to recent updates. If this is the case is there any effort to fix this? I would hate to have this issue completely destroy my older (but still heavily relied upon) MacBook with this constant mechanical challenge since I cannot afford to replace it. Please can you fix this problem. It is an old and exhausting struggle I thought I would not have to deal with again. If my assumption of the source of the problem is inaccurate do you have any suggestions?

I did read that the 3 dots will appear if I hover over a shortcut. I tried that several times on different shortcuts but the 3 dots never appeared. Is there another way to edit, delete, or dismiss a shortcut? Or even better is there a way to restore the 3 dots?  </p><p>I cleared my cookies, cache, history and data like I was told to when I connected a new router so all of my shortcuts have changed. A few that are there now I don't want and I do want to add several new ones.  </p><p>Thank you for your help! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,other,en-US,1656018;,E-or
