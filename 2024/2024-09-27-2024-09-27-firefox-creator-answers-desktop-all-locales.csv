Recently, I have come across rumblings about Firefox privacy defaults. At first i dismissed it as the usual whinging, but then i started to see what appears to almost be forks of Firefox.  I have already ditched Thunderbird because of their nonsensical  thread defaults. Surely, Firefox with its privacy focus wouldn't be making privacy decisions from collaboration with other browser companies like google &amp; Microsoft? One of the early really great privacy innovations was in containers, but it is still an extension. Why?  Because of the architecture of Chrome, its is not possible to have containers in chrome engined browsers. So is that why Mozilla didn't progress containers?  Did the money from Google for default search engine (shame on you Mozilla) come with strings attached?  I came across Librewolf which mostly use the Firefox code but with much more stringent privacy defaults, and with bundled ad blocker as part of the default installation.  How can it claim to be more privacy focused than Firefox when it uses Firefox code? Firefox is supposedly the privacy focus browser so why is it following what Chrome and Edge do? They will NEVER gain lost market share by watering down their privacy settings which is the reason to even exist. It just antagonizes users like me. Or is that the point, a nice easy progression till oblivion and we all then accept an advertisement riddled internet. </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",bernie4

I noticed it was slower in searching either with urls or the search box on the screen. Today the tabs have started crashing, ironically on the second try after I use the restore tab button, it is loading pages faster than it has for some time. However when I tried the search 'business cards' it just kept  repeat crashing. Maybe I should have dropped by earlier but I have other browsers, though I prefer Firefox and I was just trying to get a ton of stuff done. ( I went through the troubleshooting data, but this appears to be a user experience thing as the the last lot of data was from the 4th of September).

That means we are using audio/video option. My firewall is on and all the connection to and from Firefox are allowed, and were allowed all along, I did not have to allow it after the Bug 1919173 was identified for some users. I was able to use the Internet on Firefox, and I am using it right now logged on using Firefox browser. But the issue is now with the upgrade that the calls I am receiving are being disconnected whether it is the audio or video. Video freezes, and that never happened before the upgrade. According to my MacBook Pro Firewall, ""all connections to Firewall allowed"", I don't understand then I am being disconnected when all the permissions are granted to access the microphone and the camera whenever prompted. I looked at the Privacy and Security/Permissions/Microphone/Camera/Settings, in Firefox Settings/Preferences and the dialog box that opens after clicking on Settings, basically does not serve the purpose because there is no +sign to add the portal webpage name to ""always allow access to Microphone and camera"" despite the permissions were already allowed numerous times from Firefox prompts when the call/session started. I did not have the portal webpage added to this specific dialog box because it was not necessary, and frankly I never opened the permissions under Privacy and Security so I don't know if the + sign was enabled before the upgrade. I opened the firewall on my MAC and Firefox is one of the applications allowed with ""All the communications to Firefox Allowed"" with green dot right by it. I am afraid to delete it and then add it again Under my MacBook Pro Settings and the firewall because of possibility I would not be able to use the Firefox then, at all. Do you know if anybody tried it already and succeeded? I even tried to install newer Firefox version 130 but that one had sound issues with crackly and breaking up issues from the other end. I uninstalled Firefox version 130, and I am keeping this one, version 115 that I used successfully for VoIP for at least last six months. Is there any plan from developers to work on the dialog box under Privacy and Security/Permissions/Camera/Microphone/Settings and have the plus sign enabled to be able to add the portal web page I am using for my work? Are there any other suggestions or we just have to wait until Apple would work on the fix and issues the patch for this bug? Thank you so much. </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",cmfxnwmvbj
