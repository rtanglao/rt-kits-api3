I would like to migrate all instances of Firefox to 64bit, but have found that installing 64bit Firefox on a device that already has 32bit Firefox dies not remove the 32bit version form C:\Program Files (x86)\ and just installs the new 64bit version into C:\Program Files\. This causes either the 64bit version to launch with no user profile loaded, or the user receives a message that they are launching an older version of Firefox. We can easily automate the uninstallation of 32bit Firefox during the install, but is there a way that we can programmatically load the users existing Firefox profile into the newly installed 64bit version of Firefox? I will be deploying the installation to around 7,500 computers, so a manual work-around isn't an option. </p>",desktop;windows-11;firefox-1280;install-and-update;,firefox,install-and-update,en-US,"",gr640
