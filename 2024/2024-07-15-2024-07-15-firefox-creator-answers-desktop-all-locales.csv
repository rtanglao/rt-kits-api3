I have attached four examples, and summarised following. LinkedIn is working when accessing by Edge: on the same laptop, or by another computer. A summary of the four examples follows: 1.	Another user’s feed not loading, 2.	Group feed not loading, 3.	My profile page not loading, and 4.	Group feed not loading. The only control that relatively works is regular refreshing, though this is inconsistent, and is generally ineffective e.g. my feed may only be for a couple of: minutes, or hours; despite many refreshes, instead of &gt; six hours with confidence by scrolling.  The issue has been occurring for the previous four days,  and other users are apparently experiencing similar, refer following. I unsuccessfully trailed the following: 1.	Various minor setting modifications according to historical posts - I cannot recall all of the specifics, 2.	Clear cache etc, and DNS flush, 3.	Log in/out/restart, and 4.	New profile. </p><p>I speculate may be a LinkedIn ""bot"" control feature, and my use appears like a ""bot"" - though I do not use any automated features. The justification for the “bot” speculation is the new profile apparently worked, prior to commencing my normal use - opening multiple tabs with LinkedIn, though this may be a coincidence. I also speculate that if was a ""bot"" control feature, LinkedIn would restrict my account, though is inconsistent with using by Edge. </p><p>The following may also be coincidental, though I have observed that emails in my Outlook webmail are slow to load, and occasionally require refreshing to read etc. </p><p><br> Other Users With Issues: I replied to the following discussion: </p><p><a href=""https://new.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1dzi2dr/something_went_wrong_please_refresh_the_page_and/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://new.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1dzi2dr/something_went_wrong_please_refresh_the_page_and/</a> </p><p><a href=""https://new.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1dy5j90/weird_maybe_firefox_linkedin_browsing_bug_anyone/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://new.reddit.com/r/linkedin/comments/1dy5j90/weird_maybe_firefox_linkedin_browsing_bug_anyone/</a> </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1280;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",settingsaver

I would like to migrate all instances of Firefox to 64bit, but have found that installing 64bit Firefox on a device that already has 32bit Firefox dies not remove the 32bit version form C:\Program Files (x86)\ and just installs the new 64bit version into C:\Program Files\. This causes either the 64bit version to launch with no user profile loaded, or the user receives a message that they are launching an older version of Firefox. We can easily automate the uninstallation of 32bit Firefox during the install, but is there a way that we can programmatically load the users existing Firefox profile into the newly installed 64bit version of Firefox?

Recently, I was using network access to upload images from a different computer, but that machine started acting up, and so Firefox tries to re-open the shared folder I was using on that other machine if I try to upload a file and cannot connect, so the file selection doesn't show up and I cannot use any other controls, just get the error SFX instead and I have to restart Firefox by closing it using Task Manager in order to restore function. How do I reset what folder it tries to open for file upload so it does not try to open that inaccessible network folder? It softlocks every time now. </p>",mobile;windows-10;troubleshooting;firefox-1280;,firefox,basic-browsing-firefox,en-US,"",desuThis420
