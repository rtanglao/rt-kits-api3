This occurs regardless of the videoâ€™s quality setting, and it happens both on Wi-Fi and cellular data. The video frequently pauses to buffer, even though the loading bar indicates that the video has already buffered up to a certain point. Additionally, I notice a significant drop in video quality, and the screen sometimes freezes while the audio continues to play. The problem persists across different videos and channels, suggesting it is not specific to any particular content. </p>",desktop;install-and-update;,firefox,install-and-update,en-US,1661980;,wadikarharshal1999

I would like to migrate all instances of Firefox to 64bit, but have found that installing 64bit Firefox on a device that already has 32bit Firefox dies not remove the 32bit version form C:\Program Files (x86)\ and just installs the new 64bit version into C:\Program Files\. This causes either the 64bit version to launch with no user profile loaded, or the user receives a message that they are launching an older version of Firefox. We can easily automate the uninstallation of 32bit Firefox during the install, but is there a way that we can programmatically load the users existing Firefox profile into the newly installed 64bit version of Firefox? I will be deploying the installation to around 7,500 computers, so a manual work-around isn't an option. </p>",desktop;windows-11;firefox-1280;install-and-update;,firefox,install-and-update,en-US,"",gr640

Recently, I was using network access to upload images from a different computer, but that machine started acting up, and so Firefox tries to re-open the shared folder I was using on that other machine if I try to upload a file and cannot connect, so the file selection doesn't show up and I cannot use any other controls, just get the error SFX instead and I have to restart Firefox by closing it using Task Manager in order to restore function. How do I reset what folder it tries to open for file upload so it does not try to open that inaccessible network folder?
