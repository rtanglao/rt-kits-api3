It fails on Firefox, though I can log in on Chrome.  I dislike Chrome, and prefer Firefox for several reasons, including that it is easier on my eyes.   I note that there are many complaints describing the same thing that I experience: recaptcha fails to load, or there is simply a blue circle turning in perpetuity with nothing happening.  I have removed recent cookies etc, but no change.  </p><p>There are some sites that use recapcha that I can sign in on using Firefox with no problem.  I am wondering if there are different versions of captcha?  This started the same week both Microsoft and Firefox updated.  Firefox has updated several times since then, but recaptcha is still nonfunctional: FF is not loading it, at least on some critical sites (perhaps the ones that use the most recent recaptcha?  </p><p>I have reported this frequently for last several months.  I notice that this is a continuing problem for many people. Why is it not fixed? </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;firefox-1320;firefox-13202;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1689147;1689148;,dastratton

Mac works fine, Windows Chrome, Edge work fine but Windows Firefox displays the affected text as individual boxes with letters in them. This may be broader than the font settings on one computer as I have replicated the issue on several PCs. Interesting though that when I download the embedded pdf, and it's displayed in the page, the fonts ARE CORRECT!!! You can see the issue here: <a href=""https://davegibsonimages.com/air-force-vs-navy/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://davegibsonimages.com/air-force-vs-navy/</a> or you can look at the screenshot I took. I've contacted the developer of the embedder plugin and they are seeing a 404 error for the affected pages, which is NOT replicated elsewhere, but since it returns a 200, they're convinced that it's not a problem with their plugin.

For many years, when I typed the first four characters of the document name Firefox would suggest the document via its autocomplete feature so all I had to do open to the document was press Enter. I learned it via muscle memory. Over the years it saved me a ton of time. </p><p>Then about 9 months ago I signed up for insurance from a company whose name starts with the same four characters. Firefox immediately started suggesting the insurance website instead of my document. I don't know why Firefox thinks I'd rather go to this insurance website. My document is bookmarked but the insurance website is not. I visit my document 100X as often as I visit the insurance website. </p><p>I've tried to find settings that will bring my document back to the top of the list. The most useful setting I was found was disabling ""Browsing History"" under ""Address Bar - Firefox Suggest"". This removed the insurance website from my suggestions, but it did not bring my document back to the top. I found a help document that says that I should be able to remove the insurance website specifically from ""Firefox Suggest"" by clicking the three dots next to the name in my drop down address bar and select ""remove"", but for some reason the insurance website doesn't have the three dots next to it (other suggestions listed in the drop down address bar do have the three dots, so I think I'm looking in the right place). I doubt this would help anyway since I have already removed the insurance website from my suggestions and my document still hasn't been restored as the default. </p><p>Is there anyway to access more specific settings that would restore Firefox's original behavior? </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",jaylubow
