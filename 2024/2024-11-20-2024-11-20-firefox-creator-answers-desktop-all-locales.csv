Can I recover them?,"<p>A few weeks ago, I checked my passwords and logins tab only to find there was nothing there anymore. Completely blank. I must have had at least 50 logins saved there. I'm not sure if there was an update around the time, but I believe I checked and saw there was. Has this happened to anyone else? Were you able to get them back? This is my wake up call to completely stop using the password manager feature of any browser ever. Totally disappointed </p>",firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;firefox-1320;firefox-13202;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",moisesrodriguez543

Or rather, they work just fine, but when I close Firefox and re-open it later, they seem to fail to actually enable. I must go to the <strong>about:addons</strong> page, disable the addon, and then re-enable it for it to actually work. If I do not do this, it will not be on my toolbar, and the Extensions sidebar button does not show the addon in the list. It's as if it isn't properly installed. </p><p>After reading this post: [<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1420017"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/que.../1420017</a>] I thought maybe my extensions db got corrupted somehow, so I followed their instructions and deleted the <strong>extensions.databaseSchema</strong> config. And wouldn't you know it, it worked! Once I restarted Firefox, I saw some notifications in the main sidebar menu and was greeted with this: <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/UQI3XZg.png"" rel=""nofollow"">Notifications</a> <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/UQI3XZg.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/UQI3XZg.png</a> Once I clicked through them and enabled, everything seemed fine. </p><p>However after closing firefox again, the problem comes back. Those exact extensions that I manually approved upon restarting are the ones that are giving me troubles and not enabling properly. An interesting thing I noticed is that these all seem to be extensions that require additional permissions. I enabled the addon and gave them the permissions they requested, so I don't know why they are failing to enable properly on startup. </p><p>I want to permanently fix the problem </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,1689015;,Delfofthebla
