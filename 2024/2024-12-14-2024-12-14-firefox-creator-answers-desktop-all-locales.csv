Σαράντα ἡμέρες ἠ Ἐκκλησία μὲ τὴ νηστεία καὶ τοὺς προεορτίους ὕμνους μᾶς προτοίμασε γιὰ τὸ μεγάλο γεγονὸς. Κατὰ τὶς ἡμέρες τῆς Ἑορτῆς καὶ ὅλο τὸ Ἅγιο Δωδεκαήμερο, ἀπὸ νωρὶς τὸ πρωί, στοὺς Ἱεροὺς Ναοὺς μας μὲ τὰ ἱερὰ ἀναγνώσματα καὶ τοὺς ἀνυπερβλήτους σὲ λογοτεχνικὴ διατύπωση καὶ μελῳδία ὕμνους δοξολογεῖται ὁ Θεὸς καὶ βοηθοῦνται οἱ Χριστιανοὶ νὰ βιώσουν ὡς σύγχρονη πραγματικότητα τὸ σχέδιο τῆς θείας Οἰκονομίας γιὰ τὴν ἐπανένωση τοῦ ἀνθρώπου μὲ τὸν Δημιουργὸ καὶ Πατέρα: Ὁτε δὲ ἦλθε τὸ πλήρωμα τοῦ χρόνου, ἐξαπέστειλεν ὁ Θεὸς τὸν Υἱὸν Αὐτοῦ, γενόμενον ἐκ γυναικός, γενόμενον ὑπὸ νόμον, ἵνα τοὺς ὑπὸ νόμον ἐξαγοράσῃ, ἵνα τὴν υἱοθεσίαν ἀπολάβωμεν (Γαλ δ΄,4-5). Τὰ Χριστούγεννα ὅσο κι ἂν εἶναι ὑποδουλωμένος σὲ κοσμικὲς φροντίδες  ὁ ἄνθρωπος, ἀπὸ ὅποιο περιβάλλον κι ἂν προέρχεται, ἔχει τὴν εὐκαιρία νὰ νοιώσει  χαρὰ ἀπὸ τὴν ἐπιβεβαίωση τῆς φρονίδος τοῦ Θεοῦ Πατέρα γιὰ τὸν ἴδιο καὶ γιὰ ὅλο τὸ ἀνθρώπινο γένος· νὰ ἐλπίζει στὴν ἀνάκτηση τῆς ἐλευθερίας του στὸ πλήρωμα τῆς ἀγάπη  ποὺ δίδει Παιδίον Νέον, ὁ προαιώνιος Θεὸς καὶ Λόγος τοῦ Πατρός. Οἱ Ναοί μας στολισμένοι περιμένουν τους πιστούς. Συχνὰ τὰ Χριστούγεννα ἔρχονται ἐκεῖ ἄνθρωποι ξένοι καὶ περαστικοί, γιὰ νὰ ζήσουν τὸ Μυστήριο τῆς Γεννήσεως τοῦ Θεοῦ στὴ γῆ,  καὶ λείπουν λόγῳ βιοτικῶν μεριμνῶν πολλοὶ Χριστιανοί. Πῶς ὅμως μποροῦμε ἀκόμη καὶ τὴν πιὸ ὄμορφη τελετὴ νὰ τὴν ὀνομάζομε Χριστούγεννα χωρὶς ἀναφορὰ στὸ Χριστό; Χριστιανοί μου, οἱ θεῖοι Πατέρες οἱ τὰ πάντα καλῶς διαταξάμενοι ἔχουν προβλεψει γιὰ μᾶς μέσα στὶς Ἐκκλησίες τὸν πιὸ φωτεινὸ τὸν πιὸ χαρούμενο τὸν πιὸ χορταστικὸ ἑορτασμό. Καλούμεθα νὰ ξεπεράσωμε τὴν ἀσφάλεια ποὺ μᾶς παρέχει ἡ ἐπανάληψη τῶν συνηθειῶν τοῦ ἑορτασμοῦ  μιᾶς κοσμικῆς ἐπετείου, νὰ πλησιάσωμε τὴν οὐσία τῆς Γεννήσεως  τοῦ Θεανθρώπου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ ἀπὸ τὴν Παρθένο Μαρία καὶ νὰ ἀναλογισθοῦμε τὶς συνέπειες τῆς ὑπερτάτης ἐκδηλώσεως τῆς Ἀγάπης τοῦ Δημιουργοῦ γιὰ τὴν κτίση, γιὰ τὴν ἀνθρωπότητα καὶ γιὰ καθένα μας προσωπικά. </p><pre>Διαβάζομε στὸ κατὰ Ἰωάννην Εὐαγγέλιον ὅτι τόσο πολὺ ἀγάπησε ὁ Θεὸς τὸν κόσμο « ὥστε τὸν Υἱὸν αὐτοῦ τὸν μονογενῆ ἔδωκεν, ἵνα πᾶς ὁ πιστεύων εἰς Αὐτὸν μὴ ἀπόληται ἀλλ' ἔχῃ ζωὴν αἰώνιον»(Ἰω γ΄16). Ὁ Θεὸς Πατὴρ ἔδωκε τὸν Υἱόν Του,  γιὰ νὰ γεννηθεῖ ὡς τέλειος Θεὸς καὶ Ἄνθρωπος, νὰ πάθει καὶ νὰ σταυρωθεῖ, νὰ ἀναστηθεῖ καὶ νὰ μᾶς ξαναδώσει εἰσητήριο γιὰ τὴ Βασιλεἰα τῶν Οὐρανῶν. </pre> <pre>Ἡ αἰώνιος ζωὴ εἶναι λοιπὸν ὁ στόχος, ἡ ""ἀπώλεια""  εἶναι ὁ κίνδυνος. Εὔκολα μποροῦμε νὰ ἀντιληφθοῦμε τὸν κίνδυνο τῆς ἀπωλείας τοῦ εἶναι μας, τῆς ἐκμηδενίσεως τοῦ ἀνθρωπίνου προσώπου, τῆς μετατροπῆς μας σὲ ἔνα ἀριθμό, τῆς ἐξαφανίσεώς μας μέσα στὶς παγίδες τοῦ Πονηροῦ. Ὁ Ὅμηρος παρομοίαζε τοὺς θνητοὺς ἀνθρώπους μὲ φύλλα τῶν δένδρων (Ἰλ Ζ 146) καὶ ὁ Ψαλμωδὸς μὲ χορτάρι καὶ μὲ ἄνθος τοῦ ἀγροῦ (Ψαλμ 102,15). Ὄχι δὲν εἴμαστε τυχαῖοι. Ἀντίβαρο στὴν τραγικότητα τοῦ «πεπτωκότος» ἀπογόνου τῶν Πρωτοπλάστων εἶναι ἡ ἄπειρη Ἀγάπη τοῦ Θεοῦ. Ὁ ἄναρχος, ὁ ἀόρατος, ὁ ἀκατάληπτος, ὁ ἄϋλος, ὁ ἀεὶ ὤν Υἱὸς καὶ Λόγος τοῦ  Πατρὸς, μένοντας ἀναλλοίωτος δίδεται ἀπὸ τὸν Πατέρα καὶ γεννᾶται δι’Ἁγίου Πνεύματος ἐκ Παρθένου ἀγνῆς ὡς τέλειος ἄνθρωπος γιὰ νὰ σταυρωθεῖ καὶ νὰ ἀναστηθεῖ ἐκ νεκρῶν ὡς Θεάνθρωπος σώζοντας τὸ γένος τῶν ἀνθρώπων. «Καὶ ὁμολογουμένως μέγα ἐστὶ τὸ τῆς εὐσεβείας μυστήριον· Θεὸς ἐφανερώθη ἐν σαρκί, ἐδικαιώθη ἐν Πνεύματι, ὤφθη ἀγγέλοις, ἐκηρύχθη ἐν ἔθνεσιν, ἐπιστεύθη ἐν κόσμῳ, ἀνελήφθη ἐν δόξῃ», γράφει ὁ Ἀπόστολος Παῦλος (1 Τιμ γ΄ 16). </pre> <pre>2024 χρόνια μετὰ τὴν , ἄς πλησιάσωμε τὸ Μυστήριο μὲ τὴν ἁπλότητα καὶ τὴν χαρὰ τῶν Ποιμένων. Καὶ σὲ μᾶς εὐαγγελίζεται ὁ Ἄγγελος χαρὰν μεγάλην γιὰ νὰ ἀνεύρωμε «τήν τε Μαριὰμ καὶ τὸν Ἰωσὴφ καὶ τὸ Βρέφος κείμενον ἐν τῇ φάτνῃ» καὶ νὰ ἀκούσωμε τὴν δοξολογία ὄχι γιὰ τὰ γήινα ἀλλὰ γιὰ τὸν Ὑψιστο. </pre> <p>Ἂς ἔχωμε τὴν ἐπιμονὴ καὶ τὸ κουράγιο τῶν Μάγων «Ἀς τοὺς ἀκολουθήσωμε στὴ μακρὰ πορεία γιὰ νὰ δοῦμε τὸν Χριστό, γνωρίζοντας ὅτι κι ἐκεῖνοι  δὲν θὰ τὸν ἔβλεπαν ἄν δὲν ἀπομακρύνονταν ἀπὸ τὴ χώρα των.Ὅσο ἦσαν στὴν Περσία ἔβλεπαν τὸν Ἀστέρα. Ὅταν ἔφυγαν ἀπὸ ἐκεῖ, εἶδαν τὸν Ἥλιο τῆς Δικαιοσύνης. Ἀναστῶμεν οὖν καὶ ἡμεῖς· κἂν πάντες ταράττωνται, ἡμεῖς ἐπὶ τὴν οἰκίαν τοῦ παι- δίου τρέχωμεν· κἂν βασιλεῖς, κἂν δῆμοι, κἂν τύραννοι τὴν ὁδὸν ταύτην ἐκκόπτωσι, μὴ καταλύωμεν τὸν πόθον. Οὕτω γὰρ πάντα τὰ ἐπικείμενα διακρουσόμεθα δεινά» (ἉγἸω. Χρυσόστομος PG 57 78)  . </p><p>«Ὅταν δὲ ἦλθε τὸ πλήρωμα τῶν καιρῶν, ... Θεὸς ὢν προαιώνιος, ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς ὤφθη καὶ τοῖς ἀνθρώποις συνανεστράφη· καὶ ἐκ Παρθένου ἁγίας σαρκωθείς, ἐκένωσεν ἑαυτόν, μορφὴν δούλου λαβών, σύμμορφος γενόμενος τῷ σώματι τῆς ταπεινώσεως ἡμῶν, ἵνα ἡμᾶς συμμόρφους ποιήσῃ τῆς εἰκόνος τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ». </p><p>Το Μυστήριο τῆς ἐνανθρωπήσεως τοῦ Θεοῦ εἶναι κοσμοϊστορικὸ γεγονὸς ποὺ χωρίζει τὸ παλαιὸ ἀπὸ τὸ νέο, τὸ πεπερασμένο καὶ πρόσκαιρο ἀπὸ τὸ ἄπειρο καὶ αἰώνιο.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Ἐνῷ ὅμως συνέβη σὲ συγκεκριμένο χῶρο καὶ χρόνο ξεπερνᾶ αὐτὰ τὰ ὅρια καὶ προεκτείνεται, στὸ παρόν. Ὅπως καὶ ὅλα τὰ ἄλλα θεῖα συμβάντα ἡ Γέννηση τοῦ Θεανθρώπου γιὰ τὸ πλήρωμα τῆς Ἐκκλησίας Του συμβαίνει  «σήμερον» διότι κάθε στιγμὴ ἀνακεφαλαιώνεται ἡ ἱστορία τῆς Σωτηρίας γιὰ κάθε ταπεινὸ πιστὸ καὶ συντελεῖται θαῦμα ὑπερφυές:  Τὸ προσωπικὸ γεγονὸς τῆς γνώσεως τῆς Ἀληθείας καὶ τῆς πίστεως στὸν μόνο ἀληθινὸ Τριαδικὸ Θεὸ ἀποκτᾶ ἀδιάκοπη  σωτηριολογικὴ σημασία γιὰ τὸν κόσμο ὁλόκληρο. «Ὁ Πατὴρ ἀγαπᾷ τὸν Υἱόν, καὶ πάντα δέδωκεν ἐν τῇ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ. Ὁ πιστεύων εἰς τὸν Υἱὸν ἔχει ζωὴν αἰώνιον· ὁ δὲ ἀπειθῶν τῷ Υἱῷ οὐκ ὄψεται ζωήν (Ἰω γ΄ 35-36). Ἡ ἀπείθεια στὸ Χριστὸ ἀποκλείει τὴ Ζωή. Ἡ  ἐνσαρκωμένη  Ἀγάπη γεννημένη μέσα στὴ φάτνη κάθε ἀνθρωπίνης καρδίας συνεργεῖ καὶ θὰ συνεργεεῖ ἕως τὸ τέλος τοῦ αἰῶνος τούτου ὄχι στὴν κρίση, τὴν δίκη καὶ τὴν καταδίκη τοῦ κόσμου ἀλλὰ στὴν διὰ τοῦ Θεανθρώπου Σωτηρία του. Γνωρίζοντας αὐτὴ τὴν δυνατότητα ἂς ξεπεράσωμε τὰ ὅρια τῶν ἀτομικῶν μας αἰτημάτων καὶ ἂς παρακαλέσωμε θερμὰ τὸν Κύριο νὰ καταστείλει ἄμεσα τὰ ἔργα τοῦ σκότους στὸν πλανήτη μας, τοὺς πολέμους, τὴν βία, τὴν ἐκμετάλλευση μεταξὺ τῶν ἀνθρώπων, χαρίζοντας καὶ στὸ φυσικὸ περιβάλλον καιροὺς εἰρηνικοὺς καὶ εὐ </p><p>εἴσοδον ταύτην τῇ θείᾳ σου χάριτι εὐλόγησον· ὄμβρους εἰρηνικούς πρός καρποφορίαν τῇ γῇ δώρησαι· τούς ἀέρας ὑγιεινούς καί εὐκρά τους ἀνθρώποις τε καί κτήνεσι </p><p>Σᾶς εὔχομαι ἀπὸ καρδίας νὰ γιορτάσετε εὐλογημένα Χριστούγεννα καὶ νὰ διέλθετε τὸ νέο σωτήριο ἔτος 2024 μὲ τὴν χαρὰ τῶν Ποιμένων καὶ τῶν Μάγων, μὲ ἐλπίδα στὸν πλουσιοπάροχο χορηγὸ τοῦ ἀφθάρτου πλούτου, μὲ ἔμπρακτη ἀγάπη γιὰ τὸν Θεὸ καὶ τὸν συνάνθρωπο. </p>",firefox;accounts;,firefox,accounts,en-US,1694631;,mariepanayotopoulos
