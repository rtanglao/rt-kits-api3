I cannot find any option to change this. Vivaldi gives us an option to decide what we want unlike Firefox. </p><p>Chrome focuses on the search bar on the new tab regardless, duckduckgo browser does same, edge does same, opera does same, Brave does same and Vivaldi does same but gives us option in the settings as in the image below.
