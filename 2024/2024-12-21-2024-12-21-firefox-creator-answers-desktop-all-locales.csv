I have attached two identical images from the NYT homepage: the first is a screenshot from Chrome and the second is the same exact image but taken from Firefox.   </p><p>I have also attached another screenshot taken in Firefox from <a href=""http://REI.com"" rel=""nofollow"">REI.com</a>.  You'll see that it's not necessarily just a white background that is causing the weird blue color.  It also happens in products images being displayed incorrectly.   </p><p>I figured this might be a Firefox website appearance setting, but I have played around with it and selected many different permutations and I haven't been able to solve this issue.  I have also tried refreshing Firefox, using Firefox in Safemode, disabling all of my plugins/themes, etc. and nothing was fixed.   </p><p>I am pretty sure this isn't a system wide issue or a monitor issue because these websites are being displayed 100% correct in Chrome and Edge.  This is only an issue in Firefox.   </p><p>Can someone advise? </p><p><br> Thanks, </p><p>DC </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",climbwithahelmet
