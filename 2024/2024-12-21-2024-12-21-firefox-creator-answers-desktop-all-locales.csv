I use Google and Mozilla,<p>It's sort of difficult for me to explain. Other than I have used both Mozilla and Google. I have a Gmail account and a Proton mail account and I changed my email for Gmail by eliminating the last four digits of my social security number. Which used to be my Gmail address and I believe that I was using my last four digits for my proton mail account also? But to be honest I am not really sure of that? So to attempt to simplify my situation. doyttrail@gmail.com is my email address for Gmail and I really don't know if I changed this for proton mail account also. I am definitely getting old. Because I will be 68 on the 23 of this month. And I remember the days when none of this even existed. So I am sure that there must be someone who can help me straighten this mess that I created out and please help me simplify my life again. Thanks to whoever reads this and replies. They have to understand that cell phones didn't exist for me and many others when I was young. Computers didn't exist as we know them then either. But obviously I have learned alot in my 68 years of existence. </p>,firefox;accounts;,firefox,accounts,en-US,"",doyttrail

You'll see that it's not necessarily just a white background that is causing the weird blue color.  It also happens in products images being displayed incorrectly.   </p><p>I figured this might be a Firefox website appearance setting, but I have played around with it and selected many different permutations and I haven't been able to solve this issue.  I have also tried refreshing Firefox, using Firefox in Safemode, disabling all of my plugins/themes, etc. and nothing was fixed.   </p><p>I am pretty sure this isn't a system wide issue or a monitor issue because these websites are being displayed 100% correct in Chrome and Edge.  This is only an issue in Firefox.   </p><p>Can someone advise? </p><p><br> Thanks, </p><p>DC </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",climbwithahelmet
