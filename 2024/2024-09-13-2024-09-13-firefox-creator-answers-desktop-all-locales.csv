I'm using my android phone. This is the reason I chose to use Firefox to get privacy back. Mozilla doesn't offer the support I need because I'm limited to questions I have. I'm so frustrated. I didn't sync with any other devices but it's synced with my account. Can you help me regain my privacy using your apps? I'm not on a computer!!! Please don't let me down!!! </p>,firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1674240;1674241;1674250;,mspoe61
