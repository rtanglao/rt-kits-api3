I don't want video autoplay.  I had that FIXED at one point, but with the new update, all of my settings were discarded, and now I'm back to square one. I do not want video autoplay! Now, on to the next question: many complaints have been lodged on various 'help' pages and forums describing the same problem; my question is, in light of all of these complaints, why hasn't Firefox FIXED this problem and issued an update with the repair patches?! On my version of FF, Mac 126, all video controls in settings have disappeared. WHY? Where did they go? Not that they worked anyway because we had to muck about in about:config with various patches WHICH NO LONGER WORK ON MY  MAC! Why is there not a simple ON/OFF switch, in Settings, for those  of us who want the choice?! When are FF boffins going to FIX this to our satisfaction, with a WORKING, simple-selectable solution? I await a reply from a knowledgeable Firefox technician, one who preferably works on this part of the browser, please. Help me understand, or make me happy, preferably both. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1260;,firefox,other,en-US,"",trennor
