Some elements seem to be rendering incorrectly or not displaying at all. I've tested the website on other browsers, and it appears to be working fine there. Could someone help me troubleshoot this problem? Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. </p><p>Details: </p><p>Website URL: <a href=""https://freecapcutapk.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://freecapcutapk.com</a> Description of the Issue: When accessing my website on Mozilla Firefox, certain images and stylesheets are not loading properly. Additionally, the navigation menu appears to be misaligned, overlapping some of the content on the page. This issue is consistent across multiple pages of the website. Steps Taken to Resolve the Issue: I've tried clearing the browser cache and cookies, as well as testing the website on different devices and networks to rule out any local issues. However, the problem persists only on Mozilla Firefox. Browser Version: Mozilla Firefox version 98.0.1 (64-bit) Screenshots or Error Messages: Attached below are screenshots illustrating the rendering issues encountered on Mozilla Firefox. Additionally, there are no specific error messages displayed; the elements simply fail to load or display incorrectly. Thank you for your help! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",keith65609

I don't want video autoplay.  I had that FIXED at one point, but with the new update, all of my settings were discarded, and now I'm back to square one. I do not want video autoplay! Now, on to the next question: many complaints have been lodged on various 'help' pages and forums describing the same problem; my question is, in light of all of these complaints, why hasn't Firefox FIXED this problem and issued an update with the repair patches?! On my version of FF, Mac 126, all video controls in settings have disappeared. WHY? Where did they go? Not that they worked anyway because we had to muck about in about:config with various patches WHICH NO LONGER WORK ON MY  MAC! Why is there not a simple ON/OFF switch, in Settings, for those  of us who want the choice?! When are FF boffins going to FIX this to our satisfaction, with a WORKING, simple-selectable solution? I await a reply from a knowledgeable Firefox technician, one who preferably works on this part of the browser, please. Help me understand, or make me happy, preferably both. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1260;,firefox,other,en-US,"",trennor
