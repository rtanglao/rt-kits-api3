One day I might be working on a brand new piece of equipment and the next day trying to log into some ancient piece of equipment because I need to change something and I can't replace it yet. I'm having a major issue with the redirect even if I explicitly type HTTP it forces it to HTTPS ( and no I don't have HTTPS everywhere installed I've actually never used it ). I've noticed recently a few updates back now that if the connection cannot succeed it redirects to HTTP but it can hang up in a weird limbo where it thinks the site doesn't exist. There needs to be a toggle for local addresses explicitly typed ""HTTP"" to try that first. There also needs a toggle to ignore the security issues when accessing the device with a self assigned certificate as every single networking device has a self assigned a certificate and every time I need to change the setting on a router I have to agree even though I have a greed for the last 10 times when I've access the device or I just reset the device and the self signed certificate changed. And I don't know how you're gonna handle this on mobile but it almost makes using a mobile browser useless because I might as well just get the computer out even if all I have to do is change a password, SSID or just check a setting. </p><p>So local addresses need an option to lower the warning level for self signed certificates and to obey the typed protocol! </p><p>And there's some sort of bug with the Logic that detects a certificate or non-secure site that breaks when the connection drops. The only way I've been able to get around this is to go to the address bar and hit enter as a reload will not work and a reload skipping cash will not work to bring the site back up. </p><p>I've had devices that I thought weren't working only to find out they were working fine after 3 or 4 attempts and restarts only to find it's just that firefox thought the site didn't exist anymore. </p><p>And I don't have any other options because chrome is even worse with HTTPS once it gets it's vampire fangs in you're stuck it will not let you go back. And safari you might as will be undead. </p><p>Finally getting annoyed enough to write some thing as every time you go change your setting reboot device check setting log back in change saying restart log back in and you have to hit except certificate every single time. </p><p>And while I'm here Bring back the checkbox to save/ not save the certificate as I might not want to save the certificate when I know I'm going to reset the device and it's going to be totally different in the next 10 minutes. Or I might not want to save it at all like I go to a website that's misconfigured and the certificates not valid for the domain name that it's using. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;website-breakages;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",iMark7777777

Any insights or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. </p><p>Details: </p><p>Website URL: <a href=""https://freecapcutapk.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://freecapcutapk.com</a> Description of the Issue: When accessing my website on Mozilla Firefox, certain images and stylesheets are not loading properly. Additionally, the navigation menu appears to be misaligned, overlapping some of the content on the page. This issue is consistent across multiple pages of the website. Steps Taken to Resolve the Issue: I've tried clearing the browser cache and cookies, as well as testing the website on different devices and networks to rule out any local issues. However, the problem persists only on Mozilla Firefox. Browser Version: Mozilla Firefox version 98.0.1 (64-bit) Screenshots or Error Messages: Attached below are screenshots illustrating the rendering issues encountered on Mozilla Firefox. Additionally, there are no specific error messages displayed; the elements simply fail to load or display incorrectly. Thank you for your help! </p>","",firefox,other,en-US,"",keith65609

I don't want video autoplay.  I had that FIXED at one point, but with the new update, all of my settings were discarded, and now I'm back to square one. I do not want video autoplay! Now, on to the next question: many complaints have been lodged on various 'help' pages and forums describing the same problem; my question is, in light of all of these complaints, why hasn't Firefox FIXED this problem and issued an update with the repair patches?! On my version of FF, Mac 126, all video controls in settings have disappeared. WHY? Where did they go? Not that they worked anyway because we had to muck about in about:config with various patches WHICH NO LONGER WORK ON MY  MAC! Why is there not a simple ON/OFF switch, in Settings, for those  of us who want the choice?! When are FF boffins going to FIX this to our satisfaction, with a WORKING, simple-selectable solution? I await a reply from a knowledgeable Firefox technician, one who preferably works on this part of the browser, please. Help me understand, or make me happy, preferably both. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1260;,firefox,other,en-US,"",trennor
