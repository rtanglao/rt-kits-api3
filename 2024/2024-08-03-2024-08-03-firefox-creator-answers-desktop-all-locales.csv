But couldn't import the bookmarks. So, I thought I'd reinstall. Did that twice but both times it automatically populated the old bookmarks. Then I watched a tutorial that showed me how to change settings so I could view hidden files. This time I was able to import the bookmarks but they aren't showing up. Where are they because I received a message that they were imported. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1280;firefox-12803;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",tomcalwriter1

I converted my Windows 10 to Windows 11 a little too early. The options I had was to 'keep everything I have' or manually select what I wanted to keep.  Obviously I wanted to keep everything that I have so I selected to keep everything I have. </p><p>Windows 11 did a number on my computer. I think it fried my dual band bluetooth usb adapter, deleted saved email messages that included important passwords, and deleted all of my bookmarks that I had when I was using Windows 10 in one swoop. </p><p>For the past three days I've been trying to get what I had in Windows 10 back to Windows 11. I was able to replace some things but I seem to can't replace my old bookmarks. It has my job's link on there. I can't access my job through their horrible app but I can access my job online and no longer can do that. Even my history for the past month is gone. I thought I could access both my job points from there but it seems like the day I converted to Windows 11 deleted crucial things. Everything else is there. </p><p>Is there a way that I could retrieve my old bookmarks? I did the restore option but it only have 2 days which is the day I converted my computer but as I said, some things magically disappeared and I need those items back. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1280;firefox-12803;,firefox,other,en-US,"",D-vadout
