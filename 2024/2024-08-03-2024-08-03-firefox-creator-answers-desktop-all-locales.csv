I use Tagged and HI5 often.. My problem is ads on tagged and HI5 (Both are sister companies?  I get ads but no way of blocking them I have just tried all kinds of adblockers on firefox just waste of time... But the worst thing is those ad's that tagged display all infected... I use Norton and Malwarebyts when I click on the ad's they both come  on asking me to stay away all their ad's are infected... I have sent 5 emails to Tagged telling them what is going on but I had no reply at all negative or positive and they are infecting peoples computers or mobiles if they are not using Antivirus.... Ad's are always on when I use firefox but but when I use Microsoft Edge no ad's somehow but Microsoft Edge is much slower then Firefox,, when I click on to something it goes round and round and says Hang tight....What should I use on firefox to stop those Tagged ads..On tagged settings ads section has been unchecked but nothing stops them from popping up even the adblockers that I have...But only on firefox... Help help please to stop this unpleasant ads... Please find attached 3 screenshots of those ads...only 3 ads but much more we get ... God bless and thank you for your help on this matter...

It kept all my passwords, more than 100. A few days ago firefox totally crashed on my side, it did not want to start any site, while on the same computer other browsers stated them. After I realized this I deleted the firefox and uploaded again. Now it works almost for all site (but for example not for booking) but I lost almost all my passwords:(  I have now just 23 but lost many many. How can I get them back? </p><p>Many thanks: Emese </p>",desktop;windows-11;firefox-1280;protect-your-privacy;firefox-12803;,firefox,protect-your-privacy,en-US,"",pastiemese18

But couldn't import the bookmarks. So, I thought I'd reinstall. Did that twice but both times it automatically populated the old bookmarks. Then I watched a tutorial that showed me how to change settings so I could view hidden files. This time I was able to import the bookmarks but they aren't showing up. Where are they because I received a message that they were imported. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1280;firefox-12803;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",tomcalwriter1

I converted my Windows 10 to Windows 11 a little too early. The options I had was to 'keep everything I have' or manually select what I wanted to keep.  Obviously I wanted to keep everything that I have so I selected to keep everything I have. </p><p>Windows 11 did a number on my computer. I think it fried my dual band bluetooth usb adapter, deleted saved email messages that included important passwords, and deleted all of my bookmarks that I had when I was using Windows 10 in one swoop. </p><p>For the past three days I've been trying to get what I had in Windows 10 back to Windows 11. I was able to replace some things but I seem to can't replace my old bookmarks. It has my job's link on there. I can't access my job through their horrible app but I can access my job online and no longer can do that. Even my history for the past month is gone. I thought I could access both my job points from there but it seems like the day I converted to Windows 11 deleted crucial things. Everything else is there. </p><p>Is there a way that I could retrieve my old bookmarks? I did the restore option but it only have 2 days which is the day I converted my computer but as I said, some things magically disappeared and I need those items back. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1280;firefox-12803;,firefox,other,en-US,"",D-vadout
