1440434,2024-02-21 20:07:26 -0800,2024-02-21 21:16:43 -0800,Help upgrading from Macintosh Firefox 78.15.0 esr (64 bit).  Maybe also Thunderbird 60.9.1,"<p>WED 21FEB24 The urgent issue is that in the last few weeks, many web pages do not load content, just a grey or white screen.  Some will load the header.  I am the Executor for someone's estate, and I am having this trouble with some financial websites that I must access to do the job. </p><p>Its been many years since I upgraded anything.  It might be that Macintosh Firefox 78.15.0 esr (64 bit) and Thunderbird 60.9.1 are the newest revs that work with OSX 10.11.6 El Capitan.  I have a 2011 MacBookPro. </p><p>I don't like the changes in the user interface that Apple put into OSX after El Capitan.  But I may be forced to upgrade.  Too late in life to learn Linux. </p><p>Maybe the minimalist solution is to upgrade Firefox.  But that may require upgrading OSX, and Apple has made it really hard to do that unless you go to the very newest.  OTOH I don't know if the newer OSX will run on my 2011 MacBook Pro.  If I clicked on ""software update"" in About This Mac, what would happen?  would it just start doing it, or tell me about it first? </p><p>The last time I upgraded something, probably Thunderbird but maybe it was Firefox, I had to learn a complicated process to copy &amp; save the User Profiles (they are in a hidden directory), and then install them into the new rev.  I don't want to go through that again.  I just want to run the dmg file. </p><p>There used to be a Mozilla web page with all the versions &amp; you could download the dmg file you wanted. </p><p>If I still have problems, I would have to buy a much newer computer.  A several year old MacBookPro.  But I don't like the ""new"" disk formatting method Apple created.  It saves space by not actually making copies of files, but uses a pointer to one copy.  So there is a single point of failure, which makes copies pointless.  I want to keep using OSX Extended (Journaled) and I would have to have the seller of the computer do that for me, before I used Migration Assistant to put my stuff on it.  I also hate the welded-on hard drive; being able to pull the drive is the best ""broken hardware"" solution. </p><p>I don't recall if El Capitan has the ""OSX Recovery"" system or if that happened in a later rev. </p><p>I use SuperDuper to make a clone of my hard drive as a backup &amp; archive.  I wonder if I could connect a copy on an external drive and then startup using the external copy.  Then I could upgrade Firefox and see if it works, then do the same for OSX if necessary, and Thunderbird. </p><p>Suggestions &amp; how-to info needed.
