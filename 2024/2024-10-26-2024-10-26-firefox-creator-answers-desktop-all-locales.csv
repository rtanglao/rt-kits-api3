A nearly-clean profile created in the same version as the problematic one comes from does restore tabs successfully after upgrade. How can I find out what Firefox is doing that leads it to decide not to restore the tabs from this profile, so that I can then figure out how to get it to not decide to do that? </p><p><br> Longer version: </p><p><br> I am working to prepare a deployment for my organization to upgrade from its currently-deployed Firefox release (ESR 107.2.0) to a much more recent one (ESR 128.3.1, which I understand to be the current latest ESR). </p><p>I make much heavier use of and reliance on Firefox than do most in my organization. As part of that, I have hundreds of open tabs in multiple windows, saved by the session-restore feature to be reopened on subsequent launches of the browser. I also have a variety of add-ons installed. (I also have some userChrome-related UI customization, but I have reproduced this issue without that, so I do not think it is relevant.) </p><p>Because of that heavy use and reliance, part of my process for preparing to deploy a new Firefox release across the organization is to copy my Firefox profile to a test computer, verify that it comes up correctly after the upgrade, and determine whether any manual adjustments (e.g. to new settings, or of the userChrome-related UI customization) is necessary. This also helps position me to assist any other users who may likewise make heavier use of Firefox than most do. </p><p>This is typically a fairly straightforward process, if a time-consuming and sometimes clunky one. In this case, however, something went wrong. </p><p><br> I shut down my primary Firefox instance (on Windows 10), copied the profile directory out, copied it into place on another computer (running Windows 11), launched Firefox 107.2.0 there (to confirm that the profile came up correctly, which it did), shut it down again, upgraded Firefox on that computer to 128.3.1, and launched again. </p><p>Rather than the profile coming up correctly, the browser opened with none of my hundreds of tabs. There was only one window, and the only tab in that window was displaying my configured default page. The History menu showed the pages I had recently navigated to prior to copying the profile, but the ""Restore Previous Session"", ""Recently Closed Tabs"", and ""Recently Closed Windows"" entries were all grayed out. about:sessionrestore did not show any session content to be restored; its list of windows, tabs, etc., was entirely empty. Other configuration aspects, such as extensions and about:config settings and so forth, were all retained without apparent issues that I have noticed. </p><p>Investigating led me to reports such as <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1449541"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1449541</a> and <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1901899"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1901899</a>. The behavior described seems similar to what I am seeing, although the primary-password aspects do not appear in my case; I do not have such a password set, and did not see any prompt which would be related to one. (We have a policy in place to disable setting such a password, and it seemed possible that this might inadvertently trigger the same code path as having the user click to cancel on such a post-upgrade password prompt; however, I have tested the upgrade scenario with all of our Firefox-related enterprise policies removed, and the behavior was identical.) </p><p>Those reports, among others, suggest that such cases of lost tabs can be recovered from by looking under [profiledir]\sessionstore-backups\, identifying a .jsonlz4 file which contains the session data from the session, and copying that file to recovery.jsonlz4 and/or [profiledir]\sessionstore.jsonlz4. </p><p>I have experimented with this extensively, and gotten nowhere. The pre-upgrade copy of the profile contains a sessionstore.jsonlz4 file which, when I examine it via the tools from <a href=""https://github.com/jusw85/mozlz4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jusw85/mozlz4</a>, appears to contain the correct session state; during launch after upgrade, this file disappears (i.e., gets deleted). The post-upgrade copy of the profile contains sessionstore-backups\previous.jsonlz4 and sessionstore-backups\upgrade.jsonlz4-[datetimestampstring] files which appear to be identical to the previous sessionstore.jsonlz4, and a sessionstore-backups\recovery.jsonlz4 file which is (reported as being) 1KB in size and is presumably empty. </p><p>If I exit Firefox, delete that ""empty"" recovery.jsonlz4 file and copy either previous.jsonlz4 or the update.jsonlz4-* file into place under the recovery.jsonlz4 name, then launch Firefox again, the behavior is observed again. The tabs and windows are still not restored; a little while (more than a few seconds, less than a minute) after the Firefox UI becomes available and responsive, the copied-in recovery.jsonlz4 file disappears, and a new one with the ""empty"" state is created in its place. (I conclude that it's not just having its contents ""updated"" to the ""empty"" state, because if I have the file highlighted in Windows Explorer before the Firefox launch, and after launch return to that window and keep pressing F5 to refresh, at first nothing visible changes, but then on a later F5 press Explorer goes from having the correct-size file selected to having no file selected and having an ""empty""-state file present.) </p><p>If I instead - or also - copy the file into place as [profiledir]\sessionstore.jsonlz4, I see the same result. The newly-copied in file disappears after launch, and the tabs are not restored, nor available for restoration. </p><p>I have reproduced this behavior with various cut-down versions of the profile, including one which narrows it down to only one window and fewer than a hundred tabs, and which strips out the [profiledir]\chrome\ directory which contained the UI customizations. </p><p>I have created a test ""clean"" profile with Firefox ESR 102.7.0 (on the same computer where I'm doing the testing work), in which I just open a couple of tabs, set the ""restore tabs on startup"" preference, and exit. With that profile, the tabs come up after upgrade without issues. That demonstrates that this is not a universal problem, but is somehow being triggered by something about the profile I'm working with. </p><p>I have just about exhausted all avenues for debugging this with the resources I currently have. I have no idea how to get Firefox to tell me what it is doing in those early launch stages leading up to the point where the .jsonlz4 files get deleted. I'm not even sure it's *possible* to get Firefox to do that without using a debug build or doing custom builds which log status/etc. messages out to file at every step. Without that information, I have no leads on what to try that might bypass the problem. </p><p>The only idea I have left for getting any further is to try to bisect the profile/session down to a point where the issue *stops* happening, in the hopes of at least creating a minimal reproducing case - and because of the need to downgrade Firefox in order to be able to modify the profile/session, then upgrade it in order to test whether the issue still manifests, each step of the bisect is sufficiently lengthy and manual that I am hesitant to try to go that route without asking for help first. </p><p>I've considered filing a bug report on Bugzilla, but am not certain that that is the best venue for an appeal like this one, at least not as a first/next step - especially since I don't have a steps-to-reproduce, at least not without attaching a copy of the profile I'm using (which hardly seems like what that is asking for). I've already looked at the open bug reports in the session-restore component there, and not found any which seem to be covering the same behavior I'm seeing. </p><p>Any suggestions or advice which I might not have already considered and tried? </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",buehleaj

Initially when I transferred over my main profile, the addons worked at first but broke after a short while (specifically there were still as many addon buttons in my toolbar as before, but they were all blank and did nothing), and wouldn't restore after shutting down and reopening Firefox.  At first I tried disabling and reenabling each extension, and that worked, but after shutting down and reopning Firefox, they were all broken again.  I looked for fixes and tried the solutions in this ask: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1260445;"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1260445;</a> first, I tried jscher2000's solution of ""deleting"" extensions.json by renaming it, but it only fixed a couple addons (BitWarden and uBlock Origin, mainly).  Then I tried cor-el's solution of deleting combatibility.ini, and that still only had BitWarden, uBlock Origin, and maybe one or two others working - it also seemed to set the toolbar to default, removing most of the addons/empty buttons from the toolbar, and for some reason also made the addons overflow button no longer actually able to access the overflow dropdown and instead just open the about:addons page? </p><p>But, then I deleted the profile and copied it over again, but this time I preemptively went into extensions.json and changed all the paths to the new correct path (I also did so for the one path address in pkcs11.txt just in case, because it was the only other thing that came up in a search in the profile folder that had that hard-baked full path that might need updating; I don't know what pkcs11.txt does but I just wanted to be sure), and then (not sure if this part matters quite as much) did Create a New Profile and selected that existing copied-over folder as the folder for that profile to use.  Lo and behold, all my addons worked!  And they've continued to work as normal and not break through several times of closing and reopening both that specific profile and Firefox overall, and even with a couple shut downs and restarts of Windows. </p><p>However..... I tried doing that exact procedure (copying over profile folder, editing the paths in extensions.json and pkcs11.txt to be the new correct ones, Create a New Profile and selecting that folder) for my secondary profile, and yet still the addons end up broken just like in the main profile before I did the fix, and strangely it even also has the ""toolbar set to default"" and ""addons overflow button just opening about:addons"" problems the first profile had after the first couple failed fix attempts.  I have no idea what's different, as far as I'm aware I'm doing the exact same thing that worked on the first profile yet it's still ending up broken. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",tfaholic09

Within this programme, a ‘changeset’ can be called for processing in JOSM. </pre> <p>Message from JOSM ‘remote control has been asked to import data from the following URSL ( This is opened within JOSM  <a href=""https://www.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/changeset/158340818/download"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/changeset/158340818/download</a> (the number at the end can change) Normal situation is that this happens 1 time. Now the situation is, when in the browser the changeset is still open this is spontaneously sent to JOSM. And that several times, each time a page I visited earlier. Very annoying.  The JOSM helpdesk gives this message. Quote: </p> <hr> <p>comment:1 by frans Schutz &lt;Frans.schutz@…&gt;, 4 days ago </p><p>Since a week or so I see this behaviour. I use Firefox internet explorer and have often a OSMcha and changesets open. The Data layers which opens are always the same as the changesets I have opened. No idea if there is an interference with that. Thanks for looking into this comment:2 by stoecker, 4 days ago </p><p>Sounds like a ""background load"" to me. The Web browser tries loading the URL in background and each time you get a new layer. Closing the TABS in the browser may help or if possible disabling background fetches for the localhost URLs? comment:3 by taylor.smock, 4 days ago Owner: 	changed from team to Frans.schutz@… Status: 	new → needinfo </p><p>I agree with stoecker. </p><p>As a first step, I would turn off/disable Remote Control. If this fixes the issue, then you have a poorly behaving website that is continually calling JOSM remote control. </p><p>See wiki:Help/Preferences/RemoteControl. follow-up:  5 comment:4 by anonymous, 3 days ago </p><p>Hello I disabled the remote control, but than I have no access to JOSM when I want to open a task in TM4 </p><p>Till last week, Firefox did not respond as what I now see. </p><p>I try to close open OSMcha and changesets to see if this solve the issue Bestregards in reply to:  4 comment:5 by taylor.smock, 3 days ago </p><p>Replying to anonymous: </p><pre>   I disabled the remote control, but than I have no access to JOSM when I want to open a task in TM4 </pre> <p>That was expected. The question is, did disabling remote control fix the issue. If so, then something is calling JOSM remote control in a loop, and it is not a bug in JOSM. </p><pre>   I try to close open OSMcha and changesets to see if this solve the issue </pre> <p>Once you figure out what website is the problem, I would highly recommend filing a ticket with them. Absent that, put the website (preferably with the full URL -- most browsers let reopen the last closed tab) in this ticket and I'll look into the sites bug report procedure. </p>",firefox;browse;firefox-1310;firefox-13103;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",Frans-Schutz
