These sites will load on VPN on other browsers fine (i.e. Safari) and WILL load on Firefox when VPN is turned off. What could be the issue here? It appears to be Firefox specific to Mac since the configuration works fine on my iPhone. Thanks! </p>,firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",nwellsr

Initially when I transferred over my main profile, the addons worked at first but broke after a short while (specifically there were still as many addon buttons in my toolbar as before, but they were all blank and did nothing), and wouldn't restore after shutting down and reopening Firefox.  At first I tried disabling and reenabling each extension, and that worked, but after shutting down and reopning Firefox, they were all broken again.  I looked for fixes and tried the solutions in this ask: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1260445;"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1260445;</a> first, I tried jscher2000's solution of ""deleting"" extensions.json by renaming it, but it only fixed a couple addons (BitWarden and uBlock Origin, mainly).  Then I tried cor-el's solution of deleting combatibility.ini, and that still only had BitWarden, uBlock Origin, and maybe one or two others working - it also seemed to set the toolbar to default, removing most of the addons/empty buttons from the toolbar, and for some reason also made the addons overflow button no longer actually able to access the overflow dropdown and instead just open the about:addons page? </p><p>But, then I deleted the profile and copied it over again, but this time I preemptively went into extensions.json and changed all the paths to the new correct path (I also did so for the one path address in pkcs11.txt just in case, because it was the only other thing that came up in a search in the profile folder that had that hard-baked full path that might need updating; I don't know what pkcs11.txt does but I just wanted to be sure), and then (not sure if this part matters quite as much) did Create a New Profile and selected that existing copied-over folder as the folder for that profile to use.  Lo and behold, all my addons worked!  And they've continued to work as normal and not break through several times of closing and reopening both that specific profile and Firefox overall, and even with a couple shut downs and restarts of Windows. </p><p>However..... I tried doing that exact procedure (copying over profile folder, editing the paths in extensions.json and pkcs11.txt to be the new correct ones, Create a New Profile and selecting that folder) for my secondary profile, and yet still the addons end up broken just like in the main profile before I did the fix, and strangely it even also has the ""toolbar set to default"" and ""addons overflow button just opening about:addons"" problems the first profile had after the first couple failed fix attempts.  I have no idea what's different, as far as I'm aware I'm doing the exact same thing that worked on the first profile yet it's still ending up broken. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",tfaholic09
