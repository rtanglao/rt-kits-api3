I have to go into student and instructor records frequently where their personal info is displayed in the form of filled in fields on a web page. Every time I exit a student/instructor contact page, firefox asks me if I want to save their addresses. Obviously I don't want to do this with other peoples info, but I'd still like to autofill addresses for my own private browsing. Is there a way I can exclude only  the class scheduling website from address autofill/autosave without shutting the function off entirely for all my other browsing? Thanks . </p>",desktop;customize-settings-and-preferences;,firefox,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",bengreen1935
