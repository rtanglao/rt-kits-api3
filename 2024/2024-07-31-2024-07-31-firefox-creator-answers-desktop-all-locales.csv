However, I no longer use Windows and have encountered problems with it on various Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian...). Currently, I'm only using Fedora 40, and the problem persists. </p><p>The issue is that when I click on the PiP icon, it activates normally, but when I switch windows or minimize and then maximize Firefox again, the video disappears. </p><p>I will attach some screenshots to clarify the issue. </p><p>I would like to know if there is any way to resolve this. I’ve already reset the settings, cleared the cache, and tested different installation methods (software store, .tar.bz file, apt, dnf, snap). I’ve tried troubleshooting mode and even installed the Developer Edition, but the problem persists. I’m wondering if this is an issue with the Linux version of Firefox. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",linux;desktop;troubleshooting;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",caiochaves0610

I have to go into student and instructor records frequently where their personal info is displayed in the form of filled in fields on a web page. Every time I exit a student/instructor contact page, firefox asks me if I want to save their addresses. Obviously I don't want to do this with other peoples info, but I'd still like to autofill addresses for my own private browsing. Is there a way I can exclude only  the class scheduling website from address autofill/autosave without shutting the function off entirely for all my other browsing?
