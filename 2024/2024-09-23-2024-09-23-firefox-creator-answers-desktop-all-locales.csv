However when I click on a link to a product I get weird web pages with a heading ""breadcrumb"" and the page comes out with only a few images and this strange lot of directional arrows. When I paste the webpage address into another webpage exactly the same problem. When I paste the address into Chrome, no problem, the page comes up correctly with all the images and not this weird page I get with Firefox. I prefer to use Firefox and I would really rather not have to change to Chrome or MS Edge. </p><p>I didn't always have this problem, it seemed to have been more recently and seems to be only with eBay. I imagine it's something in the settings that somehow switched and I need to switch it back. </p><p>Thank you for all those at Mozilla support, I look forward to a reply.
