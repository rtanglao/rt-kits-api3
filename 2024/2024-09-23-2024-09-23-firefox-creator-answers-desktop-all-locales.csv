They literally warn you to be careful as these changes could mess up your system and providing this complex solution, IS RIDICULOUS!! </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1382827"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1382827</a> </p><p>Second, why this setting is the default and a simple solution hasn't been provided is ridiculous and another example of how customer service no longer exists! </p><p>So for the majority of users that likely don't understand the solution provided or don't want to risk creating more issues. CAN YOU PLEASE PROVIDE AN ANSWER THAT EVERYONE CAN UNDERSTAND? If you don't, I can assure you that not only will I never use any of your products again, I will make it my life's mission to make sure others quit using your products as well because again, this whole issue and past solution is beyond ridiculous!!! </p><p>NO ONE WANTS THIS SETTING SO THE SOLUTION SHOULD BE FIXED BY YOUR PROGRAMMERS AND NOT BY PROVIDING COMPLEX SOLUTIONS THAT MOST DON'T UNDERSTAND!!! </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",mzman2013

This problem <em>seems</em> to only affect Linux. Reports on the reddit thread indicate that setting <strong>gfx.canvas.acceleration</strong> to false fixes the problem, although I have not thoroughly tested to ensure that fix works and even if it does it obviously isn't a desirable solution. The thread indicates that this has been an issue since 129.0.2, although I'm unsure whether this is a regression or if Google changed something that broke Gecko. Interestingly, turning off all of my extensions doesn't seem to fix anything, but running in troubleshooting mode does. Additionally, I've noticed that Firefox reports that it is running in Quirks mode when it loads a particular script, presumably because that script injects raw HTML into the page. (the script in question: <a href=""https://docs.google.com/static/document/client/js/108419787-client_js_prod_kix_core.js"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.google.com/static/document/client/js/108419787-client_js_prod_kix_core.js</a>) </p>",firefox;firefox-1300;performance-and-connectivity;firefox-13001;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",pheonixRenegade
