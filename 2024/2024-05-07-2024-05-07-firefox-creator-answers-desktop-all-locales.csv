They are from different sources for different reasons/subjects/interests etc... I think when I reached ~430.000 or something like that it really slowed firefox down in a way that even clicking on a folder in the ""bookmark symbol bar"" (the one underneath the URL address fiel) takes 2-3 sec to open up and show the containing bookmarks. In the bm-manager going from one folder to another also takes a few seconds. I've now deleted about 40.000 but no change it's still lagging. and deleting 1000 takes about 1h. </p><p>I've looked but so far I couldn't find another tool or a better way to manage all these URLs WITH their title. </p><p>I still want to keep them, but managing them has become so slow and tedious. So if you have any suggestions especially for other tools to manage them.... </p><p>I also think the possibility to export only a part of them (selected ones, or specific folders) would be helpful; maybe also a tool to clean up the database? (like defrag did for harddrives?). or split it to differnt files? I don't know. </p><p>I know 400.000 bookmarks are extreme... but well.... </p>",desktop;beta;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1250;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",LeSeigneur

I updated FLOORP on the 5th May, FLOORP crashed and then Brave, Firefox, Waterfox, LibreWolf and Vivaldi started crashing. I had Brave and Vivaldi open when I launched FLOORP and FLOORP asked consent to update itself and after updating, it did not open in ‚Äúprevious session‚Äù and I could not open ‚Äúprevious session‚Äù through History. When I launched ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù from menu, ‚Äúprevious session‚Äù opened! I had pinned ‚ÄúSettings‚Äù earlier. </p><p>Now the bizarre happens; suddenly LibreWolf launches by itself also without ‚Äúprevious session‚Äù and open tabs in Brave and Vivaldi disappear to single New Tab. After some tinkering, I was able to restore ‚Äúprevious session‚Äù in LibreWolf, Brave and Vivaldi. </p><p>Now I close all browsers and open Firefox, no ‚Äúprevious session‚Äù and some random windows in its history, opening these random windows also opened ‚Äúprevious session‚Äù! üôÑBut then Waterfox launches also without ‚Äúprevious session‚Äù, here clicking on OneTab extension recovered ‚Äúprevious session‚Äù. </p><p>Cutting short; I uninstalled, Waterfox, LibreWolf and FLOORP, this did not help, I ran System Restore twice to two different points and it has not resolved the issue. </p><p>Thankful for any help! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1651734;1651740;,phosflox

Accedo spesso alla sezione a pagamento di un sito che, tra altre informazioni, contiene widget grafici di un altro sito, ma al posto di tali immagini appare solamente un riquadro a sfondo grigio. Sulla pagina pubblica che dovrebbe mostrare video streaming in diretta, non vedo nulla, neppure la finestra del video. In entrambe i casi non mi appare alcun messaggio. Su tali siti ho disattivato ogni estensione che filtra pubblicit√†. Con Edge i due siti funzionano alla perfezione (ma non vorrei dover usare un secondo browser, oppure cambiare del tutto). Immagino ci sia qualche componente di Firefox mancante o disattivato. Suggerimenti su come cercare una soluzione?
