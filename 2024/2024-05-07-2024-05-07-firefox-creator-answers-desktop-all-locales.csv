However, this doesn't change the position of the close tab button and leaves it on the right hand side. I found a way to change it, using the code  .tabbrowser-tab .tab-close-button { </p><pre> margin-left: -5px&nbsp;!important;  margin-right: 2.5px&nbsp;!important; </pre> <p>} Unfortunately, this doesn't change based on the size of the tab, so if I set it to a size that is good for only having 1 tab, it will look bad or be off the screen for the other amounts of tabs. Is there a way to detect the width of the tab or the amount of tabs open and dynamically set the margins based off of this? So I could set it as (width-of-tab)-x and that would always keep the close tab button in the same spot, regardless of tab size. Thanks! </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",williamoflowden

They are from different sources for different reasons/subjects/interests etc... I think when I reached ~430.000 or something like that it really slowed firefox down in a way that even clicking on a folder in the ""bookmark symbol bar"" (the one underneath the URL address fiel) takes 2-3 sec to open up and show the containing bookmarks. In the bm-manager going from one folder to another also takes a few seconds. I've now deleted about 40.000 but no change it's still lagging. and deleting 1000 takes about 1h. </p><p>I've looked but so far I couldn't find another tool or a better way to manage all these URLs WITH their title. </p><p>I still want to keep them, but managing them has become so slow and tedious. So if you have any suggestions especially for other tools to manage them.... </p><p>I also think the possibility to export only a part of them (selected ones, or specific folders) would be helpful; maybe also a tool to clean up the database? (like defrag did for harddrives?). or split it to differnt files?

Sulla pagina pubblica che dovrebbe mostrare video streaming in diretta, non vedo nulla, neppure la finestra del video. In entrambe i casi non mi appare alcun messaggio. Su tali siti ho disattivato ogni estensione che filtra pubblicit√†. Con Edge i due siti funzionano alla perfezione (ma non vorrei dover usare un secondo browser, oppure cambiare del tutto).
