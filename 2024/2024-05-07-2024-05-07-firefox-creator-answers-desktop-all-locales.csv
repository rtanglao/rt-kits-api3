What currently happens is I open the browser only to get shanghaid by the update process. I dont want that. when I open the browser I want to go straight to what i am doing. I dont want to have to sit there and wait while the browser updates. If it did updates once a month or less it wouldnt be such an issue but the damn browser is updating every few days or even every day and it always wants to do it when I want to do my own work. IS there not a way for the browser to update while im asleep at 3 am? When Im not wanting to use it. Its so irritating. It causes me to not bother with updates. I dont want to comply. When IM given a choice for any updating I set updates to install in the early hours when Im not inconvenienced by it. How can I do this with firefox? </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,other,en-US,"",uncleresry
