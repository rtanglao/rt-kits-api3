But if we change the action to ""use windows default application"" it works fine. </p><p>So my question is why is this happening? I did some research and found related issues <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/996487"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/996487</a> and <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1249538"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1249538</a> </p><p>What is the technical explanation for this? We're happy to just set the FF preferences to ""use windows default application"" but we'll need to tell them why that is. </p><p>thank you </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1290;firefox-12901;,firefox,other,en-US,1668251;,rvtuble

It does not seem to happen when they are not present.  Interestingly. we had been using a a very similar Firefox configuration on a legacy Intel macOS system without this issue.  We began seeing it while setting-up a fresh installation of Firefox on a new Apple Silicon system with macOS Ventura. The issue was reproduced in a new profile.  It continues to the present day with up the current version of Firefox 129.01 on macOS 14.6.1 I feel like this is probably a bug but I don't have the necessary skill to make an effective bug report. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;customize-settings-and-preferences;firefox-1290;firefox-12901;,firefox,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",timothybright
