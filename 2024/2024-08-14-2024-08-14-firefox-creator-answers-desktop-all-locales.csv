On your own risk you can prevent Firefox from carrying out the blocklist by changing the appropriate setting in the browser's configuration (""about:config"") but Nuance does not recommend this.  Further information is available from Mozilla."" </p><p>If anyone can help with this, as I need the software for accessibility reasons and I don't want to be forced onto another browser because of it. </p>",desktop;windows-11;customize-settings-and-preferences;firefox-1290;,firefox,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",willshore20

Automatic update never works, first it claims that FF restart is required to install the update but when invoked FF never restarts automatically. Alternatively if FF is closed without invoking restart subsequent manual launch never starts the browser. Only the second manual launch opens the browser window which takes a small portion of the upper left corner of the screen and there's no Maximize button - instead the button is Restore and upon clicking the small window moves beyond the upper right corner of the screen putting the maximize button out of reach. So I have to somehow grab the title bar and move it to the view so I can finally maximize the window - very annoying. Upon checking the FF version remains the same, no update occurred. Invoking another update results in endless notification Updating FF. At some point there's a notification that I have to update FF manually by downloading an installer etc. This goes on and on over and over. Could this mean my FF is hijacked? </p>",desktop;windows-10;firefox-1270;install-and-update;,firefox,install-and-update,en-US,"",miracle.flame

I get an email from them when there are new summary notices and I click on the link to view them.  That brings me to the login page and after I log in I get a page that lists summary notices starting with the most recent.  For each notice, there are three links you can click:  download, print, and open.  I've always clicked ""open"", which has always brought up the summary I chose, I think in a new tab or window, but I'm really not sure, it's been a while. </p><p>This time when I clicked on ""open"" for the first summary notice, it stayed in the same tab and under the title listing the particular notice I got the following: </p><p>"" Firefox Can’t Open This Page </p><p>To protect your security, <a href=""http://api.medicare.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">api.medicare.gov</a> will not allow Firefox to display the page if another site has embedded it.

As I was writing this just now I noticed that the error message says you need to open it in a new window, so I just tried that instead of a new tab, but I still got the same error message. </p><p>Interestingly, I thought I'd check clicking ""download"" just to make sure I could get my new notices.  That opened a new tab and the notice came up!!  Now I'm sitting here trying to remember if I used to click ""open"" or ""download"" and feeling like this computer drives me crazier and crazier every day I use it! </p><p>I am submitting this anyway for two reasons.  First of all, if I'm confused other people are probably also confused.  Secondly, I want to know if there's anything wrong on my end that I should be fixing or if this is a problem on Medicare's end.  Obviously I want to let them know if it's their problem so that it can be fixed. </p><p>I just got a notice about a Firefox update but I haven't installed it yet and I haven't tried this in any other browser (I really hate using Chrome, especially for something as private as Medicare, but if that will help you please let me know and I can try it there).   </p><p>One other thing that may or may not be relevant.  I've had my Social Security and Medicare accounts for many years.  Recently I received a notice from Social Security that they're upgrading to a more secure login system (sorry I've forgotten exactly what they call it) and said that if you're using an older account you have to create a new login with their new site and it would work across your federal government accounts.  I did that but Medicare used my old login information and it worked.  I don't know if that would be causing this problem, I don't think they've terminated the old system altogether just yet but I'm not sure.  This probably doesn't make a difference but I thought I should mention it just in case. </p><p>Thank you for any suggestions you have about this, and please let me know if you think I should notify the <a href=""http://medicare.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">medicare.gov</a> people as well. </p><p>Joan </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1280;firefox-12803;,firefox,other,en-US,1668270;,PurpleJ
