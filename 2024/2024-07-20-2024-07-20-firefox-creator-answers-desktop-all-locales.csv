For some unknown reason, sometimes when watching youtube videos in fullscreen the video pops out of the screen and goes to a lower right window. This window has no controls, no title and the video stays black and nothing plays anymore. If I right click on it I have the option of ""showing controls"". Why is this happening? Am I issuing some weird mouse or keyboard command? How the HECK do I disable this, since I don't want, ever, to see any videos on a floating window, like ever at all? May I remind you that I disabled PIP in the beginning?  </p><p>Please help. </p>",desktop;windows-11;firefox-1280;customize-settings-and-preferences;,firefox,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",moreira.jf

The message flashes on the screen and disappears almost immediately, so I am unable to read the details of the message. Then I went to another website and I received a similar message. This time, the message stayed on the screen, and I was able to read it all. It said that I have to go to my ""extension bar"" and disable the ad blocker. What is an extension bar, and does this have something to do with Mozilla Firefox? Firefox recently had an update, so I am wondering if they are related. </p>",desktop;troubleshooting;firefox-1280;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,1662995;,nrmasson
