I have LastPass: Free Password Manager extension in my Firefox. </p><p>Up until 2 days ago I had an icon on my toolbar for the LastPass extension that I could click after opening Firefox to login to LP. It has worked fine for years. It was that way when I shut down my computer that night. The next morning when I opened FF, that icon was gone. LP still shows in my Add-ons manager as Enabled. To the best of my knowledge, nothing on my comp updated in that time period.  </p><p>I tried clicking the 'Extensions' button in the FF toolbar, but all it did was to open the ""Recommendations"" tab of my Add-ons manager. Previously, clicking the 'Extensions' button in my toolbar would show a menu of extensions including LP. I would get an option to show an LP icon in my toolbar. That worked as recently as a few weeks ago when I wiped my hard drive and did a fresh install of Windows.  </p><p>I tried removing and reinstalling the exension. It made no change. Next I fully removed Firefox with the Remove Programs option in the Windows control panel, then removed all traces of FF in my Windows user profile. Then rebooted. Then DL'ed Firefox fresh from the FF site and re-installed it. Twice. No icon shows up, and the 'Extensions' button continues to do nothing but send me to the 'Recommendations' tab of the add-ons manager. </p><p>I had a few other extensions installed as well as LP at the time this problem arose. But when I re-installed Firefox, I only installed LP and tried to get its icon showing before installing any other extensions, just to be sure there was no conflict. </p><p>Can you offer any suggestions to help? </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;windows-10;troubleshooting;firefox-1280;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",cousinjoe

This window has no controls, no title and the video stays black and nothing plays anymore. If I right click on it I have the option of ""showing controls"". Why is this happening? Am I issuing some weird mouse or keyboard command? How the HECK do I disable this, since I don't want, ever, to see any videos on a floating window, like ever at all?

This time, the message stayed on the screen, and I was able to read it all. It said that I have to go to my ""extension bar"" and disable the ad blocker. What is an extension bar, and does this have something to do with Mozilla Firefox?
