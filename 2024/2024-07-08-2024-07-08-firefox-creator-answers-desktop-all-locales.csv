Then a loop starts where a window appear with buttons offering to Restart or Close Firefox but whichever I choose it takes several sets of open/crash to stabilize when in the end if offers to either open it again, or refresh Firefox. I don't wan to refresh because I have tens of tabs that I want to save. But I can't because OneTab, along with all other extensions, is being disabled after the restarts. </p><p>I have a crash ID of one of the latest occurrences of this phenomena: f6ef62ad-b072-46b8-8bc8-0d3ca0240708 </p><p>Please advise! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",radi.stoyanov

My wife finds the top left print too small and wants me to go back to Google Chrome where she can read what she has entered. I cannot find anything, anywhere which will allow her to do this.
