São muitos para eu fazer manualmente, então estou procurando outra maneira de salvá-los (ou transferi-los para meu notebook novo). Até aonde sei não existe uma opção nos menus do Firefox para importar o Histórico assim como existe com os Favoritos. Então encontrei um artigo de ajuda no site da Mozilla que diz que as as informações do Firefox são armazenadas em C:\Users&lt;seu nome de usuário do Windows&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles e que a lista de Histórico estaria no arquivo ""places.sqlite"". Como não tenho como abrir o arquivo, copiei do notebook antigo e colei na pasta mencionada acima só que no notebook novo. Abri o Firefox porém os Históricos não estavam lá. Existe alguma outra maneira de realizar backup dos sites no Histórico? </p><p>Observações: Sistema Operacional do notebook velho (do qual quero copiar): Windows Vista Home Premium Service Pack 2 Versão do Firefox do notebook velho: Version 52 (não atualiza mais) Sistema Operacional do notebook novo (para o qual quero copiar): Windows 10 Pro (posso mudar se for necessário) Versão do Firefox do notebook novo: 122.0 Não consigo fazer login no site da Mozilla pelo notebook antigo. </p><p>Se alguém souber como resolver meu problema, peço que compartilhe a solução.
