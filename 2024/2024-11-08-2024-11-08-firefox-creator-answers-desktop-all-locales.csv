I've noticed that since updating to version 132.0.1 of Firefox that something seems to be odd with the way the browser is behaving with Youtube. Specifically, the back button isn't behaving as it should. Instead of taking me back to a  previous page/video, the back button fades out as if it had indeed gone back to a previous page on the site, but doesn't actively take me to that page. I have to reload the page to get back to that previous page. This, so far, has not occurred  on any other website I visit. I'm not sure if this is a glitch in Youtube or in Firefox, however given that this seems to be localized to Youtube, I'm wondering if it's an issue in Youtube that is somehow specific to Firefox itself. I tried this on my phone, and the issue isn't happening there, just on my laptop's version of the browser. This issue was not present in the previous version of Firefox, so I'm not sure what's going on. I am on an older build of Windows 10 as my machine seems incapable of updating to a later build of the OS, but I don't believe this is the cause either since other websites I've visited do not have this issue, so far as I can tell.  </p><p>Can anyone help in regards to this issue?
