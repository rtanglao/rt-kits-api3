Turning it off makes the video drop to one or two FPS.  </p><p>Chromium has no problem with the same video. However, you can see from the screenshots that both read the resolution/scaling of my screen differently, and it implies that Firefox is rendering something like 6314 x 3552 while Chromium is rendering at UHD, the resolution of the screen and my video. If I turn off all my Global Scaling, Firefox stops dropping frames (the same info box on YouTube states resolution is UHD), reinforcing my theory about scaling being the issue. Both are confirmed to be using native Wayland. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",rhyme_relays_0k

Siempre he tenido sincronizados los marcadores, etc. He tenido que instalar el SO de nuevo en mi PC y al instalar Firefox, no me aceptaba la contraseña que tenía, por lo que he tenido que crear otra nueva. El problema es que tras iniciar sesión, no me sincroniza con mis datos de siempre. No sé si es porque se ha creado un perfil distinto, pero en el apartado de cuentas solo me aparecía el actual, así que no podía importar los datos de ningún otro pefil. Podrían ayudarme? Es que tengo guardados marcadores de cosas del trabajo que necesito... </p><p>Gracias de antemano </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;firefox-1320;firefox-13201;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,es,1686603;,vabasan
