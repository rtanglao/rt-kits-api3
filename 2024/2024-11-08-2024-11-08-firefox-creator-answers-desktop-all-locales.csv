I tried this on my phone, and the issue isn't happening there, just on my laptop's version of the browser. This issue was not present in the previous version of Firefox, so I'm not sure what's going on. I am on an older build of Windows 10 as my machine seems incapable of updating to a later build of the OS, but I don't believe this is the cause either since other websites I've visited do not have this issue, so far as I can tell.  </p><p>Can anyone help in regards to this issue?

Turning it off makes the video drop to one or two FPS.  </p><p>Chromium has no problem with the same video. However, you can see from the screenshots that both read the resolution/scaling of my screen differently, and it implies that Firefox is rendering something like 6314 x 3552 while Chromium is rendering at UHD, the resolution of the screen and my video. If I turn off all my Global Scaling, Firefox stops dropping frames (the same info box on YouTube states resolution is UHD), reinforcing my theory about scaling being the issue. Both are confirmed to be using native Wayland. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",rhyme_relays_0k

El problema es que tras iniciar sesión, no me sincroniza con mis datos de siempre. No sé si es porque se ha creado un perfil distinto, pero en el apartado de cuentas solo me aparecía el actual, así que no podía importar los datos de ningún otro pefil. Podrían ayudarme?
