It allowed you to right click on the link, and open the site in a tab, using Internet Explorer, for sites that didn't work properly in Firefox. I was wondering if anybody knows of any similar extension that would do the same for Edge? I can't open Twitter (X) using Firefox anymore, but I can open it using Edge. I don't like Edge (obviously), but I have no choice. Thanks in advance!!! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",carlrgoodwin

Is there anyone having experienced similar phenomena? </p><p>1) Firefox stops showing Gmail correctly after a few days. Immediately after starting Firefox, I can log-in and open <a href=""http://Gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Gmail.com</a> correctly. But after a few days keeping opening Gmail on Firefox, <a href=""http://Gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Gmail.com</a> shows error messages regarding Cookie (please see the attached screenshot). If I do ""Try clearing the startup cache"" from trouble shooting information tab, Firefox shows Gmail correctly again, but after a few days the same issue happens again. </p><p>2) Fire fox cannot log-in on <a href=""http://Outlook.live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.live.com</a>. As title says, I cannot log-in outlook live. Whenever I try to log-in from Outlook log-in page, Firefox shows log-in page again. This issue isn't resolved by inactivating ""Enhanced tracking protection"". </p><p>Both of them started to happen since the update around the end of 2023, I think. (On the other hand, Chrome works on both websites correctly) </p><p>If you have some information, it might help me. Thanks in advance. </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-10;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,cookies,en-US,"",ghc03361
