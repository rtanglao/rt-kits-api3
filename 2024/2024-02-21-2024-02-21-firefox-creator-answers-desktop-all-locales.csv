I seem to have affected the print facility so that the contents of a frame within a webpage do not print. The frame contents do show on the preview screen but then disappear when the Print button is pressed and they are not printed. The rest of the webpage is printed OK. Typically this happens to the 'Sellers Description' on an Ebay item. I have upgraded to Firefox 115.7.0esr but this has not fixed the problem. The print works fine on another machine running Windows 10 and Firefox 91.6.0esr 64-bit. Is there a way to get the full print back?
