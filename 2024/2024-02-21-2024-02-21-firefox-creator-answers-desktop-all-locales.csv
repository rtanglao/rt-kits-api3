Is there anyone having experienced similar phenomena? </p><p>1) Firefox stops showing Gmail correctly after a few days. Immediately after starting Firefox, I can log-in and open <a href=""http://Gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Gmail.com</a> correctly. But after a few days keeping opening Gmail on Firefox, <a href=""http://Gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Gmail.com</a> shows error messages regarding Cookie (please see the attached screenshot). If I do ""Try clearing the startup cache"" from trouble shooting information tab, Firefox shows Gmail correctly again, but after a few days the same issue happens again. </p><p>2) Fire fox cannot log-in on <a href=""http://Outlook.live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.live.com</a>. As title says, I cannot log-in outlook live. Whenever I try to log-in from Outlook log-in page, Firefox shows log-in page again. This issue isn't resolved by inactivating ""Enhanced tracking protection"". </p><p>Both of them started to happen since the update around the end of 2023, I think. (On the other hand, Chrome works on both websites correctly) </p><p>If you have some information, it might help me. Thanks in advance. </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-10;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,cookies,en-US,"",ghc03361
