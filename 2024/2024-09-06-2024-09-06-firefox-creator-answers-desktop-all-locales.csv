I thought it might adapt to the most recent or most often selected folder; however, it seems to present the same ""default"" location every time I bookmark a tab - a folder I have not barely used in months. I realize I can select another folder, but it is annoying for it to select the LEAST used and my personal least favorite folder EVERY TIME, for MONTHS.  </p><p>1) Is there a way to select which folder it preloads to save bookmarks to?  2) Why is it selecting THAT folder?  3) If there is no way to set a folder, is there a way to reset it or something? ANY other folder to default to would be less annoying. I do not understand why it seems ""stuck"" on this folder and will not preload ANY other folder from the dozens of folders.  </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help! </p>",settings;firefox;firefox-1300;,firefox,settings,en-US,1672968;,ameliajaycen
