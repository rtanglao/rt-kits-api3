The current version is 130.0 which auto downloaded about a week or 2 ago.  Now I am unable to login to my eTrade account unless I remove cache.  The URL for the site is <a href=""https://us.etrade.com/home/welcome-back"" rel=""nofollow"">https://us.etrade.com/home/welcome-back</a>.  When I first click it, a tab pops up which is labeled <em><strong>Investing, Trading and Retirement</strong></em> with a dot on that tab that continues moving left to right to indicate it's trying to bring up the login page.  It never times out.  I noticed while it's doing that, there is verbiage down on the bottom left corner of the screen that says ""Read <a href=""http://c.evidon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">c.evidon.com</a>"" which never goes away.  If I go to Firefox settings and delete cache, the login screen will pop up after I restart Firefox.  So I can end up logging in, but once I logout of eTrade and try to come back in, the same problem occurs.  Never had this issue before but now is somewhat of a pain every time I need to get to my eTrade account.  I also have Brave on my laptop and I don't have that issue when using it. </p>",firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",rossfrank1

The resource consumption is a big problem when a few tabs are needed to support research projects.  How about spending more time improving the resource utilization as opposed to developing features? The resource utilization of Firefox is poor when compared to other browsers like Brave.  However, I like Firefox the best from a features standpoint. So how about it?  Please put some effort into making Firefox more resource friendly.  One way to get free improvement is to immediately release resources for objects that are orphaned because the associated application has been closed.  Lingering resources are a complete waste. </p><p>Thanks, Dan </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",14arevelation

I thought it might adapt to the most recent or most often selected folder; however, it seems to present the same ""default"" location every time I bookmark a tab - a folder I have not barely used in months. I realize I can select another folder, but it is annoying for it to select the LEAST used and my personal least favorite folder EVERY TIME, for MONTHS.  </p><p>1) Is there a way to select which folder it preloads to save bookmarks to?  2) Why is it selecting THAT folder?  3) If there is no way to set a folder, is there a way to reset it or something? ANY other folder to default to would be less annoying. I do not understand why it seems ""stuck"" on this folder and will not preload ANY other folder from the dozens of folders.  </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help! </p>",settings;firefox;firefox-1300;,firefox,settings,en-US,1672968;,ameliajaycen
