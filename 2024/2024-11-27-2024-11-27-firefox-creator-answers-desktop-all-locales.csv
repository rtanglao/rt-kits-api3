The thing is: - I haven't changed/updated or done anything like that to my password since Account creation so date should be different &amp; earlier - before my OS reinstall and signing in again to Account on fresh Firefox, I've logged out, cleaned my whole history, data etc. - so there should not be any leftovers like cookies on either side (mine or Mozilla's servers) that could cause potential issue- I guess?  - sign out from Account, OS reinstall date and new sign in to firefox are also different days than 26th October  - Recent account activity logs - all seems right, nothing alarming - Connected services/devices - all correct - all confirmation emails from Mozilla - everything ok So as you can see there is no suspicious activity...besides that date change. Since account creation I haven't noticed any weird behavior in my computer/software/firefox/mozilla profile too. Regarding that date - 10/26/2024 - on that day I was just regularly browsing web and logged in to my Pocket account - nothing exceptional, no settings change made or anything, Pocket account existed before that day and was active -so rather no important,worth commemorating by Mozilla activity, I presume? Logs/ confirmation emails agree with that.  </p><p>I have to admit , I've already contacted support team but their answer still lefts me, sort of, unsatisfied... They have not found any issues regarding my password and account and indicated that it may be kind of <em>update</em> sent by Pocket during logging in on that day, or 'cookies/site data issue', nothing scary overall. Well... but then why Pocket has not overwritten this creation date again during my later sign-ins in the following days?  Have anyone experienced situation like this?  Is it a bug?Paranormal manifestation of sloppy coding? A feature from Mozilla so users can keep their blood pressure a bit higher? Symptoms of my account being compromised? Maybe there was some big update on Mozilla servers/services that could cause aforementioned change, that day -26th October, anyone knows? Am I missing something, like my own, user errors? Perhaps I'm overthinking and this is trivial issue, but I find it a bit confusing and can imagine that it can be puzzling for even more technically skilled users than me.   I would be very grateful for any probable explanations or experiences from you, dear Mozilla users. Thank you! Cheers. </p>",firefox;accounts;,firefox,accounts,en-US,"",str8bananas

I had all my profiles created in <strong>about:profiles</strong> and I had <strong>browser.profiles.enabled</strong> set to true. This allowed me to easily switch between profiles by pressing the hamburger button in the top right. However, it is no longer appears for me after the latest Firefox update. I'm not exactly sure if I'm missing something, or if this was intended as I know the profile switcher was a work in progress feature.  </p><p>This <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1c6hddu/firefox_profiles_are_being_worked_on/"" rel=""nofollow"">reddit post</a> shows what the feature looked like.
