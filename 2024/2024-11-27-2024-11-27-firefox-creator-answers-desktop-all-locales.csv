However, the X button that lets me close the tabs only seem to appear next to tabs open on my other computers that also run Firefox 132, while my computers that run the 128 ESR version don't show the X button next to their open tabs. </p><p>Is this because the close synced tabs feature was implemented after version 128, or is it blocked for some reason due to the nature of the ESR version? Or am I just doing something wrong with the sync settings on my ESR versions? </p><p>I've tried looking up the release notes and also asked Perplexity to try to figure it out, but all attempts failed to find the reason and a fix&nbsp;:( </p><p>Thanks! </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",JY

Je dois scroller jusqu'en milieu de page pour obtenir des sujets de réponses qui correspondent à ma requête. Ce comportement semble être récent peut être du à une mise à jour du navigateur? Ou bien à un paramètre que j'ai modifié par inadvertance? Si vous savez la cause de ce comportement, je serai ravi d'en connaitre la solution. Merci pour l'aide. </p><p>Hello, For the past few days, when the results for a search are displayed, I always find myself with dozens of results with advertisements. I have to scroll all the way to the middle of the page to get the results that match my query. This behavior seems to be recent, perhaps due to a browser update? Or a parameter I've inadvertently changed? If you know the cause of this behavior, I'd love to know the solution.

I had all my profiles created in <strong>about:profiles</strong> and I had <strong>browser.profiles.enabled</strong> set to true. This allowed me to easily switch between profiles by pressing the hamburger button in the top right. However, it is no longer appears for me after the latest Firefox update. I'm not exactly sure if I'm missing something, or if this was intended as I know the profile switcher was a work in progress feature.  </p><p>This <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1c6hddu/firefox_profiles_are_being_worked_on/"" rel=""nofollow"">reddit post</a> shows what the feature looked like. I will also attach the images. </p><p>If anyone would know why this no longer appears to be working, or how to fix it I would greatly appreciate it. I know I can just use <strong>about:profiles</strong> or some other alternative, but I found this to be the most convenient. </p>",settings;firefox;windows-11;firefox-1330;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",omrr
