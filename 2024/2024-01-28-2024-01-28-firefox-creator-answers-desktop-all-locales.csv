It's either muted or full blast and I'd like to know how to bring back the little slider. I've tried what people posted on Reddit and neither the extension or the Tampermonkey script did anything. I don't know what else I can do. </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1220;,firefox,other,en-US,"",thesongdeer

When I click the login button, a new page is shown with my Mozilla account email, picture, and a sign in button. After clicking ""Sign in"" I expect a page to appear to input my authenticator code, but instead what appears is the window in the attached partial screen shot. Any ideas? Thanks! </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1220;,firefox,other,en-US,"",cjwinchell
