I could not log back in even though I used the correct email address and changed my password twice.  I can log in on other browsers using my latest password.  I called the Times and the person with whom I spoke, after trying to get me logged in, finally said that this is a known problem with Firefox.  He did not have any idea about the cause or what I could do; he simply told me to use another browser.  I use Firefox for almost everything and this is, to say the least, an inconvenience--for instance, if the Times sends me a link to an article by Thunderbird (which is my email program), I can't read the article but have to find it on another browser.  Are you aware of this problem?  Do you have any suggestions for how I might log in despite it?  Do you know the cause of the problem and whether Mozilla is trying to fix it? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1270;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",rdbulkley
