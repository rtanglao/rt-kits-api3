I recently switched from the snap ubuntu package to using the firefox APT package. However, I've noticed this really weird issue. Whenever I download a file, it always seems to have the ""file://"" link or mime type. </p><p>Say for example I download an mp4 video, trying to open it via firefox results in a dialog asking me to ""select which application i want to open this file link in"" </p><p>I have tried refreshing firefox, and tried completely removing it from my operating system (a search of my entirety of / showed no traces of anything relating to firefox), but even after a clean install, the issue persisted. </p><p>The only way I found that can fix this issue is by using firefox nightly, or using the firefox flatpak. And I'd prefer to not use either. </p><p>I was monitoring the browser console, and upon clicking on the file in the downloads list, It seems that firefox gets this error: </p><p>Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: defaultButton is undefined </p><pre>   _setInitialFocusIfNeeded chrome://global/content/elements/dialog.js:318    _postLoadInit chrome://global/content/elements/dialog.js:332    connectedCallback chrome://global/content/elements/dialog.js:149 </pre> <p>dialog.js:318:9 </p><p>This error does not occur on firefox nightly. </p><p>I believe I have troubleshooted this as much as possible on my end, and I'm unsure of what to do about this. Could I please get a bit of help? </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1270;,firefox,other,en-US,"",smallketchup82

Like 20-30 seconds. </p><p>Strangely enough, this only applies to keyboard inputs. I can change my tab with my mouse, I can click on things, no issues there. But any keyboard interaction is hugely delayed. </p><p>This does not fix itself until I close my browser and restart it. Closing the browser is always broken here too, if I close the browser with the [X] exit button, I then need to kill the process because it just hangs. It blanks out the contents of each tab like it's preparing to close them, but it just doesn't ever complete the task without a manual kill. </p><p>CPU usage and memory usage are relatively low; significantly below my system's limits. </p><p>I've already tried <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/accessibility-services#w_how-do-i-disable-firefox-accessibility-service"" rel=""nofollow"">this suggested fix</a>, to no avail. </p><p>The frequency of this is only about once a week at most, usually once a month, so it's not a huge issue, but I'm just worried about this occurring during a critical meeting or something later. Having this impending restart needed is kind of worrying for critical usage times. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1270;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",iliesi.amiel

I could not log back in even though I used the correct email address and changed my password twice.  I can log in on other browsers using my latest password.  I called the Times and the person with whom I spoke, after trying to get me logged in, finally said that this is a known problem with Firefox.  He did not have any idea about the cause or what I could do; he simply told me to use another browser.  I use Firefox for almost everything and this is, to say the least, an inconvenience--for instance, if the Times sends me a link to an article by Thunderbird (which is my email program), I can't read the article but have to find it on another browser.  Are you aware of this problem?  Do you have any suggestions for how I might log in despite it?  Do you know the cause of the problem and whether Mozilla is trying to fix it? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1270;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1657374;,rdbulkley
