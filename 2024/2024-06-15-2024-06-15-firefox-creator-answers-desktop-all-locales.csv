With the latest update (mandatory because this is a work-administered) laptop, the new behavior is that tabs are changed.  </p><p>I want any solution to revert this to standard (past) behavior (preferably not an extension). Looked around in about:config but could not find anything to toggle on/off.  </p><p>This is highly annoying as I've had this workflow for literally years. Even opening this ticket I encountered the issue more than 3 times as I was phrasing the message and had to delete &amp; rewrite some stuff while also have other tabs open in the same Firefox window. </p><p>Would highly appreciate your timely response! </p><p>Thanks a lot! -- John </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1270;,firefox,customize,en-US,1657437;1657438;1657439;1657441;,ionut_mntn

Like 20-30 seconds. </p><p>Strangely enough, this only applies to keyboard inputs. I can change my tab with my mouse, I can click on things, no issues there. But any keyboard interaction is hugely delayed. </p><p>This does not fix itself until I close my browser and restart it. Closing the browser is always broken here too, if I close the browser with the [X] exit button, I then need to kill the process because it just hangs. It blanks out the contents of each tab like it's preparing to close them, but it just doesn't ever complete the task without a manual kill. </p><p>CPU usage and memory usage are relatively low; significantly below my system's limits. </p><p>I've already tried <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/accessibility-services#w_how-do-i-disable-firefox-accessibility-service"" rel=""nofollow"">this suggested fix</a>, to no avail. </p><p>The frequency of this is only about once a week at most, usually once a month, so it's not a huge issue, but I'm just worried about this occurring during a critical meeting or something later.

I could not log back in even though I used the correct email address and changed my password twice.  I can log in on other browsers using my latest password.  I called the Times and the person with whom I spoke, after trying to get me logged in, finally said that this is a known problem with Firefox.  He did not have any idea about the cause or what I could do; he simply told me to use another browser.  I use Firefox for almost everything and this is, to say the least, an inconvenience--for instance, if the Times sends me a link to an article by Thunderbird (which is my email program), I can't read the article but have to find it on another browser.  Are you aware of this problem?  Do you have any suggestions for how I might log in despite it?  Do you know the cause of the problem and whether Mozilla is trying to fix it? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1270;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1657374;,rdbulkley
