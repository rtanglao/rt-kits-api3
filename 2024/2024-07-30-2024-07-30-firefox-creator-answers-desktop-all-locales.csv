Typically, I open a Firefox window with multiple tabs and leave the window open all day. I always have Gmail and Google Calendar open in tabs. What happens is that the Gmail tab will at some point give me a message that it cannot connect and has timed out and is trying to reload, but it never reloads, it just stalls. Then I try to open a Google search bookmark to search and the tab remains blank. This happens multiple times throughout the day. Meanwhile I can open Gmail or any Google page in Chrome, which I don't like using.  </p><p>Sometimes I can close out the Gmail tab that won't load and try to open Gmail in a new tab, but that stalls out too. The only way I can open Gmail again is to close out the Firefox window completely and then relaunch it, then it can open Gmail or Google... until it breaks again. </p><p>This never used to happen. I'm using the latest versions of Windows 10 and Firefox on my desktop PC. Nothing else has changed. </p><p>Please help me fix this, it's very annoying. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1280;firefox-12803;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ferrarapan
