Up until yesterday, the current problem was never experienced. Yesterday, all I remember doing is starting Firefox. I don’t recall downloading anything. I don’t even recall browsing. </p><p>My first remembered action was that: Event 1.  I typed a short search key [plain text, nothing weird] into the Firefox address bar. Then I clicked to go to the link address. Nothing happened. The plain text did change to a Google search format. e.g. If I typed in {Find This} then hitting carriage return changed it to {<a href=""https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=Find+This"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=Find+This</a>}. But NOTHING else happened. </p><p>Event 2. I then went specifically to the New Tab page and tried the same thing with the same null result. Next, I clicked on one of the shortcuts stored on the New Tab Page. It took me to the linked page with no issue. From there I entered the search key into the address bar and now it worked without any problem!  It doesn't matter which shortcut I use, search from the Address Bar always works if done after using a shortcut. </p><p>Event 3. But it didn’t stay that way. Later on, when I tried to search again Firefox had reverted to what’s described in Event 1.  Every time I restart Firefox, when I make the first attempt to use the address bar, Event 1 occurs. Any time I use a saved short cut on the New Tab page, search fro the Address Bar works immediately after. </p><p>Next I searched the web for similar behaviour to Event 1.  I found <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1323170"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1323170</a> It describes checking preferences in about:config &gt; keyw &gt; keyword.enabled  I checked and keyword.enabled preference is bold and has a value of true, which is supposedly correct. </p><p>Next I did a virus scan. No malware found. </p><p>The only thing I could think to try next was to replace Firefox with a fresh install. I’ve generally re-installed apps for years but, as I’m not a professional techy and each app can be different, I asked for help on reinstalling Firefox. I believe I checked in a Mozilla web page. The instruction said, to save existing settings and data, do NOT uninstall or delete Firefox, just install the newest version and Firefox will take care of things. </p><p>It didn’t!  The install did succeed in installing a working Firefox app. However, it did NOT overwrite the existing Firefox app retaining my settings and data. Instead, it created a second Firefox app, the identical version number to the first, but with just default settings and no data, i.e a “factory fresh” install. </p><p>I then tried to uninstall Firefox, obviously trying to get rid of JUST THE NEW VERSION.  I went via START&gt;APPS.  IN the START menu, there were 2 Firefox icons and one had yesterday’s date on it as the install date. I checked and it did open the new version. The other icon did open the old version [the one I need]. So I selected DELETE for the NEW icon and it took me to the APPS window where JUST ONE Firefox icon existed. I used it’s menu to delete Firefox. It deleted the old install, the one I need.GRRRRRRRR. </p><p>Luckily, I had just created a restore point so I will regress to what I had. But that will leave me with 2 Firefox installs, one with my settings and data but an unreliable address bar and the other with a working address bar and factory fresh data but no data, UGH. And, there will be no obvious way to delete the new install, I can only delete the old install that I need. </p><p>Thus, solutions needed A] How do I delete the NEW factory fresh install? B] How do I repair the address bar in my old install OR overwrite that install with a new one that uses my settings and retains my data? OR C]  How  do I somehow cause the NEW factory fresh install to acquire all my settings and data from the OLD install? </p><p>If you got this far, thanks for your patience and thanks for any advice of how to resolve this. </p>",desktop;troubleshooting;windows-11;firefox-1280;firefox-12803;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",paulindr

With the proliferation of mobile applications, downloading APKs (Android Package Kits) for video editing tools is increasingly common. However, ensuring privacy and security while downloading these APKs is essential, especially for Firefox users who value a secure browsing experience. </p><p>Understanding the Risks When downloading APKs from the internet, especially for video editing, there are several risks to be aware of. These include the potential for malware, which can compromise your device and data, and the possibility of downloading tampered or fake versions of the app. Such risks are heightened when APKs are sourced from unofficial websites or third-party providers. According to a study by Symantec, nearly one in five APKs from third-party sources were found to contain malware. </p><p>Safe Downloading Practices Use Trusted Sources: Always download APKs from reputable sources. The Google Play Store is the safest option, but if you need to use third-party sites, ensure they are well-known and have positive user reviews. Websites like APKMirror and APKPure are popular and trusted among many users. </p><p>Check Permissions: Before downloading, check the permissions the APK requests. If a video editing app asks for permissions unrelated to its function, such as access to contacts or messages, this could be a red flag. </p><p>Verify the APK File: Use tools like VirusTotal to scan the APK file for malware before installation. This extra step can help identify any potential threats. </p><p>Enable Security Settings: Ensure that your device’s security settings are enabled. For example, keep the option to install apps from unknown sources disabled unless absolutely necessary. Additionally, use a reliable antivirus app on your device. </p><p>Firefox Security Features Firefox offers several features that can enhance your security when downloading APKs: </p><p>Enhanced Tracking Protection: This feature blocks trackers that follow you across websites, providing an additional layer of privacy. HTTPS-Only Mode: Enabling this ensures that all connections to websites are secure, reducing the risk of data interception. Add-ons for Security: Utilize add-ons like NoScript to block potentially malicious scripts and uBlock Origin to prevent unwanted ads and trackers. Recommending Reliable Video Editors When it comes to choosing a video editor, selecting a reliable and well-reviewed application is crucial. One highly recommended option is VN Video Editor. Known for its user-friendly interface and robust features, VN Video Editor offers a great balance between functionality and ease of use. Remember to <a href=""https://vnapkapp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">download it from trusted sources</a> to avoid any security issues. </p><p>Staying Updated and Informed Keeping your apps and security tools up to date is another critical aspect of maintaining security. Developers regularly release updates that fix security vulnerabilities, so ensuring you have the latest versions installed is essential. Additionally, staying informed about the latest security threats and best practices can help you navigate the digital landscape safely. </p><p>Conclusion By following these guidelines, Firefox users can significantly reduce the risks associated with downloading video editing APKs. Prioritizing security and privacy ensures a safer browsing experience and protects your personal information and devices from potential threats. Whether you are a seasoned video editor or just starting, maintaining these practices will allow you to enjoy the benefits of mobile video editing while staying secure. </p>","",firefox,protect-your-privacy,en-US,"",usamaghaffar250
