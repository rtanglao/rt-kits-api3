If this was an intentional decision, it should have been noted in the update/change logs in preview of the IOS app store.

Specifically, the file names are the same, only for some pages they create them uniquely as it was before. I am sending an example of a name (Screenshot 2024-06-17 a[...]) that is the same for different screenshots and therefore I always have to rename it. Before the update, this never happened, each screenshot had a unique file name, so it was saved without the need to enter a file name. </p><p>I use this feature very often and i find it very annoying to create file name and it is very impractical and time consuming. Can it be set somewhere? Or what should I do. I really like this function of firefox and I don't use another browser because of it. I don't even plan to, because I think it's the best browser and has a lot of great features. This is one of them and I'm really disappointed that it got worse with the update. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1270;,firefox,other,en-US,"",evaondrejkova137

It gave me the option to create a new profile or Exit when starting it. So eventually I went for creating a new profile and now my old one seems lost. This is not what I wanted. </p><p>When using my shortcut on the taskbar, which I've used for years, it suddenly complained I was using an old version of Firefox. This has not happened for me in decades. I've lived with the Firefox installation on this computer for a very long time and it has smoothly upgraded in the background until now. So what is going on now with this upgrade? Is it a major new version of Firefox that doesn't migrate a current profile? </p><p>rgds Christian </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Christian_Martin_Eriksson
