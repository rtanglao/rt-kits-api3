When I signed into my Firefox account, all my bookmarks showed up but none of my tabs were loaded. I figured out how to load my tabs up from my previous session but all my bookmarks then deleted. I tried to re-sync but none of the tabs showed up. When I try to restore my bookmarks from the manage bookmarks library, it does not appear.

My primary monitor's resolution is 3440x1440, and my secondary is 3840x2160.  </p><p><br> The text on my Firefox toolbars and menus looks very clear on my secondary monitor (3840x2160), it looks as I would expect it to; however, on my primary monitor (3440x1440) it's smaller which makes it pixelated meaning it's much less clear. I've been using Firefox for about an hour and I'm already bugged enough to post here.  </p><p><br> Due to the different resolutions I need to keep the layout.css.devPixelsPerPx in about:config to the default -1.0 so the windows scale as per my Windows 11 settings. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1270;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",jenji.exe
