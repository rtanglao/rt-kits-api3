I saved the data and want to reinstall Win 7 and import previous Bookmarks data to new install of Moziilla Firefox.   </p><p>I transferred the sqlite file (s88qn337.default) from the previous install (now non working system) to the existing working Firefox directory (C:/Users/My Name/AppData/Roaming/Firefox/Profiles/xxx.default.  </p><p>I then renamed ""default.XXX.old"" (the previous install had only one file in the Profile directory - ie s88qn337.default) </p><p>When I try to open Mozilla Firefox, with the single file (s88qn337.default) in the Profile directory, I get the error ""Can't find user data"". </p><p>When I then open fresh install of Mozilla Firefox on working SSD (Win 7 Ultimate) and try to Import Bookmarks, the options are only ""Import Bookmarks from Explorer"" or ""Import from html file"". </p><p>How to resolve this problem, please? </p>",windows-7;desktop;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",pjcoomb

My primary monitor's resolution is 3440x1440, and my secondary is 3840x2160.  </p><p><br> The text on my Firefox toolbars and menus looks very clear on my secondary monitor (3840x2160), it looks as I would expect it to; however, on my primary monitor (3440x1440) it's smaller which makes it pixelated meaning it's much less clear. I've been using Firefox for about an hour and I'm already bugged enough to post here.  </p><p><br> Due to the different resolutions I need to keep the layout.css.devPixelsPerPx in about:config to the default -1.0 so the windows scale as per my Windows 11 settings. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1270;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",jenji.exe
