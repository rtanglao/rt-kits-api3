I often stream a video in one window while working in another. The other window has several tabs (email, news, ebay, amazon). Often when I switch from one tab to another, there is a 30-second delay while my hard drive activity goes up and the streaming video freezes. Sometimes it even cuts out and I have to reload it. I loaded system manager and it shows firefox using all the hard drive and/or cpu cycles. I switched to chrome and the problem went away. I have an Intel I7 cpu with an SSD and 16g of ram. </p><p>separate issue on another machine: On my work computer I dont stream video so I don't have this issue. However, I got notification about a month ago that there is a new version of firefox. Despite downloading and installing it 3 times, that notification still pops up several times a day. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",yisgood

Disabling hardware GPU acceleration seems to mitigate the issue however this is just a workaround. Modern browsers should work just fine with HW acceleration.  The issue does not happen with Chrome or MS Edge so this is clearly something Firefox specific.  </p><p>Is there a fix for it? </p>",firefox;browse;firefox-1310;firefox-13103;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",bogdan.rusu
