I had used about:config to disable the bookmark bar favicons as I have a visual aesthetic I enjoy on my computer. </p><p>Now in 2024, it seems that all of the settings I previously used are no longer functioning when toggling them to false within about:config. They were browser.chrome.favicon, and, browser.chrome.site_icons . </p><p>Doing searches, all I can find are tips and tricks from many versions ago, some dating all the way back to 2007. </p><p>Does anyone know how, in the current version of Fires, which at the time of this writing is 125.0.3 to remove the favicons? I have attached a pic of the look I am going for, which is the default globe icon, instead of the annoying favicon. I tried the userChrome.css trick, but it completely removed the globe icon as well. </p><p>I know there has to be a new setting in about:config that will work, I just can't seem to find it. </p><p>Any help would be most welcome! And thank you! </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",troycopes

I notice this on another PC that shares the same profile.  However one of my PCs doesn't take this long and it uses the same profile as well.  It also seems that the pinned tabs are not loading correctly because I get errors with those pages too. </p><p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/6IIyTJc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://imgur.com/a/6IIyTJc</a> </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",gsrgtrdg4565653

If you continue you risk losing personal data.  You can protect your data by signing out, then signing in again"".  So I signed out, then signed in again and the boot proceeded but it was like a brand new installation.  Desktop background was Windows blue, about half my desktop icons gone, all default apps reset, in Firefox all my plug-ins/extensions gone, all my bookmarks gone. And Windows Settings now won't let me set Firefox as the default browser and when FF offers to set itself as the default browser, that doesn't work either. </p><p>I've got the feeling this is some kind of identity issue gone awry but I don't know how to fix it.  Hoping someone on this forum recognizes the problem, and knows a solution.  Thanks for any help offered. </p>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",vimy100
