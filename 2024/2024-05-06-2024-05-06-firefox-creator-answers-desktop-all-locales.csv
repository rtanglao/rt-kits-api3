I've been browsing for - say - a couple of hours or so, I look at how much RAM I've got spare and it's down to about 2 gig.  So I close Firefox via Task Manager and all my RAM comes  back.  Then I REOPEN Firefox and all the old tabs are restored - but this time around, hardly using any memory! Which tells me the hewge memory munch was unnecessary the time before.   </p><p>Firefox has ALWAYS done this from day 1. Nobody's ever fixed it, through all these updates.  I've got the latest version and it's STILL memory-munching.  How do you stop it?  It's just annoying  because  you can be using other software that crashes because it runs out of memory, because Firefox has munched all its memory for no reason.   </p><p>This is just a question, I'm Asperger's, I sometimes sound like I'm asking a leading/angry question but I'm not. (Not this time anyway!)  Is there a workaround for this memory-munching problem, is it ever going to be fixed or is it too deeply embedded into Firefox's programming TO be fixed?  </p><p>Yours respectfully </p><p>Chris. </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",ulrichburke

I had used about:config to disable the bookmark bar favicons as I have a visual aesthetic I enjoy on my computer. </p><p>Now in 2024, it seems that all of the settings I previously used are no longer functioning when toggling them to false within about:config. They were browser.chrome.favicon, and, browser.chrome.site_icons . </p><p>Doing searches, all I can find are tips and tricks from many versions ago, some dating all the way back to 2007. </p><p>Does anyone know how, in the current version of Fires, which at the time of this writing is 125.0.3 to remove the favicons? I have attached a pic of the look I am going for, which is the default globe icon, instead of the annoying favicon. I tried the userChrome.css trick, but it completely removed the globe icon as well. </p><p>I know there has to be a new setting in about:config that will work, I just can't seem to find it. </p><p>Any help would be most welcome! And thank you! </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1651551;,troycopes

If you continue you risk losing personal data.  You can protect your data by signing out, then signing in again"".  So I signed out, then signed in again and the boot proceeded but it was like a brand new installation.  Desktop background was Windows blue, about half my desktop icons gone, all default apps reset, in Firefox all my plug-ins/extensions gone, all my bookmarks gone. And Windows Settings now won't let me set Firefox as the default browser and when FF offers to set itself as the default browser, that doesn't work either. </p><p>I've got the feeling this is some kind of identity issue gone awry but I don't know how to fix it.  Hoping someone on this forum recognizes the problem, and knows a solution.  Thanks for any help offered. </p>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",vimy100
