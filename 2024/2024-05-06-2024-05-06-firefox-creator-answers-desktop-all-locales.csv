""On screen keyboard"" works fine as does ""Touch keyboard"" in Edge and Chrome and all other Apps.  Since this is a recent occurrence,  and a lot of odd changes took place after the last FF update, I have reverted to Firefox 124, after this did not work also did a restore to last Restore Point from April.
