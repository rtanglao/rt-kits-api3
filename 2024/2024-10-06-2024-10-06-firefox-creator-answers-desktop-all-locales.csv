The effect of this is that ongoing downloads freeze and are resumed (sometimes fail) only after unlocking the screen. </p><p>Chromium, wget, etc., on the other hand appear unaffected and the download progresses during screen lock / vt-switch. </p><p>I do not remember when exactly this problem started, but could have been since a couple of years.  </p><p>This problem also occurs when running the latest firefox (downloaded tarball from mozilla site) and a blank profile. So it could be some interaction between firefox and the window manager / xsession. </p><p>My setup is a desktop computer connected via ethernet cable running XFCE on Debian. </p><p>How do I go about diagnosing / fixing the issue? </p><p>Thank you.
