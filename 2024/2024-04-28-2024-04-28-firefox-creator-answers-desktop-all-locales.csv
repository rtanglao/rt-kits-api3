I love Firefox, but I have an issue at the moment where I have one copy set up on my Mac, and it has two profiles.

I have two admin accounts on my Mac and an applications folder with Firefox in it. Then each of my Mac accounts has a version of Firefox with a different profile. </p><p>I'm about to do a clean install of macOS with the two admin accounts. I want to install Firefox correctly this time. How do I have two entirely separate copies of Firefox running on my Mac in the two admin accounts?
