Way more secure, efficient, and lighter than any other browser (IE, Chrome, and now Edge). Firefox is my first download on every new device and my go to even on my iPad.  </p><p>I've been getting this error message lately and I don't know what to make of it. My saved tabs are working normally (email, work, streaming entertainment). This automatically comes out on ever new start / re-start (Firefox is my default) on separate tab but I am not opening any new website. It's been 2-3 days. At first I didn't mind it but its consistently happening and not just a one time thing. I already cleared my cache data. I've also ran a scan and it's come up clean (I have a paid BitDefender subscription). It's also not the local ip of my machine.  </p><p>So any help would be great as I really don't want to leak any personal data or have any viruses.  </p><p>Thank you for your time! </p>",desktop;beta;other;windows-10;firefox-1250;,firefox,other,en-US,1649998;,leoandrewa

When I look at the collection of articles I've saved to Pocket (I've been using Pocket for years) in the browser, I only see 8 articles. But when I open Pocket on my iPhone and iPad, the list of articles I've saved is much more longer (an estimate would be between 50 and 75 articles saved to Pocket). I haven't found any articles in Mozilla support to help me solve this. Thanks </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1250;firefox-12502;,firefox,other,en-US,"",irosenblum
