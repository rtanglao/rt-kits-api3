There are help pages that say go to settings&gt;privacy&gt; and turn autofill on. But there is no autofill mentioned anywhere in that page. The only reference that autofill comes up with when typed in the search bar in settings is in import settings. How is this so difficult to enable, its basic functionality 10 years ago.  I've also tried going to extensions.formautofill.supportedCountries and extensions.formautofill.addresses.supportedCountries and adding my country (why this is a thing is bizarre as well). </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1260;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",p.harry

Here are details: </p><p>What is working: 1. I can go to google, amazon, yahoo, and certain other websites home page, and type certain queries in the google. </p><p>What is not working: 1. I can't load Duckduckgo(dot)com, nor ddg(dot)gg 2. Though I can open Google(dot)com, but I can not search anything in Google. I can see autocompleted/suggested results in Google, but nothing happens when I click on those autocompleted/suggested queries (screenshot attached, see lower left corner, *.gstatic.com/*.google.com is loading forever). 3. I can't open any addons/extensions. For eg. Tab Session Manager, or even Bitwarden does not load when I click on it, except it shows a pixel on the right corner of addon button on Firefox Toolbar (screenshot attached for that pixel towards the right lower corner of the icon). </p><p>What I have tried already - 1. Firefox is up to date as of a few minutes ago. 2. Underlying OS is up-to-date as of a few minutes ago. 3. I have tried disabling all addons and it did fix the problem. 4. I tried changing theme (which was default black) to default, and it did not fix the problem. 5. Tried restarting PC and it did not solve the problem. 6. I tried troubleshooting mode and it DID fix the problem while I was in troubleshooting mode, at least sites were loading. But as I exited troubleshooting mode, addons started loading for a few seconds, and then once Firefox is loaded fully, I started experiencing the same problem. 7. Tried toggle HTTP3 enable/disable, which did not fix the problem. 8. Followed Firefox troubleshooting guides, it did not solve the problem (except troubleshooting mode). I tried disabling hardware acceleration and disabled any protection modes, DNS over HTTPs and other settings which might interfere in site loading - none of that worked. </p><p>My hypothesis so far - As I can access some sites on the internet, I have ruled out DNS issues and networking issues. I tried disabling all addons and it did not fix the issue (except when in troubleshooting mode) - which tells me addons are not necessarily a problem. However, I could not find what all things troubleshooting mode disables, and perhaps I should find that out. Could anyone please share any insights or your thoughts on what I might be missing? Firefox is my primary browser and a lot of my tasks are pending from over a day now. Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks a lot! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1654943;,jac_apk
