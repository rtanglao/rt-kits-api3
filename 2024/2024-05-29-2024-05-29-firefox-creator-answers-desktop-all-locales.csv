This started after today's update. I've tried creating a new profile, troubleshooting mode, disabling hardware acceleration, disabling dark reader, changing the windows override settings to NEVER - NONE OF IT WORKED!! I'm getting really ticked-off by this crap! Didn't have this problem until the newest ""great"" update! </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",rogan.brendan
