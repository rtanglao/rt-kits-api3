Here are details: </p><p>What is working: 1. I can go to google, amazon, yahoo, and certain other websites home page, and type certain queries in the google. </p><p>What is not working: 1. I can't load Duckduckgo(dot)com, nor ddg(dot)gg 2. Though I can open Google(dot)com, but I can not search anything in Google. I can see autocompleted/suggested results in Google, but nothing happens when I click on those autocompleted/suggested queries (screenshot attached, see lower left corner, *.gstatic.com/*.google.com is loading forever). 3. I can't open any addons/extensions. For eg. Tab Session Manager, or even Bitwarden does not load when I click on it, except it shows a pixel on the right corner of addon button on Firefox Toolbar (screenshot attached for that pixel towards the right lower corner of the icon). </p><p>What I have tried already - 1. Firefox is up to date as of a few minutes ago. 2. Underlying OS is up-to-date as of a few minutes ago. 3. I have tried disabling all addons and it did fix the problem. 4. I tried changing theme (which was default black) to default, and it did not fix the problem. 5. Tried restarting PC and it did not solve the problem. 6. I tried troubleshooting mode and it DID fix the problem while I was in troubleshooting mode, at least sites were loading. But as I exited troubleshooting mode, addons started loading for a few seconds, and then once Firefox is loaded fully, I started experiencing the same problem. 7. Tried toggle HTTP3 enable/disable, which did not fix the problem. 8. Followed Firefox troubleshooting guides, it did not solve the problem (except troubleshooting mode). I tried disabling hardware acceleration and disabled any protection modes, DNS over HTTPs and other settings which might interfere in site loading - none of that worked. </p><p>My hypothesis so far - As I can access some sites on the internet, I have ruled out DNS issues and networking issues. I tried disabling all addons and it did not fix the issue (except when in troubleshooting mode) - which tells me addons are not necessarily a problem. However, I could not find what all things troubleshooting mode disables, and perhaps I should find that out. Could anyone please share any insights or your thoughts on what I might be missing? Firefox is my primary browser and a lot of my tasks are pending from over a day now. Any help is greatly appreciated! Thanks a lot! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1654943;,jac_apk
