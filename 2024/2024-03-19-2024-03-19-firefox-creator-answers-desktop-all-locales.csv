Recently Google introduced a Two-step security check and, when selected, a question was sent to the handset (which I use as a tether for two laptops) which always quickly appeared and quickly responded to my finger's touch. In the last couple of weeks the question is still asked but nothing comes through to the handset, or the standby handset.  For a test I then went through Google Chrome and that opens the Youtube History without any questions etc.   It seems to hint that Google are using the Two-step etc to keep out access over other Browsers.
