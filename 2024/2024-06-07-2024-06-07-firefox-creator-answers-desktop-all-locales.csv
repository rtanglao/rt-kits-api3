I thought freshly installing firefox would fix the issue and allow me to download but it didnt.   I also am tried to download an addon/extension, and that automatically fails to download.   How can i fix this? </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-11;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",Qtip_69

I just assumed this was either something outside of the browser or the website itself was broken. Today I just tested with several other websites and browsers and confirmed that Firefox seems to be the issue. Even in Troubleshooting Mode it was completely broken.  </p><p>L1, R1, R2, Triangle, Share, Options and the Left Stick seem to be the only things that function properly currently, with the DPad not doing anything and the rest of the face buttons/triggers hitting the wrong buttons. In the case of the right stick, L2 for some reason controls the vertical movement while the physical right stick still works horizontally. This controller works perfectly on the rest of my system, windows sees the proper buttons being pressed and games that support Dualsense work fine without any interference. </p><p>Below I have attached two images which show how the website I mentioned <em>used</em> to look, and the second image is how it looks now. I have a feeling some kind of update to Firefox's Gamepad API has broken this, somehow. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,other,en-US,"",sebedg
