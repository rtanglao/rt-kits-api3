Sometimes, I'll even dare say most of the time, when I browse YouTube on Firefox and enter a video - it loads fine (currently üò¢) but the thing that says what the browser is doing right now - I don't really know how it's called, sorry - keeps showing, and the only way for me to remove it when it's stuck is to refresh the page. It is a small yet annoying problem, and been persistent through Firefox's updates.

The precise setting is called ""Allow Firefox to"" ""Check for updates but let you choose to install them"" (screenshot attached). However, this setting is not honoured. Every month, the browser auto-updates and forces a browser restart for me to continue working (screenshot attached). For 126-&gt;127, there was in fact no notification to update and the update happened automatically in the background with a restart forced upon me. What's the point of having this setting if it's not going to be honoured? </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-11;firefox-1270;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",rovinbhandari

Firstly, it's tightly integrated with Firefox browser, ensuring seamless syncing of bookmarks, history, passwords, and tabs across devices. Unlike some competitors, Firefox Sync is open-source, enhancing transparency and trust. It prioritizes user privacy by encrypting synced data end-to-end, ensuring that Mozilla or any third party cannot access personal information. Additionally, it supports multiple platforms including desktop and mobile, catering to diverse user needs. Users also benefit from features like session restoration and easy setup, making Firefox Sync a robust choice for maintaining continuity and security across browsing sessions. </p>",desktop;sync;needsinfo;windows-10;,firefox,sync,en-US,1657238;,muhammadhamza.71180

The problem is a bit complicated and I could't find anything similar to it on the net, so I'll try to explain in details what happened. One day after opening the browser I noticed that it didn't launch(there was no window). After opening it again I saw that all of my previously opened tabs were gone. After that I closed Firefox and went to check the task manager. I found that Firefox was still running after closing it. I couldn't wrap my head around it and killed the programm. Then I opened it again and got the same results: first launch: no Firefox window(nothing on the taskbar either), secound launch: one empty tab. After that I opened a new tab in Firefox through task manager and my screen ""swiped right"", I got access to Firefox window with all of my previous tabs, but all the other programms I had opened on the taskbar were gone. Somehow Firefox opens outside my screen on a ""separate one"" every first time I launch the app, and the only way to switch between ""screens"" is to open a new tab through task manager or launch a program that was previously active to switch back to previous ""screen"". It is also impossible to switch between opened windows on different ""screens"" using gestures on the touchpad or ""Alt"" + ""Tab"". I use a laptop and never even tried to attach/connect a second monitor. I don't have another monitor attached via bluetooth or any other means in device manager. I have the latest verion of windows 10 installed and updated. I have another PC, where I use the same Firefox with the same addons on the same Mozilla account, which has no such issues. I have tried renaming the file called ""xulstore.json"" to ""xulstore.old"" or deleting it entirely, this didn't resolve the issue. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1260;,firefox,other,en-US,"",nab.layk
