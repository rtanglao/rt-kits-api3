The switch is also the access point to the internet ""modem"". </p><p>I would like to cause the PCs to use wifi to access the modem ONLY for internet and Thunderbird, with the workgroup remaining on the wired system. </p><p>With both ""networks"" enabled in W10 the PCs are automatically defaulting to whichever method was enabled 1st. I have no idea how or if I can ""split"" the flow and cause FF and Tbird ONLY to use wifi. </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",alitkowiak

I am considering replacing it with a new Macbook Air.  My files are backed up with Carbonite.  Will I be able to get my saved passwords back by restoring my Firefox profile to the proper folder on the Mac?  (I already know that Carbonite's backup program will not do a ""file restore"" between Mac and Windows; I will likely be paying Carbonite an extra $100 so they can put my files on an external drive and ship i to me.) | (I have a lot of the passwords saved in Safari on my iPhone and old iPad mini 2, but there are some I did not want to save on the mobile devices.  They are also not on the much older Windows laptop I am currently using.  Therefore, I cannot access certain sites right now unless I am willing to change the passwords.) </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ajpeavler
