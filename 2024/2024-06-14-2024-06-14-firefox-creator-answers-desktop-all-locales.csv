The problem is a bit complicated and I could't find anything similar to it on the net, so I'll try to explain in details what happened. One day after opening the browser I noticed that it didn't launch(there was no window). After opening it again I saw that all of my previously opened tabs were gone. After that I closed Firefox and went to check the task manager. I found that Firefox was still running after closing it. I couldn't wrap my head around it and killed the programm. Then I opened it again and got the same results: first launch: no Firefox window(nothing on the taskbar either), secound launch: one empty tab. After that I opened a new tab in Firefox through task manager and my screen ""swiped right"", I got access to Firefox window with all of my previous tabs, but all the other programms I had opened on the taskbar were gone. Somehow Firefox opens outside my screen on a ""separate one"" every first time I launch the app, and the only way to switch between ""screens"" is to open a new tab through task manager or launch a program that was previously active to switch back to previous ""screen"". It is also impossible to switch between opened windows on different ""screens"" using gestures on the touchpad or ""Alt"" + ""Tab"". I use a laptop and never even tried to attach/connect a second monitor. I don't have another monitor attached via bluetooth or any other means in device manager. I have the latest verion of windows 10 installed and updated. I have another PC, where I use the same Firefox with the same addons on the same Mozilla account, which has no such issues. I have tried renaming the file called ""xulstore.json"" to ""xulstore.old"" or deleting it entirely, this didn't resolve the issue. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1260;,firefox,other,en-US,1657268;,nab.layk
