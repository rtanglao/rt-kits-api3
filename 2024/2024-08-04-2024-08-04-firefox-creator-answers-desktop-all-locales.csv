While this is happening trying to close firefox will cause the os and firefox to crash. trying to open firefox settings will cause firefox to crash.Trying to restart wont do anything since the os(win10) seams to wait for writes to disk to finish before shutting down. I tried to download something overnight and woke up to this issue so it will never finish downloading/writing the file to disk. Only fix is to hard shutdown(hold power button) then delete the file and parts file before lauching firefox and cancelling the download imediately when it tries to download it again. While this is happening the disk its trying to write the file to will show 100% usage and 0 read and write speed. I doubt this is a firefox issue and probably something on my end but any workarounds or insight into how firefox writes files to disk will help me figure out whats wrong. sorry about the scuffed image but I cant save a screenshot while this is happening. </p>,desktop;windows-10;troubleshooting;firefox-1280;firefox-12803;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",rattlesnake112

I am attempting to update the saved address and credit cards on my profile. Using the web browser, I can navigate to settings and see my saved passwords but there is no option to view or edit my saved addresses. The only result shown when I search for addresses is the sync option to change if I am syncing that across my devices but not to change or view it or my saved credit cards for that matter. I am currently on 128.0.3 on my computer. I also have tried to update the address and credit cards on my phone app where I am able to access the saved information and at least see it but there is no option to edit. Tapping or swiping on the addresses do nothing. Pressing and holding will highlight the addresses but nothing will happen. Please help me use this product. I have been on firefox for 10+ years and have enjoyed the offerings but am incredibly frustrated not being able to see or edit my information. Thank you </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1280;customize-settings-and-preferences;firefox-12803;,firefox,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",coadster7
