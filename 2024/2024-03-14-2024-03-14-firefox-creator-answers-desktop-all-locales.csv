I tried to contact ""Support"" but there is only a Support Forum and nobody else has posted this as an issue that I was able to find when I searched. So no support is offered.  The website suggests that I create an account to be able to post a new issue. However, Every time I have tried to set up a <a href=""http://github.com"" rel=""nofollow"">github.com</a> account, I am Unable to do so. The page to set up an account either doesn't load OR if it loads, I can not add any information to it. I am a VDH Registered User and until this morning, the current VDH app I am using, version 8.2.1.1 was working just fine. But now when I try to use it, it says that my VDH Companion App needs to be updated. But I can not even download it  to update it. I am running the current version of FF, 123.0.1 on an iMac with Sonoma OS 14.4.  We used to be able to email Mig but not anymore. The <a href=""http://github.com"" rel=""nofollow"">github.com</a> support page is unwieldy at best and I see that numerous requests for help or support have not been answered or even acknowledged. I am a paid Registered user with a license, but that doesn't seem to matter. I, like many others from what I read online, count on using this app almost every day and I would think that the mechanism for updates should be working correctly. The update files I tried to download came across at crazy low speeds, like 20.1 to 40.5 Kbps!  I spent over an hour with Tech Support for HughesNet and much to my chagrin, No Other Websites had any issues with download speed. It was only happening on the <a href=""http://github.com"" rel=""nofollow"">github.com</a> website and this one file update.

I've been using firefox for decades but I just installed chrome, and I desperately DO NOT want to use chrome but firefox is unstable.  It freezes and I have to open task manager to try to close it and there are dozens of firefox tasks running.   </p><p>Before you ask: this is a new laptop, windows 11 is updated, all the drivers, etc are updated too.  I do not use extensions. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1642172;1642176;1642178;1642180;1642191;,incognimaus
