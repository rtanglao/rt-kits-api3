I think I can also use them to set font-weight. </p><p>But I want body text to be good and readable, and I still want bold text and header text to stand out. So I don't want to set *everything* to font-weight 500. So is there a way to set a range from 500 to 900, or a minimum of 500 but leave bolder fonts unaffected, or set everything which wasn't already bold to 500, and anything that was to 700? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1230;firefox-12301;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",MarjaE

Not even porn videos. nothing. i don't remember installing any new software and Chrome plays youtrube sounds just fine. I listen on headphones and when i unjack, i still can only hear Chrome's browser play sounds. It seems like its not my comp, its the browser itself and it's only happened recently. i have yet to uninstall the browser and re-install, but i think if i use the Mozilla backup program to save my bookmarks, it will save whatever setting is causing the problem as well and re-installing will get me nowhere. anyone have any clue? i'm sure it's something simple but i cant figure it out </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1230;firefox-12301;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",judgeraye
