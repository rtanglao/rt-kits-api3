As in, if the window focus is on Firefox window A and I try to drag a tab from Firefox window B to window A, I have to click first the window. I can't just intuitively drag the tab from a non-active window, because it will get ignored. It will just activate the window, ignoring the drag. </p><p>Firefox for Linux, running on Nobara KDE latest desktop.

Is there a simple way to turn off all the security stuff so I don't have to waste hours trying to find a solution? Is there a simple way to ask a question to get a meaningful answer without all the flak that means nothing to an average user? Does anyone at Firefox care about the average guy trying use his browser without unnecessary security lockdowns? If anyone can answer yes to these questions, perhaps you can give me a dumbed down version of the simplified questions.

Why does firefox just put one there instead of just an arcane hours long wild goose chase to look for non-solutions.  Yeah, I am frustrated over unilateral browser lockdowns. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1230;firefox-12301;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1642260;,nijoani

Given the importance of online security and compatibility in today's business environment, I have a few questions: </p><p>How can I optimize Firefox settings to ensure maximum security and privacy for my business's online activities, considering the specific cyber threats in the Dubai market? Are there any Firefox extensions or add-ons that are particularly useful for business users in Dubai, such as for productivity, collaboration, or website compatibility? Can Firefox be seamlessly integrated with other business tools and platforms commonly used in Dubai, such as CRM systems, cloud storage services, and communication apps? Any tips or best practices for managing browser settings and extensions across multiple devices and users in a business setting to maintain consistency and efficiency? I appreciate any insights or experiences you can share to help me make the most of Firefox for my business in Dubai.

The latest automatic update does not display pages correctly in normal mode, but does work correctly on Safe Mode.  <a href=""http://Snap.io"" rel=""nofollow"">Snap.io</a> lists only the latest version of Firefox so I was unable to ask snap to revert to the previous release (prior to 5 Mar 24) and by the time I had tried to investigate the previous version was no longer cached. I did not see a way to force a fresh download of firefox from the latest channel on <a href=""http://snap.io"" rel=""nofollow"">snap.io</a>. </p><p>I tried the snap beta channel for v124, but that exhibited the same problems. </p><p>I tried adding a symbolic link to colors.css after seeing firefox complaining that it could not be found when started from the command line.
