Most settings are default, but I wanted to include the settings in case this could be the problem: - I've turned off Firefox home content - I've turned off all passwords and autofill features - Never Remember History - Do Not Track and Tell Websites not to share/sell my data are turned on - I left the standard-level security settings as is </p><p>I have one extension installed. </p><p>The only other browser I have installed is Safari and I am not having these issues. I should add that I don't receive any error messages when this happens, it just freezes. The most recent issue is that I was clicking on buttons on a website and it wasn't working, but when I started using the Safari browser (which also set to private mode) it worked fine. </p><p>When it works I love Firefox and would like to keep using it.
