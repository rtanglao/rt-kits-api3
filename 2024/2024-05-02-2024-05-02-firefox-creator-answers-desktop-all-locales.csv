It works in Chrome, Opera, and Edge with no issues, it will either just go to a check mark or open the window with the pictures to choose, on both regular pages and on the <a href=""https://google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo"" rel=""nofollow"">Google Recaptcha Demo site</a> Google Recaptcha Demo site. But when I load a page that requires Recaptcha in Firefox, it just spins forever. It was working fine a few hours ago, and I didn't change any settings or anything in Firefox. I was filling out a job application and it worked fine, then I went to another job application and Recaptcha won't work at all, even on the Recaptcha Demo site.  </p><p>I'm on version 125.0.3 (64-bit), on Windows 10. Not using a VPN or anything like that, just a standard Ethernet connection, with whatever Charter gives me. </p><p>Steps I've tried, none of which have helped: </p><p>1. Cleared Cookies. 2. Restart Browser. 3. Restart Computer. 4. Restart Modem and Router. 5. Opening Firefox in troubleshooting mode. 6. Ensured Firefox was up to date. 7. Reinstalling Firefox. 8. Turned Connection Settings to no proxy. 9. Turned off Enhanced Tracking Protection. (It's set on standard otherwise, and I didn't change it) 10. Release/Renew IP via Command Prompt.  </p><p>I'm genuinely at a loss of what to do, after a couple of hours of searching around for solutions. I don't get how it just stopped working in the span of like ten minutes when I didn't change any settings or anything. Firefox is my main browser and it would be a tremendous pain to have to use another browser for any pages that require Recaptcha.  </p><p>Any assistance or advice to solve this problem would be greatly appreciated! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,other,en-US,"",coolman50002001

To watch a video I right click on it and select ""open link in new window"". If I just click on the video to watch it, the main page may reload when I click on the back arrow and some of the videos I was interested in are no longer displayed. Sometimes my touchpad doesn't recognize the right click and opens the video in the current window. After it starts playing, if I click the back arrow, the video returns to the previous page (which may be reloaded), and sometimes the audio from the video keeps playing, so I have audio for a video that is no longer visible. When this happens, if I click on another video, the audio from both are played. Today I had the same thing happen when I was streaming a TV program from the Spectrum website. </p><p>1. If I click on a YouTube video from the main page, should the main page be rebuilt when I click on the back arrow? 2. How do I resolve the audio continuing to play problem? i don't know if this is a Firefox problem but I have no idea where to start to fix it. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",taherte
