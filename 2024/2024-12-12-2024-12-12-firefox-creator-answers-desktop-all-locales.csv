I recently received a warning by Firefox that as of March 14, 2025 Firefox will end support for Windows 8 (8.1 and below too) and that the last version <em>compatible</em> with Windows 8 is Firefox 115ESR (up to which? Before in Settings Firefox wanted to update from 115.0.3 to 115.0.3ESR now it says 115.1ESR - is this still ok for Windows 8? Are all 115 versions ok or not? Please help because I'm not a computer person, at all, with far too many gaps). Also, what happens after March 14, 2025? Will I be able to keep using Firefox 115ESR version even if I won't be getting any more updates or not? Also, I have extensions (4 ad blockers+Ghostery+VideoDownload helper) which keep updating and the warning said that extensions may not work properly anymore - so I wonder if you know if these above mentioned will in fact be affected or not, because I don't know whether to update them after March 14, 2025 or not because I'm not sure how to go back to a previous version should they not work. Too, I would like to say that you suggest switching to a newer Windows ver. (10 or above) but not everyone really wants to for one reason or another. Personally I find myself fine with Win 8 so far and don't like Win 10 while Win 11 may be too much for my old computer and I cannot afford to buy another. Also I would not attempt to upgrade to Win 10 without help (considering that others more expert had difficulties making it work or reverting back to Win 8) help that I do not have, at all - that's why I'm here now, and I don't really understand how this works either, so... Anyhow, reading on that warning page that after March 14, 2025 you would reconsider your position regarding support for Win 8.1, 8 and below (and knowing also that Chrome and Edge have ended their support - effectively leaving users <em>stranded</em> or forcing them to upgrade to a Windows version unwillingly) I would like to plead with you NOT to follow their example and help us, your supporters, keep using Firefox (which you say is for the people) - like I said many of us have good reasons for keeping on using Win 8.1 or below, so won't you please, PLEASE help us keep Firefox as our browser so that we too may keep using Internet? I know technology goes forward and staying behind makes all more difficult but not all can afford the same things and since I have found that there are a few of us yet I am asking to PLEASE not abandon us as others have done (leaving us to manage the best we can) but consider our plight (I know it might be a challenge for the engineers and developers but surely you can find a solution at least to allow us to keep using Firefox).

My computer is a new iMac (M3) desktop.  I have used FF for several years without incident, until today. It opened normally, and then the familiar update pop-up said an update was available and invited me to re-start the browser. That requires providing admin credentials to the ""Install the 'Helper tool' "" pop-up, which I have done every time without incident, until today. A follow-on pop-up then asked if I wanted to allow Firefox to access other apps and devices, which I had never seen before. I said ""No"", and that was the end of my FF browsing experience. Every time I try to start the FF browser, it wants me to try to install the Helper tool; I provide admin creds, it goes away (fails), and the browser never starts. </p><p>I have a lot of bookmarked URLs and other browser-related data that are extremely important, and I cannot afford to lose them. Used Safari &amp; Google &amp; Mozilla helped me learn the location of the FF ""Profile"" folder.

Went to download folder, clicked the .dmg file, which opened a small pop-up. Followed the instructions to hold down the CTRL key while clicking ""Eject Firefox"".  Nothing productive happened (no new FF icon). The old icon in the dock still doesn't start the app. </p><p>Would it be useful at this point to un-install Firefox (in Applications) and then try again to download a new version?
