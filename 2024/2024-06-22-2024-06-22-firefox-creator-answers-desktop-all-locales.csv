In the top right corner there should be six icons representing 1. Table of contents 2. Search 3. Reader settings (size of font and one or two columns) 4. Annotations 5. Add bookmark 6. Reader menu - this should have five dropdown items including ""go to page"" which is missing. It now only displays the first and the last, and I want to use ""go to page"" which is missing. </p><p>Another failure of going to the right page - when I log into Firefox on my desktop after browsing Kindle on my Kindle reader, Firefox is meant to go automatically to where I have been reading on the table. Instead it goes to the beginning of the book. That looks like the same problem - failure to go to the right page. </p><p>It works fine on Opera but I have to look up my passwords and type in the URL, whereas my Firefox browser shows Kindle along the top, and my password manager works for Firefox. So Opera is very inconvenient. </p><p>I guessed that my version of Firefox has become corrupted, but couldn't find how to re-install it. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1270;firefox-12701;,firefox,other,en-US,"",iankens

I think it really does improve both security and privacy, but I have HTTPS websites in a local network (private IP addresses) that load some images from a local IP camera over HTTP. I do not have control over these IP camera images, so as a temporary workaround I am allowing the whole website to be delivered over plain HTTP. </p><p>It's not a huge security issue, because it's on a local network which I access over the Internet via a VPN, but I would prefer to keep the website on HTTPS and allow mixed content for this specific IP address, so to keep the protection fully enabled when I browse the Internet. </p><p>Is there a way to enter a specific IP address in an exception list, so to selectively allow mixed content? Or, in alternative, is it possible to specify that all web requests from private IP addresses (RFC 1918) should allow mixed content? </p><p>Many thanks, </p><p>Piero </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1270;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1658613;,piero7
