I think it really does improve both security and privacy, but I have HTTPS websites in a local network (private IP addresses) that load some images from a local IP camera over HTTP. I do not have control over these IP camera images, so as a temporary workaround I am allowing the whole website to be delivered over plain HTTP. </p><p>It's not a huge security issue, because it's on a local network which I access over the Internet via a VPN, but I would prefer to keep the website on HTTPS and allow mixed content for this specific IP address, so to keep the protection fully enabled when I browse the Internet. </p><p>Is there a way to enter a specific IP address in an exception list, so to selectively allow mixed content? Or, in alternative, is it possible to specify that all web requests from private IP addresses (RFC 1918) should allow mixed content? </p><p>Many thanks, </p><p>Piero </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1270;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",piero7

My Firefox and laptop are also on their latest updates and regardless this issue has continued through multiple update cycles.  </p><p>It is very frustrating as I'm applying for jobs regularly so manually having to use alternate ways to autofill my details is annoying - I know a password manager is probably the best solution but regardless this is still a very annoying issue. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1270;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",kopthis83

I Suspect a PC repair Co., that has had remote access to my PC in the past of some how accessing my Private network of 7 device's and making sure that some where on my network any of several app's they have used before to take remote access of my PC! I first noticed a problem after this co. initially set up my network. I would be on my PC and see the Any desk app soft ware. So I did uninstall the any desk app where ever I saw it on my network. This co. would call me and tell me to be sure and take advantage of their monthly tune up. Keep in mind I was scared into purchasing 3 year support package. I turned on my PC today,after using Google as my default Browser for a long time. I decided to try Firefox I was very disappointed to see that Firefox had been set up and the third bookmark was something called Take Remote. This Co. Is still in Business and my account is active. In my opinion I believe that all HACKER'S should have their hand's CUT OFF. Again I am a  novice user, But for some one who use's their knowledge and their Company to prey on people like me, There Should be consequence's!!!
