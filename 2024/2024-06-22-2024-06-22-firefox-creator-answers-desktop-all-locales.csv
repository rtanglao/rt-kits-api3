I Suspect a PC repair Co., that has had remote access to my PC in the past of some how accessing my Private network of 7 device's and making sure that some where on my network any of several app's they have used before to take remote access of my PC! I first noticed a problem after this co. initially set up my network. I would be on my PC and see the Any desk app soft ware. So I did uninstall the any desk app where ever I saw it on my network. This co. would call me and tell me to be sure and take advantage of their monthly tune up. Keep in mind I was scared into purchasing 3 year support package. I turned on my PC today,after using Google as my default Browser for a long time. I decided to try Firefox I was very disappointed to see that Firefox had been set up and the third bookmark was something called Take Remote. This Co. Is still in Business and my account is active. In my opinion I believe that all HACKER'S should have their hand's CUT OFF. Again I am a  novice user, But for some one who use's their knowledge and their Company to prey on people like me, There Should be consequence's!!! I Would Greatly Appreciate any help or Advice you could help me with!                                                                                                                                        </p><pre>                                                                                Thank, You                                                                                                                                                                         Michael Ruschman </pre>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1270;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",6hjqvqh8pm
