The amazon web page appears normal till I sign in, then it doesn't update ""cart"" contents or show account holders name or list any ""Lists"" when accessing account saved lists. I have deleted entire history, and all cookies and caches X 3. I Rebooted computer along with a ""system command control reset"" and still the pages are not loading correctly.  Short of reinstalling ""Firefox"" what more can I do?  Are there any ""Preference"" files or files with specific extensions I can delete? Thank you.
