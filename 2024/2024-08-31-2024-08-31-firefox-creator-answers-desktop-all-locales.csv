I still had one ff window open with only one tab and I went to History (there is no session restore on  my firefox-been thru that before) and selected restore recent tabs.  That only opened about 10 tabs .  BUT, now that becomes my "" previous session"" so how do I get my earlier session back.  If I close FF and then open, all I get is that window with 10 useless tabs. This has happened before so I have FF set as default, and ""open to previous window/tabs is selected"".  So how do I get my previous session open? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1290;firefox-12902;,firefox,other,en-US,"",airedalemd

The amazon web page appears normal till I sign in, then it doesn't update ""cart"" contents or show account holders name or list any ""Lists"" when accessing account saved lists. I have deleted entire history, and all cookies and caches X 3. I Rebooted computer along with a ""system command control reset"" and still the pages are not loading correctly.  Short of reinstalling ""Firefox"" what more can I do?  Are there any ""Preference"" files or files with specific extensions I can delete? Thank you.
