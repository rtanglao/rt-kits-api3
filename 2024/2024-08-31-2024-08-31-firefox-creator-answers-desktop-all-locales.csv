Firefox installer on Windows 10, when ran from GUI or admin PowerShell, accesses AppData fodler under standard user account that started the elevated process. Thus, it's not possible to install it if admin account doesn't have access to user folder, as on my system it doesn't for security reasons. </p><p>It's a minor inconvenience to need to explicitly log into admin account and do it there. But as this is a disease among installers I'd rather have them play well with normal security. </p><p>You may disagree here, and I understand if you do.

The applications that Firefox offers are inadequate. This means that if I want to save pages on different sites outside of the web search, they are not saved correctly as PDFs.

Alternatively, reference is often made to other browsers such as Chrome or Opera. I know it's running there as it should be, but I want to keep using Firefox. When I search on YouTube I only find trivial things like how to save a PDF in general. I already know how to save PDFs in general, but it is explicitly possible that hyperlinks also remain active which seems like nobody is interested in. This is a major problem. I just don't understand why something as trivial as an A4 sized page of hyperlinks requires 7+ hours of fruitless research? It seems like I'm someone who's only interested in simply having an HTML to PDF with active hyperlinks. Do any of you have experience with this situation?
