Okay, here's my issue....I'm OLD! HA! Onto the pertinent issue I hope can be solved here:  </p><p>I use Otter ai to transcribe my healing sessions w/ clients (I'm an energy healer-I see dimensions within the human energy field). I'm a ""low-end"" user (I just made that up) because it's just me. When I try (operative word) to export and actually hit the ""export"" button, I get this stupid, crappy, dangling box about ChatGPT (see image below). There's no place to respond yes, no, or to close it out. The only thing I can do is hit ""escape"" to make it disappear but then I'm kicked out of the export process to view the original screen listing my recent meetings.  </p><p>Specifics: I have a Macbook Air, macOS Sonoma version 14.4.1 w/ an Apple M1 (no idea what all this but assume it's useful for you). FF is my default browser. I use otter thru FF rather than an app on my Mac. In FF settings I've added otter ai to a list that allows website popups. I don't use Chatgpt or whatever it does on otter. I just want to export the text.  </p><p>Sadly, otter ai customer support has been dismal. So, I've turned to you folks. I'm not super computer savvy, but hope I've done the basics to rule out issues. Oh, I've also logged out then in to Otter, rebooted my laptop a bunch- all the things to reset. Didn't work.  </p><p>Thank you for your help!!!!

But somehow logging in for a community post didn't help. I've spent nearly half an hour already just to get far enough that I'm logged on, dagnabbit!! Thing is, I was tech savvy 30-40 years ago. But I've not been keeping up. </p><p>Problem is: I got a new laptop recently. Dell, Windows. And there were problems with the earbuds. I went back to the local vendor a couple times to get it fixed. Warranty, dontcha know? It's been OK for awhile now. </p><p>Until this morning. I DLed an update yesterday, and it installed when I fired up this morning. And the earbuds now do not work at all. The machine will not recognize them. At all. This is the first perhaps direct correlation I've noticed, so I'm wondering if my FireFox update means I can no longer listen to videos or music through the earbuds. Here's the error message that pops up: </p><p>Windows cannot find 'C:\ProgramFiles\RealTek\Audio\HDA\RtkNGui64.exe'. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again. </p><p>Of course, I didn't type the file name in. It's part of booting up the machine. And it worked just fine. It quit this morning, and the only change was a FireFox update. </p><p>Perhaps related? In addition, my PhotoShop worked for awhile, and now when I try to open it only hangs. Otherwise, I'd have sent you a screenshot. Could FireFox somehow have affected that, too? It's an old version, and I'm too old to want to buy a new one, big learning curve. Besides, now they want me to rent it, when I still have the disks to install the original Creative Suite 3, which I'm fluent at and am in need of no more new features. (I am elderly, in my 70s, retired, and not ambitious for new skills &amp;c.) </p><p>Could these problems somehow correlate with installing updates? Any suggestions? I'm coming to the end of the line for what I can get fixed under warranty. Just wanting PhotoShop &amp; earbuds to work, is that too much to ask? Could FireFox updates somehow be causing these problems? </p><p>I'm uploading a picture from my camera of the pop-up error message. Maybe it will help? It's bigger than needed. I don't have access to my normal tools. Sorry. </p><p>Or is this just a case where nobody will help me, everyone says the problem comes from elsewhere, not them. What I'm after is earbuds that work. Is that too much to ask? </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",EWinter

I also reinstalled the newest drivers twice, updated my bios, updated Windows, and reset my router so I'm not really sure whats causing the problem. I tested twitch and youtube on Edge and the issues are kinda there but considerably better.

I have tried the following troubleshooting steps and I do see: </p><p>1. Update Firefox to the Latest Version Go to Menu (≡) &gt; Help &gt; About Firefox. This will automatically check for updates. Regular updates ensure compatibility with modern web apps like Shopify. 2. Clear Cache, Cookies, and Site Data Go to Menu (≡) &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security. Under Cookies and Site Data, click Manage Data. Search for ""Shopify"" to delete only Shopify-related data, or use Clear Data to remove all cached data, which can resolve display issues in Admin. 3. Run Firefox in Troubleshoot Mode (Enhanced Safe Mode) Firefox 2024 includes a robust Troubleshoot Mode that disables extensions, custom settings, and themes, giving a clean environment. Go to Menu (≡) &gt; Help &gt; Troubleshoot Mode. Choose Restart in Troubleshoot Mode, then Open when prompted. If Shopify Admin works in this mode, an extension or setting is likely causing the issue. 4. Check for Incompatible Extensions and Privacy Add-ons Go to Menu (≡) &gt; Add-ons and Themes &gt; Extensions. Disable extensions, especially ad blockers, VPNs, and script blockers, which may conflict with Shopify's dynamic elements. Reload Shopify Admin after disabling each extension to pinpoint any issues. 5. Disable Enhanced Tracking Protection for Shopify Firefox’s Enhanced Tracking Protection may block essential cookies and scripts used by Shopify. Open Shopify Admin, click the shield icon next to the address bar, and select Turn off Enhanced Tracking Protection for This Site. 6. Disable Hardware Acceleration Some display issues stem from hardware acceleration conflicts. Go to Menu (≡) &gt; Settings &gt; General &gt; Performance. Uncheck Use hardware acceleration when available and restart Firefox. 7. Use Firefox’s DevTools to Diagnose Errors Open Menu (≡) &gt; Web Developer &gt; Web Console or press Ctrl + Shift + K. Reload Shopify Admin to see if any errors or blocked elements are logged, which can provide insight into potential conflicts or missing resources. 8. Verify Network Security and Check Proxy/VPN Settings If your network includes a firewall or proxy, ensure that it allows secure access to all Shopify domains. Disable VPNs temporarily to check if they’re impacting Shopify Admin performance. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1684932;,gberryhill32
