Each tab contains at least one image ranging size typically from 1MB to 20MB. When I open a certain amount (maybe around 20), I can no longer save the image by clicking the image and dragging to my desktop. It saves ~4.1KB of the file, then stops.  So I am left with an incomplete file. This also occurs when right-clicking and save as (except in this case, the the download message says ""Failed"").  However, if I click on the retry icon, it will then work.  If I open the image directly into in a new tab, I can successfully save using both of the earlier methods.   </p><p>I was wondering if there is some setting in Firefox that is doing this. I am using a somewhat fresh installation of Firefox (installed a few days ago). I have some extensions, but the issue persisted when they were disabled. </p>",desktop;troubleshooting;windows-11;firefox-1280;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",xpandapanda

I now need to reduce the height of even better fix it to a specific value that won't change even if I customize the scale factor in Windows. Which is what happens atm. I increased the scale factor (recommended was 150, I used 175 for a while, now my eyes got worse and I need to constantly reach for my laptop when I use the folders explorer (where I can't change the zoom level like I can in Firefox. Or, I can but it only affects the kind of view, details, list, small icon, large icon etc. The text stays the same). And once I increased the scale factor, now the tabs headers and the address bar became super big and take too much space. If changing the height of the address bar is not possible ,at least the tabs header? I don't find anything in about:config when I look for browser.tabs </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;windows-11;firefox-1280;customize-settings-and-preferences;,firefox,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",AlternativeTotal2211
