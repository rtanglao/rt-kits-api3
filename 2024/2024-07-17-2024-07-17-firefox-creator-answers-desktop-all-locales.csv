Each time I try to open a website (saved website) I receive the error message ""PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR"", due to a security problem. According to Firefox the website (page) can not be opened because the authenticity can not be verified. It is a very strange situation, because this problem came out of the blue. The websites I'm trying to open, are saved websites without security problems so far. Moreover this strange situation is only occurring on my ""desktop pc with Windows 10"" and does not occur on my ""laptop with Windows 11""! More important info: the problem is occurring with an ethernet connection both with a WiFi connection. My laptop is always connected with a WiFi connection. Both devices do not use VPN. On both devices is running Bitdefender (with exactly the same options), CCleaner/Kamo (of CCleaner, with exactly the same options). My service provider is Ziggo Netherlands. Consulting Internet, I tried to fix this problem by applying a lot of adviced changes into a lot of options. All without any success. One of the advices I did not try, is turning off the virus scanner Bitdefender, because I do not know how to turn off and how to again on. I did turn off Bitdefender firewall, without success. Fyi: I always use Firefox and I never use Chrome or any other browser. However I checked the situation with Chrome and to my surprise, the same website connection problems did occur! Please advise how to resolve this problem. Thanks in advance. Best regards, Peter </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1280;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",PeterWillemsen

This is my hail mary.  </p><p><strong>How I got here</strong> I needed to do a full wipe and reinstal of my macOS; this was conducted with the help of the Genuis bar. Upon reinstalling Firefox, I signed into my account and my bookmarks are all gone, records of them empty.  </p><p>I should also note that nothing else ported over. No passwords, no browser extensions. Nada. The passowrds and extensions aren't a big deal. I use a 3rd-party password manager and can easily re-download the handful of extensions/widgets. But I <em>heavily</em> relied on bookmarks for both frequently visited sites and ones rarely-used which I knew were important for future reference. And I cannot remember 80% of them... </p><p><strong>What else I've tried other than what's suggested in help article: </strong> </p> <ul><li> Because I did not check to confirm <em>which</em> Firefox profile I've been signed into for ages and ages before doing the reset, I thought maybe I had just signed into the wrong one. I proceeded to try every other email address I have, including two from my old workplace. None of the other 5 emails had profiles created. I know this because it prompted the sign up userflow; create a password, etc.  </li><li> But I also know for a fact that the bookmarks were saved as part of a profile because I used the profile sync feature to auto-port all my bookmarks when I first got this Macbook a year and a bit ago.  </li><li> The folders where bookmark backup info is stored locally are empty... Clearly, it wasn't stored in my icloud documents (that's on me for not double-checking)  </li><li> I checked my other device (mobile phone) to see if I had firefox downloaded and was signed into the same account as the original, with the bookmarks still visible. Of course I didn't. I only use Safari on my phone 😭 </li></ul> <p>""""Grasping at straws: the only other things I can think of"""" </p> <ul><li> Is there some way of linking my MAC address with my IP address and using those to triangulate the correct profile? </li><li> Because my computer got wiped and nothing is saved locally, my only hope is that my bookmarks are floating around the ether. If so, I just need to figure out how to find them. </li></ul> <p>Any and all help/suggestions are massively appreciated!! </p><p>Thanks in advance,  </p><p>Lauren </p>",desktop;sync;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1280;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",lauren.fromtiktok

Edge is messed up in other ways as is Opera so I'd really love to have just ONE browser that I can depend on.

I will add a bookmark to a folder the first time, but then will no appear to repeat the effort with adding another to the same or another folder. Re 'jscher2000's answer to my question, switching to another folder and back offers no relief from this but you are correct in that the issue is the page does not refresh to show added content after the first (or maybe second) time, if left idle a few moments. Closing out and reopening 'Mange Bookmarks' and navigating to the appropriate folder (or subfolder) then becomes necessary for it to display that in fact it had added the bookmark. Tiresome. Is there any way to increase the amount of memory allotted by my computer or Mozilla to this function, to regain the functionality I once took for granted? </p><p>Re 'cor-el' , where is the 'places database'?
