The download problem occurred when suddenly my FF always froze no matter if I closed it or not. So I just refresh my FF and copy my profile from the old backup data that FF generated and just pasted all of them on my new profile. The problem is that after I tries to download warcraft 3 maps from google drive, the download always occurs as failed.  I don't have this problem when I tried it with Edge. Running FF as admin doesn't worked either. Neither as when I run FF as refresh without any extension.  Downloading stuffs with IDM (Internet Download Manager) does not have any problems. Just now, I try to download a .xlsx files from my workplace websites. After I click on the download or the file itself, nothing occurs as if nothing happened. This is giving me a headaches so I came here to give it a try if anyone can help me fix this problem. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",twz.lotus15

This has been going for many months now a problem would have been fixed by now.   I would like to know if you can bring pressure to bear on them to get reinstated again.   I have attached a screenshot of the message from their site. Thanking you.
