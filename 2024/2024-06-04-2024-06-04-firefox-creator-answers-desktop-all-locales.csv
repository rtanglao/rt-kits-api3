I am reaching out to report an issue regarding the accessibility of a website through Mozilla Firefox. </p><p>The website in question, <a href=""https://carrecoverydxb.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://carrecoverydxb.com/</a>, is currently inaccessible when attempting to load it using Mozilla Firefox. Despite multiple attempts, the site fails to open, displaying an error message indicating an inability to establish a connection. </p><p>I have tested the website on other browsers and devices, and it appears to load without any issues. However, this problem seems specific to Mozilla Firefox. </p><p>As a member of the Mozilla Firefox community, I am seeking assistance in resolving this issue. I believe it is essential to ensure that all websites are accessible through Mozilla Firefox to provide users with a seamless browsing experience. </p><p>Could you please investigate this matter and provide any guidance or solutions to address the problem? Your prompt attention to this issue would be greatly appreciated. </p><p>Thank you for your time and assistance. </p><p>Best Regards, Umlex matlex </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",umlexmatlex

They vary from SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN to SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER... even on websites like <a href=""http://x.com"" rel=""nofollow"">x.com</a> or LinkedIn. At the same time I got a new router from my ISP. But I am not sure, if this is connected somehow or if I got a Man-in-the-Middle or a virus. Malwarebytes &amp; Co don´t find anything. I have resetted Firefox, too. But nothing helps. I get these errors in Chrome, too, sometimes. But not as often. Any ideas anybody?

Sometimes the Google home page won't load up at all.  Once it does load up sometimes the searches work, sometimes the search just times out and goes back to the empty search bar, also when I click on links to websites they time out too.  If I go straight to a bookmarked website, that seems to free things up and the next Google search I do will work.  I've uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox but it doesn't make any difference.  Google works fine on Chrome and Edge.  Any advice would be gratefully received - please note I'm not technically minded!  Thank you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1655744;,kallen359

The download problem occurred when suddenly my FF always froze no matter if I closed it or not. So I just refresh my FF and copy my profile from the old backup data that FF generated and just pasted all of them on my new profile. The problem is that after I tries to download warcraft 3 maps from google drive, the download always occurs as failed.  I don't have this problem when I tried it with Edge. Running FF as admin doesn't worked either. Neither as when I run FF as refresh without any extension.  Downloading stuffs with IDM (Internet Download Manager) does not have any problems. Just now, I try to download a .xlsx files from my workplace websites. After I click on the download or the file itself, nothing occurs as if nothing happened. This is giving me a headaches so I came here to give it a try if anyone can help me fix this problem. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",twz.lotus15
