Spatial audio provides a three-dimensional surround sound experience (even in stereo sound, and especially in multi-channel sound), making it seem as if sounds are coming from different sources around you in space. This provides an enhanced and more immersive listening experience. Can you research the steps required to add support? </p><p><strong>What steps will reproduce the problem?</strong> </p><p>(1) Use a Mac with macOS Monterey or higher, with Apple Airpods headphones connected (2) Open some audio content in Firefox browser, for example <a href=""https://youtu.be/luFGI13Mv8o"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/luFGI13Mv8o</a> (3) You will see that MacOS shows that Spatial Audio is Not Available. When you open the same video in the Safari browser (or in supported third-party apps like Infuse), Mac will allow you to apply a Spatial Audio effect. </p><p><strong>What is the expected result?</strong> </p><p>Firefox on a Mac will allow Spatial Audio to be played on supported headphones, like the Safari browser </p><p><strong>What is the actual result?</strong> </p><p>Firefox does not support Spatial Audio </p><p><strong>Please also provide additional information:</strong> </p> <ul><li> I understand from <a href=""https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/commit/1ed8607292ae4f9eafd041d304ad68740ffd3fd7"" rel=""nofollow"">this commit</a> that support should be added by switching to Apple's new AVFoundation driver </li><li> apple docs: <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10265/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10265/</a> </li></ul>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,other,it,"",fctaddia
