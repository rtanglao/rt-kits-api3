I have auto-update enabled. Since the update, my browser experience has reverted back to 1999, where opening a tab is slow to a crawl, scrolling on (for example) facebook is delayed, and youtube videos keep buffering. </p><p>Note: I have a beast PC with 36GB RAM, and a 1000W PSU, yet in my task manager it stays as using almost 4GB of RAM and ""Very high"" power usage. </p><p>I've updated drivers, tried the ""firefox safe mode"" which had the same issues, and confirmed that this doesn't impact any other of my internet-based activities (like gaming and discord). </p><p>I've also run a malware check (deep scan) and found nada. </p><p>Lastly, I've tried ye-olde 'turn it off and on again'. </p><p>Nothing has helped. Any suggestions? I'd love it firefox had a revert update feature but it does not, which is a huge bummer. Please gimme a hand, 'cause I hate Chrome, which is working just fine. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1270;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",tuinstra.tim
