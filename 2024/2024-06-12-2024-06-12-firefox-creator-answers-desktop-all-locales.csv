This only happens since I started using a new Mac (M2 Chip). </p><p>I know there are some ""solutions"" flagged but I cannot get it to work. My main issue is, the inspector it self has completely garbled fonts. So does the elements of the browser itself, for instance my favorites bar. </p><p>I know I am supposed to check my fonts, but I don't know how? I used the fonts application on my mac and let it validate the fonts. No issue there. </p><p>Only thing to resolve this issue is to reboot. And this is extremely frustrating since it means out of the blue my Firefox won't show fonts and I have to save all my work and reboot to be able to use it again. </p><p>I would highly appreciate a step by step solution on how to fix this. It seems to be a common problem so maybe there is a solutions that describes it better than the text I found here to inspect elements and check fonts. </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p><p>Julian </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",benner.julian

I have auto-update enabled. Since the update, my browser experience has reverted back to 1999, where opening a tab is slow to a crawl, scrolling on (for example) facebook is delayed, and youtube videos keep buffering. </p><p>Note: I have a beast PC with 36GB RAM, and a 1000W PSU, yet in my task manager it stays as using almost 4GB of RAM and ""Very high"" power usage. </p><p>I've updated drivers, tried the ""firefox safe mode"" which had the same issues, and confirmed that this doesn't impact any other of my internet-based activities (like gaming and discord). </p><p>I've also run a malware check (deep scan) and found nada. </p><p>Lastly, I've tried ye-olde 'turn it off and on again'. </p><p>Nothing has helped. Any suggestions? I'd love it firefox had a revert update feature but it does not, which is a huge bummer. Please gimme a hand, 'cause I hate Chrome, which is working just fine. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1270;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",tuinstra.tim
