When multiple Firefox windows with multiple tabs each are in use multiple YouTube videos will start playing. (Only one of possibly multiple YouTube tabs per FireFox window, I believe.) The cacaphony is annoying. Tracking down the offending tabs is difficult. (There is no ""Show tabs playing media"" feature in Firefox.) </p><p>QUESTIONS: (1) How do I prevent Firefox from playing media (YouTube and others) unbidden when Firefox re-starts and re-loads its tabs? (2) How do I quickly find which Firefox windows have a tab that is playing media? (3) How do I quickly find which Firefox tabs are playing media? (4) How can YouTube videos be prevented from automatically starting when a Firefox web page with that video is re-loaded? </p>",desktop;windows-10;troubleshooting;firefox-1290;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,1671128;,mrids

But when I open Firefox, my homepage doesn't show the page provided by the extension. It's still Firefox's default homepage. Only when I open a new tab will the page provided by the extension appear. Also, the settings don't offer the option to replace Firefox's default homepage with the page provided by the extension. I need to replace the homepage from Firefox's default homepage to the tab provided by the extension. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1290;firefox-12902;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",qm65285

I already had a firefox account on my old computer and I signed into the new computer with my firefox account thinking it would make a difference but I am still unable to see my old bookmarks that were on my old firefox.
