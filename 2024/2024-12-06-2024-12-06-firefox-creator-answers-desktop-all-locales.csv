Now I just discovered that it's virtually impossible to completely delete the history in Firefox.  I do try to delete my browsing history as suggested in the Firefox documentation. The problem is with ""Firefox suggests"". Pages that should have been cleared out by deleting the browser history, be it in settings or over the three bar menu still show up there. To me this is unacceptable. I can obfuscate by disabling all address bar search options, but the history data is then still stored somewhere. I do not use any cloud services. Attached you can see an image of what I mean. All browsing history should have been deleted but still show up (also after restarting Firefox). </p><p>I would really like to continue to use Firefox but only if I can delete ALL browsing history. Thank you. Best Regards </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1692402;1692407;,gerhard.gubler1

But at this point for me, I am really looking for a DEFAULT USAGE solution. I'm sure there is one and I just don't know it.  </p><p>All I want is to be able to use and <strong>click Mac's built in UI ""Green"" button</strong> in the traffic-light UI element at the top-left corner of a window, and have the browser obey and: strip out or suppress all Firefox browser ""chrome"" elements such as tab bar, URL bar, bookmarks bar -- and show me the webpage I am looking at truly full-screen. Then when done with full-screen view, I want to click/toggle Mac's ""green light"" button again and have all the Firefox browser UI elements return. (Tab bar, URL bar, bookmarks bar). </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",quicksite

When I rebooted the computer again, firefox automatically started up, and the flyout panel thing that shows up when you right click on an app claimed that all three windows returned. However, only two of them were actually accessible, and clicking on the app to move between them and the F3 window confirmed this. Clicking on the third window accomplishes nothing, reveals nothing, and just moves the little checkmark around in that flyout panel. Closing the other two windows before restarting firefox does not open a new window because it thinks one is already there, but I cannot in any way see or access it outside of its label in the flyout panel. Even hitting ""Show All Windows"" just shows the window I am typing this in. What am I supposed to do here? </p>",firefox;browse;firefox-1330;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",hype11419
