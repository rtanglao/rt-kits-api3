The input cursor visibility is inconsistent: it shows properly on some screen ratios but disappears on others. This issue appears to be related to how the input and SVG elements are rendered in different viewport sizes and resolutions. </p><p>Steps to reproduce: </p><p>Create an SVG element and embed an &lt;input&gt; tag within it. Test the behavior on screens with varying resolutions and aspect ratios. Expected Behavior: The input cursor should be consistently visible across all screen ratios and resolutions. </p><p>Actual Behavior: The cursor visibility is inconsistent. On certain screen ratios, the cursor either doesnâ€™t show or is misaligned. </p><p>This behavior greatly affects the usability of such components, especially in responsive designs. I would appreciate any guidance or a potential fix in future updates to address this rendering inconsistency. </p><p>Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please let me know if you need further details or a code example to reproduce the issue. </p><p>Best regards, Gyanendra Kumar Dubey </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",gyanendra.dubey

Now I just discovered that it's virtually impossible to completely delete the history in Firefox.  I do try to delete my browsing history as suggested in the Firefox documentation. The problem is with ""Firefox suggests"". Pages that should have been cleared out by deleting the browser history, be it in settings or over the three bar menu still show up there. To me this is unacceptable. I can obfuscate by disabling all address bar search options, but the history data is then still stored somewhere. I do not use any cloud services. Attached you can see an image of what I mean. All browsing history should have been deleted but still show up (also after restarting Firefox). </p><p>I would really like to continue to use Firefox but only if I can delete ALL browsing history.

When I rebooted the computer again, firefox automatically started up, and the flyout panel thing that shows up when you right click on an app claimed that all three windows returned. However, only two of them were actually accessible, and clicking on the app to move between them and the F3 window confirmed this. Clicking on the third window accomplishes nothing, reveals nothing, and just moves the little checkmark around in that flyout panel. Closing the other two windows before restarting firefox does not open a new window because it thinks one is already there, but I cannot in any way see or access it outside of its label in the flyout panel. Even hitting ""Show All Windows"" just shows the window I am typing this in. What am I supposed to do here? </p>",firefox;browse;firefox-1330;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",hype11419
