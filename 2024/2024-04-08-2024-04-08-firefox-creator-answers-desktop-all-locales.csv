In event logs there are several allows but also several blocks. All of them are from the exact same path and executable(which should be allowed regarding the path rule). </p><p>2)Applocker is turned on, instead of whitelisting path i have used publisher rule(this one is not the prefered solution in our case). </p><p>Firefox launches just fine, but there are still block events in the logs. As we are collecting these logs it is filling our collector. </p><p>Microsoft provided me with steps on how to simulate this issue: </p><p>1.	Setup a Windows 10 Enterprise 22H2 or Latest Windows 11 build. 2.	Setup another remote machine to create SMB share where you need to place the Firefox program. 3.	Use local group policy (gpedit.msc) to create Applocker policies. (Use publisher rule for Firefox.exe. There is no need to setup path rule as we are able to reproduce the issue using publisher policy itself) 4.	Create two scenarios, working and non working. Running Firefox.exe from local folder will be working scenario. Running Firefox.exe from smb share will be non working scenario. 5.	Firefox vendor can capture their own data and do the investigation, leveraging the inputs that we have given below. </p><p>FF version is 124.0.1 (64-bit) </p><p>Thanks for investigation. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,cs,"",roman.marik

1444298,2024-04-07 22:16:35 -0700,2024-04-08 02:44:02 -0700,Firefox keeps zooming in on web page,"<p>I'm not sure how this happened, but one of my firefox web pages keeps zooming in only on one website and the zoom refuses to reset no matter what I do. </p><p>For reference this is wikipedia. Every time I load a wikipedia page it loads zoomed in to 210%, which I will then have to reset to 100% in order to read the page properly. If I for some reason click on a link on the wikipedia page that goes to another wikipedia page, the zoom will reset again to 210%, which I will then need to reset once again. This happens also whenever I switch from the wikipedia tab to another tab and then switch back again. I do have an addon that changes wikipedia slightly (the Wikipedia Vector Skin addon) but disabling this addon doesn't fix the issue. </p><p>I went into about:config several times already and changed different settings to try and make it stop, but nothing so far has worked. I've tried resetting layout.css.devPixelsPerPx to 1.0 and back again to -1.0 and it makes no difference. I also tried changing browser.zoom.full to false and it keeps happening. Changing browser.zoom.siteSpecific to false does fix the issue, however it also resets the zoom I have on other websites that I want to keep, so it's not an ideal fix. I also cleared all my cache and cookies and it changed nothing. </p><p>Does anyone have any idea on why this keeps happening only with wikipedia, and how I can get this to stop happening? I assume there must be some internal setting that would need to be reset in order to fix this, but I don't know how to do it or where I would even go. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1220;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1646311;,stephanothebrave
