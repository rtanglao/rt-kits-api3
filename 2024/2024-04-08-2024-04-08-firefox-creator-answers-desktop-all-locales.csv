I've restarted the browser, removed extensions nothing seems to help and my firefox is up to date. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1646295;,kitongamark

Every time I load a wikipedia page it loads zoomed in to 210%, which I will then have to reset to 100% in order to read the page properly. If I for some reason click on a link on the wikipedia page that goes to another wikipedia page, the zoom will reset again to 210%, which I will then need to reset once again. This happens also whenever I switch from the wikipedia tab to another tab and then switch back again. I do have an addon that changes wikipedia slightly (the Wikipedia Vector Skin addon) but disabling this addon doesn't fix the issue. </p><p>I went into about:config several times already and changed different settings to try and make it stop, but nothing so far has worked. I've tried resetting layout.css.devPixelsPerPx to 1.0 and back again to -1.0 and it makes no difference. I also tried changing browser.zoom.full to false and it keeps happening. Changing browser.zoom.siteSpecific to false does fix the issue, however it also resets the zoom I have on other websites that I want to keep, so it's not an ideal fix. I also cleared all my cache and cookies and it changed nothing. </p><p>Does anyone have any idea on why this keeps happening only with wikipedia, and how I can get this to stop happening? I assume there must be some internal setting that would need to be reset in order to fix this, but I don't know how to do it or where I would even go. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1220;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1646311;,stephanothebrave

Not the first time, so I went to retrieve it with sessionstore.jsonlz4  Put it in the directory above the backups as usual.  Not working.  No matter where I put it, Firefox is not restoring my session.  Tried everything I can think of, no joy.  Would really like to recover my session.  Has the location changed?  Different file name?  Firefox has done a lot of updates lately.  I am on a pc operating WIndows 10. </p><p>[Lost my session because I had a private window open when I closed my regular window.
