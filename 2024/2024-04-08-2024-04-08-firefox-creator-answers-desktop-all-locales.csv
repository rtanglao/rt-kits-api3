My email-account is with <a href=""http://arcor.de"" rel=""nofollow"">arcor.de</a> (which is also with vodafone).  I found already the advice on your pages, to enter firefox (respective mozilla) on a white list of the provider. But there is no whitelist existing. What can I do now?

Setup a Windows 10 Enterprise 22H2 or Latest Windows 11 build. 2.	Setup another remote machine to create SMB share where you need to place the Firefox program. 3.	Use local group policy (gpedit.msc) to create Applocker policies. (Use publisher rule for Firefox.exe. There is no need to setup path rule as we are able to reproduce the issue using publisher policy itself) 4.	Create two scenarios, working and non working. Running Firefox.exe from local folder will be working scenario. Running Firefox.exe from smb share will be non working scenario. 5.	Firefox vendor can capture their own data and do the investigation, leveraging the inputs that we have given below. </p><p>FF version is 124.0.1 (64-bit) </p><p>Thanks for investigation. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,cs,1646352;,roman.marik
