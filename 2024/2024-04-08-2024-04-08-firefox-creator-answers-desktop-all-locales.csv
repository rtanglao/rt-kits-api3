Not the first time, so I went to retrieve it with sessionstore.jsonlz4  Put it in the directory above the backups as usual.  Not working.  No matter where I put it, Firefox is not restoring my session.  Tried everything I can think of, no joy.  Would really like to recover my session.  Has the location changed?  Different file name?  Firefox has done a lot of updates lately.  I am on a pc operating WIndows 10. </p><p>[Lost my session because I had a private window open when I closed my regular window.
