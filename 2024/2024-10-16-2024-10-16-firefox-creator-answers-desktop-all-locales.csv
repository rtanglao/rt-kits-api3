Até para carregar o google ele chega a demorar mais de 10 minutos. Depois dessa demora inicial, ele volta a funcionar normalmente. A questão é que esse problema parece ser comum e já vi em outros fóruns soluções como ""restaure o firefox"", ""desligue todas as extensões"" ou ""limpe seu histórico e os cookies"" para que o mozilla volte a funcionar normalmente. E isso realmente funciona para resolver essa demora inicial, mas quando eu fechar o navegador e abrir de novo outro dia, o problema vai acontecer de novo. Não pretendo desinstalar minhas extensões (não uso nada muito complexo, apenas bloqueadores de anúncios e detectores de música) nem pretendo restaurar o firefox toda vez que quiser usar, então pergunto: existe algum jeito de resolver este problema da demora inicial de uma vez por todas? Ou só existem paliativos? Realmente não queria trocar de navegador. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,pt-BR,"",leo.jardim
