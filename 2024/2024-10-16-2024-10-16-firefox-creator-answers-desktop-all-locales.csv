I did a system restore to a week earlier, and after 5 hours, the computer rebooted to that date. Upon opening Firefox, I found the the notice that the next time Firefox opens, it will update. After closing, and reopening, Firefox updated and displayed the same error message.  Nor quite sure what to do, I downloaded Firefox again, and was going to uninstall and reinstall. But as soon as the download finished, it loaded. So now I have the new Firefox without all of my saved bookmarks and passwords. I thought I'd read someplace that that wouldn't happen, and all of my password and bookmark history would transfer to the new Firefox.  As if that wasn't enough to ruin my day, I found that the new Firefox isn't working in my wife's account on the same computer. She gets the same error message as I did before the new install.

Até para carregar o google ele chega a demorar mais de 10 minutos. Depois dessa demora inicial, ele volta a funcionar normalmente. A questão é que esse problema parece ser comum e já vi em outros fóruns soluções como ""restaure o firefox"", ""desligue todas as extensões"" ou ""limpe seu histórico e os cookies"" para que o mozilla volte a funcionar normalmente. E isso realmente funciona para resolver essa demora inicial, mas quando eu fechar o navegador e abrir de novo outro dia, o problema vai acontecer de novo. Não pretendo desinstalar minhas extensões (não uso nada muito complexo, apenas bloqueadores de anúncios e detectores de música) nem pretendo restaurar o firefox toda vez que quiser usar, então pergunto: existe algum jeito de resolver este problema da demora inicial de uma vez por todas? Ou só existem paliativos? Realmente não queria trocar de navegador. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,pt-BR,"",leo.jardim
