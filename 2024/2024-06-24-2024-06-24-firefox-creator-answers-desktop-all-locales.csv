Esta es mi primer consulta por lo que espero describirla bien. Tengo Firefox Nightly y me paso unas dos o tres veces que luego de una actualización cierra todas las sesiones y debo iniciar nuevamente una por una, gmail, whatsapp, trello, etc. Por lo que, quería saber si es algo propio de algunas actualizaciones, o si debo cambiar algo en la configuración o que puede ser ya que, son muchas las sesiones a volver a abrir y me pasa en ambas computadoras por lo que se hace eterno volver a la ""normalidad"" de uso del navegador.  Cualquier solución que sepan sería de ayuda.  Muchas gracias </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1270;,firefox,other,es,"",imenano89
