It will take like 20 seconds to load the ""save as"" popup and then, once saved and it closes, takes another 5 seconds to regain control and not make the error sound when I click. </p><p>Firefox loads quickly on every other aspect. And I have a beast of a laptop. It has an Intel Core i9 13th Gen 13900HX, 64GB of DDR5/6 RAM and a Nvidia RTX 4090 Laptop graphics chip. It also has Windows 11 Home. So it SHOULDN'T be this laggy. And I refreshed Firefox multiple times and even reinstalled it. NOTHING! </p><p>And, while I'm personally not complaining about the icons in the bar looking like they're from 7 or something, I wonder if it's connected? Regardless, I NEED this fixed as it's damn near unusable for me. I'm in college for video game development, so things like this are the last thing I want to deal with... </p>",firefox;firefox-1300;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",slpage5

I have already tried changing the color settings within firefox many times and that has not helped. I have also already tried refreshing Firefox, completely uninstalling and reinstalling firefox among other things. So far there seems to be no fix. I have tried restarting my computer as well.

Don't get me wrong, I love Firefox - have used it for decades now across a multitude of OS's - and favicons always used to display properly.

I would go to my menu, select History and select Clear Recent History. The box to clear my cookies and cache would show, and I would click on Clear. When I would go back to the menu, and select History, it would show Empty. </p><p>On Thursday, July 18, 2024, and since, I have not been able to clear my cookies and cache. All the days of entries since July 18. 2024 are piling up. </p><p>I certainly do not know what changed. I would appreciate your listing step by step what I need to do to get my cookies and cache to work/clear. </p><p>Or, if you can just fix the problem, please. My laptop is Windows 10, and I use Firefox. Thank you. </p><p>Regards, A.B.
