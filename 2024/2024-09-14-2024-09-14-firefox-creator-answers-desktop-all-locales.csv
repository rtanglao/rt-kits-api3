Each time I close Firefox, I am required to log in again to the ""Bale"" messenger upon reopening the browser, as my login credentials are not retained for future sessions. </p><p>I would like to highlight the following points for your consideration: </p><p>1.    This issue is specific to the Bale messenger and does not occur on other websites. 2.    The problem persists across all of my devices, including my work computer, home PC, and laptop. 3.    The issue does not arise when I am not logged into my Firefox account. In fact, Bale messenger works perfectly on my friends' Firefox browsers, where there is no need for repeated logins after closing the browser. </p><p><strong>4.    I have already reviewed the ""Cookies and Site Data"" settings (see the attached image).</strong> </p><p>I would greatly appreciate your guidance on how to resolve this issue at your earliest convenience. </p><p>Thank you for your time and support. </p><p>Best regards, Mostafa </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",ajvadi1987

On multiple distros favicons simply don't show, while they may on Windows. Not trying to dig, but shouldn't this be a pretty basic feature that's expected for a browser no matter what OS is used? Even searching at the forums here for favicons reveals 222 potential threads - one would think that the sheer volume of reports issued for them not functioning correctly would prompt a unified remediation effort. Don't get me wrong, I love Firefox - have used it for decades now across a multitude of OS's - and favicons always used to display properly. Googling this issue will reveal several recommendations of 3rd party addons and tweaks. Can we make favicons just work (again?) </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",wizardofcor
