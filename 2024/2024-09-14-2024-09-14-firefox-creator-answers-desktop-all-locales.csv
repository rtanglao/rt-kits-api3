On multiple distros favicons simply don't show, while they may on Windows. Not trying to dig, but shouldn't this be a pretty basic feature that's expected for a browser no matter what OS is used? Even searching at the forums here for favicons reveals 222 potential threads - one would think that the sheer volume of reports issued for them not functioning correctly would prompt a unified remediation effort. Don't get me wrong, I love Firefox - have used it for decades now across a multitude of OS's - and favicons always used to display properly. Googling this issue will reveal several recommendations of 3rd party addons and tweaks. Can we make favicons just work (again?) </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",wizardofcor
