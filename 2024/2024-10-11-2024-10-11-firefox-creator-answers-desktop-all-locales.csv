This happens ONLY when Firefox is running. (Doesn't matter what site or URL and also occurs during Troubleshoot Mode.) If I close Firefox, the operation(s) are successful, just as they have been for many, many years. (Nuance stopped supporting PaperPort around 2015). I also do not have any problems when I use a different browser (Edge or Chrome). There was also a Windows update on the same day as Firefox was updated but that seems irrelevant since the crashes do not occur under other browsers. Also, it doesn't seem to be in the ""main' program PaperPort, but more so in ""ImageView"" which is used to edit or modify a new or existing scan. All operations from the main program, including Save &amp; Save As, operate normally so it doesn't seem related to file permissions, etc. And why would there be problems only when Firefox is running? </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",ktagge

I have searched and found that this is apparently a Firefox issue that is being caused by a new feature being utilized in Firefox. It appears that the issue is NOT a PG&amp;E's problem, but some program in Firefox not being compatible with something in PG&amp;E website. Also with this issue, I can't view videos in the news stories, because of thr privacy pop up, it says to allow advertising, which I don't select, since I have gone into Firefox settings and set the it to don't  srll my info. And, btw, I was getting the pop up BEFORE I I changed the don't sell settings in Firefox.  I have to copy the URL and paste it into Chrome to see the vidros in the news stories. Is there a work around in Firefox that can be used to access PG&amp;E with Firefox, as I have read in a few forums that we need to ‘allow' Firefox from the PG&amp;E web site, but that can't be done if we can't open it in the browser?  Not sure if that info is accurate though. Why would Firefox be using a feature that doesn't allow all web sites, if that is the actual cause? Thank you for your help, and hopefully there is a solution to fix this particular issue.  Stay safe and well.

Not sure whether I should put a phone number or the added secondary email address in here so you can add it for me. I can't sign into Mozilla to do anything.
