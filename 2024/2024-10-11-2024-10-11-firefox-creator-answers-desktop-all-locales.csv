This can be fixed temporarily by customizing the toolbar but the icons move back when Firefox is closed and reloaded. </p><p>Prior to this issue, I had installed a custom theme by Mozilla and have since removed it, but this hasn't fixed the issue. </p><p>Additionally, I was watching a YouTube video in full screen mode and, when I left full screen mode, all of my bookmarks, the home button, the new tab, downloads, and nearly every other button in the area were gone. I was able to fix this by customizing the toolbar, but ever since then, the new tab and downloads buttons have migrated. The video I was watching was fairly long so I'm not sure what caused the mass exodus of buttons or exactly when it happened. </p><p>Is there anyway to make the buttons stay put? </p><p>Thank you. </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",florsolitaire
