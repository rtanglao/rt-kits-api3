I don't really use other sites that have videos other than Youtube. But I notice that the videos freeze quite often and audio just continues to play. The videos then unfreeze and skip multiple frames. I've noticed clearing browser cache seems to help but it doesn't help for longer than a 2 min video at best. At worst, it doesn't affect it at all. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,other,en-US,1631253;,tanishqsingh280607

Firefox on Mac and Windows, if a login password exists, allows us to require authentication to autofill, view or edit saved credit cards. Firefox on Linux doesn't allow this authentication. So, I'm guessing that the credit card information is stored in Linux in an insecure manner. This is true?  Another question about Mac and Windows. Does requiring authentication for credit card processes mean that the card information is encrypted on disk? Or does the password only protect information from unauthorized viewing, and the cards are stored on disks in text form? </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1210;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",YDUBINSKY

I keep my most up-to-date passwords in iCloud, but would love to use auto fill in Firefox as I am not a fan of Safari. Is there a way to set this up? </p>",macos;,firefox,setup-sync,en-US,"",katkaczmarski
