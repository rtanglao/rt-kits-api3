Firefox on Mac and Windows, if a login password exists, allows us to require authentication to autofill, view or edit saved credit cards. Firefox on Linux doesn't allow this authentication. So, I'm guessing that the credit card information is stored in Linux in an insecure manner. This is true?  Another question about Mac and Windows. Does requiring authentication for credit card processes mean that the card information is encrypted on disk? Or does the password only protect information from unauthorized viewing, and the cards are stored on disks in text form? </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1210;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",YDUBINSKY
