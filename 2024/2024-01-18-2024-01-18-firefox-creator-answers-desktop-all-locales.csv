Then, when I move the mouse to hover over the menu, the menu vanishes.  If, instead, I hold down the mouse button, I can move over the menu without it disappearing. </p><p>I'm using a focus-follows-mouse window manager (VTWM) and I think, somehow, Firefox is getting a focus change message when the mouse moves onto the menu.  I think this because of the way the Firefox titlebar flickers from showing it's the active window to the inactive window, then active again, once the menu disappears. </p><p>Please advise. </p><p>Thanks, Richard </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-11560;firefox-1156;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",rellwood
