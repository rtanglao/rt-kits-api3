I like to drag links/youtube videos to new tabs instead of right clicking/middle click.

The sound quality in the Mozilla browser is worse than in Edge, regardless of the site, whether it’s watching a movie, a video on YouTube, or just listening to music. I tried a completely new profile, without my settings, without extensions, and everything else, the problem did not disappear. It feels like the browser’s audio codec just compresses the sound quality. I will attach 2 documents: Application Information and Raw Data I will also leave a link to a short video clip where I compared the sound quality between Edge and Firefox in the browser version of Deezer, as an example, so you better understand what I’m talking about. <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NhUoYTm_6uMpypt5uMBUCNt1QbOMviEw/view?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">Google Drive Link</a> </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;,firefox,other,en-US,1631307;,darkwarhammerbykhorus

Firefox on Mac and Windows, if a login password exists, allows us to require authentication to autofill, view or edit saved credit cards. Firefox on Linux doesn't allow this authentication. So, I'm guessing that the credit card information is stored in Linux in an insecure manner. This is true?  Another question about Mac and Windows. Does requiring authentication for credit card processes mean that the card information is encrypted on disk? Or does the password only protect information from unauthorized viewing, and the cards are stored on disks in text form? </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1210;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",YDUBINSKY
