I have narrowed the issue of detection of Trojan:HTML/Phish!pz by MS Defender While running Glary Utilities. (see screenshot). </p> <hr> <p>Jeremy, Thank you for your rapid response. I connected to 3 different VPN servers, and used the link you provided (<a href=""https://user-support.firetrust.com/Tickets/Reply/36314"" rel=""nofollow"">https://user-support.firetrust.com/Tickets/Reply/36314</a>) below via Firefox, Chrome, and Edge. Connections to Seattle, Dallas, and Washington DC all produced the same result as before ONLY with Firefox. The issue WAS NOT reproduced by Chrome or Edge. I hope this helps resolve the problem because, I have issues with both Edge and Chrome. Particularly with their self-serving propensities. </p><p>Rodman L Browning [edited] @hotmail.com ________________________________________ -System: -Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz   3.40 GHz -Installed RAM: 32.0 GB -Device ID  3B29AE3B-C784-4651-9123-A91B7C41393A -Product ID 00330-80000-00000-AA737 -System OS: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor - -MS Defender v1.403.1528.0 -Created 1/2/2024 3:58am -Last updated 01/02/2024 11:51am - -Glary Utilities Pro v6.4.0.7 -VPN: Hideaway by Firetrust Limited v4.20.4 </p><p>- <img> - This MS Defender notice occurred during a 1-Click Maintenance/Temporary File Cleaner; - file: C:\Users\Rodman\AppData\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\wg6stjgb.default-release-1640201893394 \cache2\entries\08D20F0659D23D2EF0621F044374EA076FED5146 -An immediate 1-Click Maintenance/Temporary File Cleaner produces no notices (I assume because the Trojan has been quarantined).
