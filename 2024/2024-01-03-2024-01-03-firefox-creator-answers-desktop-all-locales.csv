I used that in a few local scripts, and created a shortcut to the executable, with this path:  </p><p><em>""C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe -private""</em> </p><p>Just like that, it worked. Whether by shortcut, terminal command, or execution of a 3rd party script, that startup switch would always open a private browsing window. Until a few months ago, that is, when it suddenly stopped working. Rather than opening a private browsing window, it now does one of two things: </p><p>1. If FF was not already running, it opens FF to a tab showing a warning that I am not in private browsing, with a button I can click to launch a private browsing window. (see attached image) This tells me it recognized the startup switch, but...refused to honor it? 2. If a FF window is already open, it launches another (non-private) Firefox window, with no warning about not being in Private Browsing mode. </p><p>Was this an intentional change? Is that startup switch just not supported anymore? I tried a quick web search, but all I was finding were unhelpful suggestions like ""right click on the FF icon"" and ""pin to start.""

I recently found that eBay was able to confidently identify me when I would not have expected. By the way, I work in tech, often dealing with security and basic privacy.  I am well aware of ""fingerprinting,"" but typically that is used to break up people into subsets, or cohorts, not individually identify the user. And of course, even when it does, it typically won't show/tell the user that it has successfully done so. Anyway, here's what happened: </p><p>1. I visited eBay using FF's ""Private browsing"" in ""Strict"" mode, over a VPN connecting to country ""alpha"". This was running directly on the host OS of Windows 10, with a non-default (but common) window size, and one very common browser plugin. eBay marked me as belonging to the country of my VPN endpoint, and set the region and currency accordingly. 2. I close the private browsing window, change VPN endpoint to country ""beta"", and re-connect to eBay. It still recognizes the previous region settings, even though my VPN endpoint is in a different country. Thinking maybe cookies were not wiped until the browser session was completely terminated, I go a little further; 3. Close all browsing tabs, go to settings, and manually clear all data (cookies, cache, etc.). Change VPN endpoint again. 4. Connect to eBay again. It still recognizes me. Note that I have not changed any other signals about the session. Browser window size has not changed, still the same OS, the same browser version, the same browser plugin. I did these tests in quick succession, which could also be a signal to them. But this session did not carry a cookie, and was coming from a different IP address. All cached data had been cleared (supposedly, at least). </p><p>Is eBay's fingerprinting just that good, that they actually identify me individually, without a cookie and coming from halfway around the world? Or is there some other tracker or signal they are able to follow me with, to re-identify me? </p><p>I was running FF on a transparent virtualization layer, so I just wiped all data stored by FF since the testing started, switched to another VPN endpoint, and just like that, eBay had no idea who I was again. But why didn't FF's Private browsing, or the built-in data wipe (cookies &amp; cache) de-identify me? It can't see it having been advanced fingerprinting, or it would have seen through me wiping the virtualization layer. </p><p>Thank you! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1210;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Figure8565

Alcune voci potrebbero non essere abilitate."". </p><p>Finchè sono file pdf o documenti in word va tutto bene, però i file eseguibili non li esegue e devo mettermi a cambiare i permessi a questi file.

I have narrowed the issue of detection of Trojan:HTML/Phish!pz by MS Defender While running Glary Utilities. (see screenshot). </p> <hr> <p>Jeremy, Thank you for your rapid response. I connected to 3 different VPN servers, and used the link you provided (<a href=""https://user-support.firetrust.com/Tickets/Reply/36314"" rel=""nofollow"">https://user-support.firetrust.com/Tickets/Reply/36314</a>) below via Firefox, Chrome, and Edge. Connections to Seattle, Dallas, and Washington DC all produced the same result as before ONLY with Firefox. The issue WAS NOT reproduced by Chrome or Edge. I hope this helps resolve the problem because, I have issues with both Edge and Chrome. Particularly with their self-serving propensities. </p><p>Rodman L Browning [edited] @hotmail.com ________________________________________ -System: -Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3770 CPU @ 3.40GHz   3.40 GHz -Installed RAM: 32.0 GB -Device ID  3B29AE3B-C784-4651-9123-A91B7C41393A -Product ID 00330-80000-00000-AA737 -System OS: Windows 10 Pro 64-bit operating system, x64-based processor - -MS Defender v1.403.1528.0 -Created 1/2/2024 3:58am -Last updated 01/02/2024 11:51am - -Glary Utilities Pro v6.4.0.7 -VPN: Hideaway by Firetrust Limited v4.20.4 </p><p>- <img> - This MS Defender notice occurred during a 1-Click Maintenance/Temporary File Cleaner; - file: C:\Users\Rodman\AppData\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\wg6stjgb.default-release-1640201893394 \cache2\entries\08D20F0659D23D2EF0621F044374EA076FED5146 -An immediate 1-Click Maintenance/Temporary File Cleaner produces no notices (I assume because the Trojan has been quarantined).
