Tried on several different PCs and several different 64bit PKCS#11 drivers for different smart cards. </p><p>When I try to load e.g. C:\Windows\SysWOW64\eop2v1czep11.dll for the <a href=""https://info.identitaobcana.cz/eOP/OvladaceKarty.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Czech eID</a>, it returns ""Unable to add module"". When I do the same from C:\Windows\System32\eop2v1czep11.dll, it works. </p><p>The issue is that some issuers of qualified and commercial certificates (like e.g. <a href=""https://www.kb.cz/en/certification-services-kb"" rel=""nofollow"">Komerční banka</a>) do not issue a 32bit version of PKCS#11 drivers for their smart cards anymore and the only driver available is C:\Windows\SysWOW64\mopkcs11.dll, which cannot be loaded by Firefox or Thunderbird either. </p><p>I don't see a problem in implementing the support for 64bit PKCS drivers in a 64bit browser and a 64bit email client.

In my job search window, I have many tabs open for different job postings that I want to hang on to /keep track of. When I want to jump to one of these tabs, I open a new tab and type in whatever its title would be, and then when it pops up in my history I click the ""Switch to tab"" shortcut to get to it. I find it saves time as opposed to sifting through 50 tabs. In this case, I was trying to find a tab that was opened to a sales job posting, and I clicked switch to tab. However, it took me to a what I think is an entirely separate window, one that I didn't even have open previously, and my jobs window disappeared. I tried to reopen it in History, but it didn't show up. Does anyone know what might have happened here, and how I can recover that window? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1220;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",emiller358
