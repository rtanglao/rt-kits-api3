Herhaaldelijk proberen bood geen oplossing. Ik kreeg steeds het scherm zoals in de bijlage. Ik heb Firefox verwijderd en opnieuw gedownload; alles werkt nu perfect maar ik krijg steeds het scherm zoals in de bijlage als ik de computer opstart of gebruik. Ook het woordenboek werkt niet meer ook al is hij aangeklikt in de 'Add-Ons' Op het scherm komt wel een rode lijn als het woord foutief is maar ik kan het niet aanpassen via het gebruik van de rechtermuisknop. Gelieve mij, stap voor stap, uit te leggen hoe ik dat kan oplossen. Met vriendelijke groeten.

I've used both Gmail and Firefox for years and have never had a problem, but I now get stuck in an endless loop on the Gmail login page. I select my account, enter my password, then get sent back to the account selection page. </p><p>The problem seems to be relating to me trying to link two Gmail addresses so that mail from one is forwarded to the other. I set up one account this way without any issue, but when I went to do it with a different account, I got an error code. After that, I was logged out of Gmail in Firefox and haven't been able to log back in. </p><p>Things I've tried so far: </p> <ul><li> <strong>Using a different browser</strong>. I can log in without issues in Chrome. </li><li> <strong>Logging in with a different method</strong>. Neither my password nor my passkey work. </li><li> <strong>Logging in with a different Gmail account</strong>. All of my accounts seem to be stuck in this way. </li><li> <strong>Disabling all my extensions</strong>. This doesn't help. </li><li> <strong>Clearing Firefox's cache</strong>. No luck here. </li><li> <strong>Restarting Firefox and restarting my PC</strong>. Turning it off and on again doesn't fix it. </li><li> <strong>Contacting Google support</strong>. They said they think it's a browser issue as I don't have any problems using Chrome. </li><li> <strong>Using Firefox's private browsing mode</strong>. This <em>does</em> work and I can log in to Gmail. However, I don't know exactly what the problem is because I've disabled all my extensions and cleared the cache in regular browsing mode and still can't log in that way. </li></ul> <p>So I have a partial solution (using Firefox's private browsing mode) but it's not a long-term fix. What else can I try? Has anyone else seen this problem before and been able to fix it? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1646994;1646996;,alexblake2
