When I use the mouse wheel on Google Sheets, the screen will not scroll bit by bit, but suddenly the scroll will go to the bottom and right. </p><p>Sorry, I am a Chinese user. Using GOOGLE translation assistance, the semantics cannot be very precise. You can refer to the screen recording, </p><p><a href=""https://youtu.be/Gox7DGHb8gE"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/Gox7DGHb8gE</a>  </p><p>Thanks for the help </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,other,en-US,"",kulolido

I started to download a file from Envato elements, and firefox asked me where I wanted to put it, so I pointed it to a dropbox folder on my finder level (I'm on a Mac computer). Some pop up showed up that said it didnt like the directory so I hit ok. Then I tried to download again to another location but now firefox won't ask me where i want to download the file to. And instead it just populates a file in the downloads folder called ""7gp69ST8.mp4.part"" or something similar. If I uncheck ""Always ask you where to save files"", the whole file downloads just fine to the downloads folder but I dont want that setting, I want the check mark ON so that it asks me each time where to save the file to. But its not asking me any more. So I hit quit on firefox and came back in and the issue persisted. I cleared the cookies and the issue persisted. Please help me fix this. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",rachelcenter
