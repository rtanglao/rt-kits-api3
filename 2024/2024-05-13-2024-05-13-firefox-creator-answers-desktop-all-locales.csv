I'm sure these local idiots are just being lazy/stupid so I'd like Mozilla to stick a rocket up their dumb-asses.

Some pop up showed up that said it didnt like the directory so I hit ok. Then I tried to download again to another location but now firefox won't ask me where i want to download the file to. And instead it just populates a file in the downloads folder called ""7gp69ST8.mp4.part"" or something similar. If I uncheck ""Always ask you where to save files"", the whole file downloads just fine to the downloads folder but I dont want that setting, I want the check mark ON so that it asks me each time where to save the file to. But its not asking me any more. So I hit quit on firefox and came back in and the issue persisted. I cleared the cookies and the issue persisted.
