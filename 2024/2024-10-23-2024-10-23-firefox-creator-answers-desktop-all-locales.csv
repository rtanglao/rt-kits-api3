It is my preferred browser. I also use YouTube a lot. Recently, when I go to YouTube home page I get video suggestions but no search bar to search for vids. If I click on one of the videos and bring one up then the YouTube search bar appears above that video. However, this is a deal breaker for me.  I am not willing to take that extra step every time I want to search for a particular video. If I open up YouTube in the Chrome browser I get the search bar which is great but pisses me off as I feel that Google has forced me to use their browser.  I pay for YouTube Premium and I will cancel it if I cannot resolve the problem of the missing search bar in Firefox. I have added no extensions since well before this problem has occurred and I have searched the web for a solution to no avail. If anyone has a suggestion for how to resolve this It would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. </p>",firefox;browse;firefox-1310;firefox-13103;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",kdautel9

I bought a new laptop that I'm trying to sync, and every time I try, it either claims the password is wrong or the 2fa code is wrong. Every so often it will work, I will get the prompt to download Firefox for mobile too, but then after that screen it appears I'm disconnected again. I tried resetting the password and I got an ""unexpected error"". Any idea what's going on? </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",alex2iou
