That setting also stops you moving a tab to a new window at all - you have to copy the url and open a new window and navigate to the URL. </p><p>Any idea what might be happening?

To type any indic language I have ibus framework and m17n-db engine to type the indic language. Now the problem is the system where it will be used is login as root user. And it is being advised not to open the firefox with root user. However, there is command which actually allow the user to open with any user other than root. I am using this command  ""sudo -H -E -u user firefox test.html""  The test.html is just textarea where I want to type an indic language available in m17n engine. This is perfectly working fine in Ubuntu 16 with firefox version 54. But the same this is not working in Ubuntu 22 with any latest or inbuilt firefox comes with Ubuntu 22. However, if I logged in as normal user , then it works perfectly fine.  </p><p>I have tried many thing , setting environment in .bashrc of root user so that it get the m17n language but still not working. The one thing which I noticed is , XKB layout is working in both the case with or without user. I am not sure what exactly changes are implemented in the build of firefox which is stopping to type the indic language in the firefox if open with above command. Any specific security check which is causing the problem. Can I just disable it from config page&nbsp;?
