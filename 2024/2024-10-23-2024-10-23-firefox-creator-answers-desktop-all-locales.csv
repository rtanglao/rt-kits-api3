I then went through the “Adding exceptions for HTTP websites"" procedure which then allowed me to access the bank account. Since I had a second account, I also added this to the exceptions. To my surprise this did not work, and the first bank account did not either. I also disabled the “Don’t enable HTTPS-Only Mode"" option available during the initial setup. This made no difference to the problem. I would appreciate any help in resolving this Problem. Ian Duncan. </p>",settings;firefox;firefox-1310;firefox-13103;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",eand1939

I will note, however, that signing out entirely and then signing back in does get me from signed out to signed in despite not correcting this error. </p><p>In case it would help I attempted to change my password via the account menu, but it says that my <em>definitely correct</em> password (I used the exact same entry from my clipboard successfully to sign in moments ago) is incorrect, and attempting to use the ""forgot my password"" menu gives me the error ""Unexpected error"" instead of doing anything, which is not very helpful.  My password remains unchanged.

This feature allows users to keep their work and personal browsing completely distinct. The question focuses on how users can set up, switch, and manage these profiles efficiently. </p><p>Key follow-up considerations could include: </p><p>How do profiles work within Firefox's ecosystem? What benefits do multiple profiles offer? Can Firefox profiles sync across devices? This question addresses the need for better organization in browsing and taps into a feature that isn't always utilized to its full potential. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1683610;,alenmark388

That setting also stops you moving a tab to a new window at all - you have to copy the url and open a new window and navigate to the URL. </p><p>Any idea what might be happening? I've searched several times over the last few months and the only hits I get are 4 years old (and recommend turning off tab tearing at all). </p><p>Thanks, </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",wgmoffatt

So you follow the official <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/install-firefox-linux#w_install-firefox-deb-package-for-debian-based-distributions-recommended"" rel=""nofollow"">installation instruction</a> only to get hit in the punch once more: </p><p>`Get:11 <a href=""https://packages.mozilla.org/apt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://packages.mozilla.org/apt</a> mozilla/main all Packages [27.4 MB] Get:12 <a href=""https://packages.mozilla.org/apt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://packages.mozilla.org/apt</a> mozilla/main amd64 Packages [479 kB]` </p><p>Yeah so every time you run apt update from now, you are going to have to download 30 megabytes of garbage.

To type any indic language I have ibus framework and m17n-db engine to type the indic language. Now the problem is the system where it will be used is login as root user. And it is being advised not to open the firefox with root user. However, there is command which actually allow the user to open with any user other than root. I am using this command  ""sudo -H -E -u user firefox test.html""  The test.html is just textarea where I want to type an indic language available in m17n engine. This is perfectly working fine in Ubuntu 16 with firefox version 54. But the same this is not working in Ubuntu 22 with any latest or inbuilt firefox comes with Ubuntu 22. However, if I logged in as normal user , then it works perfectly fine.  </p><p>I have tried many thing , setting environment in .bashrc of root user so that it get the m17n language but still not working. The one thing which I noticed is , XKB layout is working in both the case with or without user. I am not sure what exactly changes are implemented in the build of firefox which is stopping to type the indic language in the firefox if open with above command. Any specific security check which is causing the problem. Can I just disable it from config page&nbsp;?

It is my preferred browser. I also use YouTube a lot. Recently, when I go to YouTube home page I get video suggestions but no search bar to search for vids. If I click on one of the videos and bring one up then the YouTube search bar appears above that video. However, this is a deal breaker for me.  I am not willing to take that extra step every time I want to search for a particular video. If I open up YouTube in the Chrome browser I get the search bar which is great but pisses me off as I feel that Google has forced me to use their browser.  I pay for YouTube Premium and I will cancel it if I cannot resolve the problem of the missing search bar in Firefox. I have added no extensions since well before this problem has occurred and I have searched the web for a solution to no avail. If anyone has a suggestion for how to resolve this It would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. </p>",firefox;browse;firefox-1310;firefox-13103;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",kdautel9
