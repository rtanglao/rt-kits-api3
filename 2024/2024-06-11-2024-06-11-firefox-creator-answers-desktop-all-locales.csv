I recently have found my FireFox browser closing my first attempt to open and upon opening my second attempt Firefox will open but give me a pink address bar with a robot stating ""browser is under remote control (reason: Dev Tools)"" and the only thing that seems to get rid of this temporarily is going to my control panel (I'm a windows user) and toggling the remote assistance checkbox (I keep it unchecked since this problem has occurred). Then after re-opening Firefox again, it appears to work normally - no pink address bar with robot. Is there a permanent fix for this? Is it an OS issue or a Firefox issue? Maybe both? Any insight would be greatly appreciated. I am fairly tech savvy, but not too familiar with browser interfaces and solutions involving the command line. </p><p>Thank you, </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1656854;,whitcomb61915

This happens again if I pause/unpause or if I seek forward/backward on a video. The video ""spinning animation"" will appear and it will take 2-3 seconds for the video to start. This happens immediately, even if I click pause/start fast (ie: this is not after some delay necessarily). Also, if I mute audio on the video, the issue does not manifest itself. </p><p>During the waiting, Firefox itself seem to be hanging: for instance if I click on an extension icon in the toolbar, nothing will happen until the video finally start playing and then the extension menu will open up </p><p>When using Google Meet or Zoom for instance, I sometimes have to wait up to 10 seconds or so before Bluetooth Audio/Microphone starts after I've joined a meeting. </p><p>The issue is not specific to these platforms: I experience the same issue on other platforms such as Facebook, dailymotion, vimeo, zoom. On Facebook, since videos start muted, I can see the videos start playing right away, and then if I unmute sound the video stops, and start again with sound after 3 seconds or so </p><p>The issue does NOT manifest itself when playing an audio-only stream: ex Soundcloud or local radio stations audio stream </p><p>Things I've tried and didn't help - Troubleshoot mode - Different Firefox profile - Different Firefox install - Restarting my system </p><p>This feels like Firefox/macOS is waiting for Bluetooth to activate, or something like that. I have a feeling this only happens for certain types of video/audio codecs but I am not sure how to validate that (ex: no issues on soundcloud, petron audio-only posts).  </p><p>The problem is entirely non-existent when I'm using sound output that is not Bluetooth. </p><p>This does not happen with other browsers otherwise I wouldn't be posting here&nbsp;:) </p><p>macOS 14.5, M1 Macbook Pro </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1656837;,jf.cron0

If there's any pattern to what causes it, I haven't been able to notice it; sometimes it happens as soon as I open the browser, sometimes it happens after several hours, sometimes it happens twice in ten minutes, sometimes it happens twice in a few hours (however, I can count the number of days it's happened less than twice in one day in the past few weeks on the fingers of one hand). When the browser freezes, it becomes totally unresponsive - it doesn't fade or display ""Not Responding"", and Task Manager shows nothing abnormal, but it doesn't accept any input at all, any video or other animated material that may have been displaying freezes, and it can only be ""fixed"" by force quitting from the task manager and reopening. This is exclusively a firefox issue; other programs open at the same time as the browser freezes are not affected. </p><p>The only real lead I have as to what could be going on is that sometimes, things don't freeze all at once, but in a cascading effect. For example, tabs, bookmarks, etc. might not highlight when moused over, but still accept the clicks, or selecting another tab might causes the address bar to display the URL of the selected tab, but the screen displayed in the window will not change. Once these cascading changes start, they generally progress to total freeze before I have a chance to do much with that information (only a few seconds), but it's unusual enough behavior to be worth noticing. </p><p>Things I've already tried that haven't fixed the issue: </p> <ul><li> Reducing the number of tabs used and otherwise reducing Firefox's system resource usage has not impacted the problem in any way. </li><li> Running in Troubleshoot Mode has not had a consistent effect on the problem (the most recent time I did, the browser ran stably for longer than I could stand to use the internet without my ad blocker, but this is only one data point in an already inconsistent spread; prior instances of the problem have occurred in Troubleshoot Mode) </li><li> Disabling hardware acceleration has not fixed the issue. </li><li> The issue has persisted through multiple refreshes and at least one full uninstall and clean reinstall. </li><li> The issue persisted after creating and switching to a new profile multiple times. </li><li> The issue persisted after renaming places.sqlite </li><li> The issue persisted after clearing cache and cookies multiple times. </li><li> The issue persisted after clearing downloads and history. </li><li> And very likely some other stuff that I'm forgetting, I've been trying to fix this on my own for a while now. </li></ul>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1656856;1656858;,8bitorne
