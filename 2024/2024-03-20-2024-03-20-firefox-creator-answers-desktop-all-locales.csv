It takes me in a seemingly infinite loop. On the Cloudflare community site they say it could be because of things like adblock but even without any adblock or anything of the sort on it does the same thing. Sadly Cloudflare community doesn't support being used on Firefox. So maybe they don't support being used on Firefox in general? I have contacted the actual websites support but they don't seem to even read submitted inquiries because I never hear anything back from them except the automated message they received it. It is now preventing me from using certain things in general which as before it wasn't that big of a deal but recently they changed the site layout and still allowed you to use the old layout but the verification blocks you from using the old layout. The first one is one from a couple of weeks ago when it only effected me trying to open things in a separate tab and the second one is the newer one which prevents me from accessing the old layout. I'm not sure what to do about it since nothing I specifically could do to solve it has helped.
