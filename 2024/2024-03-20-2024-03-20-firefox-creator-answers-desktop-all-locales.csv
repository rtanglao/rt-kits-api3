I use PocketSmith accounting software and some its functions do not work since the last Firefox update. The same problem exists regardless of which computer I use. The common factor is Firefox. The problem does not occur if I use a private window in Firefox or use a Chrome browser. PocketSmith have run extensive checks and the problem does not appear to be at their end. </p><p>2. I can no longer log in to my eBay account, unless I use a private window or Chrome. I can enter my user name but am unable to progress to the password window. Again this occurs regardless of the computer I use. Both are Mac desktops. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;website-breakages;firefox-1230;firefox-12301;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1643135;,timsjaj
