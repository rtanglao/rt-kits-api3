They are each 2KB and contain only an empty tab with the URL ""about:home"". There are three additional files starting with ""upgrade"" but they are from too long ago, so they don't contain the tabs I require. </li></ul> <p>The contents of these tabs are vitally important for my work, so this is causing me significant stress. If anyone can suggest ways to recover my previous tab beyond the documented fixes, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you so much to anyone who can help! </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",king__lego

Now, when I load google map webpage, the map loads normally with all the street, country, road names, then 1 second later, all those texts disappear. I've disabled all Plugins, delete cache, load a brand new profile, without effects. Note that if I use a user agent switcher plugin and choose any Mobile versions (but not a desktop version), the names load (and stay) normally. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",gustavklopp
