Then, the PiP window becomes activated, and I have to toggle back to the window I was working on before (on which I wanted to change language). I have the ""separate languages for separate windows"" option activated. </li></ul> <p>It's been some months now, and all those things were working before an update but never came back... </p><p>Does anyone know if there's a way of fixing these issues?
