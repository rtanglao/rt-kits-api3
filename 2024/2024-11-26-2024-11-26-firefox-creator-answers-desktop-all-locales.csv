Sometimes it doesn't let me interact with the start bar, other times it just crashes. On the other hand, the browser cache is really annoying for a web developer. We need some partial cache clearing or another system similar to Chromium. I try to stick with Firefox since I've been using it for over 10 years, but I'm almost forced to switch to Chrome if it has so many problems. Thanks in advance. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,es,"",jegico93

Wanneer ik bvb vanaf you-tube of eender welke site waar ofwel muziek/geluid wordt afgespeeld, een interview of podcast of andere geluidsfragmenten en switch naar andere site of tabblad loopt het geluid van de site welk ik verlaat enkele fragmenten door, soms met onderbrekingen. Dit vind ik dan geweldig storend en is de reden ook waarom ik Firefox in het verleden reeds heb verwijderd van pc .. Toch weer toe gevoegd en helaas nog steeds zelfde probleem dus heeft u enige bruikbare tips, hoor ik dit graag, ik wil niet onmiddellijk over gaan tot opnieuw verwijderen ...
