Very familiar using desktop. For some reason, about a couple weeks ago, some of my sites have begun using google adds, over and over. When I click on the ""X"", wants to know why, etc. I use Malware Bytes, scans every day. Does NOT discover any malware, but I KNOW something has changed to allow the bombardment! Is it possible it's just a single site that I had to change and log in to? Even if so, WHY doesn't Malware stop them? Should I try a system restore to weeks ago?
