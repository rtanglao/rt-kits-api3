I did found solutions for older verions of firefox, and some addons, but nothing that's native or current.  </p><p>I think having history is incredibly useful short term, lets say a week or some days, but I don't think I have ever had to dig trough my old history for something. Usually what you need is to find some page you closed recently or something. And while I would like to use deleting history after closing browser, it interferes with stuff that I'm logged in, reopening tabs after closing etc. And ofc, it actually deletes history which is useful short term.  </p><p>This is both request for help and improvement. It would be nice to have option on ""clear history when firefox closes"" settings, to delete any selected data older than set number of days for instance. Or if there already isn't, something similar in about:config. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1260;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",em9ozjksey9
