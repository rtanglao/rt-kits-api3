When it is turned on, this new feature on the developer tools is causing extreme slowdown and substantially slowing down my debugging time by taking 30+ seconds for my variables to show up in the scope every time I move around breakpoints. Is there any solution to this problem? If not, I would please ask for this feature to be removed or optimized so it doesn't impede with my development time since it worked just fine before and the variables showed up instantly before the update. Otherwise, I will have to stick with an older version of Firefox until this issue is fixed since I use it extensively for my debugging needs. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1630255;,giorgycasta

But since I stalled Firefox I just have problems . Yesterday no tab would connect to the internet....today email links don't open in a new tab. And when I decide to exit and close Firefox and I open Firefox again I automatically see all the previous tabs. Even though I exited before. It should ask me if I want to restore my previous session, right? But it doesn't.  </p><p>I am not computer savvy  and reading articles is not helping me bc I only understand half of what you guys are talking about.  </p><p>I really need help or I have to uninstall and go again with Google which I don't want. </p><p>Thank you very much </p><p>Britta </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-11;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",brittatiarks

It did in the past and I didn't have any problems but lately I'm having these problems happening on sites I've used for years.  If I use another browser it will work with no problem. In fact after talking with some of the support people at some of the sites that won't work, the suggest trying another browser which works fine. I'm talking like American Express' website which I use a lot.  There are other sites other than credit cards that are not working correctly and again, their support agent will tell me to use another browser.  I have tried different remedies like clearing cache, history, etc.  I only use few addons like AdBlock which helps to cut down on trackers and information gathers.  I have set my preferences to clear out my history and cookies.  I have used Firefox for so many years without problems and with the same addons without any problems.  So what is causing this to happen?  I do enjoy using Firefox but if I have to keep changing over to another browser so sites will work, then maybe it's time for me to stop using Firefox. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",bussysconsultant
