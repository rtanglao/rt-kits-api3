I am fully aware that the Windows Scaling and Layout is a Micro$oft problem. But I found a fix somewhere for Firefox that changed the top of the screen in Firefox (the menu bar, etc.), which took all of 30 seconds to fix. It was a simple about:config edit.  </p><p>Yesterday I discovered that <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a> can be set up in Thunderbird, which I did not know previously, so I installed it and set my email up the way I had it on my Window 7 desktop that half of the stuff for )KB, Mouse, etc.) disappeared when my kids moved my house while I was in the hospital. This laptop has Windows 10, and everything was fine, although I could barely read a lot of text on it, until I set the Scaling and Layout to 150%. After that the text was big enough for me to read, but the header and footer in Firefox took up most of the screen. I looked around and found a fix. Now I need something similar for Thunderbird. </p><p>Just like before, every post I've read is talking about how to make fonts bigger. That isn't the problem I need to fix. CTRL + Fixes that just fine. I'm talking about the very top of the screen, where the menu bar and page tabs are. On my 23"" monitor, I took a standard plastic ruler and this area is just under two inches, where as in Thunderbird it's over three. </p><p>I'm getting old, and my memory isn't what it used to be, but I think I changed the <strong>ui.textScaleFactor</strong> to 100, but while Thunderbird has that field, it has three options and I don't want to mess with that until I am advised on the proper way to address this issue. At minimum, I would at least like the tabs to be smaller, but if I could the headers to be the same size as Firefox, that would be ideal. </p><p>Thank you in advance and Happy New Year! </p><p>Axel Slingerland Eureka, California </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-1130;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",axslingerland

When it is turned on, this new feature on the developer tools is causing extreme slowdown and substantially slowing down my debugging time by taking 30+ seconds for my variables to show up in the scope every time I move around breakpoints. Is there any solution to this problem? If not, I would please ask for this feature to be removed or optimized so it doesn't impede with my development time since it worked just fine before and the variables showed up instantly before the update. Otherwise, I will have to stick with an older version of Firefox until this issue is fixed since I use it extensively for my debugging needs. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1630255;,giorgycasta

It did in the past and I didn't have any problems but lately I'm having these problems happening on sites I've used for years.  If I use another browser it will work with no problem. In fact after talking with some of the support people at some of the sites that won't work, the suggest trying another browser which works fine. I'm talking like American Express' website which I use a lot.  There are other sites other than credit cards that are not working correctly and again, their support agent will tell me to use another browser.  I have tried different remedies like clearing cache, history, etc.  I only use few addons like AdBlock which helps to cut down on trackers and information gathers.  I have set my preferences to clear out my history and cookies.  I have used Firefox for so many years without problems and with the same addons without any problems.  So what is causing this to happen?  I do enjoy using Firefox but if I have to keep changing over to another browser so sites will work, then maybe it's time for me to stop using Firefox. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",bussysconsultant
