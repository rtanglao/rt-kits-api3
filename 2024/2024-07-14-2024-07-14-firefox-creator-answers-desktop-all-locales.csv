When opening a pdf link, i need the file to open in browser, don't want it to download 2. When opening from download history, i want it to open in my pdf software </p><p>I believe this was the default in old firefox(some years ago). Currently if i set it to open in browser, point 1 will work but  2 won't (i have to right click and choose ""open in xx app"") if i set it to always open in other app, 2 will work but 1 won't. Back then i tried some settings which downloads the file to temp folder and open from there, i don't want that (not needed the file in download history) pls let me know if there is a solution. Thanks </p>",desktop;windows-10;firefox-1280;customize-settings-and-preferences;,firefox,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",ar.v

I really try to get away from google, so I searched extensively and found out: profiles do indeed exist as a feature in Firefox. My question now is: why are there no buttons or easily accessible settings (for example in connection with sync-settings) for using profiles and why does one need to type in strange things in the address bar to access the feature and even to start another instance of firefox with another profile? </p><p>My use case is this: I have a private profile, one for my job and one for union stuff which I don't want to mix into my job profile. Yet, on my home computer I'd like to have all three profiles running simultaneously. Sometimes one or more profiled windows have been closed down and I need to open a new window with a specific profile. I understand that I need to open a tab, type ""about:profiles"" and then scroll through a page with large amounts of techy information on all profiles and press the last one of four buttons under that profile. </p><p>I'm quite tech-savvy and typing ""about:profiles"" is doable for me, but it seems absurd, given that the feature is not sci-fi and is well visually accessible in other browsers (Chrome and Brave: rightclick on profilesymbol and choose from simple list). </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1280;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",mak2
