(I have ""Stage Manager"" turned off because that was causing weird delays when trying to click on a window behind another one to bring it forward. I only mention this because it means my desktop only has the system menu on my main monitor, the laptop.) </p><p>When I open a new window in Firefox, it continually opens the new window on the external display, which is not what I want. I would prefer that it open the new window on the monitor where the currently active window is located. </p><p>I read some posts about ""dragging a window to the monitor you want to open new ones on, maximize, minimize, turn around three times"" or something like that. Not only does that not work, other than maybe temporarily, it also seems silly. </p><p>Is there no way to reliably open new windows on the currently active monitor, or least the main one? Or any planned fixes related to this? </p><p>Thanks for your input. </p>",desktop;troubleshooting;firefox-1280;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",philipglevy

When I try to open the Photoroom website at <a href=""https://photoroomaiapk.pro/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://photoroomaiapk.pro/</a> in Firefox, the site completely hangs and becomes unresponsive. My laptop essentially freezes anytime I attempt to use this site in Firefox. </p><p>However, when I open the same Photoroom website in other browsers like Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, the site loads and functions normally without any hanging or freezing issues. This leads me to believe there is some kind of incompatibility between the editing site and Firefox specifically. </p><p>I have tried clearing my browser cache/cookies, restarting Firefox in safe mode, and updating to the latest version of Firefox, but nothing seems to resolve the problems using Photoroom in Firefox. The site will begin loading but then become completely unresponsive and everything freezes. I can't click on anything or even force quit Firefox once it hangs. I have to manually reboot my laptop every time. </p><p>Has anyone else experienced issues with using the <a href=""https://photoroomaiapk.pro/photoroom-ai-photo-editor-for-pc/"" rel=""nofollow"">Photoroom Photo Editor for PC</a> on the Firefox browser? </p><p>Are there any known fixes or workarounds that can allow the Photoroom website to function properly in Firefox? </p><p>I rely on this photo editing tool for work and need to be able to use it in my preferred Firefox browser rather than switching to Chrome or Edge. </p><p>Any advice on how to resolve the freezing/hanging problems when trying to use Photoroom in Firefox would be greatly appreciated! </p><p>Thanks! </p>","",firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",Robertdan

I really try to get away from google, so I searched extensively and found out: profiles do indeed exist as a feature in Firefox. My question now is: why are there no buttons or easily accessible settings (for example in connection with sync-settings) for using profiles and why does one need to type in strange things in the address bar to access the feature and even to start another instance of firefox with another profile? </p><p>My use case is this: I have a private profile, one for my job and one for union stuff which I don't want to mix into my job profile. Yet, on my home computer I'd like to have all three profiles running simultaneously. Sometimes one or more profiled windows have been closed down and I need to open a new window with a specific profile. I understand that I need to open a tab, type ""about:profiles"" and then scroll through a page with large amounts of techy information on all profiles and press the last one of four buttons under that profile. </p><p>I'm quite tech-savvy and typing ""about:profiles"" is doable for me, but it seems absurd, given that the feature is not sci-fi and is well visually accessible in other browsers (Chrome and Brave: rightclick on profilesymbol and choose from simple list). </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1280;,firefox,sync,en-US,1661852;,mak2
