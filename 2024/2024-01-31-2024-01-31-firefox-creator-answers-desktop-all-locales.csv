When I have a decent number of tabs open, firefox will often randomly decide to lock up completely. GUI is almost entirely unresponsive. I can right click the menu bar area and get the Menu Bar/Bookmark Options/etc. context menu, but it's also screwed up (2 options that are normally there are completely missing). This has occurred for a year or so. Originally, I used the snap version but recently backed up and switched to installing from .deb. Still the same issue. I saw recommendations for turning off hardware acceleration, and that didn't prevent the problem. Running `top`, I see that I always have plenty of memory (at least 10G free) free and worst case 1 thread is being run 100% but the others are hardly being utilized. No crash reports are generated (I will pkill firefox to stop it). Addons and extensions are all disabled. </p><p>I recently realized that hitting the windows key with firefox frozen will allow the web page to show again, but it's back to frozen. I keep hitting the windows key, and it will unfreeze just momentarily to show me the current webpage that is up. I can also Ctrl+N and open a new window, and the new window works perfectly fine independent of the completely frozen first window. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;ubuntu-2204;firefox-1220;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",veto1024

The problem is not that the tabs themselves are lost -- the ""Reopen Closed Tab"" drop-down menu entry is still available on right-click, and seems to function as expected. Similarly, I checked about:config to see if there was a problem with sessionstore or sessionrestore, both of which are at their default settings and can't be causing this. Rather, something about the combination itself is no longer working. </p><p>I ran Firefox in Troubleshoot Mode to see if any of my settings were causing this. The problem persisted there, so that doesn't seem to be the case. </p><p>A little over a month ago, I got a new phone and synced up my desktop and mobile (Android) Firefox tabs, which I hadn't done previously. This is really the only thing I can think of that would lead to any issues, but it's impossible to match the timeframes -- I noticed this problem today, five hours ago. (The failure for ctrl+shift+t to work includes tabs that were opened from mobile sync.) I make heavy use of this keyboard shortcut and would've noticed it earlier if it started earlier. </p><p>Something about Ctrl+Shift+T itself is not properly being 'translated'. Ctrl+T works as expected (opens a blank tab), which is the same thing the Shift version is doing. Both my Ctrl and Shift keys are working fine in other respects (e.g. shift key capitalizes letters and adds special characters), so it's not keyboard hardware.

I don't know if it coincided with a Firefox upgrade, but I don't think so. </p><p>Here's the deal; in Firefox, when I go into google meets, my microphone and camera both show up as turned off with an exclamation mark, meaning I can't turn them on. This is my desktop PC and it has no camera, so the camera I understand. It definitely DOES have a microphone and I've used it many times. </p><p>The permission for ""use the microphone"" is set to allowed. When I click the exclamation mark on the camera, I get a popup saying ""meet is blocked from using your camera"". When I click the exclamation mark on the microphone button, my audio cuts out for a second, but other than that nothing happens - no popup, no explanation, nothing. </p><p>Other apps that use the microphone (i.e.; Teams) work just fine. Same browser, same permissions, same microphone. Microphone test sites also work just fine, so it's not a browser issue. </p><p>Using Google Meet in a different browser with the same microphone works just fine. I've tried Chrome and Opera - both work as expected. </p><p>On my other PC, a laptop, Google Meet with the same version of Firefox works just fine. So this must be some weird issue related to specifically my desktop. </p><p>Here is what I have tried so far; - Remove the mic permissions and set them again. - Clear all cookies, local storage, everything the browser has for this domain. - Turn off all extensions in the browser. - Restart browser, restart PC. - A combination of all of the above (remove permission, local storage, cookies, turn off extensions, close browser, restart PC, then start from scratch). </p><p>None of it makes any difference and I'm out of ideas.
