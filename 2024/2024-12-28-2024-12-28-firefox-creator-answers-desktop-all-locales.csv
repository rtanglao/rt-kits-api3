After lots of trial and error it appears to be something to do with Firefox version 133.0.3 (aarch64) as it only happens when I leave Firefox running. </p><p>I have run the Apple offline diagnostics multiple times immediately after the crash but I never get any reported errors. Interestingly I get no dialog from Apple that my Mac has crashed or needed to be restarted </p><p>I have restarted my Mac into safe mode, same problem </p><p>I have refreshed Firefox several times, same problem </p><p>Any help woulld be much appreciated! </p><p>Happy Christmas and a peaceful New Year to you all </p><p>Thank you, Peter </p>",firefox-13303;firefox-1330;firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",pd.thomas

Have found the command DisableAppUpdate but cannot override the setting.  The research I've done so far says Mozilla was to have fixed this problem years ago.  How can I update Firefox to latest version?  I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling and it is still version 113.  How can I possibly update this to the latest version as the release I have is now behaving quite weird. Thank you. </p>,"",firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,1698236;,admin928
