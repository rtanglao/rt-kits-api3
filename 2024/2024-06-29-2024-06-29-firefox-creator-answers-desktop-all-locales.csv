They are forever stuck on the thumbnail image of the video, and nothing happens when I hit play.  I've had this happen a couple times and was able to resolve before by installing updates and uninstalling my Mozilla VPN, but this time nothing has worked.  I've tried pretty much every solution I could find online: </p> <ul><li> Updating Firefox </li><li> Updating my computer </li><li> Running in Incognito </li><li> Running in troubleshooting mode </li><li> Allowing autoplay </li><li> Disabling hardware acceleration </li><li> Disabling addons </li><li> Clearing cache and data </li><li> Enabling/disabling DRM content </li><li> Installing Windows Media Pack </li></ul> <p>I'm running Windows 10, and videos seem to work fine in Edge, if that makes any difference. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,other,en-US,"",cassidy.radtke

The search suggestions in the address bar are missing.  I mean that the entire drop-down box never shows up.  There are no search engine suggestions. There are no history based or bookmarks based suggestions.  </p><p>The search suggestions is ticked in the settings. And I also disabled hardware acceleration.  </p><p>Steps I took to troubleshoot: 1. Refreshed Firefox through troubleshoot mode. 2. Restarted firefox in add-ons disabled mode.  3. Tried creating new profile.  4. Tried using Firefox nightly and Dev builds.  5. Got fed up. Switched to Floorp.  6. I also tried a bunch of about:config modifications, that were suggested in earlier such support posts. None to any avail. 7. Tried it on an entirely different windows. And again, the minute I log in, the search suggestions are gone.  </p><p>This is when I realized, the issue was popping up whenever I log in using my mozilla account. I tried any firefox alternative without logging in and the search suggestions work. The minute I log in with firefox account/mozilla account. The search suggestions stop. This has to be something due to sync is what I guessed. And I stopped sync. And reinstalled.  Then the issue resolved. But the minute I log in it reverts back. And no search suggestions. </p><p>The search suggestions do not work on any windows based system. I checked my android device and suggestions are working. Sadly, I do not have access to any other platform.  </p><p>So at this point I was very much frustrated.  So someone please help me out. I will give whatever logs you need. But fix this. I need search suggestions. At least bookmarks and history. I believe it to be a core part of the experience.  </p><p>Not even recently searched are in suggestions. That drop-down box itself is missing. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,other,en-US,"",saisibisuresh1471
