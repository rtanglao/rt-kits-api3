I have read the lag issue with Youtube was suppose to be corrected with FF 127.02 but it is not.   I have been using FF for many years now an love it.  It is my understanding that it is the ad blockers causing the slow down.  Do you have an estimated date when this will be resolved.  I have tried every trick included running it in diagnostic mode or trouble shooting mode.  Nothing seems to work.

Consequently, I couldn't hear anything until I changed the sound setting back to Optical.  The 3rd time the user interface had changed significantly and for the better except that the sound setting had not only changed to USB Audio Codex, but it was stuck at that setting--so the Doc called me on the phone so I could to listen to what he had to say. </p><p>I don't think this is browser dependent.

Certain websites do not load, for example, <a href=""http://travel.state.org"" rel=""nofollow"">travel.state.org</a>, which is a website to know the requirements to travel to the United States. However the site loads without any trouble on my Android phone, and on other browsers such as 'Microsoft Edge'. Can someone help me with this situation? Thank you this would be very much appreciated. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1270;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1659644;,DTS99
