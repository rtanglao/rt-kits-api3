Which is very comfortable. Why is this not a feature in firefox? I always have to copy paste the URL and enter an own title. Chrome has become very slowly on some websites, while firefox does not slow down on those websites at all. So i want to stay with firefox. Good job, team. But the bookmarking UX is improveable. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",bechm73

The search suggestions in the address bar are missing.  I mean that the entire drop-down box never shows up.  There are no search engine suggestions. There are no history based or bookmarks based suggestions.  </p><p>The search suggestions is ticked in the settings. And I also disabled hardware acceleration.  </p><p>Steps I took to troubleshoot: 1. Refreshed Firefox through troubleshoot mode. 2. Restarted firefox in add-ons disabled mode.  3. Tried creating new profile.  4. Tried using Firefox nightly and Dev builds.  5. Got fed up. Switched to Floorp.  6. I also tried a bunch of about:config modifications, that were suggested in earlier such support posts. None to any avail. 7. Tried it on an entirely different windows. And again, the minute I log in, the search suggestions are gone.  </p><p>This is when I realized, the issue was popping up whenever I log in using my mozilla account. I tried any firefox alternative without logging in and the search suggestions work. The minute I log in with firefox account/mozilla account. The search suggestions stop. This has to be something due to sync is what I guessed. And I stopped sync. And reinstalled.  Then the issue resolved. But the minute I log in it reverts back. And no search suggestions. </p><p>The search suggestions do not work on any windows based system. I checked my android device and suggestions are working. Sadly, I do not have access to any other platform.  </p><p>So at this point I was very much frustrated.  So someone please help me out. I will give whatever logs you need. But fix this. I need search suggestions. At least bookmarks and history. I believe it to be a core part of the experience.  </p><p>Not even recently searched are in suggestions. That drop-down box itself is missing. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,other,en-US,"",saisibisuresh1471
