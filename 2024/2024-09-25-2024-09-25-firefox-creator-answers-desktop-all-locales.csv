I've noticed that it takes up to 17 processes on my computer. There by slowing both my computer and firefox to the point it's unusable. I know extensions can take up some processes, however I'm only using 3 extensions. So, it shouldn't be using so much. What is being done about this? I like what firefox has to offer, but if these aren't fixed then I'll have to start using another browser. And, getting everyone I know to get off of it, as it's being just like bloatware on my pc. </p>",firefox;firefox-1300;performance-and-connectivity;firefox-13001;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",klealshadow

This includes moving tabs around in their order, dragging a tab into a new window, dragging tabs into bookmarks, moving bookmarks around in the browser. I can't drag them around in 'manage bookmarks' either. I can still open and create bookmarks; they are simply much more difficult to place where I want them. </p><p>I believe this happened with the last update but it's not a feature I use all that often so it could be older. </p><p>I have opened Firefox in safe mode and had the same issue.

As seen in the screenshot, Firefox stays on the <em>New Tab</em> page. When trying to access through a hyperlink, the favicon of the current page blinks out for a fraction of a second but nothing else happens. This happens with all of the websites I've tried with the .fun TLD (<em>e.g.</em> neal.fun, jklm.fun) and the .work TLD (<em>e.g.</em> frame.work, at.work). This does not happen in private browsing however, where these websites function normally. </p><p>This happens only on my PC that runs Manjaro. I also have a PC on Ubuntu, and it does not have this issue. I have tried clearing cache and cookies, to no avail. I haven't tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox as I'm afraid of losing session information and extensions. Any help, ideally allowing me to keep the aforementioned data, would be greatly appreciated. </p><p>System information: OS: Manjaro Linux Kernel: 5.10.224-1-MANJARO Firefox version: 129.0.1 (64-bit) </p>",firefox;firefox-1290;firefox-12901;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",thegh0stmzpelf

Sul sito del supermercato online di Carrefour, per esempio, non vedo tutti i prodotti disponibili nei vari reparti. Ho verificato che sia utilizzando l'app sia usando un altro browser la visualizzazione è corretta, cioè mi vengono mostrati tutti i prodotti disponibili in quel dato reparto. Questo è il link del sito: <a href=""https://www.carrefour.it/spesa-online/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.carrefour.it/spesa-online/</a> Su un altro sito, invece, il contenuto del carrello non si aggiorna man mano che aggiungo prodotti e quando cerco di visualizzarne il contenuto, mi rimanda alla homepage. Anche per questo sito ho verificato che usando un altro browser funziona correttamente. Questo è il link del sito: <a href=""https://www.spaghettiemandolino.it/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.spaghettiemandolino.it/</a> I problemi con il sito di Carrefour li riscontro da qualche mese, mentre con il secondo sito li ho da almeno un paio di anni, mentre prima funzionava correttamente. Grazie per l'aiuto che potrete darmi. Un saluto. Raffaella Pepitoni </p>",firefox;firefox-1300;browse;firefox-13001;,firefox,browse,it,"",r.pepitoni

For a while I was messing around with NetworkManager configs to no success, but then I found captive portal detection and I've made progress on solving the issue, so far I've tried turning ""network.captive-portal-service.enabled"" to false but then the ""open network login page"" button stopped showing up entirely and trying to search would so a no WIFI page,      so that won't work, then I tried changing ""captivedetect.canonicalURL"" to an empty string, but then the network login page was obviously an empty page, I'm really not sure what to do now, I haven't found any answers yet, so any help will be greatly appreciated. </pre> <p>Thank you in advance. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",codekiwi132
