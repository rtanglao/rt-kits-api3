When we view an mp4 video within Firefox, the audio includes an extra popping or clicking noise throughout.  The same mp4 video plays fine in other browsers or when we download the file and use a video application (like Media Player or VLC).  It's only in Firefox+Windows that we can confirm the problem. </p><p>Here is an example short video that I created.  I apologize for the first few seconds of silence, which is unfortunate since I'm trying to test the sound quality here. <a href=""https://pennstateoffice365-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/tfw5421_psu_edu/EW34XDcGtppIliWJbioDxaUBkbf_pFqM6NWRPxc_rpO4-g?e=D1M385"" rel=""nofollow"">https://pennstateoffice365-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/tfw5421_psu_edu/EW34XDcGtppIliWJbioDxaUBkbf_pFqM6NWRPxc_rpO4-g?e=D1M385</a>  </p><p>The way I recorded the video (which is how our users are doing it) is by recording within Microsoft Powerpoint, then exporting to mp4 file.  They take that file and upload it to Canvas, an online classroom system. <a href=""https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/record-a-presentation-2570dff5-f81c-40bc-b404-e04e95ffab33"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/record-a-presentation-2570dff5-f81c-40bc-b404-e04e95ffab33</a>  </p><p>Strangely, the link to the video that I provided above will play the audio fine in Firefox in the context of the Sharepoint website.  Try downloading that same file to your local computer, though, and playing it from there directly in your Firefox window.  On Windows 10/11, you should hear the popping noise in the Firefox browser... but not other browsers.  We get the same popping noise in the Canvas course too. </p><p>I appreciate any suggestions, either for changes in PowerPoint to improve the audio compatibility cross-browser, or for settings changes in Firefox that would eliminate the popping noise if our students make that change to their browser. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",tfw5421

This can happen if the server is busy or does not have enough resources to complete the task. Uploading a smaller image may help. Suggested maximum size is 2560 pixels."" </p><p>Of course, smaller images aren’t an issue (probably because they finish processing before the 30-second limit). Another weird thing is that, even when WordPress presents that error, sometimes the large image does get successfully processed anyway. But not always. </p><p>As the error implies, for a long while I thought it was a server-side issue. We’ve looked into everything: PHP, Apache, ImageMagick, ModSecurity, Cloudflare… no good. </p><p>Long story short, I recently found out that this doesn’t happen at all when uploading images via Safari. I can even upload like a 40MB image, it will take a while to process, but it doesn’t ever stop/break at 30 seconds and always process it successfully. </p><p>So, what gives? Is this really a Firefox issue? I tried playing with lots of about:config settings related to some kind of 30-second timeout, but still haven’t figured it out. Also, I’ve tried disabling all add-ons/extensions, clearing caches/cookies and also hoping into Firefox’s Safe Mode, and have asked a friend to also try from his computer and the same thing happened to him on Firefox. </p><p>Any ideas?

When I am on my product page viewing a product I have certain products that contain more than one image. An image carousel is supposed to display.

My cookie notification popup does not load on firefox thus the user can not accept the cookies. In the console log I get the following errors.  Cookie “_gcl_au” has been rejected for invalid domain. bramall-handle-chrome-plated-128mm.html Cookie “_ga_ZRG2HYFVGP” has been rejected for invalid domain. bramall-handle-chrome-plated-128mm.html Cookie “_ga_ZRG2HYFVGP” has been rejected for invalid domain. bramall-handle-chrome-plated-128mm.html Cookie “_ga” has been rejected for invalid domain. bramall-handle-chrome-plated-128mm.html Cookie “_ga_ZRG2HYFVGP” has been rejected for invalid domain. bramall-handle-chrome-plated-128mm.html Cookie “_ga_ZRG2HYFVGP” has been rejected for invalid domain. bramall-handle-chrome-plated-128mm.html Cookie “_ga_ZRG2HYFVGP” has been rejected for invalid domain. bramall-handle-chrome-plated-128mm.html Cookie “_ga_ZRG2HYFVGP” has been rejected for invalid domain. </p><p>I think it may also have something to do with the Javascript file not being loaded correctly.

On certain products nothing displays and on others it loads two arrows with dots, the arrows do not work to change between images and are displayed in the incorrect place as well as the other images below the main image not loading. Please advise me on how to fix this issue as it is only a FireFox issue and after extensive research I can not find a solution.
