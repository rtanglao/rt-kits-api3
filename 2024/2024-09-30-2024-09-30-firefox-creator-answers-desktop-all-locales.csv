The website landing page will display and appear to be normal, but it will not display some information or links to go to other information within the site.  I have to us Chrome as the browser in order to get the links/information I need.  I suspect this is due to the website programming changing and they are not providing Firefox with the needed information to allow users to view the changed website programming.  The problem  presents itself when I'm unable to follow a directive from the company whose website I've accessed.  The screen display in Firefox does not match the screen display in Chrome.  Only the Chrome screen provides the information/functionality I need.  I hope you can provide me with a solution to this problem because I prefer to us Firefox as my default browser.

Normally with video and audio dying and repeating the last second of sound over and over robotically until the PC restarts.

Sometimes it is completely locked up straight away. Some other occasions I can move the mouse for a bit but the screen is frozen and my mouse drags along dead pixels. It appears to be something to do with the graphics card (nvidia Geforce RTX 4060) but it is only ever activated by watching video, it never happens when playing games with firefox open. It has happened in some instances outside of video or youtube but was just after a video or with one playing on the side. It is 95% due to watching youtube and if not, firefox is always open when it happens. </p><p>Firefox is up to date as well as nvidia drivers. I even tried re-installing drivers fresh by removing old ones and re-adding and nothing. It will be an issue that will go away for a week or two or more, and not happen for a long time, and then out of nowhere starts happening again. Sometimes immediately after restarting and re-watching the same video again within seconds. Multiple times in one hour in some cases. Then other times it doesn't happen for weeks, almost as if whenever I update drivers or firefox, thats when it happens more, then as time goes on it goes away. </p><p>Any help would be great. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",cokedaz
