The about:config ""This might void your warranty!"" warning page may appear. </p><pre>   Click I'll be careful, I promise! to continue to the about:config page.    copy the next security.ssl.enable_ocsp_stapling and paste it in the search field    double-click on it to make it false    close the page, exit firefox and restart it.
