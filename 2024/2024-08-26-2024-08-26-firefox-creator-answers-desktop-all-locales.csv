I have already asked this question but never received any response.  For a long time now I keep running across sites that do not work on Firefox. It can be a streaming site such as Paramount+ or it could be my phone service site Ting. In all of the cases and there have been quite a few I am always able to find another browser the sites will work on. 9 times out of 10 they will work on Chrome but I have found at least one that does not work there but will work on Edge. So, right now Edge is the prime candidate to switch to.  I do not want to quit as it would be a pain in the ass as I have been a loyal user for at least 15 years and have stuck with you as I believe in what you are doing and represent but it is becoming to much of a pain to continue using you because I like the convenience of using only 1 browser 99% of the time.

I still didn't decide if TLS 1.2 is still important or it's enough with 1.3 so for now I am leaving them both. I did this system wide, with PowerShell, following the instructions in <a href=""https://techpress.net/disable-tls-1-0-tls-1-1-using-powershell-on-windows-10-11/"" rel=""nofollow"">THIS</a> THIS article. </p><p>But then there's Firefox.

But I came across <a href=""https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-enable-or-disable-tls-1-3-in-windows-10/"" rel=""nofollow"">THIS</a> THIS article about how to enable TLS 1.3 in Firefox and when I went in about:config and I typed ""security"" I saw that there are a lot of voices with SSL and a lot more about TLS than just the security.tls.version.max mentioned in that article, so I am here to ask you what to do to be 1000% sure that all SSL and older TLS are completely disabled in Firefox, and that only TLS 1.3 is enabled. </p><p>If you have reasons to believe that disabling TLS 1.2 is not a good idea, let me know, but in <a href=""https://www.ssldragon.com/blog/tls-1-2-vs-1-3/"" rel=""nofollow"">THIS</a> THIS article I've read that 1.3 is much better and it's anyway backwards compatible with 1.2 in case some server only supports 1.2, so I decided to leave only 1.3. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;windows-11;protect-your-privacy;firefox-1290;firefox-12902;,firefox,protect-your-privacy,en-US,1670630;,AlternativeTotal2211
