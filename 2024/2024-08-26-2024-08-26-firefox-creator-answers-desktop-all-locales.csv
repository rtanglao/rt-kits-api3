Closing firefox, usually via the windows task manager, frees up the game manager and the game properly terminates.

Aka ""do I still benefit from CanvasBlocker""?","<p>Hi again, </p><p>so, in my other question I was reminded about Browserleaks and while I was there testing TLS I also tested Canvas and it said 100% unique which I was surprised because I have the Enhance Protection in FF in ""Custom"" with both fingerprinting options selected and in ""in all windows"", plus CanvasBlocker. </p><p>100% unique is not good, right? That's what I thought at first. But then I remembered, CanvasBlocker rotates settings all the time, so even if my fingerprint is 100% unique it's also changing all the time which means ""they"" can't identify me (supposedly). Then I also thought ""actually it might be better than not 100% unique because in that case I might have more issues with websites thinking that it's someone else trying to access my account"". But then I thought ""although if it's 100% unique changing all the time it's also like if it was a different person"". </p><p>I deactivated CanvasBlocker and tested again and it was also 100% unique. Then I reactivated CanvasBlocker and I deactivated FF's anti-fingerprint. Again 100% unique. In other words, I don't see a way to see what is the difference between using CanvasBlocker on top of the native FF anti-fingerprint. That's where you can help&nbsp;:) </p><p>So, questions. </p><p>1) can you tell me what exactly does FF block about fingerprinting? And, does it rotate settings like CanvasBlocker so that this ""100% unique"" is not actually a real issue because it's different every time? Or is it a bad kind of 100% unique in that case? </p><p>2) what would create less issues of websites thinking that I am not me? A rotating 100% unique, or a not 100% unique (in which case, how to I achieve that, considering that neither CanvasBlocker nor FF's anti-fingerprint nor both together can do that?). </p><p>Would you say that having a VPN with own DNS which block tracking on a domain level, plus AdGuard with all possible filters, plus FF's Enhanced Protection in ""Custom"" with all at max, plus CanvasBlocker, is a good combo? Or what could I improve to reach a good balance of not being tracked/fingerprinted, not being blocked ""because I am not me"", reasonably light resources usage, and reasonable browsing speeds? </p><p>I used uBlock Origin previously because it's lighter on resources and it triggers my laptop's fans much less than AdGuard but it doesn't block (not even with element picker) some annoying things of websites that I visit often.

There are no problems there. Microsoft should have just ended with Win 7, their only working OS. This is a big old laptop, heavy with a 17"" screen, fragile, nonworking touchpad and with dying battery. For traveling I actually use a newer laptop - Dell XPS 13, light, sturdy, bright screen, long life battery, tiny... That came with Windows 10 initially and upgraded to Windows 11 later. I used Chrome for browsing initially just like on this laptop. At some point (I don't know whether this happened after Win 11 upgrade, I just didn't pay close intention to what Windows are doing behind my back) I just could not log on to Facebook in Chrome on Dell. Nobody is out there to help. Neither at FB, nor at Google, neither at Microsoft. Everything else worked fine. Before my travel to Europe this summer, I uninstalled Chrome and installed Firefox instead on the Dell. I carried over all my Google passwords. And everything worked fine, including Facebook. The trip to Europe went fine. Firefox performed great. Now a week back in the States, suddenly yesterday morning, out of the blue, without me doing anything to cause that (the day before I shut the lid, and everything worked fine), all hell breaks lose: I can't open a single page in Firefox - yet my WiFi connection is fine, and other devices work fine. Firefox opens the home page but nothing else, when I click on troubleshoot, my WiFi connection is suddenly dropped and I have to reconnect. I don't have Chrome on Dell, but I do have Edge, so I checked Edge: Edge opens some pages immediately, some pages only after I ask it repeatedly, all much slower and more laborious then it should be. So, while it did not lose functionality altogether like Firefox, I would say it is also not operating properly. But Skype, email software, printer connection - they work fine. Some satanic force entered the computer overnight and destroyed browser functionality. And I reseted everything and rebooted and restarted and deleted cookies, all the usual crap they tell us to hide what is really going on (some screw up or intentional sabotage in the code). There are no proxies. Firewall on or off does not matter. List of Windows updated shows the last one on 8/14, and for 10 days there was no problems. I fiddled with command prompt: sfc/scannow says everything is ok, malwarebytes say computer is clean, Edge improved after netsh winsock reset, but Firefox did not, I sent a request for tech support to Dell, but this can't be a hardware issue, it is most probably some software security bullshit issue that happened behind my back and that now requires someone with PhD in programming to figure out and solve. I am totally exhausted and very unhappy with the situation. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",ivoskoricraccoon

This leak was made known to me after visiting several websites (sites I've visited previously and sites I’ve NEVER visited before!), where I will receive an email very shortly, if not immediately after visiting and closing the browser tab for the website. (These are legitimate sites that are selling a product and, typically, very politely asking if I need more information, etc. ).  </p><p>After noticing this, I got in the habit of clearing Firefox memory frequently, if not after every site I visit; but especially when my email is required to login. However, today I just notice that my email address is “permanently” located within the Firefox browser; and have to wonder if this could be how websites are getting my email… The email is located in the Firefox addon Video DownloadHelper app. The Companion App within Video DownloadHelper requires a payment, license #, and email to install. And, when looking thru its new menu today, I noticed my email (the same one I get messages from after visiting sites) is right there within the Video DownloadHelper menu (click on VDH icon, click on gear icon, click on More settings…).  </p><p>So, I don’t know for certain whether my email is being compromised after logging in to a website and not immediately clearing memory after leaving the website OR if the compromise is from the Companion App within the Firefox Video DownloadHelper app, OR possibly both(?). If it is being leaked from Video DownloadHelper, I would greatly appreciate it if Mozilla would implore upon the VDH crew to remove it from the app. </p><p>And, if you can, I would greatly appreciate an email letting me know if/when this has been fixed!

I have already asked this question but never received any response.  For a long time now I keep running across sites that do not work on Firefox. It can be a streaming site such as Paramount+ or it could be my phone service site Ting. In all of the cases and there have been quite a few I am always able to find another browser the sites will work on. 9 times out of 10 they will work on Chrome but I have found at least one that does not work there but will work on Edge. So, right now Edge is the prime candidate to switch to.  I do not want to quit as it would be a pain in the ass as I have been a loyal user for at least 15 years and have stuck with you as I believe in what you are doing and represent but it is becoming to much of a pain to continue using you because I like the convenience of using only 1 browser 99% of the time.

I still didn't decide if TLS 1.2 is still important or it's enough with 1.3 so for now I am leaving them both. I did this system wide, with PowerShell, following the instructions in <a href=""https://techpress.net/disable-tls-1-0-tls-1-1-using-powershell-on-windows-10-11/"" rel=""nofollow"">THIS</a> THIS article. </p><p>But then there's Firefox. I don't know if Firefox can establish SSL (or old TLS) connections despite the system ""ban"". But I came across <a href=""https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-enable-or-disable-tls-1-3-in-windows-10/"" rel=""nofollow"">THIS</a> THIS article about how to enable TLS 1.3 in Firefox and when I went in about:config and I typed ""security"" I saw that there are a lot of voices with SSL and a lot more about TLS than just the security.tls.version.max mentioned in that article, so I am here to ask you what to do to be 1000% sure that all SSL and older TLS are completely disabled in Firefox, and that only TLS 1.3 is enabled. </p><p>If you have reasons to believe that disabling TLS 1.2 is not a good idea, let me know, but in <a href=""https://www.ssldragon.com/blog/tls-1-2-vs-1-3/"" rel=""nofollow"">THIS</a> THIS article I've read that 1.3 is much better and it's anyway backwards compatible with 1.2 in case some server only supports 1.2, so I decided to leave only 1.3. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;needsinfo;windows-11;protect-your-privacy;firefox-1290;firefox-12902;,firefox,protect-your-privacy,en-US,1670630;1670661;1670684;1670687;,AlternativeTotal2211
