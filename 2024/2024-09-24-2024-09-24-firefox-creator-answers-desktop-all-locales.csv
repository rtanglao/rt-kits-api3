It tried posing as a pdf file, so I'm guessing it was malicious. While deleting the e-mail, I sadly clicked on it by accident. Luckily, I think, Firefox blocked the pop-up that resulted. </p><p>I was wondering if the pop-up blocker in Firefox would have prevented any malicious code from running. Does the blocker prevent anything from actually being executed or loaded? For what it's worth, I did a MalwareBytes scan that came back clean, but I've changed my most important passwords just to be safe. </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",James1995

I want Firefox to auto number downloads of the same name, instead of asking to replace the file that already exists. Example: XYZ.jpg is in the downloads folder downloading another will default to XYZ(1).jpg, just like every chromium based browser does natively.  </p><p>The setting ""Always ask you where to save files"" IS DISABLED, and I'm still experiencing every download of the same name needing to manually enter a number or change the file name somehow because it just asks to replace or not. I have Revo nuked Firefox from the system to reinstall, created new profiles since for some reason factory reset isn't a feature anymore. I have tried Firefox on multiple systems all with the same issue. I even tried enabling always ask where to save files in case something got switched.  </p><p>If I'm missing something stupid, ""great?"" I want this convenience resolved but at the same time it shouldn't be this difficult to fix, it should just naturally be right there as an easy fix. I really want to see Firefox succeed have more competition for chrome based browsers, but its always something stupid like this that inevitably pushes me back to chrome.  </p><p>Thank you for any help. </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",gunnison.jachin
