Messages and calls are secured with end-to-end encryption"" without my permission or asking if I want this), any encrypted chats have audio and video calls disabled. I note that I have ONE friend for whom it didn't do this, I can still do calls with her. If I receive a call, I get a pop-up saying that to receive this call I must download the Messenger app (no way) or a browser which supports it. If I check what browsers it thinks supports this, it only lists Chrome and Edge. As far as I know Edge is just Internet Explorer renamed, the biggest black hole in security, I've never touched it. Chrome ignores industry standards, so I don't use it. Making Firefox the best, top browser available. It's the only browser I wish to use. Mozilla needs to look into how to get Facebook to stop blacklisting Firefox like this.

I really rely on Firefox for my daily browsing, so any help would be greatly appreciated! </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",desktop;windows-10;troubleshooting;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,1667754;,isabellarosethompsoncompany

Eu consigo copiar e colar sem problemas uma palavra, uma frase, um texto, etc, mas colar uma imagem diretamente no quadro de resposta não (OBS: não é inserir a imagem, é simplesmente copiar e colar diretamente). No Google Chrome e no Edge funciona efetuando os mesmos procedimentos, e usando o mesmo Octadesk. Se alguém tiver uma solução, fico muito agradecido. </p>",desktop;troubleshooting;windows-11;firefox-1290;,firefox,troubleshooting,pt-BR,"",juniogoncalvesferreira75
