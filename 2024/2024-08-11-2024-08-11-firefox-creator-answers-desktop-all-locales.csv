Frequently there is no sound when I open Firefox. The issue is that Firefox sound volume keeps setting to 0 in volume settings, so I need to open volume setting and set volume to value higher than 0 (screenshot attached). </p><p>Additionally, yesterday I began to experience a new issue with Firefox. When I type in a search term in Google, nothing happens, like I didn't enter any search term (like Gooogle search doesn't work in Firefox). The search term I entered is visible in the search bar, but no results are displayed (Firefox window remains blank) - a screenshot attached. </p><p>Can you please let me know what is happening - is these any remedy to solve issues described above? </p><p>Regards, Matej </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1280;,firefox,other,sl,"",matej.simon8

It may take minutes. It happens for instance when clicking a a web search result or when the site itself redirects to another web page. </p><p>This Firefox behavior is there for years and I even remember that Internet Explorer had the same behavior during its era. </p><p>Is there any particular reason to do that? Because I only see downsides: for instance, you can't copy the URL to check in another program or device. </p><p>Somebody might argue that it's because you can press Esc during load and stay on the previous page. I think it would be more convenient to revert the address bar value when this happens. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1290;,firefox,other,en-US,"",basinilya
