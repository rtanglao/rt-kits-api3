Eu consigo copiar e colar sem problemas uma palavra, uma frase, um texto, etc, mas colar uma imagem diretamente no quadro de resposta não (OBS: não é inserir a imagem, é simplesmente copiar e colar diretamente). No Google Chrome e no Edge funciona efetuando os mesmos procedimentos, e usando o mesmo Octadesk. Se alguém tiver uma solução, fico muito agradecido. </p>",desktop;troubleshooting;windows-11;firefox-1290;,firefox,troubleshooting,pt-BR,"",juniogoncalvesferreira75
