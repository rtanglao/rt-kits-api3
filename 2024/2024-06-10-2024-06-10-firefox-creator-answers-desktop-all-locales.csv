After redownloading Firefox and signing into a few basic things (including my Mozilla account), I realised all my logins were gone. I have followed the steps in [[this tutorial|<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1310179]]"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1310179]]</a> but it didn't work - I think saving logins in this instance of Firefox overwrote the other logins file, as when I opened it, it only had the login info from what I logged into after I reset.  </p><p>Looking at my connected services, it seems the instance of Firefox from before I reset is still open. I mention this just because it's possible that this would contribute to a solution. </p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated as I have a number of securely generated passwords and cannot access a good deal of my accounts. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,sync,en-US,1656599;,robinfungi
