Upon trying to open anything in a new tab, firefox gets completely stuck loading the site, and when refreshed, does the tab becomes ""dead"" and nothing can be entered or clicked on, even after minutes. I know it is not my internet connection, as other browsers such as opera and edge work, as well as my ability to download games from steam, and firefox is also up to date as shown by the settings page, but firefox does not allow anything to be opened or viewed other than the settings page, which I used to navigate to the support page. I could not even use ""continue with google"" as a method of signing in and needed to manually enter everything. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;firefox-1310;firefox-13103;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",thebigdumb

I keep getting message 'Site is not secure'","<p>I need to know (in layman's language) how to fix the sight connection problem. For example: I try to connect to <a href=""http://Google.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">Google.ca</a>. Firefox comes back saying this site is not secure. Use HTTPS.   This is where it is so confusing.  I am sure that the Google site is a secure sight. So why does Firefox keeps rejecting me. It can become very frustrating really. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>ps.

The layout of all my pages is wrong.,"<p>I publish two mediawiki sites. <a href=""http://wikidelphia.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wikidelphia.org</a> and <a href=""http://othernetworks.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://othernetworks.org</a> </p><p>Both show up just fine for other people and for me when I access them with other browsers. </p><p>My problem occurs when I use Firefox to work on OtherNetworks. I'm going to try attaching screen shots of the Main Page. The first is from a normal view of my main page taken with another browser. In this shot the graphic is on the right </p><p>The second one is the same page taken with Firefox as the browser. I can't even figure out how to describe what is wrong with that second display.  </p><p>I'm wishing for someone to figure out what is going on here and tell me how to restore FireFox so I can use it to work on my website. Is there some setting in Firefox or in the OtherNetworks site that is causing the awkward layout when using Firefox. I'm rather dependent on the bookmarks in Firefox. </p><p>Please call me or write if you would like to help me. </p><p>Stan Pokras in Philadelphia, PA 267-968-0407 </p>",settings;firefox;firefox-1310;firefox-13103;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",stan68

Now I am trying to sign back in.  After a seemingly successful sign-in (with email and pw, followed by ""authorization code""), I'm taken to my account page. Scrolling down to Connected Services, I can see a recognizable account name (my Windows 11 user name and the name I've assigned to my computer). But looking up at the account button at the top right of Firefox, I see a small yellow triangle. Clicking on the button, I'm told ""Account disconnected.""  (Remember, I'm currently looking at my account page, which says I'm connected.) </p><p>So I try to log in again.  I give email address and password, and authorization code, and I'm in again.  Now I see an addtional account connected, ""Firefox 131, Windows 10"" (remember, I'm using Windows 11). </p><p>So looking up again to the upper right at the account button, I see the yellow triangle, and clicking tells me once more that I'm disconnected, even though I have my account page open in front of me. </p><p>All of this, of course, prevents me from having access to the sync function.  I've been through this circle several times with the same strange results. </p><p>Anyone have any idea what' going on. </p><p>Screenshot attached. </p><p>Thanks!
