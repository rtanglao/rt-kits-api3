And what do you know, all sorts of unnecessary crud has been added that I've now had to turn off. But I can't figure out how to turn off the Firefox-specific notifications. NOT WEBSITES. There's nothing in settings under ""notification"" or ""tracker"" and it's wholly unnecessary.  There is 0 need to to pop a flashing orange desktop notification for tracker statistics. Like this is not important info, nor is it a crisis that requires a notification. </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",tt888

When I try to use the bookmark importer, it tells me ""Firefox couldnâ€™t find any programs that contain bookmark, history or password data."" No problem, I exported my Chrome bookmarks to an HTML file. I go through the steps the wizard takes me through, and in the end I am greeted with a friendly ""Bookmarks Imported Successfully."" However, no bookmarks have actually been imported! Restarting Firefox does not help. </p><p>See attached screenshots for troubleshooting details. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",scievan

Upon trying to open anything in a new tab, firefox gets completely stuck loading the site, and when refreshed, does the tab becomes ""dead"" and nothing can be entered or clicked on, even after minutes. I know it is not my internet connection, as other browsers such as opera and edge work, as well as my ability to download games from steam, and firefox is also up to date as shown by the settings page, but firefox does not allow anything to be opened or viewed other than the settings page, which I used to navigate to the support page. I could not even use ""continue with google"" as a method of signing in and needed to manually enter everything. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;firefox-1310;firefox-13103;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",thebigdumb

Is there some setting in Firefox or in the OtherNetworks site that is causing the awkward layout when using Firefox.

Now I am trying to sign back in.  After a seemingly successful sign-in (with email and pw, followed by ""authorization code""), I'm taken to my account page. Scrolling down to Connected Services, I can see a recognizable account name (my Windows 11 user name and the name I've assigned to my computer). But looking up at the account button at the top right of Firefox, I see a small yellow triangle. Clicking on the button, I'm told ""Account disconnected.""  (Remember, I'm currently looking at my account page, which says I'm connected.) </p><p>So I try to log in again.  I give email address and password, and authorization code, and I'm in again.  Now I see an addtional account connected, ""Firefox 131, Windows 10"" (remember, I'm using Windows 11). </p><p>So looking up again to the upper right at the account button, I see the yellow triangle, and clicking tells me once more that I'm disconnected, even though I have my account page open in front of me. </p><p>All of this, of course, prevents me from having access to the sync function.  I've been through this circle several times with the same strange results. </p><p>Anyone have any idea what' going on. </p><p>Screenshot attached. </p><p>Thanks!
