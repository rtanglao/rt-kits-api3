Copying and pasting of the outcome brightens it again, and if I keep going the resulting image will be one big white square. This isn't the end of the world, more of an inconvenience as all I've had to do is switch to taking a screenshot of the image instead, but I do miss being able to just properly copy the image. The brightened effect is present no matter where I paste it, whether on another website or on a completely separate app, and other browsers I've tried on the same Mac don't have this problem. Is there a way for me to fix this? I already followed the support instructions for a different yet somewhat related pasting problem where I set gfx.color_management.mode to 0, and that had no effect.

There have recently been critical vulnerabilities announced, and all versions of this software must be removed or updated to remediate these. </pre> <p>Please note Firefox is not  ""_ _ _ _ _  _ _ _ _ _ "" approved software (both Edge and Chrome are supplied as standard), and unless there is a critical business reason (i.e. developing software that has to be tested on the Firefox browser) the software must be removed. The vulnerabilities in this software are of the highest severity, and if not remediated, devices will be isolated from the corporate network for protective purposes. If you require assistance removing, or updating this software please contact the IT Service Desk. Regards, _ _ _ _ _   _ _ _ _ _ _&gt;&gt; I don't like and never did using Edge or Chrome but now it seems I have no choice, unless Firefox improves its security critical vulnerabilities.
