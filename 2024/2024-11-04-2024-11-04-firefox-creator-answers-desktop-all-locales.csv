Even an ad from Amazon from my search results.,"<p>I cannot click links from google search on Firefox (latest version - Windows 11) if they are an advertisement. Even an ad from Amazon from my search results. Example: I did a google search for scrapbook paper from a specific company. Google gives me a page of search results. In the top of the page are adverts from Amazon etc. One of them was one I clicked on for amazon. See screenshot 1. When I clicked on the one circled in red I got the second screenshot as a result. So then I clicked the exclamation mark next to http: on screenshot 2 which gave me this info in screenshot 3. I went back to the google search page and cannot open a one of those ads across the top. My husband has the same issue on his galaxy S7 tab and he hates not being able to compare prices by clicking those ads. I have on my desktop, as well as his tablet the browser privacy set to Standard. So what is causing this? I used to love firefox but these latest 3 or 4 updates have left it a hot mess. How do I fix this? It is not like this with other browsers. I have no issues with then at all. I have the same tablet as him, but it has not updated to the latest update and I am able to click those same links from it. I just ran the same search from my galaxy mobile using firefox 119.0.1 It works fine on the mobile version I am running (I know but this is why I won't update it!). Please tell me, help me figure out what is going on with this version of Firefox (version 132.0). Is it FF and google not playing well together or just a FF issue because as much as I like FF I am about to dump it for a browser that works. Just for GP, I only have Last Pass extension active. I have AdBlocker Ultimate but it is currently disabled as I thought it was the culprit and have not re-enabled it just yet. All those extensions listed in troubleshooting information I assume is things within the browser itself?? As I said I only have one extension active and only 2 installed. Please advise. Thank you. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",No1_Debb

I've disabled all add-ons and reset all settings to default as near as I can tell. The only time the browser displays properly is when it's in Safe Mode.

Dozens of tab crashes within the span of just a minute or two are not uncommon. Sometimes, the entire browser itself crashes. Usually, the reason given is a vague EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION_WRITE or EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION_READ. I should note that in my case, the crashes affect most of the browsers I use, but they do not crash nearly as often as firefox does. </p><p>I've tried using it without any extensions (clean install), and with hardware acceleration disabled. I've run a RAM test also, which showed no issues. Disk check also indicated no issues. I installed windows 10 and even windows 11 on the secondary hard disk, but the issue persisted. I've also tried forcing my discrete/integrated GPU to be used solely as the display adapter, but the crashes still persisted. </p><p>When using firefox on ubuntu, the crashes do not happen, strangely. There was only one instance that I noticed the crashes on ubuntu, and that was when I set my discrete graphics card as the exclusive display adapter, from the BIOS settings. </p><p>Anyway, nothing really sticks out as the root cause.

It’s this garbled mess of the last screen that stays there until a new shot or enough of the current image changes. It is really annoying as I am someone who tends to skip around a lot in videos and I tend to have to replay parts because of this or just deal with this mess. It only happens on YouTube and only on Firefox for some reason. If anyone knows what could be causing this, I’d really appreciate it. I haven’t been able to find a similar issue online, maybe I am searching the wrong thing. Tried to get some screenshots of it with something that would really show it. This has been happening for a while. I use a Mac Studio with an M1 Max since it released in 2022. I've tried reinstalling Firefox as well and that did not fix it.  </p><p>This happens on any video regardless of what quality settings it is at.
