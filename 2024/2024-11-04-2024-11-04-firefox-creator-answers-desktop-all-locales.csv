What is the best way going forward? I had 375 tabs open and of course designed my way. Besides saved passwords I have a couple gigs of cookies. Some pinned tabs etc. Should I just start over  with version 132 and struggle through it for a few weeks? It used to update automatically but for some reason it did not these last few months and 105 didn't even have an option to update. Thanks for any suggestions. </p><p>Tim </p>,firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",steinkamptim
