It’s this garbled mess of the last screen that stays there until a new shot or enough of the current image changes. It is really annoying as I am someone who tends to skip around a lot in videos and I tend to have to replay parts because of this or just deal with this mess. It only happens on YouTube and only on Firefox for some reason. If anyone knows what could be causing this, I’d really appreciate it. I haven’t been able to find a similar issue online, maybe I am searching the wrong thing. Tried to get some screenshots of it with something that would really show it. This has been happening for a while. I use a Mac Studio with an M1 Max since it released in 2022. I've tried reinstalling Firefox as well and that did not fix it.  </p><p>This happens on any video regardless of what quality settings it is at. I've tried adjusting hardware acceleration to no avail. I dont really know what else to try at this point. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;firefox-1310;firefox-13103;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",gamerman8998

What is the best way going forward? I had 375 tabs open and of course designed my way. Besides saved passwords I have a couple gigs of cookies. Some pinned tabs etc. Should I just start over  with version 132 and struggle through it for a few weeks? It used to update automatically but for some reason it did not these last few months and 105 didn't even have an option to update.
