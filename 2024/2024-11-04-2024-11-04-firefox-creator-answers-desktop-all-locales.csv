Dozens of tab crashes within the span of just a minute or two are not uncommon. Sometimes, the entire browser itself crashes. Usually, the reason given is a vague EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION_WRITE or EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION_READ. I should note that in my case, the crashes affect most of the browsers I use, but they do not crash nearly as often as firefox does. </p><p>I've tried using it without any extensions (clean install), and with hardware acceleration disabled. I've run a RAM test also, which showed no issues. Disk check also indicated no issues. I installed windows 10 and even windows 11 on the secondary hard disk, but the issue persisted. I've also tried forcing my discrete/integrated GPU to be used solely as the display adapter, but the crashes still persisted. </p><p>When using firefox on ubuntu, the crashes do not happen, strangely. There was only one instance that I noticed the crashes on ubuntu, and that was when I set my discrete graphics card as the exclusive display adapter, from the BIOS settings. </p><p>Anyway, nothing really sticks out as the root cause. Wonder if someone is able to decipher anything from the crash reports below <a href=""https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/bp-6927a483-6c22-4830-b057-1413e0241104"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/bp-6927a483-6c22-4830-b057-1413e0241104</a> <a href=""https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/bp-42b9b1f5-5820-4ed9-9c52-30c8e0241104"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/bp-42b9b1f5-5820-4ed9-9c52-30c8e0241104</a> <a href=""https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/bp-0b92e804-00e8-4515-9129-3b5db0241104"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/bp-0b92e804-00e8-4515-9129-3b5db0241104</a> <a href=""https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/bp-d27cdb0b-3e38-4507-925b-09ce30240914"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/bp-d27cdb0b-3e38-4507-925b-09ce30240914</a> <a href=""https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/bp-fa6b0609-ae19-4a66-a81d-078040240911"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/bp-fa6b0609-ae19-4a66-a81d-078040240911</a> </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",khalibloo

It’s this garbled mess of the last screen that stays there until a new shot or enough of the current image changes. It is really annoying as I am someone who tends to skip around a lot in videos and I tend to have to replay parts because of this or just deal with this mess. It only happens on YouTube and only on Firefox for some reason. If anyone knows what could be causing this, I’d really appreciate it. I haven’t been able to find a similar issue online, maybe I am searching the wrong thing. Tried to get some screenshots of it with something that would really show it. This has been happening for a while. I use a Mac Studio with an M1 Max since it released in 2022. I've tried reinstalling Firefox as well and that did not fix it.  </p><p>This happens on any video regardless of what quality settings it is at. I've tried adjusting hardware acceleration to no avail. I dont really know what else to try at this point. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;firefox-1310;firefox-13103;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",gamerman8998
