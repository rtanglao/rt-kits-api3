It's always happened once in a while but it hasn't been anything bothersome. However recently it has become quite bothersome because it's happening a lot! However not all the time. It's not completely broken, just mostly. And it's happening while trying to visit sites that I know and visit frequently such as Amazon, Ebay, and even sites for local businesses that I trust and know are working. I'm not having any internet issues with my home wifi, nor am I having this issue with other browsers. I have however also noticed it on my Firefox mobile browser as well. I posted about this a few days ago and got some email back about an issue with my post. If this happens with this one and I'm unable to get this resolved I will just get rid of Firefox on my devices. FF has been a long time favorite and is usually set as my default browser but if stuff like this is going to continue, I can change that real fast. There are plenty of other browsers that work just fine and have decent customer support. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",r.dunne71

But today, in order to get messages from my health care provider  at Kaiser Permanente -- <a href=""http://kp.org"" rel=""nofollow"">kp.org</a> -- and get a document I needed for physical therapy, I had to sign in via Microsoft Edge in order to log in to my member account. On my Windows 11 Pro computer, I kept getting the message shown in the attached screenshot = ""this page isn't redirecting properly"".   </p><p>I WAS able to sign in to <a href=""http://kp.org"" rel=""nofollow"">kp.org</a> from my mobile phone, but couldn't download the document from there.  But at least I was able to send an message to my doctor asking them to send me the document via snail-mail. </p><p>At first I thought the problem was the Kaiser web  site (which admittedly is pretty gawdawful).  Didn't have time to pursue it last week, because I was attending an all-day class Mon-Fri.  Finally today, when I got the same Firefox error message, I tried to access <a href=""http://kp.org"" rel=""nofollow"">kp.org</a> via Microsoft Edge.  Sure enough, it worked. </p><p>Then I searched Mozilla support, and found a closed message thread indicating that the problem had theoretically been ""solved"" by some sort of programming fix as of June 12th or thereabouts. </p><p>I do NOT want to switch to a browser maintained by Monopolists'R'Us.  I still bear a grudge because about 30 years ago they killed or marginalized two of my favorite programs (Lotus and WordPerfect) by giving away Excel and Word for free with Windows.   Even if I LIKED Microsoft, the default user interface is cluttered with too many cutesy-poo widgets and AS (artificial stupidity) ""help"" that I do not want.  But I'm an old lady (84), and if I need to communicate with my health care providers, I will have to use whatever method works, no matter how much it galls me.  </p><p>Hope you guys can find a fix to this problem that works for EVERYBODY (including me).

I simply cannot afford to upgrade right now - I'm working on it, though. So, since the last update on ESR, everything seems to be working well, browser-wise, except for a sudden change when using FB. They're problematic, so I thought it was something there, but there are no problems with any of my other devices ( 2 phones &amp; an ipad). For most situations on FB, without going into the whys, I need to use my/a laptop, instead of anything else. It has begun freezing and lagging -sometimes, for 10 minutes - after I start typing! And, the emoji panel takes that long to appear, then longer after hitting one! It's basically unusable. I already contacted them, and as previously mentioned, the laptop is the only problem after the last update, the other devices work well, in terms of speed. I'm wondering if there's anything I can do here to remedy this. I have 9 billion bookmarks and my settings are set in stone, so I can't risk losing any of that by reinstalling, or anything like that. I've been with Firefox since it became available, many years ago, so I'm not willing to sacrifice anything I've collected. All was fine, until this last update. And, I'm working on getting another laptop. Thank you for your time. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1150;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",sharrin

1451165,2024-06-29 18:46:12 -0700,2024-06-29 18:46:12 -0700,YouTube has very long load times,"<p>At some point about 5 days ago, Firefox began to load YouTube videos unacceptably slowly. To begin a video it may take around 30 seconds or more to load (with a black screen and circular loading bar/graphic), and randomly throughout the video it will need to load again which has taken up to 5 minutes at times.  </p><p>Steps I have taken:  - ran Firefox in troubleshooting mode (issue persisted with no extensions) - minimized memory usage - disabled hardware acceleration - refreshed Firefox twice - reinstalled Firefox </p><p>Testing/comparing YouTube in Chrome and Edge, videos load near instantaneously (even while running an extension such as uBlock Origin), and I can click anywhere in the duration of the video and it loads in less than a second. Strangely, sometimes the issue doesn't persist for the next 2-3 videos that I try to play, but then goes right back to an extremely long load time for the next video. I've never had such an issue with Firefox before and cannot find a solution. Extensions don't appear to be an issue and other browsers run YouTube perfecty fine. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",parkflemin
