1451165,2024-06-29 18:46:12 -0700,2024-06-29 18:46:12 -0700,YouTube has very long load times,"<p>At some point about 5 days ago, Firefox began to load YouTube videos unacceptably slowly. To begin a video it may take around 30 seconds or more to load (with a black screen and circular loading bar/graphic), and randomly throughout the video it will need to load again which has taken up to 5 minutes at times.  </p><p>Steps I have taken:  - ran Firefox in troubleshooting mode (issue persisted with no extensions) - minimized memory usage - disabled hardware acceleration - refreshed Firefox twice - reinstalled Firefox </p><p>Testing/comparing YouTube in Chrome and Edge, videos load near instantaneously (even while running an extension such as uBlock Origin), and I can click anywhere in the duration of the video and it loads in less than a second. Strangely, sometimes the issue doesn't persist for the next 2-3 videos that I try to play, but then goes right back to an extremely long load time for the next video. I've never had such an issue with Firefox before and cannot find a solution. Extensions don't appear to be an issue and other browsers run YouTube perfecty fine. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",parkflemin
