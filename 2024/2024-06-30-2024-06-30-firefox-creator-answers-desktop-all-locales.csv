Every page I visit I get at least one message popping up with the URL at the top, the message body of ""1"" and the option for OK.

When I search for something in FF and click on the MAPS button, it comes up with Apple Maps by default. I would like that button to open Google Maps by default. (Mainly because Apple Maps misses a lot of information and significantly hinders my searches. Invariably, opening Google maps gets me to my answer or information much quicker. </p><p>I have tried various help suggestions but simply have not been able to do this.  </p><p>Please can you tell me if it's possible to do this and if so, how? </p><p>Thanks again. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1270;firefox-12701;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",panicp

After returning home Firefox updated to 127.0.2 but now it will not close its process when I close its window. When I try to launch Firefox again I get the error message below and attached:  </p><p>""Firefox is already running, but is not responding. The old Firefox process must be closed to open a new window.     &lt;Close Firefox&gt;   &lt;Cancel&gt;"" </p><p>When I select ""Close Firefox"" the new Firefox window will then launch. However, if I open any web page the same error occurs after closing the window. </p><p>If I launch Firefox and then close it without opening a web page I do not get the error the next time I launch. Somehow going to any web page in Firefox prevents that instance of Firefox from closing. </p><p>I'm running Windows 10  22H2 Build 19045.4529 and it's shown as up-to-date. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1270;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1659820;,Stedman

I simply cannot afford to upgrade right now - I'm working on it, though. So, since the last update on ESR, everything seems to be working well, browser-wise, except for a sudden change when using FB. They're problematic, so I thought it was something there, but there are no problems with any of my other devices ( 2 phones &amp; an ipad). For most situations on FB, without going into the whys, I need to use my/a laptop, instead of anything else. It has begun freezing and lagging -sometimes, for 10 minutes - after I start typing! And, the emoji panel takes that long to appear, then longer after hitting one! It's basically unusable. I already contacted them, and as previously mentioned, the laptop is the only problem after the last update, the other devices work well, in terms of speed. I'm wondering if there's anything I can do here to remedy this. I have 9 billion bookmarks and my settings are set in stone, so I can't risk losing any of that by reinstalling, or anything like that. I've been with Firefox since it became available, many years ago, so I'm not willing to sacrifice anything I've collected. All was fine, until this last update. And, I'm working on getting another laptop. Thank you for your time. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1150;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",sharrin

To begin a video it may take around 30 seconds or more to load (with a black screen and circular loading bar/graphic), and randomly throughout the video it will need to load again which has taken up to 5 minutes at times.  </p><p>Steps I have taken:  - ran Firefox in troubleshooting mode (issue persisted with no extensions) - minimized memory usage - disabled hardware acceleration - refreshed Firefox twice - reinstalled Firefox </p><p>Testing/comparing YouTube in Chrome and Edge, videos load near instantaneously (even while running an extension such as uBlock Origin), and I can click anywhere in the duration of the video and it loads in less than a second. Strangely, sometimes the issue doesn't persist for the next 2-3 videos that I try to play, but then goes right back to an extremely long load time for the next video. I've never had such an issue with Firefox before and cannot find a solution. Extensions don't appear to be an issue and other browsers run YouTube perfecty fine. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",parkflemin
