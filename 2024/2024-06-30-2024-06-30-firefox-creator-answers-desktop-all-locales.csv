I simply cannot afford to upgrade right now - I'm working on it, though. So, since the last update on ESR, everything seems to be working well, browser-wise, except for a sudden change when using FB. They're problematic, so I thought it was something there, but there are no problems with any of my other devices ( 2 phones &amp; an ipad). For most situations on FB, without going into the whys, I need to use my/a laptop, instead of anything else. It has begun freezing and lagging -sometimes, for 10 minutes - after I start typing! And, the emoji panel takes that long to appear, then longer after hitting one! It's basically unusable. I already contacted them, and as previously mentioned, the laptop is the only problem after the last update, the other devices work well, in terms of speed. I'm wondering if there's anything I can do here to remedy this. I have 9 billion bookmarks and my settings are set in stone, so I can't risk losing any of that by reinstalling, or anything like that. I've been with Firefox since it became available, many years ago, so I'm not willing to sacrifice anything I've collected. All was fine, until this last update. And, I'm working on getting another laptop. Thank you for your time. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1150;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",sharrin

1451165,2024-06-29 18:46:12 -0700,2024-06-29 18:46:12 -0700,YouTube has very long load times,"<p>At some point about 5 days ago, Firefox began to load YouTube videos unacceptably slowly. To begin a video it may take around 30 seconds or more to load (with a black screen and circular loading bar/graphic), and randomly throughout the video it will need to load again which has taken up to 5 minutes at times.  </p><p>Steps I have taken:  - ran Firefox in troubleshooting mode (issue persisted with no extensions) - minimized memory usage - disabled hardware acceleration - refreshed Firefox twice - reinstalled Firefox </p><p>Testing/comparing YouTube in Chrome and Edge, videos load near instantaneously (even while running an extension such as uBlock Origin), and I can click anywhere in the duration of the video and it loads in less than a second. Strangely, sometimes the issue doesn't persist for the next 2-3 videos that I try to play, but then goes right back to an extremely long load time for the next video. I've never had such an issue with Firefox before and cannot find a solution. Extensions don't appear to be an issue and other browsers run YouTube perfecty fine. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",parkflemin
