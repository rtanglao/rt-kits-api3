But today, in order to get messages from my health care provider  at Kaiser Permanente -- <a href=""http://kp.org"" rel=""nofollow"">kp.org</a> -- and get a document I needed for physical therapy, I had to sign in via Microsoft Edge in order to log in to my member account. On my Windows 11 Pro computer, I kept getting the message shown in the attached screenshot = ""this page isn't redirecting properly"".   </p><p>I WAS able to sign in to <a href=""http://kp.org"" rel=""nofollow"">kp.org</a> from my mobile phone, but couldn't download the document from there.  But at least I was able to send an message to my doctor asking them to send me the document via snail-mail. </p><p>At first I thought the problem was the Kaiser web  site (which admittedly is pretty gawdawful).  Didn't have time to pursue it last week, because I was attending an all-day class Mon-Fri.  Finally today, when I got the same Firefox error message, I tried to access <a href=""http://kp.org"" rel=""nofollow"">kp.org</a> via Microsoft Edge.  Sure enough, it worked. </p><p>Then I searched Mozilla support, and found a closed message thread indicating that the problem had theoretically been ""solved"" by some sort of programming fix as of June 12th or thereabouts. </p><p>I do NOT want to switch to a browser maintained by Monopolists'R'Us.  I still bear a grudge because about 30 years ago they killed or marginalized two of my favorite programs (Lotus and WordPerfect) by giving away Excel and Word for free with Windows.   Even if I LIKED Microsoft, the default user interface is cluttered with too many cutesy-poo widgets and AS (artificial stupidity) ""help"" that I do not want.  But I'm an old lady (84), and if I need to communicate with my health care providers, I will have to use whatever method works, no matter how much it galls me.  </p><p>Hope you guys can find a fix to this problem that works for EVERYBODY (including me).

I simply cannot afford to upgrade right now - I'm working on it, though. So, since the last update on ESR, everything seems to be working well, browser-wise, except for a sudden change when using FB. They're problematic, so I thought it was something there, but there are no problems with any of my other devices ( 2 phones &amp; an ipad). For most situations on FB, without going into the whys, I need to use my/a laptop, instead of anything else. It has begun freezing and lagging -sometimes, for 10 minutes - after I start typing! And, the emoji panel takes that long to appear, then longer after hitting one! It's basically unusable. I already contacted them, and as previously mentioned, the laptop is the only problem after the last update, the other devices work well, in terms of speed. I'm wondering if there's anything I can do here to remedy this. I have 9 billion bookmarks and my settings are set in stone, so I can't risk losing any of that by reinstalling, or anything like that. I've been with Firefox since it became available, many years ago, so I'm not willing to sacrifice anything I've collected. All was fine, until this last update.
