They generally only take 30 seconds or so and very rarely involve a download. I spend a majority of my workday online. PLEASE help me get back to the version of Firefox that I had prior to this newest update, along with my hundreds of bookmarks, my Extensions, my Relay Premium and Pocket Premium subscriptions.
