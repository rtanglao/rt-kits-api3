There are currently 4 or 5 and are sites I regularly go so it's nice. Youtube, Twitch, a couple sites I use for forums, and then there's THE PORN. Right... So I'm trying to remove that specific search bar suggestion. The others can stay, but I don't want THE PORN SITE show up by simply clicking the search bar. I've tried looking for answers but nothing talking about this exactly, only other similar topics. I know I can go into the Search menu in Settings and uncheck the Shortcuts option, but that removes them all. I'd like to continue to use it for the other sites. There's never been a way that I can see to CHOOSE which sites end up there, that would be the easiest.  </p><p>I've add a picture to show what I mean. At the bottom is a porn site I enjoy <a href=""http://Fullporner.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Fullporner.com</a>, but I'd like that to NOT show up right with a simple click.
