I get the error msg ""Your Request Couldn't be Processed"" three times and then I can access FB, but I am then unable to post any images and am forced to leave FB since it is frozen.

There are other routine actions causing problems as well, but the bottom line is Firefox is losing its functionality and it is forcing me to use other browsers.  I am sure you don't want to lose users in the browser wars, so maybe you will take this particular concern seriously, and actually respond to me so I know you are actually out there and taking complaints about Firefox browser performance with the appropriate concern and action regarding this issue. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",alanbala
