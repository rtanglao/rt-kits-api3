Else I will have to downgrade and disable updates for the future. This new version is making it impossible to drag the browser around when it's below a certain width, because it covers the tabs area 100% now. I really need the feature to drag my browser around without maximizing it every time. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",kuanwu01
