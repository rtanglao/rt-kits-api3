There are other routine actions causing problems as well, but the bottom line is Firefox is losing its functionality and it is forcing me to use other browsers.  I am sure you don't want to lose users in the browser wars, so maybe you will take this particular concern seriously, and actually respond to me so I know you are actually out there and taking complaints about Firefox browser performance with the appropriate concern and action regarding this issue. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",alanbala
