One was removing my ex-wife as a computer admin, which meant that I'm now my Mac's primary admin. The second was downloading the Mac software update that addressed a security flaw.  </p><p>As you can see in the image attached, I now no longer see my extensions in my toolbar. I've re-installed them and they appear for a second and then disappear. This includes uBlock origin and Bitwarden - neither which appear to be operating even though they appear in my Settings to be active. Any suggestions? </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",rsigesmund
