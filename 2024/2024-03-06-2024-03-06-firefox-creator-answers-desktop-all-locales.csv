Se si sceglieva di aprirlo con il programma pdf, non veniva scaricato nella cartella di destinazione, ma solo aperto. Adesso viene scaricato comunque anche se non richiesto intasando cosi la cartella download.

Nos dois notebooks com W11 que possuo, o Firefox, quando os início, apresenta as miniaturas na barra de tarefas sempre carregando e sem nunca carregar as imagens das páginas web abertas; esse comportamento somente cessa quando reinicio os notebooks - após a reinicialização as miniaturas das páginas web abertas no Firefox apresentam corretamente as imagens. Se for possível uma ajuda quanto a isso, eu ficaria satisfeito, uma vez que já reinstalei o Firefox algumas vezes sem sucesso na solução da questão das miniaturas das páginas web na barra de tarefas e, por outra razão, já até recuperei para a condição de fábrica um dos notebooks que possuo e, após instalar o Firefox, seu comportamento é o mesmo descrito.

Usually, that means that my computer will stay awake while the movie plays. But after 4 years of this working without issue, I started having problems last November. </p><p>Since then, whenever I make videos fullscreen, they'll display as normal, but after a few minutes, my computer's screensaver will come on. It's like my computer can't recognize that the videos are fullscreen. It treats them as regular videos and kicks into whatever power management settings I've set up  </p><p>I've tried disabling all my add-ons. I've tried changing all my power settings. (Whatever power setting I choose, that's what ends up happening: screensaver at 10 min, 15 min, etc.) But nothing I do can get my computer to recognize fullscreen videos from Firefox . </p><p>This only happens with Firefox. When I play full screen videos in VLC, my computer does not go into screensaver/sleep/etc. </p><p>I'm running Firefox 123.0 on Linux Lite (Ubuntu).  </p><p>The only way I get this to work-- and it doesn't always work-- is if I restart my computer, Firefox will sometimes behave as expected. But if I finish a movie and let my computer go to sleep, then the next time it wakes, I'll have the same problem again.  </p><p>All help appreciated.

I believe I am misinterpreting some things on how secure the storage of passwords are for Firefox as I thought using the ""Primary Password"" function would encrypt everything properly. The hacker proved he had them unencrypted sending some examples to me to flaunt.  </p><p>Was he able to attain access to the passwords due to me already having firefox open when I was compromised (even if the primary password is asked before entering each password?) Or is there some issue with firefox not storing them properly? Or is there some other less know issue with windows or edge or something ""stealing"" the passwords and storing them in an unencrypted file without me knowing?  </p><p>This whole thing makes me feel less trustful of firefox to say the least and while the hack itself was my fault I just want to know if there was something else I could have done other than using keepass or some other password manager to exclusively store passwords (which is what I am going to do now and probably should have been doing) </p><p>TLDR - Primary password did not stop hacker from seeing passwords - Any clarification on whether this was my fault in trusting it for such things or if there is an actual issue with firefox's approach </p><p>Thanks for any help or clarification. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1230;firefox-12301;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1640649;1640651;,colza
