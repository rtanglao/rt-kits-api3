The popup blocks a significant area of the screen and will not move.  </p><p>I already have Update Settings on “Check for updates but let you choose to install them”. There is no option to “Do not check for updates” on these versions of Firefox and Thunderbird. I already have Windows 11 Notification Settings on “Do not disturb” and all Firefox notifications to Off. </p><pre>I have found the Mozilla Support article “Customising Firefox using Group Policy” at  <a href=""https://mzl.la/3bLnw2J"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mzl.la/3bLnw2J</a> but I do not understand it and the device I am using is not part of a group installation setup.  </pre> <p>There is a Step by Step guide “How to stop Firefox update notifications” on Youtube at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD-oXxrCCRs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nD-oXxrCCRs</a> . This is clear to follow if I pause it frequently to absorb each step carefully. Is this safe for me to try given that I am very inexperienced in using the command line and accessing registry etc?  </p><p>The Thunderbird popups have only recently started up and I would value advice on how to stop these safely too. I need this version of Thunderbird at present for particular reasons related to gmail so it is important I do not accidentally activate a download on that. </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,1681472;,uitrusthome

My only problem is once I've added the sidebar/show side bar tool to the tool bar it only displays the chat bot after I turn the setting on and off again. When I close the browser and reopen it, the sidebar button becomes a bookmark button instead. I'm just wondering if there's a solution to this where it only opens the chat bot? Or am i stuck with opening and closing the chat bot feature so it shows up when I click the menu bar shortcut? </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",kobequiambao2003
