Dopo un aggiornamento Firefox probabilmente non andato a buon fine causa caduta linea, non riesco più ad utilizzarlo in quanto cliccando sull'icona, si blocca immediatamente il PC con la rotellina ferma sullo schermo. Ho per diverse volte fatta la pulizia della cache e altro tramite CCleaner e GlaryUtilities, disinstallato e reinstallato Firefox, tentato anche il ripristino che comunque si blocca subito, verificato nel Firewall la corretta impostazione dell'app, ecc.. ma niente da fare. Chiedo vostro cortese aiuto per risolvere il problema. Grazie mille, cordiali saluti.

One thing I love about it is I've always been able to close Firefox and when Firefox starts up again, it always remembers all of my windows and all of my tabs. That is, until about 3 or 4 weeks ago. All of a sudden, when Firefox restarts, it usually loses many if not most of my windows. Sometimes some of the unopened windows are still available in page history. Other times, they are not. This is really really bad. I need Firefox to work like it always used to work, where you can shut down windows any time you want, and when you start Firefox up again, all the windows and all the tabs come back, no ifs ands or buts. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",jrubinstein1
