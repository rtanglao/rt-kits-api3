I am writing to seek assistance regarding an issue we have been facing with Firefox. After some days of usage, Firefox prompts us to create a new profile, and the browser does not function as expected unless we do so. Here are the details: •	We have installed the latest version of Mozilla Firefox several times (2-3 times). •	We have also created new profiles, but the issue persists. •	Despite these efforts, the error to create a new profile continues to reoccur. Could you kindly assist us in resolving this issue? Any guidance or troubleshooting steps would be greatly appreciated. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",manik.borvadkar

If my cursor goes over some of the white space (address bar, or the areas in between the tabs, or the area to the right of the open tabs assuming it isn't a full bar) it will auto-hide. I noticed I can trigger this behavior 100% simply by clicking anywhere in the tab bar (X or not) and the tab bar will attempt to auto-hide to full-screen mode. </p><p>I don't think it used to be this way so my question is: Is there a way I can change the settings to make the mouse cursor location the sole determining factor (clicking) in when the auto-hide feature activates, and if I can introduce a lag time of X seconds after the mouse leaves the top bar? </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",gelekeb764
