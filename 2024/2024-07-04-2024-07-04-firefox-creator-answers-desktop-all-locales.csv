BUT, I had to take it in for repair, and give them my Windows login details. When I got the computer back, I went to the bank login page, and the autofill was a different personal id number. Does this mean that somebody used Firefox on my machine to login to their account? Or could a reboot have meant that Firefox randomly changed the PID number?

If I'm trying to view comments on Medium, for example, I am unable to scroll in the comments window as the main page scroll bar blocks it. I did not have this issue with Firefox on my previous Windows 11 laptop. I've tried changing some settings to see if it makes any difference with no success. I found a previous question regarding a similar issue where someone replied with a suggestion to toggle the ""Always show scrollbar"" option in the General &gt; Browsing settings, however this option does not exist in my settings. </p><p>As seen in the attached screenshot, both scroll bars sometimes appear at the same time. However hovering the mouse over them activates the main windows scrollbar, making it impossible to scroll in the comments window. Trying to scroll the comments window with the keyboard arrow keys also does nothing.  </p><p>I would really appreciate some advice on how I can fix this! </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",videnoirr
