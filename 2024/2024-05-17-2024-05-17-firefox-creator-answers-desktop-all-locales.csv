Here are the details of the problem: </p> <ul><li> Error Message in Console: <strong>Uncaught out of memory</strong> </li><li> Memory Usage Observed: Using <strong>about:processes</strong>, I noticed that Firefox's maximum memory usage caps at around 7GB. </li><li> System Specifications: The machine running Firefox has 128GB of RAM, so there should be plenty of memory available. </li><li> Firefox Version: 126.0a1 </li></ul> <p>Given the significant amount of RAM available on my machine, it seems unusual that Firefox would hit a memory limit at just 7GB. I suspect there might be a bug or a misconfiguration causing this issue. </p><p>Can you please assist in diagnosing and resolving this problem? Are there any settings or configurations I should adjust, or is this a known issue with the current version of Firefox? </p><p>Thank you for your help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;needsinfo;nightly;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1653302;1653303;,davide.taurisano.dev

First world problem really. But I was wondering, is there a way to hotkey toggling preferences? or adding a toggle? it's probably relatively easy to create a extension with a button and a simple script, but was wondering if anyone knew of a direct way. thanks! </p>",desktop;tips;windows-11;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",ben_trout_42

This is just working fine with one little problem. When opening firefox the first time, it does not apply the policy to set the startpage to the url in the policy file. All other policies seem to be applied correctly.  I figured out, that at the first start of firefox, no user profile (folder) ""~/.mozilla/"" exists. When i click the little ""house"" button on the the top besides the refresh buton, the correct startpage is shown.  After the first start this folder is created and then the policies work fine even the startpage shows up directly.  Can I somehow use a template profiles-folder for new users, so they have the correct firefox feeling at the first start or is there something missing in my policy file&nbsp;? The policy file has rights set to ""644 root:root"" Image of the policy file is attached because I can't upload files other then images. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,other,en-US,"",naumaj
