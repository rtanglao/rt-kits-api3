Since yesterday (16 May), on the Wall Street Journal site, after I have logged in, I no longer have access to articles' comment threads. The Show Conversation button shows 0 comments (which is erroneous), and when I click the button, it changes to Hide Conversation (which is normal), but nothing else happens--just white space and no comments or comment text entry field. </p><p>On Fox News, the comment thread doesn't display, and there's not even displayed a link to a comment thread. Until yesterday, the thread normally displayed, but required login to comment. Since yesterday, logging in changes nothing: the comment thread still doesn't display at all. </p><p>On X (nee Twitter), when I click the login icon, I get the usual login box--but it's solid black with only a rotating arrow signifying ""loading."" It never finishes loading. An added fillip: X, as recently as last Wednesday, displayed in its usual black text on a white background. Now it displays as white text on a black background. I can click on X links sent to me and get that particular X post to display, but I cannot log in. </p><p>When I go to those sites in Edge, everything behaves normally: I have access to comment threads, and I can log in to X.

Here are the details of the problem: </p> <ul><li> Error Message in Console: <strong>Uncaught out of memory</strong> </li><li> Memory Usage Observed: Using <strong>about:processes</strong>, I noticed that Firefox's maximum memory usage caps at around 7GB. </li><li> System Specifications: The machine running Firefox has 128GB of RAM, so there should be plenty of memory available. </li><li> Firefox Version: 126.0a1 </li></ul> <p>Given the significant amount of RAM available on my machine, it seems unusual that Firefox would hit a memory limit at just 7GB. I suspect there might be a bug or a misconfiguration causing this issue. </p><p>Can you please assist in diagnosing and resolving this problem? Are there any settings or configurations I should adjust, or is this a known issue with the current version of Firefox? </p><p>Thank you for your help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;needsinfo;nightly;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1653302;1653303;,davide.taurisano.dev

This is just working fine with one little problem. When opening firefox the first time, it does not apply the policy to set the startpage to the url in the policy file. All other policies seem to be applied correctly.  I figured out, that at the first start of firefox, no user profile (folder) ""~/.mozilla/"" exists. When i click the little ""house"" button on the the top besides the refresh buton, the correct startpage is shown.  After the first start this folder is created and then the policies work fine even the startpage shows up directly.  Can I somehow use a template profiles-folder for new users, so they have the correct firefox feeling at the first start or is there something missing in my policy file&nbsp;? The policy file has rights set to ""644 root:root"" Image of the policy file is attached because I can't upload files other then images. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1250;firefox-12503;,firefox,other,en-US,"",naumaj
