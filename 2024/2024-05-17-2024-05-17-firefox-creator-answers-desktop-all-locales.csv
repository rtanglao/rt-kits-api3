However, I'm finding I'm missing the reading list functionality immediately.  It has become a basic part of how I browse, and I attempted to use Pocket, but I'm finding that I hate how Pocket works compared to Vivaldi's reading list.  Does anyone know of a good extension that emulates how Chromium-based browsers have their reading list, including working with sync so I can pass links between devices? </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1260;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",valeriemdeane

El problema es que no puedo ver contenido en ninguna de las tres plataformas que tengo (Netflix, HBO i Prime) porque me salen mensajes de errores. El mensaje que me sale de Prime dice que se necesita una versión más nuevas de Firefox, la cual ya tengo. ¿Cómo me puedo hacer para que los pueda ver? ¡Muchas gracias! </p><p>Tengo un ordenador con Windows 10. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1260;,firefox,other,es,"",bernigaudricardo

In every help topic I read, it says to click the three dots on Android, go to settings and click ""Sync and save data,"" then click ""Ready to scan"" and scan the QR code provided from my desktop account. The issue I am running into is that the ""Sync and save data"" option does not exist on my Firefox Android app. If I click on my profile on the phone, I can click ""Sync"" but it doesn't do anything. It does not work if I try to scan the QR code through the phone camera instead. I am at a loss for how to sync my Mozilla account on these two devices. My Firefox app is up to date. If anyone can help me I would appreciate it. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1260;,firefox,sync,en-US,1653262;1653263;1653264;,katelynbreen
