Estou testando um código que propositalmente tem um erro de digitação na linha 86:15, porém o navegador está indicando de forma incorreta. Fiquei inseguro de utilizar este navegador em futuros projetos quando houver algum problema porque ele irá me passar incerteza sobre qual o problema. Testei no navegador Vivaldi e ele apontou a linha correta, mas gostaria de utilizar o Firefox... </p>",desktop;beta;other;windows-10;firefox-1270;,firefox,other,pt-BR,"",matheus.a.c.rita

Today, whenever I would open a module, the page wouldn't load, meaning that I couldn't access that information at all (refreshing, restarting, and completely turning off my computer did not help). I can access these pages when I checked with microsoft edge, similarly I could access these pages when I accessed them with my laptop (also using Mozilla). The main difference between my pc and laptop is that I had just, today, updated my PC to the latest windows update (2024-05 cumulative update for windows 11 version 23H2 for x64-based systems).  I'm not entirely sure if it's a Mozilla problem, but im guessing that something funky is happening to my browser with the latest windows update. I have attached pictures to show whats happening / not happening . </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1260;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",brittanya2002

However, I'm finding I'm missing the reading list functionality immediately.  It has become a basic part of how I browse, and I attempted to use Pocket, but I'm finding that I hate how Pocket works compared to Vivaldi's reading list.  Does anyone know of a good extension that emulates how Chromium-based browsers have their reading list, including working with sync so I can pass links between devices? </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1260;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",valeriemdeane

In every help topic I read, it says to click the three dots on Android, go to settings and click ""Sync and save data,"" then click ""Ready to scan"" and scan the QR code provided from my desktop account. The issue I am running into is that the ""Sync and save data"" option does not exist on my Firefox Android app. If I click on my profile on the phone, I can click ""Sync"" but it doesn't do anything. It does not work if I try to scan the QR code through the phone camera instead. I am at a loss for how to sync my Mozilla account on these two devices. My Firefox app is up to date. If anyone can help me I would appreciate it. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1260;,firefox,sync,en-US,1653262;1653263;1653264;,katelynbreen
