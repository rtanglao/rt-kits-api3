In every help topic I read, it says to click the three dots on Android, go to settings and click ""Sync and save data,"" then click ""Ready to scan"" and scan the QR code provided from my desktop account. The issue I am running into is that the ""Sync and save data"" option does not exist on my Firefox Android app. If I click on my profile on the phone, I can click ""Sync"" but it doesn't do anything. It does not work if I try to scan the QR code through the phone camera instead. I am at a loss for how to sync my Mozilla account on these two devices. My Firefox app is up to date. If anyone can help me I would appreciate it. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1260;,firefox,sync,en-US,1653262;1653263;1653264;,katelynbreen
