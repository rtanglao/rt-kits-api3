Specifically, I want to disable data encryption and machine ID checks. I know that some chromium-based browsers allow you to do this through specific switches that turn these features off, resulting in a fully portable browser. While I'm aware of third-party applications that offer ready-made solutions, I prefer not to use them for security reasons. I'd like to prepare my own version of Firefox. </p><p>I understand some may have security concerns, but I know what I'm doing. The files will be stored on an AES256 encrypted drive. Could anyone share insights or guides on how to achieve this with Firefox? Thanks a lot </p><p>PS.For those who might suggest using synchronization, I assume that, similar to Chromium, Firefox can't sync all plugin settings, and for me, plugins are essential—without them, it's not really a browser. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",max-345
