All I get is a spinning icon or a blank page, not even any error messages.  This was even true trying to go to this page until I restarted in trouble shooting mode.  Until I can get Firefox working again I have been using Chrome with duck-duck-go.  Note any search, i.e. 'hotels in Italy' or even 'MSN' do the same: spinning icon or blank page!!  Any help would be appreciated.  Also I noticed that my bookmarks were missing and there was no bookmarks drop-down on my tools line.  I have run malware bytes and it showed clean, same with CCleaner.  I have re-installed Firefox; no difference.  Please help.  and also, any way to find and replace my extensive bookmarks list?  I have reduced my privacy to near zero and turned off firewalls and all limits I could find while testing for that.  That did not change anything. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1250;firefox-12501;,firefox,other,en-US,1648752;,onefoozer

But, that won't stop Firefox from harassing me with the EXACT same tip in a few minutes from now..... </p><p>This isn't the only ""tip"" it harasses me with.

Specifically, I want to disable data encryption and machine ID checks. I know that some chromium-based browsers allow you to do this through specific switches that turn these features off, resulting in a fully portable browser. While I'm aware of third-party applications that offer ready-made solutions, I prefer not to use them for security reasons. I'd like to prepare my own version of Firefox. </p><p>I understand some may have security concerns, but I know what I'm doing. The files will be stored on an AES256 encrypted drive. Could anyone share insights or guides on how to achieve this with Firefox? Thanks a lot </p><p>PS.For those who might suggest using synchronization, I assume that, similar to Chromium, Firefox can't sync all plugin settings, and for me, plugins are essential—without them, it's not really a browser. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",max-345
