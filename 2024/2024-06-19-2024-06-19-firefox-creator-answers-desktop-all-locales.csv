I thought clearing them would just reset them, but it looks like they were completely wiped instead. </p><p>Now, the browser never remembers any login information, so I have to connect to every site I use everytime I open my computer. It's troublesome when some of them have double verification and I have to go through the trouble of checking my email and entering a code everytime. The websites don't ask me to enable cookies again, so I don't know how to make them remember my informations again. </p><p>Is there a way to re-enable cookies, or have the websites ask me to enable cookies again? </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-11;firefox-1270;,firefox,cookies,en-US,"",zoedisco292
