Firefox just randomly stopped connecting a few days ago and I had the same issue with Google Chrome last month, which is when I made the switch to Firefox.  </p><p>If anyone knows anything that could maybe help, that would be great.

As I said in the headline, I have set all languages in the system as well as in Firefox to German and uninstalled and reinstalled the dictionary. So when I write something in Firefox it is underlined in red and when I right click for the context menu where word suggestions are made, only English is displayed and if I then scroll down and want to add another language as a spell checker, Firefox sends me to the add-on administration, which didn't help me. Because no matter what I do, only English (USA) is displayed as the language for spelling. Is there perhaps no way to change this, or is there another method? </p><p>Many thanks in advance.  </p><p>Leo Krause </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1658090;1658092;,krauseleo3
