(Ubuntu),"<p>We ask this today, August 20, 2024, in the hope of finding a current solution to a question that has been asked for years:  </p><p><strong>How to prevent Firefox from updating?</strong> </p><p>When we search for this answer online, we find many answers -- all of which seem outdated. The many solutions from many years ago (which appear at the top of search listings) no longer work or are no longer available. </p><p><strong>We like Firefox</strong>. otherwise we would not even bother asking. But we do not like that it appears users are losing the ability to customise their Firefox experience. We do not like that updates will sometimes break the way that we use Firefox. And we especially do not like that Firefox has become increasingly difficult to constrain. </p><p>If we wanted software that does not respect us we have many other other options. </p><p>What we want is: the option to tell Firefox that we will continue using this specific version of Firefox for as long as we wish, even if that leads to many terrible things. Yes, we want to know what those terrible things might be and to understand the implications of skipping this new update, but we want to make that informed decision; we do not want updates shoved down our throats. </p><p><strong>For those running Ubuntu (Jammy) in August of 2024 how does one successfully prevent Firefox (recent) from updating?</strong> We would prefer a menu option but will accept a third-party solution if necessary. We want, among other things, to put a stop to the ominous ""<em>in X days we will install the update regardless of your obvious intentions to avoid an update</em>"" messages.  </p><p>(We had these same issues back when we used Windows. The ability to prevent Firefox from updating seems to have been lost many years ago.) </p><p>Helpful responses are welcomed and appreciated. </p>",linux;desktop;install-and-update;firefox-1290;,firefox,install-and-update,en-US,1669399;,beep-bop-bleh

When it opens I notice that the address is not secure.  When I add https:// in front of it, it does in-fact open, which is good.  Even though I added that prefix to the address on the Internet Options page in my system, it still continues to open the old 'unsecured' way.  I also cleaned IGHome out of my system before resaving it.  Is there anyway to get my system to recognize the secure version?  And, if I open any sites with passwords on the unsecured version, they DO open as secured so in reality I am still safe (even though my system is not opening the https site). </p><p>2.  Also, on my IGHome page, there are 'Show Your History' and 'Show your Bookmarks' tabs at the top right in the toolbar.  When I used to open them they would open almost flush right.  Now they open almost in the center.  Is there a way to make them open in their previous flush right location again? </p><p>Thank you in-advance for any time and assistance! </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>Dana Desjardins <em><strong>Email removed for privacy</strong></em> </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1150;,firefox,other,en-US,"",SnowTiger99

Either this version or a version before seems to have broken a functionality that's been there for years. With the search bar, you can have it empty, and select a search option, say, Youtube, and it'll open up YouTube. If you have a search term in the search window, obviously it'll open youtube in the search page with those search terms. I've used this for years and years to quickly go to pages such as YouTube, Amazon, etc, without having to have a separate bookmark.  </p><p>Now, if you have the search bar empty and click on YouTube, or Amazon, or any other installed search option, it doesn't default open that page. It only opens when you have something typed into this. </p><p>Idk if this is a ""feature update"" or bug, but it's worked the same way for years, and now no longer does. </p>",desktop;windows-10;troubleshooting;firefox-1290;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,1669329;,drummerdude152002
