Since this is a big misleading considering these plugins actually have very broad permissions, I consider those plugins as abuse. I reported them 1 or 2 months ago but no response. I don't want to list those names out in case it was just the author selected a wrong selection, but i do believe that the author should correct that, and the more important thing is Mozilla should check this more carefully. </p>",other;plugin;plugins;,firefox,other,en-US,"",zxkmm

It is still set to 10 in about:config, however it will only show me a maximum of 6. I can change the number to anything below 6 and it'll work fine, but any number above six it doesn't work. Is this the result of a new update? Can I do anything to get it back to displaying 10 entries instead of 6? </p><p>Hi, ik gebruik al jaren FireFox, en al die tijd heb ik browser.urlbar.maxRichResults op 10 staan en als ik op de adresbar klikte kreeg ik logischerwijs mijn top 10 bezochte websites te zien die ik dan kon aanklikken. De instelling staat nog steeds op 10 in about:config, echter laat de adresbar me sinds gisteren slechts 6 websites zien. Ik kan het nummer veranderen naar alles vanaf 6 of eronder en dat werkt, maar alles boven 6 werkt niet. Komt dit door een recente update? Kan ik iets doen om toch weer 10 websites te zien te krijgen? </p><p>MVG Eric </p>",desktop;windows-10;troubleshooting;firefox-1290;firefox-12901;,firefox,troubleshooting,nl,"",eric_slingerland

When it opens I notice that the address is not secure.  When I add https:// in front of it, it does in-fact open, which is good.  Even though I added that prefix to the address on the Internet Options page in my system, it still continues to open the old 'unsecured' way.  I also cleaned IGHome out of my system before resaving it.  Is there anyway to get my system to recognize the secure version?  And, if I open any sites with passwords on the unsecured version, they DO open as secured so in reality I am still safe (even though my system is not opening the https site). </p><p>2.  Also, on my IGHome page, there are 'Show Your History' and 'Show your Bookmarks' tabs at the top right in the toolbar.  When I used to open them they would open almost flush right.  Now they open almost in the center.  Is there a way to make them open in their previous flush right location again? </p><p>Thank you in-advance for any time and assistance! </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>Dana Desjardins <em><strong>Email removed for privacy</strong></em> </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1150;,firefox,other,en-US,"",SnowTiger99
