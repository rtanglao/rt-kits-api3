When it opens I notice that the address is not secure.  When I add https:// in front of it, it does in-fact open, which is good.  Even though I added that prefix to the address on the Internet Options page in my system, it still continues to open the old 'unsecured' way.  I also cleaned IGHome out of my system before resaving it.  Is there anyway to get my system to recognize the secure version?  And, if I open any sites with passwords on the unsecured version, they DO open as secured so in reality I am still safe (even though my system is not opening the https site). </p><p>2.  Also, on my IGHome page, there are 'Show Your History' and 'Show your Bookmarks' tabs at the top right in the toolbar.  When I used to open them they would open almost flush right.  Now they open almost in the center.  Is there a way to make them open in their previous flush right location again? </p><p>Thank you in-advance for any time and assistance! </p><p>Sincerely, </p><p>Dana Desjardins kingscontrivance@gmail.com </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1150;,firefox,other,en-US,"",SnowTiger99

Either this version or a version before seems to have broken a functionality that's been there for years. With the search bar, you can have it empty, and select a search option, say, Youtube, and it'll open up YouTube. If you have a search term in the search window, obviously it'll open youtube in the search page with those search terms. I've used this for years and years to quickly go to pages such as YouTube, Amazon, etc, without having to have a separate bookmark.  </p><p>Now, if you have the search bar empty and click on YouTube, or Amazon, or any other installed search option, it doesn't default open that page. It only opens when you have something typed into this. </p><p>Idk if this is a ""feature update"" or bug, but it's worked the same way for years, and now no longer does. </p>",desktop;windows-10;troubleshooting;firefox-1290;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",drummerdude152002
