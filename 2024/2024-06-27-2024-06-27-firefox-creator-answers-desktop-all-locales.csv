When I go to Adobe Firefly though, I consistently get a warning that this browser is not compatible and they suggest using Chrome, Safari or the latest version of Firefox&nbsp;!!! I am using the latest version available, 127.0.2 but Adobe does not detect it correctly. I have to switch to Chrome, that I'm not very fond of. I saw that a similar issue was posted 10 months ago but it's now archived and I can't even include a link to it here&nbsp;:( So, I hope this comment helps in case others have the same problem.

This is documented at <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/keyboard-shortcuts-perform-firefox-tasks-quickly"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/keyboard-shortcuts-perform-firefox-tasks-quickly</a> </p><p>However, since a recent update this no longer works. Instead, pressing F6 now switches the keyboard focus to the lefthand tree pane. A further press of shift+tab is needed to move to the search box. </p><p>My questions are: Has F6 stopped jumping to the library search box for anyone else? If so, was this a deliberate design choice? Does anyone know of an alternate keyboard shortcut to jump to the searchbox? Finally, is there anyway to revert to the old F6 behaviour? </p><p>Even if you can only answer the first question that would help, so I can determine whether or not it is just my Firefox.
