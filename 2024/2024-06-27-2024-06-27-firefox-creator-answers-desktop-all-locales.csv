I feel that this has to do with some brain-washing agenda. I don't want to see these stupid pro-women news slapped on my face every time I open Firefox. How to show ""pro-human"" news that include both pro-men news and pro-women news?  </p><p>Right now, I'm seeing many ""Feminist news"" rather than anti-feminist news. So, I'm completely blinded by one side of the coin. Here's the problem. Even when I see these feminist news, it's always positive about them. There are no ""Redpill, MGTOW, MRA, MRM"" news which is obviously the other side of the coin and I do see it, it's often negative. I see a bias here. I don't want that bias to be fed to my brain.  </p><p>In short, I want to see a balanced view or ""Pro-male"" news because I'm a man. I don't want to be fed all these ""Pro-female"" news to me. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",liamjacobjose4
