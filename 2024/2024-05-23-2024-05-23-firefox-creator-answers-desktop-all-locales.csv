I have a strange problem that started a while ago. Every time I restart the computer to refresh it, all my bookmarks and log-ins change.

A lot of bookmarks folder are gone all together and others only have a few bookmarks left in them. I suddenly have to enter passwords to get into my email accounts.  Even stranger, after a while it all goes back to my current setting without me changing anything. This can take days or weeks.  All this makes me nervous about restarting my computer. Please understand that I am not a computer wiz, so if you send me complicated instructions on how to fix this, I probably won't understand them. I hope there is a simple explanation for this.
