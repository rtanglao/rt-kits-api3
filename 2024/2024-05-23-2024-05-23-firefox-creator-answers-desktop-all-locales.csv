Primeiro gostaria de agradecer muito ao Senhor ""Herbert May 18, 2024, 11:40:57 AM"" que me deu atenção.  Informo que segui suas orientações, mas não consegui resolver. Agora mesmo mostrou a mesma mensagem. Onde o Senhor orienta para entrar no ""Gerenciador...ou pressionar Ctrl+Shift+Esc"", no ""Gerenciador aberto não existe ""...processo do Firefox na lista..."" Isso é um erro correto? Quando dá a mensagem e  abro o Gerenciador ai, mostra só ""Firefox "", e clicando com o lado direito e, em seguida encerrar tarefa ai fecha. Isso é o mesmo que clicar OK na tela da mensagem.  Não mostrar no G.Tarefa ""Firefox"" tem algum erro no meu Windows 10? (não informei a primeira postagem).   Herbert obrigado e se for possível fico aguardando uma resposta. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1260;,firefox,fix-problems,pt-BR,"",TeixeiraCarlos
