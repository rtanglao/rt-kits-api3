However it sometimes generates a password I don't want to use. Maybe it contains a swear, or something gross. </p><p>I would have thought if I erased it from the input box, and then hit the option to suggest a strong password over again, it would give a <em>different</em> securely generated password. No go, same one again. I tried going into the password list and removing the password, then going back and hitting the generator again. <strong>Must</strong> make a new one, right? No, it stubbornly returns the same exact bad one. </p><p>What is going on, and how do I make Firefox actually re-do the password generation, instead of repeating the same one? </p>",firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1688806;,PAGulley

I didn't notice until I received a notice about a recent Firefox update but Firefox wouldn't update. I ended up uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox and now in addition to that and loosing all my saved themes, add ons, bookmarks, passwords, etc. I can not even add on anything such as ad blockers for example. I am not sure what changed or maybe I made a minor change and forgotten about it but it's very frustrating. I have gone on here searching and trying suggestions using a chrome because I can't do much on Firefox now but I've gotten nowhere.

Other file icons on the desktop are full-sized and easy to see.  Is there a way to make these Firefox/PDF icons full-sized, other than selecting a different default app for PDF files? Screenshot example attached. Thanks!

If I touch ANY key on my keyboard (mouse is fine) while it is the focused window, it will crash instantly. No question or hesitation.
