Los Marcadores no me figuran, ya hice una copia manual en mi antigua Pc en archivo html y la nueva no me los reconoce como marcadores, tambien probe en restaurar a varias versiones anteriores a la fecha de la nueva Pc y nada. Me salen carteles como ""no se pudo procesar el archivo de resguardo"". Probe todas las opciones de internet de restaurar, exportar e importar, y nada. Reinicie equipo, desinstale e instale nuevamente. Ademas la sincronizacion se queda trabajando eternamente sin fin. Las claves y demas funcionan bien.  El historial no registra ninguna pagina, tanto el de la antigua Pc como las nuevas paginas que visito no figuran.  No se que mas probar... Cualquier ayuda se agradece.

I looked into that, it suggested deleting the profiles.ini file... I did, and it didn't do anything. I then tried deleting the profile folder entirely. That changed the error at least. Now it says 'no profile.' </p><p>So, I tried following directions to create a new profile. Win+R, firefox.exe -p and then tried to create a new profile and... nothing.

Microsoft changed the behavior of Windows, supposedly for security, so that clicking the Firefox button to make it the default web browser is no longer allowed. Instead, I get taken to the default apps section of Settings, where the only choices are Edge and Internet Explorer. No Firefox. Same with images and with video. Microsoft is not helping with this and I'm damned if I'm wading through probably a hundred or so file extensions changing each one individually.
