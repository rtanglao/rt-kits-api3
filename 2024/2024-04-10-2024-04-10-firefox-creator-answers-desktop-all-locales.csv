I've tried the following CSS: </p><p>``` input:autofill, input:-moz-autofill, input:-webkit-autofill { </p><pre>   filter: none&nbsp;!important;    background: rgba(0, 98, 155, 0.35)&nbsp;!important; </pre> <p>} ``` </p><p>On top of that, I tried changing that for myself in <strong>about:config</strong> changing <strong>ui.-moz-autofill-background</strong> to <strong>false</strong>, but after clearing browser cache and doing a hard-refresh, the yellow autofill background color persists. </p><p>That would be a personal fix, but I would rather firefox not murder the theme of my site for others and let me have control of what color the autofill background color should be (if I even want there to be a difference in colors). Am I missing something? I don't simply want to turn that off for myself (although I still want to, but it didn't work). I want to change it for everyone visiting my site. (Like I'm able to change the colors of link or border colors or background colors of other elements). </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,customize,en-US,1646578;,Bogey
