The top of Firefox gets hidden by white and grey ""bar"" and he can not even use the ""functions"" of buttons behind that.  -&gt; Please see attached Print screens Lower part of the Favorites-bar is visible and also works if he clicks on it - everything above not visible and does not work for clicking. </p><p>The problem only comes up from time to time maybe once or twice a week. When he minimizes Firefox the application behind is visible normally. when he maximizes it again, same problem still visible in Firefox. When he closes RDP Session and reconnects - the problem disappears. When he turns off the monitor where Firefox is  visible - Firefox gets move over to the other monitor and the problem disappears. </p><p>I am not 100% sure if this is a Firefox problem or Remote Desktop Problem (or maybe an add-in problem). But until now it only happened on Firefox! </p><p>He is always on the last recent version of Firefox, we just updated today to the latest version again - but I can not say yet, if the problem would still exist on the latest version from today. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;,firefox,other,en-US,"",astrupler
