I have noticed that the bugs really had no response for nearly then(almost 6 months), so is it the way bugs are handled?, like they take long time to address( just asking as I though the process to be relatively fast) or is it something that I might be doing wrong in reporting a bug. I searched online and have been looking at assigning the bug( what I understood). So, how to do it if there exists something like assigning and will it increase the movement on my bugs?? </p>",linux;desktop;other;needsinfo;firefox-1250;firefox-12502;,firefox,other,en-US,1650146;,bhaumik2386
