I have noticed that the bugs really had no response for nearly then(almost 6 months), so is it the way bugs are handled?, like they take long time to address( just asking as I though the process to be relatively fast) or is it something that I might be doing wrong in reporting a bug. I searched online and have been looking at assigning the bug( what I understood). So, how to do it if there exists something like assigning and will it increase the movement on my bugs?? </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1250;firefox-12502;,firefox,other,en-US,"",bhaumik2386

I then run ""firefox -allow-downgrade"" from the command prompt and everything works fine... for a few days, when it happens all over again.  This only started happening a couple of weeks ago, but it's getting <em>really</em> annoying.  How do I stop it (short of using something like Waterfox or Brave). </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",peter.dell
