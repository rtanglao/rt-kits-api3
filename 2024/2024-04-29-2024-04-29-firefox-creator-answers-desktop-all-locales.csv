I then run ""firefox -allow-downgrade"" from the command prompt and everything works fine... for a few days, when it happens all over again.  This only started happening a couple of weeks ago, but it's getting <em>really</em> annoying.  How do I stop it (short of using something like Waterfox or Brave). </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1650169;1650211;,peter.dell
