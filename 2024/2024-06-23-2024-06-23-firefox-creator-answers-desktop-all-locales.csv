But when I clicked to ask me before downloading, it does! And it gives me the 1st option to save the the folder I specified.  But if I uncheck the ""ask me"" button, it goes back to putting downloads in my home directory, which I don't want.  Another example is I've set it to ""open previous windows and tabs on startup"", but it doesn't.  When I close Firefox with several tabs open, the next time I start it I have just the home tab.  Yet when I look in ""settings"" it still says it's supposed to be opening my previous tabs.  This is more annoying than the download issue.
