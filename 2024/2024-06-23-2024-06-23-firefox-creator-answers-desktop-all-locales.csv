A few days ago and with no reason I can discern, it now saves any non-English screenshots with something like this ""Screenshot 2024-06-23 a[...].png"" instead of ""Screenshot 2024-06-22 at 08-02-28 Politics Policy Polit[...].png"" (usual for English text and what I used to get with all languages) which means I have to manually rename screenshots. Does anyone know how I can fix this because I am working on a project with lots of screenshots for topics from different languages? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1270;firefox-12701;,firefox,other,en-US,"",anonalias999

Firefox is inconsistent in following the settings I put in.  For example, I specified the download folder, but it still automatically saved to the original default folder.  But when I clicked to ask me before downloading, it does! And it gives me the 1st option to save the the folder I specified.  But if I uncheck the ""ask me"" button, it goes back to putting downloads in my home directory, which I don't want.  Another example is I've set it to ""open previous windows and tabs on startup"", but it doesn't.  When I close Firefox with several tabs open, the next time I start it I have just the home tab.  Yet when I look in ""settings"" it still says it's supposed to be opening my previous tabs.  This is more annoying than the download issue.  How can I get Firefox to follow the settings, which ARE being saved? </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1157;firefox-11570;,firefox,customize,en-US,1658701;1658702;,jan.afn.org
