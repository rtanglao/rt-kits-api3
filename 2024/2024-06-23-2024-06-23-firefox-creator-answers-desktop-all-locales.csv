On that page I had placed the icons for my frequently used programs. Each of the small ""icon boxes"" had menus that would allow entering a URL so that when clicked, the desired app would open. I was exploring MS Bing, mostly because I like the pictures they put up each day. It looks as though a ""new Improved"" version of Bing brings along the new MS AI component. Together they seem to have removed my Firefox setup or hidden it where I can't retrieve it. By using Firefox settings, I was able to remove the Bing URL. Good riddance!, but can I retrieve my page of links to most-used programs? I don't know where to look for that. If I have to reconstruct it, how is that done. Or how can I start a replacement. Sincere thanks, Greg Schultz </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1270;firefox-12701;,firefox,other,en-US,1658802;,Gresch
1450684,2024-06-23 09:27:07 -0700,2024-06-23 09:47:48 -0700,Development: Very specific problem with getting the caret position in a contenteditable div,"<p>Hello, I'm a web developer. I'm using the Firefox Developer Edition and currently working on a project that requires caret manipulation. I have this function right here that fetches the caret's client rect: ``` function getCaretRect(): DOMRect | null { </p><pre> const sel = window.getSelection()  if (!sel || sel.rangeCount === 0) return null </pre> <pre> const range = sel.getRangeAt(0)  const rects = range.getClientRects()  if (rects.length === 0) return null </pre> <pre> return rects[0] </pre> <p>} ``` Here is where the issue arises. Suppose I have a contenteditable div with two line breaks (no new lines), and the second line is smaller than the first one. If the caret is positioned somewhere that is further than the end of the second line, and I press the down arrow key, then left, for some reason the caret rect I get has all values set to zero, like this: `{ x: 0, y: 0, width: 0, height: 0, top: 0, right: 0, bottom: 0, left: 0 }` I will add an image to explain further. </p><p>I don't have this issue on Chromium based browsers, but cross browser support is important for me. </p><p>There is one more issue to do with caret manipulation which is how contenteditable divs are handled. On a Chromium based browser, if I have a parent div that's contenteditable, then another div that's not contenteditable (contenteditable=""false"" explicitly), then two children divs which are both contenteditable (or more), I can navigate through the divs freely using the arrow keys and focus is managed better alongside event handlers. This is not present on Firefox, however. </p><p>If this is not the right place to ask for help then please guide me where is more suitable. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1658786;1658788;,rayaneb_o7
