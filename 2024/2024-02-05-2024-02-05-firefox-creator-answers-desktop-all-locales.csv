El día de ayer, inicié como todos los días mi sesión en el computador, abrí el mozilla, estuve trabajando un tiempo y por error presioné el ícomo de home, que se encuentra en la parte superior izquierda del mozilla. Inmediatamente el mozilla, comenzó a cargar a la vez, todas las páginas que yo tenía abiertas, pero luego me dí cuenta de que realmente no me abrió las mismas páginas que yo tenía abiertas, sino otras que había abierto tiempo atrás (Meses antes). Me preocupé y pensé que desactivando la opción de  ""open previous windows and tabs"", evitaría que al reabrir el mozila se me cargaran nuevamente las páginas erradas (viejas), entonces desactivé esa opción y cerré el programa. Ahora, ya no encuentro en ninguna parte las tabs que tenía abiertas antes de cometer ese error de presionar el ícono de home y tampoco me funciona restaurar sesión previa. He perdido un año de investigaciones que tenía abiertas en las pestañas del firefox y he intentado de muchas maneras que he visto en videos en internet y ninguna funciona, porque al parecer, solo está la copia de seguridad que firefox hizo cuando cerré por última vez el programa (Que por error contenía páginas que eran muy viejas y yo no deseaba abrir). Espero me puedan colaborar. Muchas gracias. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,es,"",alejpv
