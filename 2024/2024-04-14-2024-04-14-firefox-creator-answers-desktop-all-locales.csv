If Firefox saves all the form, you should explicitly rename Logins by any forms/inputs. </li><li> Numbered list item History? note: I hope this is only URLs. </li></ol> <p><strong>Security issue #2:</strong> After realizing the above,  I deleted all my cache and history from the History menu. Then I toggled Sync by ""Sign[ing] Out"" and forcing ""delete all data from this device (password, bookmarks, etc.)"".  That closed Firefox. Then thinking this would be a clean version, I realized that my bookmarks were gone, so I decided to enable syncing again only for the bookmarks. When the prompt asked for my login which I entered (My email) but then my password was still saved (masked but still saved). </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1159;firefox-11591;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",debvmtesting

Weâ€™re having trouble finding that site.""  This has happened ever since loading the most recent version of Firefox (124.0.2) and it is very, very frustrating.  What is causing this?  Even in ""safe"" mode this occurs.  Please rectify this situation.  I do not want to have to change browsers after more than 20 years with Firefox. </p><p>Robert Jonathan Blue </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",vze2dp6g
