I've already gone to Privacy &amp; Security--&gt;Notificatications.  This is feature is totally pointless. This feature assumes you repeadily go to the same singular site that causes pop ups --not random site you visit. I did check off the button at the bottom ""Block new requests asking to allow notifications.""  My issue is NOT, NOT seeking to block ""permissions"" (I have never seen or been asked by Firefox to 'allow permission for website notifications')--I'm seeking to stop ALL website pop ups notifications that intrusively just appear at the lower right corner. I don't understand why there isn't a single button to stop these intrusive and annoying pop up pushes??? It's a no brainer. I hope you can help with a solution. Thank you in advanced. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1230;firefox-12301;,firefox,other,en-US,"",StevenLAX16
