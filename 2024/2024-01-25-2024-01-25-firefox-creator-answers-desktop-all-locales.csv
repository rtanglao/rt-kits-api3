Trying to move the misplaced bookmarks just means chasing them around the page with them NOT going where I want them, and often moving other bookmarks OUT of place. The only workaround I've found is to kill the manager and reopen it - but this often has to be done SEVERAL times to fix the problem, and it can happen again minutes later on another bookmark. Given I had to give up on the drop down bookmark toolbar because it reverts to the top of the list EVERY TIME I try to use it, I have been using the manager to access everything.
