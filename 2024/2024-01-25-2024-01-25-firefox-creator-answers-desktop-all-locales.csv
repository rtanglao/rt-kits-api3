This issue is not specific to this website, it happens often in many other cases. Is this being worked on?

I love it. But increasingly, I am running into problems with using features in many websites.  </p><p>For instance with Cigna Health, you can't reset your pw and open certain other links. Cigna Support has a simple solution which has always solved my problem: use Chrome or Edge.  </p><p>B&amp;H Photo Video mostly works but for instance if you are looking at the pictures associated with a product review and try to enlarge them, FF won't do it. Chrome and Edge do it.  </p><p>I am finding more and more websites that have these glitches. It's almost as if some website designers are not paying any attention to compatibility of their product with FF.  </p><p>Am I missing something in the config of FF or are these issues real and likely to get worse over time? I am very worried that if it continues that I will get a message like ""Many features on this website are not compatible with FireFox."" </p><p>I am not a programmer but if there is anything I can do to help, I am glad to do so.  </p><p>sfoAlan </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",alan225

I was told to delete all but one of the profiles, check the ""Use the selected profile without asking at startup Check box, and then hit the ""Start Firefox"" button.   Firefox then opens up.   </p><p>If I quit Firefox and fire it back up again, I again see the little, ""Open existing Firefox Application?"" window.
