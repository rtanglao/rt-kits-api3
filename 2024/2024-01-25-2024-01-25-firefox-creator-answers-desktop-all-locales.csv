I ask because the site I was trying to access suddenly has stopped working on other browsers, so I thought I would try it on Firefox, and this is what happened. I do not have the security key it is asking for so I cannot even log into the site. The site support told me that they recommend Google Chrome. It seems too coincidental that it suddenly stops working on other browsers and Firefox won't even let me login. Nor has it EVER asked me for a physical security key to access any site before. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1210;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1632820;,antony.henry911

It's almost as if some website designers are not paying any attention to compatibility of their product with FF.  </p><p>Am I missing something in the config of FF or are these issues real and likely to get worse over time?
