My latest install however, for a client, is version 7.11.10 and for some reason the right-click drop down contextual menu that allows you to copy a widget and paste it is no longer working in Firefox. I can bring up that right-click menu using Chrome, but all I see in Firefox are the crosshairs. In other Avada installs (version 7.11.5 and older), the menu works perfectly. I've checked with Avada Support and they're unable to replicate the issue in Firefox. Bizarre. It's a long shot, but I thought I'd see if anyone on here has encountered the same issue.
