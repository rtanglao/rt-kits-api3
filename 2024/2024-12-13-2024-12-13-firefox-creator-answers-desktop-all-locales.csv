I signed into my Firefox account and opened Firefox. The Bookmarks Toolbar loaded but all the  original icons had turned to globes and I had to open each one to get the original icons back on the Bookmarks Toolbar. The same thing happens to the icons in the Recent Bookmarks column. The add-ons also dissapear from the add-ons toolbar and I had to go into Manage Extension and Enabled them to get them back up. The problem is that when I close Firefox I have to log back in and do the same thing all lover again. I reaserched the problem for fixes but found no nothing covering this issue. Anyone have a suggestion for a way to fix this issue? Firefox works fine in my old computer. Thank you for your time. </p>,firefox;accounts;,firefox,accounts,en-US,"",lwnfpgc

I feel like my Firefox may be corrupted and entering bad registry code. Is there a 'fix' I can run to correct these errors, or should I delete my Firefox and download a new copy.
