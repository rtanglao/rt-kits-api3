However- I have been having an issue with links that I am attempting to open in a specific container that will load, and then immediately reload into the tab without a container. This has happened several times. The most recent example is that I clicked on a link from FB, a site I tend to avoid, and specified that I want it opened in a FB tab, as I don't trust them not to track me beyond that. However, the link loaded in the FB tab and immediately again with no container whatsoever. There was no request, no warning that I had set up the ""multi-account container"" and did I want to use it in the designated container... nothing. This has happened with links before as well. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-11;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1630612;,natikaal

When I checked what was happening, I found there were up to 14 Firefox 'windows' showing in my Task Manager, and collectively these 'windows' were consuming over 25% of the computer memory (650+MB) even with Firefox just opened as the initial browser screen; no addresses etc had yet to be added. I've followed many of the troubleshooting suggestions, but to no avail. I have not reset the browser as yet as I need to understand the root of the problem </p><p>Thanks in advance for your assistance Duncan Hodder </p>",desktop;other;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,other,en-US,1630598;1630613;,hindi_hodder
