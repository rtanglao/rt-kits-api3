It was 4 or 5 tabs. </p><p>They came in, started to load, and I pinned them to my pinned tabs list. I only have about 15 pinned tabs. </p><p>I went to open a new tab to do something else while I let the newly arrived tabs sit there. I look back at my taskbar, they're gone. </p><p>I tried to record a video of what happened. Didn't work unfortunately. </p><p>Firefox can fix this unreliability by giving me a universal synced 'send tabs' history to view. </p><p>All in all, I remember an initial period where send tabs was unreliable. Then it became more reliable. Then this happened. </p><p>I cannot trust send tabs ever again, at least for a very long time. Please implement 'send tabs' history. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-11;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",ACookieMonster
