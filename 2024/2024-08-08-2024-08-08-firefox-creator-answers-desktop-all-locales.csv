In the search field (next to the shield &amp; lock) the website for the search appears, eg <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=how+secure+are+android+phones"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=how+secure+are+android+phones</a>   or <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=nsw+service+parking+meter+app"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=nsw+service+parking+meter+app</a> there is no other response and no activity in bottom left corner of the window. </p><p>Simply clearing history (history, cookies, cached files, but not site settings) fixes the problem and the search can then be repeated and new searches done until the next time, when it's a case of rinse &amp; repeat.  No other action is required, which would seem to suggest that the problem isn't elsewhere. </p><p>This problem affects both my wife's and my PC (same configs), and has for several weeks, sorry can't be more precise as to when it started. </p><p>Thanks, Mike </p>",desktop;windows-10;troubleshooting;firefox-1290;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",mike741

That is, unless I close all open tabs of those sites and then try to visit them; then they also stop working like everything else. </p><p>I'm not sure what the cause could be.
