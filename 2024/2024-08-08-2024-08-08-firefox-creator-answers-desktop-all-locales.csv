Then I open some new tabs and try visiting other websites, but they also get stuck in the ""forever loading"" state. </p><p>It's not an internet problem because other programs on my computer are still connecting just fine, including to the same sites I'm trying to visit on Firefox. </p><p>An interesting wrinkle: other sites that I already had open tabs in when the problem starts will continue to be able to connect to other pages in that site and otherwise receive new data from that site, whether in the same tab or in a new tab.  Specifically YouTube and Discord.  I can continue receiving new Discord messages and watching new YouTube videos, while other sites fail to load.  That is, unless I close all open tabs of those sites and then try to visit them; then they also stop working like everything else. </p><p>I'm not sure what the cause could be.  In the instance that happened today, the link that initiated it was literally to the homepage of the same site I was already on.  And nothing seems to resolve the problem except for exiting Firefox entirely and relaunching it. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1280;firefox-12803;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",tfaholic09
