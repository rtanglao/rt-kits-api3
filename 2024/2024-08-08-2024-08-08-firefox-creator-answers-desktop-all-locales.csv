The pasted data is pasted into a Word chart - each Excel cell of data is pasted into its own box in the Word chart.  However after just moving to One Drive, the copy/paste action fails to paste correctly into Word via One Drive.  Instead of each Excel cell of data being pasted into its own box in the Word chart, all the cell data from Excel gets pasted into only the 1st box in Word  when using One Drive.  This is unique to Foxfire.  The problem does not occur using Edge or Chrome.  Can you please help to suggest what might be an easy solution.  This is on a brand new Dell Latitude using Windows 11.

I sometimes get the message ""Firefox is installing components needed to play the audio or video on this page. Please try again later."" I thought this was an issue with my DRM, but Netflix, Spotify, and Disney+ content all play like normal.  </p><p>Widevine says that it was updated today, and when I try to install a different version it says the file is corrupt.  </p><p>My hosts file has not been changed from the default settings. </p><p>I also can't access <a href=""http://gvt1.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gvt1.com</a>; it says that the server was not found.  </p><p>I've tried reinstalling Firefox multiple times to no avail. </p><p>Are there any other possible solutions to this problem? </p>",desktop;troubleshooting;windows-11;firefox-1290;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",dsf12108

Then I open some new tabs and try visiting other websites, but they also get stuck in the ""forever loading"" state. </p><p>It's not an internet problem because other programs on my computer are still connecting just fine, including to the same sites I'm trying to visit on Firefox. </p><p>An interesting wrinkle: other sites that I already had open tabs in when the problem starts will continue to be able to connect to other pages in that site and otherwise receive new data from that site, whether in the same tab or in a new tab.  Specifically YouTube and Discord.  I can continue receiving new Discord messages and watching new YouTube videos, while other sites fail to load.  That is, unless I close all open tabs of those sites and then try to visit them; then they also stop working like everything else. </p><p>I'm not sure what the cause could be.  In the instance that happened today, the link that initiated it was literally to the homepage of the same site I was already on.  And nothing seems to resolve the problem except for exiting Firefox entirely and relaunching it. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1280;firefox-12803;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",tfaholic09
