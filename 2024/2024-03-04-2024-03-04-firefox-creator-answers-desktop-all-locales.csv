I am reaching out to seek assistance with a specific issue I am encountering in the Firefox browser. </p><p>In my previous browser, when opening new tabs, they were considered active even if I did not immediately switch to them. This behavior allowed me to open multiple tabs, for example, by using the mouse wheel to open several videos from the main YouTube page. Subsequently, when closing the main page, the videos would be available in the order they were opened, facilitating a seamless viewing experience. </p><p>Upon transitioning to Firefox, I have attempted to configure the browser to replicate this behavior using the Sidebery extension. However, even with the extension, new tabs are not recognized as active unless I explicitly switch to them, making it challenging to maintain the desired tab activation order. </p><p>I have explored various settings and experimented with the Sidebery extension but have not been successful in achieving the desired result. In contrast, the Yandex browser, with the ""Switch to the previous active tab when closing a tab"" option enabled, behaves in the manner I am accustomed to. </p><p>Could you please provide guidance on how I can configure Firefox to consider new tabs active immediately upon opening, regardless of whether I switch to them immediately? </p><p>I added pictures to make it clearer what I'm talking about. </p><p>Thank you for your time and assistance. </p>",desktop;beta;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1240;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1640254;1640255;,Vilian
