Is it that Firefox needs to now make sure Firefox Servers always recognise <a href=""http://www.change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">www.change.org</a> and so to automatically clear the way for our <a href=""http://www.proton.me"" rel=""nofollow"">www.proton.me</a> email providers to use Firefox Search engine to always reach <a href=""http://change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">change.org</a>, which we prefer to use Firefox as freedom of speech fighters, because of Google is playing secret censorship and ambushing games worldwide, because it Google www carrier monopoly to secretly play with us or is the trouble we have now for Google to ambush us repeatedly so Google can to take us away from using free Firefox to only Google search engines?. </p><p>The problem and proof it is so is that: </p><p>We have 2 petitions on <a href=""http://www.change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">www.change.org</a>.  Then for weeks we, and others we know and met in the streets to sign our petitions, have been having problems to sign and or confirm the petitions have been signed and confirmed back to them and us from our Civil rights Petition agents <a href=""http://Change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Change.org</a>.  As last resort <a href=""http://Change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Change.org</a> lately told to try use to Google Chrome, instead of Firefox that we prefer to use and support, then we may get pass the error message that’s blocking our supporters from our list. We installed Google Chrome and other non Google Search Engines like Duck Duck Go and we still get the same blocks, so we must be losing Signatures and Petition Supporters of our Petitions and time.  We suspect Google is deliberately ambushing us to force us to leave Firefox Search Engine.   Google is the firm that <a href=""http://www.Change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">www.Change.org</a> use to run their Petitions sites. The staff at Change do not know what Google has been secretly doing in ambushing people who do not use or want Google Chrome etc to sign up to our petitions and ambushing our <a href=""http://Proton.me"" rel=""nofollow"">Proton.me</a> private email when we use our <a href=""http://Proton.me"" rel=""nofollow"">Proton.me</a> emails via Firefox. </p><p>The problem we have for weeks now, severely now affecting our 2 Petitions counts is that:  After people sign our petitions on change, <a href=""http://change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">change.org</a> sends automatically an email to the petitions signers for the signer to click a link to prove they really signed up to my petitions on change. When they click and are authenticated <a href=""http://Change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Change.org</a> then send us a confirmation email and their names appear our petition lists, for us to click to thank them and ask them to share our petitions, and sent the singers petition updates via <a href=""http://change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">change.org</a>.   </p><p>Some friends, and people we go to sign our petition, using Firefox search engine, or other different none Google controlled search engines, are constantly having trouble for weeks to access to song up or to get the confirmation email from <a href=""http://change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">change.org</a> to work at all, and some cannot even get the confirming email at all if they are using such as <a href=""http://www.Proton.me"" rel=""nofollow"">www.Proton.me</a> email system no matter how many times they sign up to our petitions or click the said confirming email back to <a href=""http://Change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Change.org</a>.  </p><p>The error that keep coming up says the address at <a href=""http://www.change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">www.change.org</a> is not recognised when they received the email from <a href=""http://chnage.org"" rel=""nofollow"">chnage.org</a> to simply click the link to confirm they signed our petitions, and we even sent the message to <a href=""http://change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">change.org</a> and they keep saying nothing wrong with the link sent us or to our petitions supporters, for some weeks now, until some of our petition supporters have not bothered to continue to try or sign up afresh after we meet them in the streets etc, so they are automatically deleted from our petitions list after 14 days which is not fair to us nor to <a href=""http://change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">change.org</a> staff that take a voluntary fee to run the <a href=""http://change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">change.org</a> petition site so they the staff would not block petitions' supporters, while Google their agent may block supporters if Google do not like our petitions.   </p><p>Some people we know get the link via invitation from us or from <a href=""http://change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">change.org</a> after finding our petitions themselves or via QR Code to sign up, and when they do get <a href=""http://chnage.org"" rel=""nofollow"">chnage.org</a> email to click a link to activate back to <a href=""http://change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">change.org</a> that they did sign our petitions.   But now of late for week clicking the link have repeatedly resulted the same error saying the link from <a href=""http://chanage.org"" rel=""nofollow"">chanage.org</a> is <em>not recognised</em>, repeatedly as if blocked by Firefox from reaching <a href=""http://chnage.org"" rel=""nofollow"">chnage.org</a> servers, and then our private email with <a href=""http://Proton.me"" rel=""nofollow"">Proton.me</a>, and other supporters at same <a href=""http://www.proton.me"" rel=""nofollow"">www.proton.me</a>, got a message back from <a href=""http://Proton.me"" rel=""nofollow"">Proton.me</a> that said it seems that the error is a fault with Firefox search engine we use; while some that clicked from their <a href=""http://Proton.me"" rel=""nofollow"">Proton.me</a> email reply box says they also then used <a href=""http://Goggle.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Goggle.com</a> or Chrome and have the same error message blocking their confirmation email reply back to <a href=""http://change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">change.org</a>, so that now we and they using Firefox and <a href=""http://Proton.me"" rel=""nofollow"">Proton.me</a> cannot get past the said error message to get <a href=""http://change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">change.org</a> to automatically confirm their signed to our Petition as they are not appearing on the list of our Petitions' Support signature list, supposed to be confirmed on change, after they signed up to our <a href=""http://change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">change.org</a> petitions.  </p><p>We have contacted <a href=""http://change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">change.org</a> to see if it’s their sent our to us and signers links and they said no, and said they tested it and said they try Google Chrome and it works, because <a href=""http://Change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Change.org</a> and most of their <a href=""http://Change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Change.org</a> users use Google Chrome, and then we did install and tried Google Chrome and it is still giving us the <a href=""http://change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">change.org</a> page cannot recognised errors, so it cannot be Firefox's fault, and we installed Firefox again and it still did not work, and we installed other no Google Controlled Search engines like DUCK Duck Go and we still get the same error message. </p><p>Please check you Firefox servers to make sure it is not Firefox fault we keep getting the error - <a href=""http://change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">change.org</a> is not recogniezed, so page is blocked from our <a href=""http://proton.me"" rel=""nofollow"">proton.me</a> email box via Firefox we prefer as our default search engine. </p><p>Is it that Firefox needs to now make sure Firefox Servers always recognise <a href=""http://www.change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">www.change.org</a> and so to automatically clear the way for our <a href=""http://www.proton.me"" rel=""nofollow"">www.proton.me</a> email providers to use Firefox Search engine to always reach <a href=""http://change.org"" rel=""nofollow"">change.org</a>, which we prefer to use Firefox as freedom of speech fighters, because of Google is playing censorship games worldwide because it has www carrier monopoly to secretly play with us or is the trouble we have now for Google to ambush us repeatedly so Google can to take us away from using free Firefox to only Google search engines?. </p><p>Yours sincerely </p><p>Lorna Douglas  [email address] And [email address] </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1280;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1664522;1664627;,lornadelmarriagepetition
