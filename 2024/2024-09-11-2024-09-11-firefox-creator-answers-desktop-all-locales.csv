Since September the 5th I have been experiencing a problem with my Gmail in Firefox. I cannot attach files in GMail in Firefox nor can I have my contacts automatically appear when I type one or two letters, like it normally does, or have the autocomplete text in the mail body. This does not happen in Edge or Chrome, it works just fine there. The thing is I use 99% Firefox and would love to keep everything in just one browser as I have done until now for many years. It's easier for my job.  Can any of you suggesr something that may help me? Thanks in advance.  </p><p>PS: I unistalled and reinstalled Firefox, nothing changed.  PS2: I have AVG antivirus, I had a remote session with an agent who confirmed the problem does not come from the antivirus.  PS3: I ran Firefox in troubleshoot mode, nothing changed.  PS4: I really now very little about computers so if there's very technical suggestions, I'll appreciate a step-by-step explanation if and when possible, so not do anything stupid. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",laurapalaciosa
