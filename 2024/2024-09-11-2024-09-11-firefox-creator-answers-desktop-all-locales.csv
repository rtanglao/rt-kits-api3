I cleared a lot of old (large) emails from my email account and freed up a lot of space - but I still can't add attachments. I've checked Firefox and it's up to date - as are my ad blockers. Is there something else I can do like deleting Firefox and then reinstalling it to see if this helps - the problem is definitely when using Firefox (and not Chrome) as my browser. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",brian.mclaughlin

Suppose I'm at my aunt's house and need to use her PC to retrieve just one password from my Firefox account. Is there a way to access that password without importing all of my account data into her browser? </p><p>I’ve tried logging into my account in a private window, but it still imported everything. In the case of Chrome, Google has a Password Manager that lets you access individual passwords without syncing or importing all data to the browser. Does Mozilla have a similar feature? If accessing a single password is possible, why does it seem so difficult? And if it isn't, why is that the case? </p><p>Kind regards, Wiktor </p>",firefox;accounts;,firefox,accounts,en-US,"",grazynapp65+mozilla

When I booted up the computer this morning I tried opening up Firefox, my daily driver, only to find that it won't open. I tried rebooting, I tried uninstalling Firefox and reinstalling, rebooting again, nothing works. I even went so far as to downloading a windows 10 reinstall program that runs of a USB. It's one that preserves your programs, but updates everything possible in windows.

Now, for some reason, all of my bookmarks are being saved to the Bookmarks Toolbar, which I don't want to happen. I've tried setting the default back to the ""Other Bookmarks"", but for some reason, nothing works. I've tried 3 different ways of doing it.
