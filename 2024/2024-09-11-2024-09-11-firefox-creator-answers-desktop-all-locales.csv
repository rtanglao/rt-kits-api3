The old firefox process must be closed to open a new window, REBOOTING does not work!","<p>Hello, I've looked over many threads to try and find a solution to the problem. When I booted up the computer this morning I tried opening up Firefox, my daily driver, only to find that it won't open. I tried rebooting, I tried uninstalling Firefox and reinstalling, rebooting again, nothing works. I even went so far as to downloading a windows 10 reinstall program that runs of a USB. It's one that preserves your programs, but updates everything possible in windows. Now the computer is back up and Firefox comes up with the same error message.  </p><p>What do I have to do to get Firefox working on my computer again???? </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",mail0198

I can't remember if I created it, or it was there. Until this last update (130.0), this folder was my default folder, and all the bookmarks were saved there automatically. Now, for some reason, all of my bookmarks are being saved to the Bookmarks Toolbar, which I don't want to happen. I've tried setting the default back to the ""Other Bookmarks"", but for some reason, nothing works. I've tried 3 different ways of doing it. This only started to happen after FF automatically updated. Any help would be appreciated. </p>",settings;firefox;firefox-1300;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",carlrgoodwin
