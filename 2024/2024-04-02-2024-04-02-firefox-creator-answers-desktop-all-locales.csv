I have a new one and used my account recovery key when i installed Mozilla. However - NONE of my bookmarks or saved passwords have appeared!!! Previously running Windows 10, which is also running on new ssd. I'm not a fan of 11, resigned to install if it means I recover lost data! What did I do wrong? How can I recover them? Many, MANY thanks in advance!!! Hayley </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1240;firefox-12401;,firefox,other,en-US,"",hayley.parks0

Impossible to get locked out anymore which would be important though!,<p>Hi I have been using firefox on linux for a while without updating it. We are artsellers and I used to be able to log in and out of an artplatform without any problems. It's now been a few weeks since logging out is not possible any more on this platform which means  that I am constantly logged in which I really do not want. The menu does not work anymore on this side whereas it works with other browers. I already contacted the platform. They cannot do anything about it themselves and asked me to contact your team. Please help. Thank you  Best regards from Germany C. Marsac </p>,linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-710;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1645302;,asupta

A Firefox Fájl/Fájl megnyitása paranccsal az újonnan indított Firefox simán megnyitja a dokumentumot. Ötletet kérnék, hogy ezt miképp lehetne orvosolni.
