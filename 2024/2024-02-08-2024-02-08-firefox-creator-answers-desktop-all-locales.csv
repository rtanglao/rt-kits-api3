For instance, Apple supports the ""applefeedback://"" URL as a way to launch the macOS Feedback Assistance app. </p><p>If I have a link to this on a web page, or if I put it in a bookmark, Firefox will ask for confirmation and will then launch Feedback Assistant.  This part works great. </p><p>But if I type that URL into the location bar, Firefox always sends it to my configured search engine.  It doesn't recongize it as a valid URL.  And in the popup list of suggestions, there is no option to just go there and not search for it.  See the attached screen shot. </p><p>I don't want to disable location-bar searching altogether, because it is really useful, but I think there should be a way, on a case-by-case basis, to tell Firefox that I really want it to treat the entire text as a URL.  The simplest approach is probably to have an extra row on the popup suggestion list that I can click on to open the text as a URL or produce an error if there is nothing in Firefox or the OS that can resolve it. </p><p>Hopefully this won't be too difficult to support.  I think it would be extremely useful. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Shamino
