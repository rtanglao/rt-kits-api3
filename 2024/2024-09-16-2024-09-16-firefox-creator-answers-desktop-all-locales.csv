Pienso que si se han estado sincronizando, pues he visto algunos sitios en el móvil donde acceso de inmediato (tendrán ya el pass y la dirección). En ese sentido, yo usaba mucho mas Firefox de escritorio. Mi Mac se dañó de forma irrecuperable. Solo tuve tiempo de copiar algunos folders de la Mac y varios programas entre esos, Firefox a un disco externo. </p><p>Ahora, estoy ""reimportando todo"" de a poco en una laptop Pc Windows. Deseo ver como salvar toda la configuración de Firefox de la Mac en esta laptop Pc. Pienso que podría ser de 3 formas? </p><p>1- Instalar Firefox en la laptop Pc e intentar ""enviar"" la sincronización desde mi móvil, para ver qué marcadores y configuración se sincronizó y se salvó? Como se hace eso? Favor explicármelo paso a paso. </p><p>2- Ubicar en cual folder del sistema Mac, Firefox guarda el archivo de la configuración y yo lo importo al folder de Firefox en la laptop Pc? Yo podría revisar si logre copiar (y quizá tenga) ese folder y pueda salvar la mas reciente configuración. Si también se pueda hacer así, favor explicármelo paso a paso. </p><p>3- Alguna otra forma que no he visto?  </p><p>cual de esas formas seria la mejor para intentar recuperar la mas actual configuración? </p><p>Aprecio cualquier ayuda y guía en como hacerlo.

The other day, I was trying to open Firefox like normal and noticed my 100+ tabs were all gone. It was tough since I needed many of those for work and academic purposes, and couldn't seem to recover the window properly without having to manually click through history to get every tab back. I worked on getting these back for about an hour, and couldnt get every tab back in its entirety, unfortunately. I looked through these forums and Reddit for solutions and kept seeing that a fresh reinstall could help, so I did so. I kept getting a message saying that I had an ""old version"", so maybe I accidentally got an old version. I couldn't avoid the error, so I did an uninstall via Window's uninstall panel in settings. When I opened the new install of Firefox back up, all of my bookmarks are completely gone, all 11,000+ of them, in fact. Again, a lot of these are needed for future work purposes, so it's a bit frustrating that its all just kinda...gone. I tried finding backups, but the latest ones are from the reinstall, 9/13/24. I can't find a profile either that has the previous bookmarks, which is worrisome. I tried logging into Firefox on my phone- same deal. However, my history is intact, as well as all of my saved autofill passwords. I can't find old profiles from that old install (that I assume were deleted with that uninstall. Probably should have been more careful before that, since I got the impression sync would work, lol) that aren't before 9/13. I tried syncing in settings, logging in and out of my sync profile that I've had since I first got Firefox on my computer. Is there anything I can do about this? How come the bookmarks are all gone, yet the rest is just fine? </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",muirmagic
