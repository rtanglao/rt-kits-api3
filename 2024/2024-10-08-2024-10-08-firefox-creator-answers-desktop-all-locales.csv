Already, there's an update for it, to version 132.0b4. Each time I open Firefox, there's this popup that tells me that there's an update available and that I need to download it. I'm using Linux Mint 21. I've already visited about:config and changed app.update.silent to true, changed app.update.manual to true, and changed app.update.url.details and app.update.url.manual to fake hyperlinks. Despite doing this and despite restarting, I'm still prompted about the update available every single time I open Firefox. Could someone kindly tell the specific developer who implemented this annoying feature, to please provide an option for Users to not be bothered with such popup notifications? </p><p>ps: Why does this website have a white background and not allow extensions to change it to a dark background? I have Dark Reader extension installed, but it says that it cannot make changes to this website. Even uBlockOrigin is unable to. Please either allow extensions to change the background, or at least change the background color of this website to dark.

Another user figured out how to allow multiple rows of tabs (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVlLVySe5OI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVlLVySe5OI</a>) which worked perfectly until version 131.0-64bit came out. Whatever was changed in it made the hack quit working. I really liked being able to see multiple rows of tabs because I tend to keep a lot open.
