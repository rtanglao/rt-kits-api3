These functions work fine in all other browsers. The menu items are grayed out and just like the macro buttons, they do nothing when clicked. I find many other talking about this with no resolution. I do find it odd there there is nothing listed about this omission in the Firefox help forums. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",kurtedward

There were  no error messages from ComfyUI, it just failed to  load workflow files. </p><p>It turns out that it's because Firefox is installed as a snap package and wherever the snap configuration for Firefox lives thinks it knows better than I do what files and directories on my system I can access in Firefox. </p><p>I also had this problem with trying to open PDFs in my home directory where I kept getting access denied errors. I tried to solve the problems with the snap version and found several proposed solutions by google search which people claimed worked but did not. </p><p>I finally found a web page that described how to uninstall the snap package and install an alternate non-snap version of Firefox, and now everything works like I expect it to. </p><p>How do I make sure this snap version does not ever come back? </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",drwootton
