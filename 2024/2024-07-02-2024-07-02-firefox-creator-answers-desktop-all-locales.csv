It's the best LG Gram laptop they had with Windows 11, and it's 1-yr old. Much on it was corrupted and I'm having to reload many items, one being my Firefox. It wouldn't open up. I did the right-click on my mouse and hit the OPEN selection. Firefox still wouldn't open up. I reloaded Firefox hoping that it would correct whatever may be wrong. No, it still won't open up. I'm reaching you now via TOR. My TOR was also reinstalled, but it is able to open up. Can you think of what I may have done wrong? [I'm unable to check the option-email me when someone answers my thread {this email must be a thread}, but this will be fine.] Please note that I am so NOT tech-savvy, I don't even have any smart/mobile/cell phone. Just a plain old phone. (I should add I'm in my 70's, ill, and in a Nursing Home.) I looked through your troubleshooting sugggestions, but they are too fancy for me to understand. I'm not sure how this works, but I sure do hope you can offer some suggestions as to what I can try. Thanks so very much for your time and consideration of this matter. It's very much appreciated. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1150;,firefox,other,en-US,"",justsleeping33
