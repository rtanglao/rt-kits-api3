Het probleem doet zich voor bij zowel Firefox in Windows 10 als Firefox in Linux Mint 21.3. Onder Windows 10 krijg ik helemaal geen geluid van de cursus en onder Linux Mint is het geluid zwaar verminkt en niet bruikbaar. Onder zowel Windows 10 als Linux Mint is het geluid van een YouTube filmpje normaal. Ik heb zowel met luidsprekers getest en met een bluetooth hoofdtelefoon. Beide met hetzelfde resultaat. Ik begrijp niet waarom het niet wil werken. Is er een instelling die ik over het hoofd zie. Of moet er nog een file geïnstalleerd worden.

This is inconvenient because you need to manually load each tab to visually see which one is which, so that the icon is loaded. When I close and open the browser, the icons that are present do not disappear, it seems to happen after a while, as if some kind of cache is deleted in the browser.

The 2nd screenshot shows a list of all my extensions. I use Simple Tab Groups to hide tabs, so I have a lot of them and some kind of memory offloading is necessary, but the lack of icons prevents me from using the sessions I created earlier. And Simple Tab Groups most likely does not affect the absence of icons, because when I unload tabs from memory through this extension, the icons remain. </p><p>I would be grateful for advice on how to fix the situation. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-11;firefox-1290;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",bormaxv
