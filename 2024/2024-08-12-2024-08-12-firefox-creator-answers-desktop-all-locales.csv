This is inconvenient because you need to manually load each tab to visually see which one is which, so that the icon is loaded. When I close and open the browser, the icons that are present do not disappear, it seems to happen after a while, as if some kind of cache is deleted in the browser. In such suspended tabs, there is also no place for the icon physically, and when I open the tab, the name physically shifts to the right and the icon appears.  </p><p>Suspended tabs without icons on screenshot 1 are highlighted in red. The 2nd screenshot shows a list of all my extensions. I use Simple Tab Groups to hide tabs, so I have a lot of them and some kind of memory offloading is necessary, but the lack of icons prevents me from using the sessions I created earlier. And Simple Tab Groups most likely does not affect the absence of icons, because when I unload tabs from memory through this extension, the icons remain. </p><p>I would be grateful for advice on how to fix the situation. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-11;firefox-1290;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",bormaxv
