I know that they say even Mozilla doesn't have access to your data - even when at rest - but I also noticed that they don't seem to utilize the term ""zero-knowledge encryption.""  In other words, does mozilla have the technical capacity to decrypt data synced via mozilla sync? </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",scartheslayer

A legfrissebb 64 bites Firefox verziót használom, és nem tudok videót feltölteni a YouTube csatornámra. A feltöltés 0%-on áll, akár órákon keresztül is. Ugyanezen a gépen Chrome böngészővel működik a feltöltés. Találkozott már valaki ezzel a problémával? </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,hu,"",vszanto

However lately: Firefox has been randomly shutting down. Usually while I'm typing a comment or a reply to some comment. </p><p>Just tonight, I tried to buy a box of Bibles from the Gideons International, and when I clicked the Place Order button, nothing happened. I started the crappy Chrome browser, went to the Gideon website and created an order. When I clicked Place Order, it 'thought' for a few seconds and then said ""Order Complete"". </p><p>Quite often, when I click on a link, I receive a message telling me Firefox cannot connect to that site. Again, if I use Chrome, or even Brave, the link goes right through. </p><p>Months ago, I never had these problems. Are you people in the business of screwing up the best browser ever invented? Put Firefox back like it was when it worked. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",OlWill

The old icon for this button was a chevron with approximately the same functionality. I was able to remove the old icon, but I'm unable to find a way to remove this one. Here is what I've tried so far: </p> <ul><li> Like the old one, the Customize Toolbar feature is unable to remove it since it is grayed out. </li><li> For a while, I was able to remove the old icon by going to <strong>about:config</strong> and setting <strong>browser.tabs.tabmanager.enabled</strong> to <strong>false</strong>. This solution does not work for the current and some recent versions of the button. </li><li> I attempted to create a userChrome.css file (following all the steps according to <a href=""https://www.userchrome.org/how-create-userchrome-css.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> this website) and added the following string: <strong>#alltabs-button { display: none&nbsp;!important; }</strong> </li></ul> <p>None of these attempted fixes have removed the button following a browser restart. Is there a way to remove it? I have no need of a button that shows me what tabs I have open when I can simply look at my toolbar. </p>",beta;firefox;windows-10;installation-and-updates;firefox-1310;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,1674655;1674658;,shabcarb

Every so often Firefox will randomly revert back to using Quad9 instead of NextDNS without any intervention from me and I then have to go back in and set up NextDNS again which is quite frustrating, does anyone know why this might be happening? </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",hurdvialjmprivate
