It is most noticeable on Reddit, but other video sites that are not Youtube (for some reason Youtube videos, even when embedded in Reddit) have the same issue. </p><p>What happens is: a video shows the first frame. I press play and it plays at an extremely low rate 1 frame every few seconds, I can't really tell whether it goes from frame 1 to 2, but it definitely does not go from 1 to 1+(time past * frame rate). Another symptom that seems to be reddit embedded video specific is that after some time it says ""video not available."" </p><p>Videos do play for a very short while after rebooting, and clearing cookies also seems to help, however after some time even clearing cookies has the video stopping again. </p><p>I ran the profiler for media on a completely fresh profile with no addins. I found a video, started the profiler and pressed play. I let it run for 2 frame changes and after that I stopped the profiler. I'm not able to really interpret what is going on, but I hope that someone can. </p><p>https://share.firefox.dev/4eKL4PT </p><p>I've shared device/troubleshooting info. </p><p>Windows and Firefox are installed on a 1TB Samsung Evo 970, which I think may be the only relevant bit of info that's not in there. </p><p>If there is any other info that I can provide I am happy to do so. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;firefox-1320;firefox-13202;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",alex379

The error message is ""Cannot load XPCOM."" I've had to uninstall Firefox and download it again both times to make Firefox work until the next time you send an update, then I have to go through this procedure all over again. What is going wrong? Any help would be greatly appreciated. If this cannot be fixed I will need to find another browser (although it won't be as good as Firefox has been over the years. </p><p>David Roth [edited email from public] </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,1687737;,aslsarge
