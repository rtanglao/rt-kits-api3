I also use F5 to refresh a webpage.  </p><p>Firefox uses many, many other key combinations and hotkeys, and a great number of them have caused the instant erasure of all the hours of work I had done on a webpage: The browser jumps to another tab, or it goes fullscreen (one of the Function keys does this), or it opens a new window, or it opens a History window, or it does any number of things which I neither want nor need. </p><p>I require only to use the key combinations and hotkeys to perform the functions that I have listed, above. But if I must sacrifice them in an overall disable, then I will do so. </p><p>Please tell me how to disable the key combination commands and hotkeys in Firefox. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",jcb3cmmrce

This happens sometimes, I'm often not sure why, but this time the previous session didn't automatically repopulate when I restarted. I navigated to the history options with the idea of retoring the previous session - either using that functionality or individually opening previous windows - but history was blank and the previous windows option was greyed out. Following suggestions online I've looked for .bak or .json or similar files to use as restore points but there's nothing since much earlier in the year up to 8th November, which are pretty much empty, and the 9th.  </p><p>I'd be very grateful for any suggestions! </p>",firefox;windows-10;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",robin_russel

That behavior is suspicious, so I used ctrl-alt-delete to close it - but no user input was allowed because the Task Manager was behind the modal full-screen popup. I manually shutdown (uncontrolled crash) rather than click on it. I suspect this popup is normal behavior, though I've never seen or heard of it before. Not all software plays fair after all. Nothing to report from perfmon.msc &gt; reliability report. But we live in a software minefield, and I can't find record of anyone stepping on this mine before. If anyone has seen or heard of similar please make a comment.  Thank you guys! </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",kevinseslar

How do I make it persist?,"<p>Hi, </p><p>Just hoping someone can help me figure out what else to try. I've only been using firefox a month or two recently, I'd been on Chrome for a while and now I'm a refugee. Anyway. Trying to figure out how to make my theme persist between sessions. </p><p>Each time I reload it's back to default. I'm able to disable and re-enable it in settings, and it applies just fine, but then is lost every time a new session starts. Not sure why this isn't toggling a flag to hold persistently.

It is most noticeable on Reddit, but other video sites that are not Youtube (for some reason Youtube videos, even when embedded in Reddit) have the same issue. </p><p>What happens is: a video shows the first frame. I press play and it plays at an extremely low rate 1 frame every few seconds, I can't really tell whether it goes from frame 1 to 2, but it definitely does not go from 1 to 1+(time past * frame rate). Another symptom that seems to be reddit embedded video specific is that after some time it says ""video not available."" </p><p>Videos do play for a very short while after rebooting, and clearing cookies also seems to help, however after some time even clearing cookies has the video stopping again. </p><p>I ran the profiler for media on a completely fresh profile with no addins. I found a video, started the profiler and pressed play. I let it run for 2 frame changes and after that I stopped the profiler. I'm not able to really interpret what is going on, but I hope that someone can. </p><p>https://share.firefox.dev/4eKL4PT </p><p>I've shared device/troubleshooting info. </p><p>Windows and Firefox are installed on a 1TB Samsung Evo 970, which I think may be the only relevant bit of info that's not in there. </p><p>If there is any other info that I can provide I am happy to do so. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;firefox-1320;firefox-13202;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",alex379
