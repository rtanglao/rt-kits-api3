Remarkably, not only the window style changes with respect to the default, but also the mouse changes to a massive version of Adwaita. </p><p>In the image attached you can compare both chromium, which doesn't have this issue: notice the window decoration (sadly the cursor can't be included as a part of the screenshot, but it's definitely not KDE Breeze dark's). </p><p>What causes this behavior? Is it internal to Firefox, or is it rather a user option that I did not correctly set? </p><p>Thank you in advance. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1220;,firefox,customize,es,"",Icemole

When I open ""manage bookmarks"" (Library), why does it always open at ""other bookmarks""? This is at the very bottom of the alphabetical list (and empty) so I always have to scroll back up to the top. I've got a lot of bookmarks, so this is extremely irritating. How do I change this? I've searched for an answer. The only likely solutions suggest removing the ""other bookmarks"" folder, but the description of how to do that doesn't work. Nowhere can I find a ""remove other bookmarks"" option. And the delete option is greyed out. </p><p>I don't necessarily need to hide or remove it, as long as I can get the bookmarks manager/Library to open at the top, ie. ""Bookmarks Menu"". </p><p>Cheers, Ian </p>",desktop;bookmarks;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",IanStar

When I pressed tabulator, it inserted an actual tabulator instead of interacting with the website/text box (either by leaving the text box and going to the next field in the website, or by nesting any un/ordered list, whenever the functionality is given by the website). </p><p>I have confirmed that this behavior was introduced in snap Firefox 122.0-2.1, since I tried reverting to Firefox 122.0-2, which was in the snap cache, and I was unable to reproduce the issue, neither in safe nor in normal mode. In Firefox 122.0-2.1 I can reproduce this in both modes. I'm running Ubuntu 23.10. </p><p>As	a	form	of	proof,	please	see	this	text,	which	is	created	by	substituting	space	strokes	by	tab	strokes	in	Firefox	122.0-2.1	(safe	mode). </p><p>If I can provide any more feedback, please let me know. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,es,"",Icemole

Home, with my personal email and work, with my work email. My work computer crashed a few months ago, and out IT department was able to recover all my bookmarks, but it wasn't easy, so I was told. I decided to do what I do at home and that was to create an account for work, which I did. I now have an account for home with it's own bookmarks, and email, and a work account with it's own bookmarks and totally different email.  I recently got a work phone. In the process of setting it up I synced it up with my work account. when I came home tonight I got online and all my work bookmarks were on my home computer. How did this happen? Now I don't have my home bookmarks. I tried signing out and signing back in with my home account, but no luck. This is very frustrating especially since they are two totally different accounts. SO, how do I get my home bookmarks back on my home computer? Thanks </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1220;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1633965;,ghaskin
