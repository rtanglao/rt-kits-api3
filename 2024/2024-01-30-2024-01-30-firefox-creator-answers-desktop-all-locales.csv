The arrow pointer does not move but the magnifier keeps going up and down 110%- 145%- 38% all over the place. only hitting escape several times and then touching the magnifier resets it back to 100% {normal} is there a way of eliminating this feature alltogether? Any help would be appreciated. </p>,desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1220;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",cqng54a

It should appear when I mouse to the bottom of the screen. I see other complaints about this opened and closed for up to 6 years. No actual answers, just workarounds. Hitting F11 twice solves it temporarily, but it comes back. No, it's not Windows. No other software on my laptop does this. Yes, I keep Firefox updated. </p><p>Any progress?

Now translation is gone. How can I keep the option to quickly translate a page in the address bar without having the popup jump in my face each time I open a new tab, forcing me to click it to make it go away? This would be a nice option but an extremely distracting presentation. thanks. </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",nopinkdragons
