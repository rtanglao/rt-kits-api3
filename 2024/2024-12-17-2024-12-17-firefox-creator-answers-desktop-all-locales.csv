I used to able to right click on a photo or graphic and Firefox would tell me what it was, its filename, and even it's size.. But no more.. </p><pre>  This was a really handy feature that kept me a Firefox user ever since I discovered Firefox..  </pre> <p>Now, instead of right clicking on it (so I can find it easily on my PC using a great little program called ""Everything"" (see <a href=""https://www.voidtools.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.voidtools.com/</a> which is amazing in its own right..), I'm stuck viewing the Page Source, finding the file in all the jumble of code, etc. etc. etc... (Yeah, I can right click on the image and open it in a new tab, but it tells me nothing about its SIZE either.. Dang! </p><pre>   So am I the only guy that's ever complained about this? (I recently downloaded Google Chrome which appears to be a less-than-perfect knockoff of Firefox and also lacks this ""feature"".. But my bank likes it whereas they would no longer allow me to do online banking with Firefox.. A pesky but unrelated issue here, I know..)
