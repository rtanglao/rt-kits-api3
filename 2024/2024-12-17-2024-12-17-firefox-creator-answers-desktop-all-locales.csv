(I typically do this so I can use the Omnisphere synth to play along to for practicing my keyboard skills.  YouTube will play just fine, but when I open Omnisphere, then try to play the YouTube video simultaneously, YouTube will just hang and won't play. I close Omnisphere and YouTube will play fine again. I know you'll think this is an issue with my virutal synth Omnisphere, but the strange thing is, that that same company makes another virtual synth called Keyscape, and when I try playing Keyscape and YouTube together, it works just fine.  To me, this seems to be some kind of sharing issue, and likely a sharing setting of some kind. The audio settings in both Omnisphere and Keyscape are identical, so why would one work, but not the other?.  I couldn't find any kind of virtual device sharing settings in Firefox or YouTube.    The company that makes these virtual instruments has told me that it works fine with Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, that's why I'm leaning towards the browser being the issue.

I used to able to right click on a photo or graphic and Firefox would tell me what it was, its filename, and even it's size.. But no more.. </p><pre>  This was a really handy feature that kept me a Firefox user ever since I discovered Firefox..  </pre> <p>Now, instead of right clicking on it (so I can find it easily on my PC using a great little program called ""Everything"" (see <a href=""https://www.voidtools.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.voidtools.com/</a> which is amazing in its own right..), I'm stuck viewing the Page Source, finding the file in all the jumble of code, etc. etc. etc... (Yeah, I can right click on the image and open it in a new tab, but it tells me nothing about its SIZE either.. Dang! </p><pre>   So am I the only guy that's ever complained about this? (I recently downloaded Google Chrome which appears to be a less-than-perfect knockoff of Firefox and also lacks this ""feature"".. But my bank likes it whereas they would no longer allow me to do online banking with Firefox.. A pesky but unrelated issue here, I know..)   Anyhow, if there's a quick fix for my problem, I sure would appreciate a how-to implement it!   </pre> <p>Thanks for ""listening""! </p><pre>  Ol' Bill in California - cumbrespass@gmail.com </pre>",firefox-13303;firefox-1330;firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1695151;1695174;,cumbrespass

Why would Firefox do that and inconvenience its customers?  It needs to be restored immediately and nowhere to find help on this matter.  Avast is aware of the problem and so is Firefox but we, the customers, have no solution that is available.  This encourages us to use Chrome instead.  Is there a solution?  Please advise. </p>",firefox-13303;firefox-1330;firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1695163;1695176;1695178;1695182;,janet4901
