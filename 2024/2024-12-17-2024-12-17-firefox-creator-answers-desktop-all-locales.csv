My desktop browser will not load any pages... except Youtube. Youtube loads just fine, I can open a video or browse channels or community pages normally. I have fully reset my browser, reinstalled it, and disabled extensions. Other browsers on my PC will work normally. I have very few extensions: Sponsorblock for Youtube, uBlock Origin, and Facebook Container, that's it. I am not using a proxy or VPN. Troubleshoot mode did not fix the issue. I'm not the most tech savvy, so I apologize if I missed anything here.  </p><p>Any insight is appreciated.

I previously contacted MB support about such warnings and they told me to uninstall two extensions--Video Download Helper and AddtoAny. I've used both for a long time, but uninstalling them did fix that particular problem wherein the browser kept trying to connect to <a href=""http://techalert.com"" rel=""nofollow"">techalert.com</a>, a site that is (through research) apparently for shareware? I don't recall ever being on it. But that's stopped. </p><p>But there was another. See jpg attachment. This is pretty much every day that I'm being told FF is trying to connect to something that is offering up a Trojan--apparently through Instagram??? That also makes little sense. </p><p>Most recently, I have two MORE such attempts to connect in the background, this time with full IP addresses. Both of those seem to be compromised sites in Pakistan according to a little research I did. (I have no dealings with Pakistan.) Why these two latest have full IP addresses and the others (see image) only deal with an Instagram URL, have no idea. </p><p>So, I contacted MB support again. They said it was not a false positive and they couldn't be sure what was doing this, but ""something on firefox is reaching out to the IP address."" At first they suggested returning FF to a default state. I'm reluctant to do that considering how much time spent  getting it where I want it.  So, now, they suggest turning off extensions one-by-one. That's a better idea, but certainly labor intensive and something that may take awhile.  </p><p>So before I undertake this potentially time consuming task, does anyone here have some idea of what's happening?  </p><p>P.s. scans came up clean of my system, no trojans, malware detected. </p><p>Win11, latest updates, FF 133.03 64 bit </p>",firefox-13303;firefox-1330;firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1695356;,monsieurms

I want to test if this handler works as I expect and therefore I have configured a webpage such that is will report CSP violations (I see them in the web developer console) and I want to have them sent to my application's CSP-violation handler. </p><p>In my test environment, the application is running on localhost. I have run my web application both on HTTP and HTTPS (with a self-signed certificate), but in neither case Firefox is sending any reports to my application. </p><p>My CSP headers look as follows: Content-Security-Policy: report-uri http://localhost:5281/csp-violation;base-uri 'none';default-src 'self';form-action 'none';frame-ancestors 'none';report-to csp-viol;script-src 'unsafe-eval' 'nonce-9FuQ3NuVoW66DT1ZU4w9EPSymnHE1/hg';style-src 'unsafe-eval' 'nonce-9FuQ3NuVoW66DT1ZU4w9EPSymnHE1/hg' Reporting-Endpoints: csp-viol=http://localhost:5281/csp-violation Report-To: {""group"":""csp-viol"",""max_age"":10886400,""endpoints"":[{""url"":""http://localhost:5281/csp-violation""}]} </p><p>When I run my application using HTTPS, all HTTP in the endpoints will also be HTTPS. </p><p>I have verified that when I post something by hand to http://localhost:5281/csp-violation, my handler is executed, so that is not the issue. I believe that Firefox is just not sending the reports. Is there a way to configure Firefox such that it will send the CSP violation reports to my application when run on HTTP(S) on localhost? </p><p>Sincerely, Marcel </p>",windows-10;firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1695403;,MarcelV

(I typically do this so I can use the Omnisphere synth to play along to for practicing my keyboard skills.  YouTube will play just fine, but when I open Omnisphere, then try to play the YouTube video simultaneously, YouTube will just hang and won't play. I close Omnisphere and YouTube will play fine again. I know you'll think this is an issue with my virutal synth Omnisphere, but the strange thing is, that that same company makes another virtual synth called Keyscape, and when I try playing Keyscape and YouTube together, it works just fine.  To me, this seems to be some kind of sharing issue, and likely a sharing setting of some kind. The audio settings in both Omnisphere and Keyscape are identical, so why would one work, but not the other?.  I couldn't find any kind of virtual device sharing settings in Firefox or YouTube.    The company that makes these virtual instruments has told me that it works fine with Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, that's why I'm leaning towards the browser being the issue.  Any idea what could be causing this? Thanks very much, I appreciate it. </p><p>Paul </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1695198;1695206;,musikman
