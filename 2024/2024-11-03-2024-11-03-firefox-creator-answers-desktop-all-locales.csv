Your tab has crashed"" before it closes. There is no crash log, and when you open it up again it asks if I want to restore tabs and if you say yes, they all come back just as they were.  </p><p>There is no particular website it crashes on, nor a particular time. Sometimes it's when I'm surfing, sometimes when it's just sitting there open. Sometimes it crashes after a minute, sometimes it crashes after 2 hours.  </p><p>Yes, it does it in safe mode. Yes, I've rebooted, and reinstalled, and tried old versions. Yes, I've even reinstalled windows. Yes, I've updated all drivers and so on. I've also increased the memory allotment, and several other suggestions I found on google. </p><p>So, odd things that might help you diagnose it: when it comes back on, the volume of an in-tab player is usually, if not always, muted (not the computer, just the firefox media player - netflix, youtube, etc).  </p><p>Also, I've owned this computer for 4 years and it's been a problem from the beginning; BUT I found a way to fix it. I just... can't remember what it was. Then about 6 months ago I had to send it in for repair and they wiped windows and I lost everything, since then it's crashing again.  </p><p>I remember that my fix involved some fix or hack that made a *Second* set of min/max/close buttons in the top-right corner. So the normal sized ones, then a half-sized set above them. Does anyone know what I might have done to have that? Because as long as it was that way, it never crashed. </p><p>Failing that, is there a way to force firefox to create a log? Because it's not technically crashing, from it's perspective; a ""tab"" crashes (all tabs, actually) and then the program closes by default. But firefox itself seems to think it's not crashing so it makes no log.  </p><p>I'm desperate: going to ask at a forum is worse than going to the second page of google.

I entered the info and then was asked if I wanted to import bookmarks, etc. from Chrome (I rarely use Chrome) so I clicked to import. My big beef with this is all of my saved url's in One Tab are missing.  I use One Tab all of the time so I lost a lot of information. </p><p>1) Can someone tell me what causes FF to do this because I had the latest version open? </p><p>2) Can someone tell me how to get my One Tab information back? </p><p>Thank you in advance for help, Becky </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,1685616;,becky.pottsbaker
