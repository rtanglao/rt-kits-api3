Is there an order in which multiple extensions are executed? Will they play nicely together or create conflicts among themselves? Are there recommended troubleshooting processes in case they don't?.   I imagine that there must be some overlap of functionality somewhere in here, so any experience or advice is appreciated.  I found no info when searching for the order of execution. </p><p>Extension purposes. UBlockOrigin and Privacy Badger used to block tracking, seem to block different trackers and usually do well together.  CanvasBlocker is to try and limit browser fingerprinting, was running with the above two extensions until I had an issue connection to a website, don't remember which one, disabling CB fixed it and I haven't tried to figure out why yet. ClearURL's because almost all search engines are going to attach tracking to url's. </p><p>Thank you in advance for any help.
