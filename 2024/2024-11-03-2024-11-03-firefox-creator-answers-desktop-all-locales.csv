I believe there was an update several weeks ago. Today I had been working in Photoshop, exited it, clicked on the Firefox tab I had open and clicked for a new tab. A window opened asking me for a new profile for Firefox. It said I needed this because there is a newer version of FF.  It was weird. I entered the info and then was asked if I wanted to import bookmarks, etc. from Chrome (I rarely use Chrome) so I clicked to import. My big beef with this is all of my saved url's in One Tab are missing.  I use One Tab all of the time so I lost a lot of information. </p><p>1) Can someone tell me what causes FF to do this because I had the latest version open? </p><p>2) Can someone tell me how to get my One Tab information back? </p><p>Thank you in advance for help, Becky </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,1685616;,becky.pottsbaker
