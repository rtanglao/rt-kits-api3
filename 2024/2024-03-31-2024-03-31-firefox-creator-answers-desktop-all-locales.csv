For some time now I’ve been trying to make use of the option to set homepage as a shortcut folder as described: Settings/Home/Homepage and new windows  where one of the options is: ‘Choose a Bookmark to be your Home Page. If you choose a folder, the Bookmarks in that folder will be opened in Tabs.’ You then need to delete the existing homepage and select the desired shortcut folder. This works but after it appears to be a static rather than dynamic selection as regardless of any changes made to the indicated folder, the homepage does not change.  Am I doing something wrong or expecting too much. Thanks  John </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1240;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",john266
