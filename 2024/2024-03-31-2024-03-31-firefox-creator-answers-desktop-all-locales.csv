If either Chrome or Brave is set as the default browser, they will correctly open the link.  Obviously, the problem is with Firefox, not with Thunderbird. I raised this issue several years ago and have never received a response.  I have drastically reduced my use of Firefox accordingly.

I love this old version, and I don't want to update it to the new version. But the update reminder pops up many times everyday. it's so annoying. I used ""about config"" to turn it off (see photo 2); it works a bit, but the popup still there once daily after the configuration. I want to turn it off permanently. Is there any way to do it?
