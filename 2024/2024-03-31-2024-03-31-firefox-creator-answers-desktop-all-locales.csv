I love this old version, and I don't want to update it to the new version. But the update reminder pops up many times everyday. it's so annoying. I used ""about config"" to turn it off (see photo 2); it works a bit, but the popup still there once daily after the configuration. I want to turn it off permanently. Is there any way to do it?  Thank you very much!! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",wongbouwing
