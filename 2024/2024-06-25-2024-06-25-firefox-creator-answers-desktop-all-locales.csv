But still i was using chrome as default and daily browser. I wanted to explore firefox, its great actually, except 2 things which might need me to switch back to chrome or brave. </p><p>1. it don't have fu**king Profile switch, I mean i use 11 Profiles On Chrome, most people still use 2-4 profiles, how can we move to a browser that dont support profiles. I know we can add profiles by ""about:Profiles"" I tried it.  It worked but guess what? To switch profile i have to manually go to that page to launch it. So much time consuming and frustrating. Why not simply add a btn on profile pic like chrome to switch profiles? </p><p>2. Add-ons is good thing, but there should be a way to install things from chrome web store, i not found any. </p><p>If firefox can fix these two things firefox can simply grow back to 30+ % market share, but if not people will just test l;like me and go. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Amanullahmalik44552

How can I resolve this issue? </p><p>If you're unable to see your saved passwords in Firefox for your websites, here are a few steps you can try to resolve the issue: </p><p>Check Firefox Settings: </p><p>Open Firefox and click on the menu button (three horizontal lines) in the top-right corner. Select ""Preferences"" (on macOS) or ""Options"" (on Windows/Linux). Go to the ""Privacy &amp; Security"" panel. Scroll down to the ""Logins and Passwords"" section. Ensure that the ""Remember logins and passwords for websites"" option is checked. View Saved Passwords: </p><p>In the same ""Logins and Passwords"" section, click on ""Saved Logins..."". This will open a new window/tab with a list of all saved usernames and passwords. Clear Private Data: </p><p>Sometimes clearing your browsing history and cookies can resolve issues with saved passwords not appearing correctly. Go back to the Firefox menu, choose ""Preferences"" or ""Options"", then select ""Privacy &amp; Security"". Scroll down to the ""Cookies and Site Data"" section and click on ""Clear Data..."". Make sure ""Cookies and Site Data"" and ""Cached Web Content"" are selected, then click ""Clear"". Update Firefox: </p><p>Ensure you are using the latest version of Firefox. Updates often include bug fixes and improvements that can resolve such issues. Check Password Manager Settings: </p><p>If you use a third-party password manager or Firefox's built-in password manager, make sure it's enabled and functioning correctly. Extensions/Add-ons: </p><p>Disable any extensions or add-ons that might interfere with password saving or autofill features. Reset Firefox Settings: </p><p>As a last resort, you can reset Firefox to its default settings. This will disable extensions and reset other settings. Go to the Firefox menu, choose ""Help"", and then ""Troubleshooting Information"". Click on ""Refresh Firefox"" to reset. If these steps don't resolve the issue, there may be a more specific problem with your Firefox profile or installation that could require more advanced troubleshooting. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",bestpathinc

More often than not doing this multiple times per singular video. Often times it won't even load anymore at all and I am forced to refresh the page and toggle the stable volume once again. </p><p>I've tried disabling every single extension I have, including ad blockers, restarting the entire browser, and using a different account, and it still happens no matter what. However it is not an issue that occurs on chrome or edge, so I'm at a complete loss of what is causing this.

Por favor, algo toqué en Firefox en Ajustes, porque ya no me salen los iconos de programas recientes en el escritorio del navegador al hacer ctrl+t, que antes salían los íconos más usados, como por ejemplo gmail, facebook, whatsapp, yotutube... ahora solamente hay un fondo negro y arriba las barras acostumbradas de marcadores, etc, pero tengo que desplazarme marcador uno por uno para buscar lo que voy a usar o digitar arriba para que me aparezca, el escritorio está vacío y negro... </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1270;firefox-12701;,firefox,customize,es,1659028;1659091;,JoseGabriel
