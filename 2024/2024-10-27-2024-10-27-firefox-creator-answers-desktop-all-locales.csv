The same problem happened to my Macbook as well, but a workaround is available. While with Windows 11, I can't find the solution anywhere on the web.  Whenever I type on the browser, if I write a non-character notation right behind the word (like ""this,""), the word would usually auto delete itself or sometimes, the word clone itself out (e.g, wordword, thisthi, etc.) or it deletes a small section of words right behind that non-char.  I don't have insert turning on. I am quite uncertain whether you can reproduce this error on your laptop (for me, I have been through 2 windows 11 laptop and this error still persist). This error seems to only occurs for Vietnamese (Telex and VNI) default keyboard from Microsoft, Russian and English work fine. I suspect that it is caused by Microsoft Vietnamese, but I have unchecked all kind of spelling checking on settings. So should I use a third-party Vietnamese language typing for this situation or does it caused by something else? </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;firefox-1310;firefox-13103;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",dinhthanhha2005
