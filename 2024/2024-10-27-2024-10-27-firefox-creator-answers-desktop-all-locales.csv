The same voice typing works perfectly fine in Google Chrome web browser. If there is any solution then let me know. Not interested to use Google Chrome as it is consuming insane amount of my old PC RAM. It would be great if I could get help from Firefox. Because, Firefox is the only browser which is working smooth in my PC. I am using latest version of Firefox and I do not have any extension installed. In the incognito mode also facing same issue. Using Windows 10 and desktop version of Firefox. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",harsh.choksi1
