I reallllly don't want to be the person asking the same question that happens every day...but I've tried to do a bit of searching. I could've done a lot more. I had a surprise windows reformat event this morning. Everything is shiny and unmodded. I have <em>never</em> had it open new indow tabs and new windows simultaneously. If I close the window on the toolbar and it closes the tab. I'd blame myself...but the only thing I did was change the font size because I'm nearly blind. Is this a new thing!? I hate it&nbsp;! I don't want NEW windows, I use firefox for tabs.  </p><p>this is happening in safe firefox and unsafe firefox. it must be something in the settings but i don't know!! (i've had the worst day at work and having to reformat was unexpected and incredibly frustrating...i just want my computer the way i like it) </p>",firefox;windows-10;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1673166;,sara.hollander

When I tried again yesterday, all my attempts to upload videos would result in the Upload dialog sticking at 0%, no matter how long I waited.  I tried again today and a separate error in which I clicked an option to Delete a 0% uploaded video resulted in approximately 50 of my last youtube uploads being deleted (that's *on* youtube).  I tried today with Safari and I had no trouble uploading a video to youtube. Therefore I'm now thinking that there was a recent update to Firefox that is causing this problem. </p><p>I'm running Mac OS 10.14.6 and Firefox 115.15.0esr. Before you tell me I should upgrade everything — I'm old — on a fixed income and running older hardware... upgrading is not really an option. Seeing how Firefox was working just a couple of weeks ago for what I needed, is there a way back to a former version? </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",sightcreations
