As I'm currently in another country I also couldn't just log in on any of my other devices to recover the password, so I decided to reset it via the E-Mail... well aparantly changing your password deletes the sync data?? I'm guessing there is no way to recover the data? So I got a relative of mine to start my backup notebook which has not been synched for a few months but some data should've still been there, at least I had thought so... password database there was empty... and instead of synching the firefox landing page from my notebook where all my pinned pages were, it copied the page from the new device and wiped that as well...
