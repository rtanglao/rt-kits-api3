When I tried again yesterday, all my attempts to upload videos would result in the Upload dialog sticking at 0%, no matter how long I waited.  I tried again today and a separate error in which I clicked an option to Delete a 0% uploaded video resulted in approximately 50 of my last youtube uploads being deleted (that's *on* youtube).  I tried today with Safari and I had no trouble uploading a video to youtube. Therefore I'm now thinking that there was a recent update to Firefox that is causing this problem. </p><p>I'm running Mac OS 10.14.6 and Firefox 115.15.0esr. Before you tell me I should upgrade everything — I'm old — on a fixed income and running older hardware... upgrading is not really an option. Seeing how Firefox was working just a couple of weeks ago for what I needed, is there a way back to a former version? </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",sightcreations
