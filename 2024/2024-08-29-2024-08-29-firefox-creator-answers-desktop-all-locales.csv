So, I have already done the following, </p> <ul><li> Previously I thought it to be snap issue, so I changed to deb but that also didn't changed much. </li><li> Then I thought it to be some other issue and tried to fix few log issues of ubuntu which I think were unrelated to the problem. </li><li> The system is running so hot that one can't put his hand on it for long. </li><li> Ultimately I switched to fedora, and everything came to normal. The firefox then was of version 123 or 125(or 126, but it was 2-3 versions back, you may find it with what version fedora ships with but I remember it to be significantly lesser than 129). </li><li> I use 3-4 windows at a time with 6-10 tabs open(but mostly pdfs).  The firefox was working all fine with no temperature and resource issues, then I remembered to do update, and soon as firefox is upgraded to 129. It has started to cause the same issue, it is damaging the hardware, the hissing sound and temperature increase have come back. </li></ul> <p>The outcome is that I have came to know that there is some problem in either the upgrade process or the new version. THIS IS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING. Please provided instructions on how to fix it, or should I open a issue in bugzilla, I can not understand what is the problem? please ask for an other information if required. </p>",linux;desktop;install-and-update;firefox-1290;firefox-12902;,firefox,install-and-update,en-US,"",bhaumik2386
