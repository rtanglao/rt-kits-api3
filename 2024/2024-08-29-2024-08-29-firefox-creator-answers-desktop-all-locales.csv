The option to pin the toolbar where the user wants it to appear seems to have vanished.  Am I correct? </p><p>The only options I can find in Firefox now are Show Toolbar and it will only appear across the top of the screen (unless I Ctrl+B); Show in new tab or Hide. </p><p>Ctrl+B will bring up the tool bar, say to the left, but when Firefox is closed and re-opened there is the need to Ctrl+B again to redisplay the toolbar.  My experience of Windows 10 was that everytime I opened Firefox my side bar for Bookmarks automatically appeared because I had always been able to pin it there. </p><p>Please help to restore the function, if it hasn't been removed through updates. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;windows-11;customize-settings-and-preferences;firefox-1290;firefox-12902;,firefox,customize-settings-and-preferences,en-US,"",peternewlands06

The firefox then was of version 123 or 125(or 126, but it was 2-3 versions back, you may find it with what version fedora ships with but I remember it to be significantly lesser than 129). </li><li> I use 3-4 windows at a time with 6-10 tabs open(but mostly pdfs).  The firefox was working all fine with no temperature and resource issues, then I remembered to do update, and soon as firefox is upgraded to 129. It has started to cause the same issue, it is damaging the hardware, the hissing sound and temperature increase have come back. </li></ul> <p>The outcome is that I have came to know that there is some problem in either the upgrade process or the new version. THIS IS HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING. Please provided instructions on how to fix it, or should I open a issue in bugzilla, I can not understand what is the problem? please ask for an other information if required. </p>",linux;desktop;install-and-update;firefox-1290;firefox-12902;,firefox,install-and-update,en-US,"",bhaumik2386
