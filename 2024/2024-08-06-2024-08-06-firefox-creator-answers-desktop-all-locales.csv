Didn't remember the password anymore so I reset it. After that the account got disconnected from Sync and asked me to sign in again (as expected). So I did and got redirected to the settings page on Mozilla account no problem, device supposedly connected. </p><p>However, the Sync notification in the app menu immediately changed to <em>Account disconnected</em> again and no matter how many times I click to sign in again it stays that way. Not to mention that each time I do click to sign in, the Mozilla account page wants me to jump through all the hoops again (password, email code, 2FA) instead of remembering the previous session (refreshing the page with F5 or Ctrl+Shift+R doesn't log me out nor indicate that the session had expired). </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1280;firefox-12803;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",formis.sagittarius

When I clicked to confirm the purchase my screen was unresponsive. I tried to send an email to you guys and clicking on the send button, same again - nothing happened.
