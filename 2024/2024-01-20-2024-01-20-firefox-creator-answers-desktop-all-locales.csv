Now it automatically saves the bookmark in the ""Other Bookmarks"" folder instead of allowing me to save it in my desired folder? I then have to find the saved bookmark and manually move it to the desired folder. Is there a fix for this or is this a permanent feature change?

Today, I didn't find the answer to my issue in the historic base of questions/answers...Maybe, I also missed the answer... anyway... </p><p>My problem is the following: I have habits to use the unicode shortcut every day (exemple&nbsp;: Ã¤ &lt;--&gt; alt+132) but this is not possible if the ""Bookmark Toolbar Shortcuts"" add-ons of firefox is active because I suppose there inteference with bookmarks shorcut that I also use a lot. So, I have to disable every time the add-ons, which is a boring operation... I tried to modify the shorcut of the ""bookmark toolbar shorcut"" add-ons but, Firefox send me ""you can't override firefox shorcut"".... </p><p>Does someone find a solution to this problem&nbsp;?  </p><p>I found this link which talk about of the subject but without a real answer&nbsp;: <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/1322464/how-to-prevent-firefox-keyboard-shortcuts-from-interfering-with-unicode-input"" rel=""nofollow"">https://superuser.com/questions/1322464/how-to-prevent-firefox-keyboard-shortcuts-from-interfering-with-unicode-input</a> </p><p>I thank you in advance for you help! </p><p>kind regards, </p><p>Simon </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",Simon463.

I am only using the touch pad and the touch screen. When I release the finger the time it takes for the scroll speed to come to a halt is way longer than on Chromium browsers and uncomfortable. I want to configure this to decelerate faster or to remove the smoothing completely. </p><p>I have tried playing around with scroll configurations and I found that setting <strong>apz.gtk.kinetic_scroll.enabled</strong> =false disables smoothing correctly, but only works for touch pad, not for touch screen. </p><p>- Is there some config I am missing to disable this kinetic scroll using touch screen? - Is there a preference where I can halve the time it takes to decelerate, rather than disable it completely? </p><p>I am running Ubuntu 22.04 on Wayland if that makes a difference. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",sirdorius
