Currently using Linux Mint Cinnamon </p><p>The browser won't connect to any websites or even try to load them, anytime I search for something it immediately goes to the error page. I've been struggling with internet on my PC for months and all was fixed when I hooked up ethernet, except for Firefox. </p><p>I've gone into about:config countless times. I've restarted it twice, I've tried installing the flatpak version and it's exactly the same result. I've deleted it and reinstalled, nothing. I've unchecked everything I've changed in about:config, once again nothing. </p><p>I can't update it as for some reason it says it's disabled by system administrator, which I don't remember enabling. I checked the firewall and it's perfectly fine. No infections were found when I scanned as well. </p><p>It's starting to become frustrating and I can't even do anything on my PC because it's acting up. Any and all help is more than appreciated and welcome. Thank you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",floofiebloonket

When I drag a file from Windows Explorer over to the Google Chrome browser, the side bookmarks window in Firefox goes haywire. Close and reopening the bookmarks menu brings it back, but the issue remains. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;needsinfo;windows-10;firefox-1210;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1631652;1631675;,iamwileecoyote

I am genuinely considering using Edge over Firefox due to them having better tab groups which I never though I would say. Please implement a simple tab folder, literally just what current Edge has. It is a very useful basic feature and I would really love to have it included in my favorite browser I have been using for over a decade.
