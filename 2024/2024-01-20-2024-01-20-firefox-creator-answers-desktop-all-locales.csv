I'm a Leo and like long walks on the beach. </p><p>For months, I've experienced the Bookmarks menu collapsing (Bookmarks Toolbar, Bookmarks Menu, and Other Bookmarks headings appear but all bookmarks are just gone) and locking up (those headings cannot be opened and closed). </p><p>I have finally noticed that this happens when I am using Windows File Explorer to drag and drop files into my Google Drive opened with an entirely separate Google Chrome browser running concurrently with Firefox. </p><p>To be clear, I have Google Chrome and Explorer at the top of my desktop, with Firefox running behind them. When I drag a file from Windows Explorer over to the Google Chrome browser, the side bookmarks window in Firefox goes haywire. Close and reopening the bookmarks menu brings it back, but the issue remains. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1210;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",iamwileecoyote

I am genuinely considering using Edge over Firefox due to them having better tab groups which I never though I would say. Please implement a simple tab folder, literally just what current Edge has. It is a very useful basic feature and I would really love to have it included in my favorite browser I have been using for over a decade. Thank you. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1210;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ftwelve
