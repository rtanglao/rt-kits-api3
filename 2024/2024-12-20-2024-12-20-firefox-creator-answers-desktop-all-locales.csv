I got the 113 from google store, and I am still getting messages that my laptop is out of date and I need to update it.

When using the native translation tool in Firefox, I have noticed that, on most websites I browse, the translation options appear reversed. For example, if I am on a page in English, the tool offers to translate ""from Spanish to English"" when it should be ""from English to Spanish."" </p><p>I have downloaded all the necessary language packs and configured both the automatic translation languages and the display language preferences. However, the issue persists. </p><p>I would like to believe this is a configuration error on my part, but after reviewing it several times and waiting for updates, the problem continues to occur. </p><p>Additionally, I would like to propose a few suggestions to improve the user experience: </p><pre>   Would it be possible to implement a keyboard shortcut to activate the translation option without needing to use the mouse?    In the language selection area, could a button be added to quickly toggle the order of the languages with a single click? </pre> <p>I appreciate in advance any guidance on where to send this suggestion or how to resolve the issue described. </p><p>Best regards, </p><p>Estimados, ¿Podrían indicarme cuál es el canal más adecuado para enviar esta sugerencia o reportar el problema que estoy experimentando? </p><p>No estoy seguro si se trata de un error en la herramienta de traducción o de un mal uso de mi parte, por lo que expongo lo siguiente: </p><p>Soy un usuario latinoamericano y mi idioma nativo es el español. Al utilizar la herramienta de traducción nativa de Firefox, he notado que en la mayoría de los sitios que navego las opciones de traducción aparecen invertidas. Por ejemplo, si estoy en una página en inglés, la herramienta me ofrece traducir ""del español al inglés"", cuando debería ser ""del inglés al español"". </p><p>He descargado todos los paquetes de idioma necesarios y he configurado tanto los idiomas de traducción automática como los de preferencia de visualización. A pesar de esto, el problema persiste. </p><p>Me gustaría pensar que es un error de configuración de mi parte, pero después de revisarlo varias veces y de haber esperado actualizaciones, el problema continúa ocurriendo. </p><p>Además, quisiera hacer algunas sugerencias para mejorar la experiencia de usuario: </p><pre>   ¿Sería posible implementar un atajo de teclado para activar la opción de traducción sin necesidad de usar el mouse?    En el área de selección de idiomas, ¿se podría agregar un botón que permita alternar rápidamente el orden de los idiomas con un clic? </pre> <p>Agradezco de antemano cualquier orientación sobre dónde enviar esta sugerencia o cómo resolver el problema descrito. </p><p>Saludos cordiales, </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,es,"",Jorguito
