I'm not a technical person who can interpret these incidents, but when these incidents happen, out of the void, I've just tried to uninstall and then reinstall Firefox. I've somehow (seemingly) been able to ultimately reinstall Firefox after these incidents, but I'm wanting to know WHY these incidents are happening? Firefox doesn't give me any help here with this question, as far as I can see, so I'm wondering why these paralytic Error messages are happening, and what I'm supposed to do to keep Firefox functioning correctly, preventing this interference with the browser's functioning? Can anyone PLEASE HELP ME with this issue here, or even point me in the right direction? Thank you very much for any explanatory help you can provide. Merry Christmas (I hope!). </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",stevemarvin7

I do a lot of research and I work this way in order to go back to a particular subject and continue where I left off.  Right now I have 20 windows open with any where from 5 to 12 tabs in some of these windows.  When using my pointer I see only the tab that was opened in a particular window when I closed FF.  I tried holding the pointer and dragging the open windows in the task bar...but no luck.   </p><p>I guess I'm asking if there's anyway I could get a quick view of what every tab in every window open actually is, or perhaps use search words to find what I'm looking for? </p><p>Thank you any response ~~Bonnie </p>",firefox-13303;firefox-1330;firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",sharp63
