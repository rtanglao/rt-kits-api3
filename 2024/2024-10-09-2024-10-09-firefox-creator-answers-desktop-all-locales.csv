I’m curious to know from the community's experience: </p><p>Which browser do you find faster overall, Firefox or Chrome? Are there specific scenarios where one outperforms the other (e.g., handling multiple tabs, streaming, running web apps, etc.)? Have any recent updates or features in either browser significantly improved their speed? Looking forward to your insights and experiences! </p><p>Thank you!
