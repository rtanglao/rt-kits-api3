It is no longer connected to the WiFi.  But the WiFi is up and running fine.  The only thing that brings it back is to close down the browser, and restart it.  Then it comes up connected.  Or I can switch to Edge and  that works fine.  It is not my computer or connection, it is the Firefox browser doing this. </p><p>Second problem.  More and more of the sites I visit, like Hulu, my doctors, and many others will not work on Firefox.  Isn't there something you can do about this.  It requires  me to use the address I am on and paste it into Edge.  Then it works fine.   If this continues to grow, I will have to make my default browser Edge.  Please see what you can do.
