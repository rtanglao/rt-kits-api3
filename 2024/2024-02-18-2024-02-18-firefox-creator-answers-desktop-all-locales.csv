I've NEVER had issues with it but for some reason on my computer that has Windows 11 it's been crashing quite a bit.  </p><p>To clarify, I'll be surfing like always but when I have maybe a third tab (usually youtube) up, then everything just STOPS. This happens at least ONCE a day or sometimes twice. Then, I have to quit firefox forcefully (which windows does say it'll get the crash report). Yet, I never get a crash report from firefox or any such message despite that I do have it checked in my settings.  </p><p>No other browser I have on this computer has ANY issue (chrome nor edge--both work fine. It's just firefox). </p><p>The thing is, I've been all over the internet about this. I've scanned my computer with both windows defender and malwarebytes--found nothing no matter how deeply I scanned. Re-installed firefox several times. Refreshed it as well. Uninstalled/re-installed my extensions. Unchecked 'use hardware acceleration when available.' I updated my drivers, etc. etc. </p><p>The only thing that 'seemed' to work was creating a new profile here on firefox. After doing that, I could surf for a whole DAY or two without a crash. But then suddenly today it crashed like <em>normal</em> (again when I was on youtube). I haven't tried using firefox in safemode to see if it crashes because the crashes are random and could happen at any time in the day. Just seems like a lot of time in safemode when I need to be working.  </p><p>Please advise! All of my other computers (either on windows 10 or on mac/android) have ZERO issues. Once more, this computer handles chrome/microsoft edge just fine but for some reason my windows 11 computer is having trouble with firefox (and firefox ONLY) no matter what I do. I hope you can help and also help me understand why firefox doesn't seem to have any crash reports for me when it HAS crashed several times. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",hahoffmanart

A veces me gusta dejar algún video de asmr de fondo en bucle, a modo picture in picture.
