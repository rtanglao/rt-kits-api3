Consequently, I am always mindful of my data usage when using my laptop. Despite primarily browsing static pages, email, and other low-data activities, I often find my data usage higher than anticipated. The main culprit comes to mind  to be videos embedded in news articles. Sometimes, with multiple tabs open, I switch to an inactive tab only to find a video playing. Although I've configured my Firefox preferences not to autoplay videos, it seems that YouTube videos still override these settings. </p><p>So, my question is, when a tab is inactive, does Firefox stop all data transfer for that tab in the background? And if not, what are the solutions to stop any background data other than continually closing all tabs? </p><p><br> Also, any suggestions on this topic are appreciated, especially from and to users who also live in remote areas without fiber, DSL, etc. </p>",desktop;tabs;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",mozilla69

I've NEVER had issues with it but for some reason on my computer that has Windows 11 it's been crashing quite a bit.  </p><p>To clarify, I'll be surfing like always but when I have maybe a third tab (usually youtube) up, then everything just STOPS. This happens at least ONCE a day or sometimes twice. Then, I have to quit firefox forcefully (which windows does say it'll get the crash report). Yet, I never get a crash report from firefox or any such message despite that I do have it checked in my settings.  </p><p>No other browser I have on this computer has ANY issue (chrome nor edge--both work fine. It's just firefox). </p><p>The thing is, I've been all over the internet about this. I've scanned my computer with both windows defender and malwarebytes--found nothing no matter how deeply I scanned. Re-installed firefox several times. Refreshed it as well. Uninstalled/re-installed my extensions. Unchecked 'use hardware acceleration when available.' I updated my drivers, etc. etc. </p><p>The only thing that 'seemed' to work was creating a new profile here on firefox. After doing that, I could surf for a whole DAY or two without a crash. But then suddenly today it crashed like <em>normal</em> (again when I was on youtube). I haven't tried using firefox in safemode to see if it crashes because the crashes are random and could happen at any time in the day. Just seems like a lot of time in safemode when I need to be working.  </p><p>Please advise! All of my other computers (either on windows 10 or on mac/android) have ZERO issues. Once more, this computer handles chrome/microsoft edge just fine but for some reason my windows 11 computer is having trouble with firefox (and firefox ONLY) no matter what I do. I hope you can help and also help me understand why firefox doesn't seem to have any crash reports for me when it HAS crashed several times. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1637257;,hahoffmanart
