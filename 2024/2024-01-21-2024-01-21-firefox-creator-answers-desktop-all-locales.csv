While there, I used my mac laptop (with Firefox as my primary browser) on a mix of both wifi-without-VPN and hotel wifi with a VPN back to my home network activated. </p><p>I have been back home for more than a week. Other browsers on the same laptop as well as other devices (like my phone) that I took with me on the trip correctly reflect my location (east coast, USA). However, Firefox stubbornly insists that I am still in Australia. The net effect of this has been to break my access to YouTubeTV, which is not available in Australia. </p><p>I have tried: - Logging fully out of my google account on firefox and logging back in (at which point the 2FA prompt on my phone says I'm trying to log back in from Australia) - Deleting all cookies, cache and website data - Fully uninstalling Firefox, including deleting the Firefox folder in ApplicationSupport </p><p>None of these have had any effect. </p><p>Within YouTubeTV, I can force an update to my location, which will temporarily reflect correctly that I am in the US. But it still won't let me play anything if I'm using Firefox, and within Firefox, will soon revert to location unknown.
