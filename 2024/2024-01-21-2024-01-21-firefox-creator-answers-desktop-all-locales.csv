Whenever I type something into the address bar, all results appear under a small Firefox Suggest header, even though Firefox Suggest is not available to me in the United Kingdom. I believe it is possible to remove this header through about:config, and I did so on my old PC shortly after FIrefox Suggest was released in 2021, although I have long forgotten how to do this for obvious reasons. Could somebody please explain how this header can once again be removed, or is it a permanent feature? Thank you in advance. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,customize,en-US,1632011;,nixiemz
