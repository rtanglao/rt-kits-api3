What if you want to specify preferences in a file, just like with user.js, but you don't want them to be made permanent? In other words, so that when the file is deleted, the prefs will be forgotten.

How can I force  Firefox  to automatically put each newly created bookmark in the correct alphabetic position in the left panel Bookmarks panel?  I DO NOT want to alphabetize the entire panel, I just want each newly created bookmark to go where is alphabetically belongs.
