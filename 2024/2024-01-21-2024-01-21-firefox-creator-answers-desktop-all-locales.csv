I can give many examples of odd behaviors but to keep this short, have pasted 2 screenshots of the same section of the homepage (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.imdb.com</a>) to demonstrate the difference. Something is preventing the proper loading of all the elements. </p><p>Another odd thing is that i'm unable to click on elements that have properly loaded and are visible. Lastly, i'm unable to play videos!! </p><p>None of the above are reproducable when in private browsing mode. I have disabled all my extension in the hopes that one of them could be the culprit to no avail! </p><p>Any thoughts on how to approach this issue? </p>",linux;desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1631932;1631957;,ggelhsva
