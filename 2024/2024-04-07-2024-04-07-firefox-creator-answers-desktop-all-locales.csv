I have maybe 30 folders, but I can only see the first/top 12 or so, starting with Inbox, etc. I can scroll down my emails. I have asked Microsoft Support 3 times, so I have deleted addons, cleared cache, tried Private Window, but still no joy.  The folders are all visible on my cell phone (Android), but I really want full use of Hotmail again on my laptop. It has been a problem for a few months. I cannot update my OSX, so cannot install/use another browser, and probably not update Firefox either from 78.15.Oesr. Thanks in advance. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-109;firefox-7815;firefox-78150;,firefox,other,en-US,"",sumnerpaul
