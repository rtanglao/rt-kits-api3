However, when I close Firefox despite the fact that the website is on the exception list, cookies are deleted and I have to keep re-entering the one time password. I did turn of the checkbox for deleting cookies when Firefox is closed and now I am no longer asked to enter the OTP after Firefox is closed. </p><p>I assume this is a bug. Does anyone else experience similar issues? Is anything I can do about it and be able to use the exception list as intended? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-11580;firefox-1158;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Zsuzsu

If they are gone I have other machines which do have bookmarks.  I think there is a way to copy the bookmarks from one system to another.
