Well, actually, it does change, but only for a small fraction of a second before returning to the normal pointer. This makes elements on web pages that have hover events almost impossible to use (such as drop-downs like the ""Get Help"" one at the top of <a href=""http://support.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">support.mozilla.org</a>) unless I left-click and hold while hovering over the element. This, of course, requires me to click on the element, which might have other consequences.  </p><p>Hovering works fine with other browsers.  This is on an M2 Mac. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1240;firefox-12402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",thereallyrealdd

I have maybe 30 folders, but I can only see the first/top 12 or so, starting with Inbox, etc. I can scroll down my emails. I have asked Microsoft Support 3 times, so I have deleted addons, cleared cache, tried Private Window, but still no joy.  The folders are all visible on my cell phone (Android), but I really want full use of Hotmail again on my laptop. It has been a problem for a few months. I cannot update my OSX, so cannot install/use another browser, and probably not update Firefox either from 78.15.Oesr. Thanks in advance. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-109;firefox-7815;firefox-78150;,firefox,other,en-US,1646088;,sumnerpaul
