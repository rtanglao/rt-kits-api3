Using the migration assistant, Firefox seemed to transfer to the new computer with no problem, except that it did not work. Neither does, apparently a new installation directly on the Mac Mini. Any suggestions? I do prefer to remain with the new operating system if possible </p><p>Thanks, </p><p><br> Wes Sokolosky </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",wessokolosky

I have gone into settings-&gt;general-&gt;applications and configured selected ""Use system default application"" for PDF files. If I click on a pdf file it downloads to my Downloads folder, which is the usual and preferred behaviour. If I click the downloaded files icon on firefox's toolbar, I see the file I downloaded, all good. If I open the folder with all downloaded files, and click on the file, it opens in the OS's default viewer, all good. On the other hand, if I click on the downloaded files icon on firefox's toolbar and simply select the downloaded file from the displayed list, it opens on a firefox browser tab. This is driving me bananas. How do I configure firefox to launch the default system application instead? </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1157;firefox-11570;,firefox,customize,en-US,1635953;,zapstrap
