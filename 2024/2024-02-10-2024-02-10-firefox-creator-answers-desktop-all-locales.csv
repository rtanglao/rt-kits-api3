When Windows 11 was initially released, certain substantial feature of the Windows taskbar known from before was missing. I'm talking about 'Combine taskbar buttons and hide labels' and the option to set it to 'Never' (users tend to set it this way to always see the program icon along with it's label, not just the icon). At this moment, the feature has been available in widely released build of Windows 11 for months (Microsoft returned it after rewriting the taskbar code and after many complains), but it is not working correctly in conjunction with Firefox. When I close all windows and tabs of Firefox and restart the browser, only its icon is visible on the taskbar, not the label. Only when I open one more Firefox window, it starts to work as it should. Is it a known issue? Can we expect a fix to be made soon? Thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1635991;,andrewz1986
