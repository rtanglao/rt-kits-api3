I opened the website a few days ago with no problem and have been using the site for years. (I checked to see if the site is down but it's not.) I googled how to unblock websites in Firefox and nothing I've tried works. I disabled Trackers for the website and I cleared my Cookies.  I added the Firefox uBlock extension a few weeks ago to stop constant website popups (after I tried resetting Firefox) and I turned uBlock off for this certain website but I still can't access the website. I also installed Mozilla VPN last week. I'm using Firefox 122.0.1.  What could be the problem? </p>,desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",grov10

I have gone into settings-&gt;general-&gt;applications and configured selected ""Use system default application"" for PDF files. If I click on a pdf file it downloads to my Downloads folder, which is the usual and preferred behaviour. If I click the downloaded files icon on firefox's toolbar, I see the file I downloaded, all good. If I open the folder with all downloaded files, and click on the file, it opens in the OS's default viewer, all good. On the other hand, if I click on the downloaded files icon on firefox's toolbar and simply select the downloaded file from the displayed list, it opens on a firefox browser tab. This is driving me bananas. How do I configure firefox to launch the default system application instead? </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1157;firefox-11570;,firefox,customize,en-US,1635953;,zapstrap
