My problem is with one particular website, <a href=""https://www.yucatan.com.mx/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.yucatan.com.mx/</a> , and it didn't used to happen. When I open the site or pages in it, trying to scroll down just results in continuous, rapid flickering and no scrolling.  I have to pull the scroll bar down just enough to get the page started, and then the mouse scroll wheel works.  After looking at other people's similar issues, I have tried disabling smooth scrolling and the pop-up blocker. When I open the same site with a different browser and try to scroll down, I do see about two frames of flicker, but it's almost unnoticeable, and scrolling works OK.  I restarted Firefox in troubleshooting mode and was able to get it to behave like that other browser at this site -- just a momentary flicker and no interference with scrolling.  OK... where does that leave me?  I can't use troubleshooting mode all the time.  And it's just this one website that presents the problematic behavior. Thanks for your thoughts, -Rick </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1636058;,rickexner2

For years, Firefox has been my primary &amp; exclusive browser.  But, in the last 6 months or so, Firefox is CONSTANTLY &amp; CONSISTENTLY freezing on me.  Here is the guaranteed &amp; predictable pattern:  Everything is working well for an hour or so and then suddenly, for no rhyme or reason, the program freezes.  I close the program (because it's not responding, so says the error message) and I immediately reopen Firefox and things are fine for another hour or two...and then it happens again &amp; again &amp; again &amp; again! </p><p>It just happened again while I was in the middle of an important work project &amp; I AM SICK OF IT.  I loved Firefox so much, I have spent hours &amp; hours, over many weeks and months, reading about the problem and trying ALL the recommended fixes--to no avail.  NOTHING has worked.  Don't ask if I tried this or that because the answer is yes, I tried it.  And it is happening to me on multiple computers.  (I use two computers simultaneously, a brand new Windows 11 and an older Windows 10 computer.)  It's getting to the point that I am starting to use Chrome more and more because I can use Chrome (or any other browser such as Edge or Maxthon) without problem or incident.  But old habits are hard to break and I keep returning to Firefox (being the fool I am) &amp; because I have Firefox tweaked to my specifications especially with passwords, etc.  I have very reluctantly and unhappily removed many add-ons thinking one of them might be the problem.  But, as I said, nothing has worked.  And yes, I have uninstalled and reinstalled the program, turned off hardware acceleration, did your registry tweaks, bla, bla, bla.   </p><p>I am writing mainly to vent.  Because I have tried ALL THE FIXES without success, I have no confidence that you can solve what appears to be a common problem.  But, of course, if you think you can help me, give it a whirl.  Otherwise, I need to dump Firefox for good.   Thank you letting me share. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1636025;,BeatlesJunky

When Windows 11 was initially released, certain substantial feature of the Windows taskbar known from before was missing. I'm talking about 'Combine taskbar buttons and hide labels' and the option to set it to 'Never' (users tend to set it this way to always see the program icon along with it's label, not just the icon). At this moment, the feature has been available in widely released build of Windows 11 for months (Microsoft returned it after rewriting the taskbar code and after many complains), but it is not working correctly in conjunction with Firefox. When I close all windows and tabs of Firefox and restart the browser, only its icon is visible on the taskbar, not the label. Only when I open one more Firefox window, it starts to work as it should. Is it a known issue? Can we expect a fix to be made soon? Thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1635991;,andrewz1986
