In order to make the Amazon menus legible I had go to color setting on Firefox and change them to always use the system settings. This eliminated the shadowing, but the text remains blue, even though I changed everything to black. Changing themes to dark or installing new themes changes Firefox but makes no difference to any site like Amazon. </p><p>I did try running the browser in safe mode and it changed the menu text color back to black, but returning to normal mode produces the same errors.
