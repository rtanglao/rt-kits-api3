Whenever I switch from one session to another (ctrl+alt+Fx), it usually takes a few minutes for Firefox to get responsive again. Sometimes it never does (typically on Mondays, after working in my ""personal"" session all week end, and switching back to my ""work"" session). Other applications (xterm, qpdfviewer, etc...) don't seem to be affected at all. Is there something I can do to fix that&nbsp;? </p><p>Thanks, </p><pre> -Olivier. </pre>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-11580;firefox-1158;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",firefox2757

I have FF docked on my taskbar (Win 7 sp1) when I click it some times it opens all my tabs (I have it set to do that) but more frequently it doesn't and just opens one tab. Usually I catch it and in history select the tab showing many other tabs and I get it all back, but this doesn't always work like today, no option to do that because there's nothing there.  When is it likely to be fixed, I've been complaining about this for months. I've even suggested FF collects a stack of last sessions (say 20) each time a session is closed and have a fixed entry for that in the menu, but nothing seems to change. I'm heartily sick of it, it's such a basic requirement of any browser and yet with FF it's just a pain in the neck. </p>",windows-7;desktop;tabs;firefox-1159;firefox-11591;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1644535;,Vicr
