I just want the stuff that the user in the above link listed. </p><p>Coincidentally, I had this exact problem a short while before, and I think it may have had to do with an update, because I remember Firefox updating at least twice fairly recently and it is in this time I've noticed this issue.

I'm having an issue when a youtube channel im following sets a live. When I get the card on the desktop for the 30 min timer, I'll click it.. sometimes it will open in a new tab (usually the card just disappears), that's another problem.. Anyway.. If I switch to the new tab at the time the live should have started, it shows the counter reset to 30 minutes.. if I F5 the page it will load the live.. Is there a way to auto start the live when the counter hits zero? </p><p>Hope that wasn't as clear as mud... </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1240;firefox-12401;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1644552;,rocatah
