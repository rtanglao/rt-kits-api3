Toggling it does nothing in itself in between restarting my machine. I am certain it's not a jump menu thing because this isn't about shortcuts (and besides the point, enabling the jump shortcuts from my OS side of things does not display it either way). I just want the stuff that the user in the above link listed. </p><p>Coincidentally, I had this exact problem a short while before, and I think it may have had to do with an update, because I remember Firefox updating at least twice fairly recently and it is in this time I've noticed this issue. The first time around it resolved itself, but this time it has not and I do not know the cause. </p><p>Unpinning/pinning the icon on the task bar does not resolve this either. It seems none of the conventional solutions in the past work, so unless I am missing something, something broke. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1240;firefox-12401;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Amuko

I'm having an issue when a youtube channel im following sets a live. When I get the card on the desktop for the 30 min timer, I'll click it.. sometimes it will open in a new tab (usually the card just disappears), that's another problem.. Anyway.. If I switch to the new tab at the time the live should have started, it shows the counter reset to 30 minutes.. if I F5 the page it will load the live.. Is there a way to auto start the live when the counter hits zero? </p><p>Hope that wasn't as clear as mud... </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1240;firefox-12401;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",rocatah
