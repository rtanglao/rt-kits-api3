A tablet is an option but it's physically inaccessible.  All I did was click update and restart. Nothing unusual about that. My phone can't access Google accounts either. I'm not the most tech savvy and so I have no clues how to remedy this situation. </p>,desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1240;firefox-12401;,firefox,other,en-US,1644536;,i8ntw8n

I have FF docked on my taskbar (Win 7 sp1) when I click it some times it opens all my tabs (I have it set to do that) but more frequently it doesn't and just opens one tab. Usually I catch it and in history select the tab showing many other tabs and I get it all back, but this doesn't always work like today, no option to do that because there's nothing there.  When is it likely to be fixed, I've been complaining about this for months. I've even suggested FF collects a stack of last sessions (say 20) each time a session is closed and have a fixed entry for that in the menu, but nothing seems to change. I'm heartily sick of it, it's such a basic requirement of any browser and yet with FF it's just a pain in the neck. </p>",windows-7;desktop;tabs;firefox-1159;firefox-11591;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1644535;,Vicr

Toggling it does nothing in itself in between restarting my machine. I am certain it's not a jump menu thing because this isn't about shortcuts (and besides the point, enabling the jump shortcuts from my OS side of things does not display it either way). I just want the stuff that the user in the above link listed. </p><p>Coincidentally, I had this exact problem a short while before, and I think it may have had to do with an update, because I remember Firefox updating at least twice fairly recently and it is in this time I've noticed this issue. The first time around it resolved itself, but this time it has not and I do not know the cause. </p><p>Unpinning/pinning the icon on the task bar does not resolve this either. It seems none of the conventional solutions in the past work, so unless I am missing something, something broke. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1240;firefox-12401;,firefox,other,en-US,1644526;1644533;,Amuko

I'm having an issue when a youtube channel im following sets a live. When I get the card on the desktop for the 30 min timer, I'll click it.. sometimes it will open in a new tab (usually the card just disappears), that's another problem.. Anyway.. If I switch to the new tab at the time the live should have started, it shows the counter reset to 30 minutes.. if I F5 the page it will load the live.. Is there a way to auto start the live when the counter hits zero? </p><p>Hope that wasn't as clear as mud... </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1240;firefox-12401;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",rocatah
