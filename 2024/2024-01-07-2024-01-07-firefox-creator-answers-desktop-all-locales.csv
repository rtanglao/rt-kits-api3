The thing I miss about Chrome is the fully rounded shapes that use ""border-radius: 2em;"". I noticed that I can't change the border radius of search bars and tabs to make them fully rounded. </p><p>I have tried: @media (border-radius: 8px) { 	border-radius: 2em&nbsp;!important; } </p><p>I have also tried 30 different codes but none edited the homepage, I have even looked through the activity-stream.css to copy the code and change just that tiny bit for my liking but nothing. My question is, is there any other way to achieve fully rounded corners on all things? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1210;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",4ndreibel

I've tried every fix I can find in the support docs, including deleting my account, stopping sync on all devices and fully deleting the app on 2 Windows PCs, a Mac, two iPads and an iPhone. I've tried creating a new account, then reinstalling a clean backed up copy that I'd fixed all the screwed up bookmarks, then reinstalled and reysnced all devices and FF sync is still an utter mess.  </p><p>It keeps messing up the order of my folders and bookmarks, as well as randomly duplicating the bookmarks all over hell and creation in my bookmarks segmentation.  </p><p>This is the first time I've had a problem with Sync, but I'm getting sick of it, because I cannot rely on it to work and because I'm too reliant on my bookmarks for many things, I'm about to dump using Firefox entirely, which is saying something because I despise other browsers. </p><p>I'd appreciate help. </p><p>Chris Pierdominici </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1210;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",nhmtnbkr1
