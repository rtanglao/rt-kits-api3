On my pc, lately, when I move an email from my Thunderbird Inbox to a folder, the message does 'go' from my Inbox, but it does not re-appear in the folder. In fact, the message seems to disappear!  However, the message tally count for that folder indicates that the message should be there, but it isn't visible.  It's obviously been happening for a while but I don't know when it will have started. In the attached image, the folder 'Chatham, Cape Cod' shows that it should have 10 messages in it, but you'll see that the folder is empty, no messages are showing. In fact, all of the 3 folders 1) Boston, 2) Chatham, Cape Cod, and 3) Virgin Atlantic show that they have messages in them, but on opening each folder, each of those folders is empty. I should add that, on my phone or ipad, when I view my folders, all of the messages are visible. It is just on my PC that the messages are not visible. I've uninstalled Thunderbird and reinstalled it, but that didn't help. And I don't know what else to do! I'd be so grateful for help as I'm not techy and, as I work mainly from my PC, it's proving to be difficult not having all of my messages visible in their folders on my PC. Fingers x'd someone has a solution! Many thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1628856;1628858;,melanielockhart

It's like Google falls asleep and then, when it wakes up, all is fine, until it nods off again. I have followed advice provided, cleared cache, cleared cookies, removed plugins and extensions, reinitiated and reinstalled. Running in safe mode seems to help, as in pages seem to load faster, but sadly does not eliminate the problems. Other browsers on this machine are not affected.
