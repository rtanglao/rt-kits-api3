Yet when I look at the Process Manager I consistently find third-parties (defined by me as NOT my OS, my browser, or any website I have visited during this session).   As I write this I have just killed the following 4 processes, which I think Firefox should have caught.  And in a few minutes when my active window is another application or when I take some browser tab to full-screen mode, these processes I thought I killed will reactivate.   The current sample: </p><p><a href=""http://kampyle.com"" rel=""nofollow"">kampyle.com</a> <a href=""http://setpay.com"" rel=""nofollow"">setpay.com</a> <a href=""http://signifyd.com"" rel=""nofollow"">signifyd.com</a> <a href=""http://trustarc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">trustarc.com</a> </p><p>You may identify these as innocuous, but they are the very definition of third-party sites.  Anything that calls itself TRUST is the first thing I'm going to question.  Its exhausting having to police this constantly.  What good is ETP if I have to supplement with my own time and energy, diverting me from my primary tasks?  </p><p>Steps taken:  Before submitting this I took a moment to check all the sites I have open or have had open on this device in this browser session.  Clicking on the shield near the web address field, I have confirmed EPT is ON for each of them and I can see that many trackers, etc., are apparently being blocked.  I also re-checked the related Firefox settings to ensure it remains as I selected. </p><p>Info:  I work in remote locations, and carry my own hotspot with me.  Its a cellular hotspot and I can have many devices as well as many tasks on any single device sharing the bandwidth.  I started looking into this because these extra processes interfere with my use of my own devices and the bandwidth that I need and PAY FOR. </p><p>Thank you for your help. -LLD </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1130;firefox-11302;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",LLD
