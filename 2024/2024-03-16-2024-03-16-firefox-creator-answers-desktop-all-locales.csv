The plugin states that it only works when launching Firefox with ""-start-debugger-server"" argument. This launches Firefox with an interface warning, recoloring search bar bright striped-red with a warning ""Browser is under remote control (reason: devtools)"". </p><p>I would very much like to remove this warning, since I'd like to work in this mode all the time anyways.
