I believe in prior versions of Firefox there was a checkbox to delete that provision.  I'm using Firefox 123.0 64-bit with Windows 10 and have been through the setting and more tools areas but found no way to remove that function.  I did try the about:config suggestions but still have no joy. </p>,desktop;beta;customize;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",stevespangler2008

Whenever they go to Google Images, it seems like the images don't fully load. GIFs don't play, and it ends up showing the preview rather than the full image. This isn't happening on other sites like Bing. Any ideas what could be causing this? A uninstall and reinstall didn't help. </p><p>Thank you so much! </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",chinchouchannel
