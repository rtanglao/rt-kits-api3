Everything seems to have gone Ok, except that for every tag, all of the bookmarks listed under the [Name] column are duplicated. When I right-click &amp; [Show In Folder], they both show in the same folder. When going onto their folder, they are only shown once, so there are no duplicates there. When I attempt to [Delete] 1 of the 2 duplicate entries they both get [Deleted], so I can only conclude that they are 1 in the same. But the question remains, ""How can I fix this duplicate condition?"" </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",Jimmy

One notable example is the New York Times. it is not possible to read an article from them because when someone clicks on the article of interest, it is not visible unless that person signs up for a subscription to the NYT. So, for all of your readers who like to peruse interesting and thought provoking articles, but do not wish to sign up for multiple subscriptions, why even carry articles from sources that cannot be read to start with? this is VERY annoying!

Whenever they go to Google Images, it seems like the images don't fully load. GIFs don't play, and it ends up showing the preview rather than the full image.
