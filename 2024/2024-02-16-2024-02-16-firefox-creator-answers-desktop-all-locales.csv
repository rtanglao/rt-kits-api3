Now when I try to log in to RAI from Firefox (latest version) I get the following message from the RAI system ""window.gigya is undefined"" . Even though my credentials are correct, the RAI platform does not allow me to log in to my account. This is a Firefox issue and not a RAI issue. I know this because I can access my RAI account and see TV content no problem via SAFARI.  Perhaps there is a setting in Firefox I need to change.

This problem does not occur consistently but is particularly frustrating when it does, as it forces me to switch to my laptop's keyboard for input.

Everything seems to have gone Ok, except that for every tag, all of the bookmarks listed under the [Name] column are duplicated.

So, I can go to any bookmark folder &amp; clearly see that there are no duplicate bookmarks, but when you do a [Search], that's when you get duplicate entries. That leads me to believe that this is the result of the [Search] function, &amp; thus for some odd reason the [Search] is generating ""duplicate entries"". And then perhaps, both the [Tag]s &amp; the [Search] function are related. </p><p>Also, this ""duplication"" does not happen on newer added bookmarks, after the [Restore] was executed, &amp; it's only a phenomenon that affects those bookmarks that were saved by the Bookmarks' Library [Backup] function, &amp; thus it was introduced by the [Backup]. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",Jimmy
