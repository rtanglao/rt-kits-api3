I do something and a pocket page suddenly comes up with like 10 pictures and click links to articles. (And I don't know what I did to get this pocket page to come up. It happens when I do something online and I can't replicate it! It's always by accident. I google pocket and login but ti's not the same page with the same articles.) I see several articles I would like to read. I click on one and at least I can usually read that one, but then I go back and can't find the other articles I wanted to read and I cant get back to the same page displaying the articles. Now there are different articles!

Rather than going through and clicking a bunch of checkboxes, I decided to have a hot key combination to enter in order to obtain my desired options.  For example, I want to allow new windows to open normally, I want to choose where files are saved, and I want to turn off Firefox's recommendations.  The underlined hotkeys are, respectively, ALT+W, ALT+A, and ALT+R ALT+F.  So rather than a bunch of scrolling and clicking, I could just type ALT+WARF, and get the options I want quickly. </p><p>However, pressing the hotkeys while in the settings does not seem to do anything.  In particular, pressing ALT+WARF only succeeds in pressing the ALT+F, which opens the File menu.  Pressing these keys without an ALT key sends them automatically to the search bar -- which is also not what I want.  Pressing ALT+SHIFT focuses in on the checkbox -- but does not press it.  For example, ALT+SHIFT+W focuses on the checkbox, but I still have to click SPACE after it to press it. </p><p>Is this a bug?  If not, how can I make the underlined keys press the respective checkboxes? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",asdf2

But every time that I lunch Firefox all the pages in the shortcuts ""call"" their websites, I see it from pihole and all the requests are made every first lunch of Firefox. Probably it's something related to the cache and to give better perfomances in case I wanna select one of those shortcuts, but I don't want that all of them make a ""call"" to their respective websites. I think it's something related to privacy and freedom about what I want to do with mt browser. Is there an option to block those connections?

Everything seems to have gone Ok, except that for every tag, all of the bookmarks listed under the [Name] column are duplicated. When I right-click &amp; [Show In Folder], they both show in the same folder. When going onto their folder, they are only shown once, so there are no duplicates there. When I attempt to [Delete] 1 of the 2 duplicate entries they both get [Deleted], so I can only conclude that they are 1 in the same. But the question remains, ""How can I fix this duplicate condition?"" </p><p>Another related &amp; interesting behavior is that, from any bookmark folder where you can clearly see there are no duplicated bookmarks, when you do a [Search] from the top-right-hand search-box, the ""results"" are also ""duplicated"", although you might need to sort them by clicking on the [Name] column control. So, I can go to any bookmark folder &amp; clearly see that there are no duplicate bookmarks, but when you do a [Search], that's when you get duplicate entries. That leads me to believe that this is the result of the [Search] function, &amp; thus for some odd reason the [Search] is generating ""duplicate entries"". And then perhaps, both the [Tag]s &amp; the [Search] function are related. </p><p>Also, this ""duplication"" does not happen on newer added bookmarks, after the [Restore] was executed, &amp; it's only a phenomenon that affects those bookmarks that were saved by the Bookmarks' Library [Backup] function, &amp; thus this anomaly was introduced by the [Backup]. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",Jimmy
