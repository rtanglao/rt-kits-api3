At first, when I received this message,  I turned off the ""NoScript"" extension and tried again,  but the website still gave me that same message.  So then I went to the about:config page.  and it showed that JavaScript is enabled because it showed a value of ""true"".  This sort of thing has happened more than once in the past.  I'm forced to go to another browser such Microsoft Edge or Chrome,  where I do not encounter this problem.  Why is this happening in Firefox, and what can I do about it?  My operating system is Windows 10 Professional,  and if you need any other details,  please let me know.

Everything seems to have gone Ok, except that for every tag, all of the bookmarks listed under the [Name] column are duplicated. When I right-click &amp; [Show In Folder], they both show in the same folder. When going onto their folder, they are only shown once, so there are no duplicates there. When I attempt to [Delete] 1 of the 2 duplicate entries they both get [Deleted], so I can only conclude that they are 1 in the same. But the question remains, ""How can I fix this duplicate condition?"" </p><p>Another related &amp; interesting behavior is that, from any bookmark folder where you can clearly see there are no duplicated bookmarks, when you do a [Search] from the top-right-hand search-box, the ""results"" are also ""duplicated"", although you might need to sort them by clicking on the [Name] column control. So, I can go to any bookmark folder &amp; clearly see that there are no duplicate bookmarks, but when you do a [Search], that's when you get duplicate entries. That leads me to believe that this is the result of the [Search] function, &amp; thus for some odd reason the [Search] is generating ""duplicate entries"". And then perhaps, both the [Tag]s &amp; the [Search] function are related. </p><p>Also, this ""duplication"" does not happen on newer added bookmarks, after the [Restore] was executed, &amp; it's only a phenomenon that affects those bookmarks that were saved by the Bookmarks' Library [Backup] function, &amp; thus it was introduced by the [Backup]. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",Jimmy

One notable example is the New York Times. it is not possible to read an article from them because when someone clicks on the article of interest, it is not visible unless that person signs up for a subscription to the NYT. So, for all of your readers who like to peruse interesting and thought provoking articles, but do not wish to sign up for multiple subscriptions, why even carry articles from sources that cannot be read to start with? this is VERY annoying!
