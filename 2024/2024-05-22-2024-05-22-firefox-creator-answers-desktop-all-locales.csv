Completely from scratch. </p><p>The first few thing I did is download firefox. I believe in the first boot of firefox, I can download things fine, I installed Ublock Origin add-on and a few installers for the app that I need to use. I can't recall when, but after a few reboot, I noticed that Firefox can't download anything, every download link I click on, the download fail instantly, I can't install add-ons as well. </p><p>I tried reinstall firefox, changing download folder target, nothing helped. </p><p>Can you take a look please? Thank you! </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-11;firefox-1260;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",wangrimen
