I see such an obvious lack of willingness to make software work for most people, instead of for the few geniuses who think everything goes without saying, that I have no confidence in software people anymore.    </p><p>Software was once a promise, 40 or 50 years ago. Now it more and more becomes a promise unfulfilled. And nobody wants to do anything about it. It's not even recognized as a problem.  Sadly, this happens in Community operated software like Mozilla just like in the big for profit Apple, Google, Microsoft, etc enterprises.  I am trying to be as kind as possible in this.   </p><p><br> Extra credit: 4) Why does the search term ""Version"" produce zero result in Firefox ""Settings""?

How much do you want to bet on that? </p><p>6) Why can't search software answer a question with another question, asking intelligently for more detail </p><pre>in order to decipher what the initial question might require to be answerable? </pre>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1240;firefox-12401;,firefox,other,en-US,1644348;,voodooquantum
