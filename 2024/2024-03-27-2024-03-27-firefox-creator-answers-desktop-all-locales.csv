However, we've encountered an issue where Firefox browser overrides this policy. It has come to our attention that Firefox is the only browser that allows users to change the default Windows proxy settings directly from the browser itself.  </p><p>To address this, we want to prevent users from changing proxy settings via Firefox browser as well. Could you please provide guidance on how to disable this feature? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",hitenj.trivedi
