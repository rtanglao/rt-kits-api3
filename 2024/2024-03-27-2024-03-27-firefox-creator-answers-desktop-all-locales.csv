While I'm familiar with some popular add-ons like Firebug and Web Developer Toolbar, I'm eager to explore more tools that can streamline my development process further. </p><p>I'm particularly interested in add-ons that aid in tasks such as: </p><p>Code Editing: Are there any add-ons that offer advanced code editing features within Firefox, such as syntax highlighting, autocomplete, or code snippets management? </p><p>Page Inspection and Debugging: I'm looking for add-ons that provide robust tools for inspecting and debugging web pages. Something akin to Firefox's built-in Developer Tools but with additional features or customization options would be fantastic. </p><p>Performance Optimization: Are there any add-ons geared towards optimizing website performance, such as identifying and resolving bottlenecks, analyzing page load times, or minimizing resource usage? </p><p>Cross-Browser Testing: I'm curious about add-ons that facilitate cross-browser testing within Firefox, allowing me to preview and debug my web projects across different browsers without leaving the browser window. </p><p>Accessibility Testing: Given the importance of accessibility in web development, I'm interested in add-ons that assist in testing and ensuring web accessibility compliance. </p><p>Version Control Integration: Lastly, I'm wondering if there are any add-ons that seamlessly integrate version control systems like Git or SVN into Firefox, providing convenient access to version control features directly from the browser. </p><p>If you have any recommendations or personal favorites in these categories or any other add-ons that you find indispensable for web development, I would greatly appreciate your insights. Thank you in advance for your help and expertise! </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",voicenews3311

When I'm on Bluesky with my Android phone and go to create a post, I tap the image to upload an image. I get the post editor box on the top, the keyboard on the bottom.
