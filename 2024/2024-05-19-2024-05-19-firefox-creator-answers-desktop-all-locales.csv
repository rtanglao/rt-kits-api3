Using Firefox the latest Ubuntu LTS, with the latest Firefox from Snap. I'm a very long term Firefox user, never had any real troubles unit recently. I have a vast number of cookies, saved passwords and so on. Reinstalling or deleting cookies or such isn't an option unless fixes are guaranteed to work - if I have to start over then I'll do it with Opera, that is where my grumpiness indicator is at. </p><p>The set up is two monitors (working as a single 'screen') attached to an Aspire PC (Aspire X seems to be the model?). I tend to have 'stuff' going on in the left hand monitor, YouTube on the right. The PC is on all day. I know there are log files, but I don't know which is for what or where they are. I use AdBlocker Ultimate.  </p><p>So what's happening is: Firefox crashes quite often at any time - 'Firefox is not responding - force quit or wait' - always have to quit. There doesn't seem to be any repeatable way to cause this, it seems random. </p><p>When the mouse enters the YouTube window (the drawing area, not the actual window) it disappears until the pointer moves out of the window. Jiggling the window size sometimes brings it back, but... </p><p>When the mouse pointer actually appears the window is completely unresponsive - clicks don't work, nothing highlights and so on. After somewhere between 10 and 30 seconds things will work for 2 or 3 mouse actions (clicks, drags etc) then do it again. Unless I give it plenty of time, clicking on a video will play a pretty random one - Firefox seems to lose track of where the pointer is.  </p><p>If I comment on a video the I get about 5 to 10 characters in then nothing happens for 10 to 20 seconds, then any queued characters are shown. Rinse and repeat until the comment is complete - it takes ages. </p><p>YouTube is the biggest problem, but there are some glitches in other Firefox windows, I'm supposing that the problems are audio/video related.  </p><p>None of the above happens with Opera. It's getting to the stage where Firefox is unusable.  </p><p>I've googled and searched this site but the there seems no solution. </p><p>Any help appreciated. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1250;firefox-12502;,firefox,other,en-US,"",richardjwatsontsr3

And after some time with the browser running it starts to garble PDFs. I have not found a trigger. Sometimes it opens fine in a new container tab or private browsing, other times nothing will open it. Very occasionally refreshing a few times makes it load correctly. The error doesn't manifest for all PDFs at the same time. Open ones will remain viewable, and once the error occurs some new PDFs still open while others fail consistently. Sometimes opening the same PDF as a file from my local drive makes it render. </p><p>The rendering error is a bit unlike anything I've ever seen. There is a lot of X and Y spearing like it tried to render the same text and images in slightly different spots over and over again. When I switch virtual workspaces and come back some parts of the rendered page retain the contents of the previous workspace and others do not. Scrolling produces jitter and additional smearing. </p><p>One somewhat reliable way to trigger the error is to put the laptop to sleep and wake it up. That always causes PDFs to exibit this error but often refreshing the PDF will work to restore it. Not reliably though. </p><p>I've attached an image of the error captured with my phone because neither screenshots nor OBS can actually ""see"" the garbage on screen. Apologies that this error is so full of inconsistent behavior. I've lived with this for some time now in the hopes that it was a temporary problem and tried to work out what causes it but I can't find anything other than putting the laptop to sleep being a cause, and even then it is not the sole cause. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1260;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Colette.m.y.Kerr

I think this is very strange, so I  try to search in the ""Bing"" in different browser(Firefox and Chrome),and the test is confused.   when I used this string ""Áõä‰∫ëÂÖ¨ÁõäÂØªÂÑøÁ´•""  as the keyword for searching, there is only one result in Firefox browser but there are many results in Chrome browser.please see below images ( image 1 and image 2). At the same time ,there are also many results in ""Baidu"" in Firefox(image 3).  Next I changed another keywords""Â§©Ê∞îÈ¢ÑÊä•"",but there is still the big difference between them.  when I Searching ,I closed all the plugins.  So I think this is strongly related to Firefox browser. This phenomena makes ""Bing  search"" very  unpredictable so that I  often got no result. please help me! thanks. </p>",linux;desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",vitaecheng

Until Sonoma, but with a stipulation.  </p><p>It will not respond at all to a double click, but <strong>ONLY</strong> when I have chosen to show the title bar in Firefox. It works fine clicking in the tab plane as long as I have Show title bar turned off. This is a bit bizarre, but it appears a recent update of Firefox no longer works like that in Sonoma. Works fine on a Windows 10 machine and on a Mac running an older OS.  </p><p>Note that I did do all the proper troubleshooting, reset Firefox, start in safe mode and all to no avail. When Show Title Bar is turned on, double click to minimize simply does not work. </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1260;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",info2825
