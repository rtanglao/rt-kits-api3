Is snel efficiënt, maar als ik op facebook het spel Words with friends wil spelen,  opent dit niet.  Al de andere spellen werken perfect.  Alleen words with friends opent niet sedert een aantal weken.  Werkte vroeger wel&nbsp;! Ik heb ondertussen Chrome geïnstalleerd, daar werkt het wel en op Edge ook,   maar ik verkies met Firefox te blijven werken. Kan U me aub laten weten waarom dit niet werkt&nbsp;?  hoe het op te lossen. Ik speel op laptop,  niet op telefoon of tablet. Windows 10 update&nbsp;!  Firefox ook update&nbsp;! Wat kan het probleem zijn aub&nbsp;? Er is ook een probleem met end to end messenger,    maar dat is minder belangrijk voor mij. </p><p>Graag hulp abu.

As a result, the YouTube list of videos I wanted to watch has been lost. The ""Restored Session"" only contains the current video, not the queue of videos I'd been looking forward to. I had Firefox set NOT to auto-update, but apparently the last Update changed that as well. <strong>I was happy with the previous version, and didn't need or want an Update, at least not now.</strong> Could you please either fix the Restore Session to include <em>the WHOLE web page, including YouTube queues</em>, or make the Do Not Auto-Update choice persistent through Updates. Better yet, both.  (I've just reset the about:preferences&gt;settings&gt;General&gt;FireFox Updates&gt;Allow FireFox to... box to ""... let me choose to install them."" Let's keep it that way!) </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1260;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ReggieA

And after some time with the browser running it starts to garble PDFs. I have not found a trigger. Sometimes it opens fine in a new container tab or private browsing, other times nothing will open it. Very occasionally refreshing a few times makes it load correctly. The error doesn't manifest for all PDFs at the same time. Open ones will remain viewable, and once the error occurs some new PDFs still open while others fail consistently. Sometimes opening the same PDF as a file from my local drive makes it render. </p><p>The rendering error is a bit unlike anything I've ever seen. There is a lot of X and Y spearing like it tried to render the same text and images in slightly different spots over and over again. When I switch virtual workspaces and come back some parts of the rendered page retain the contents of the previous workspace and others do not. Scrolling produces jitter and additional smearing. </p><p>One somewhat reliable way to trigger the error is to put the laptop to sleep and wake it up. That always causes PDFs to exibit this error but often refreshing the PDF will work to restore it. Not reliably though. </p><p>I've attached an image of the error captured with my phone because neither screenshots nor OBS can actually ""see"" the garbage on screen. Apologies that this error is so full of inconsistent behavior. I've lived with this for some time now in the hopes that it was a temporary problem and tried to work out what causes it but I can't find anything other than putting the laptop to sleep being a cause, and even then it is not the sole cause. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1260;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Colette.m.y.Kerr

I am trying to create my own theme using Firefox Color, but the custom image I uploaded doesn't show in the actual theme, only the little preview. It is definitely small enough, so I do not know what the problem is. Is this able to be remedied? I am adding a screenshot so you can best understand what I mean. I have not used FireFox Color before, so if it is an obvious fix, I apologize for the trouble.

I think this is very strange, so I  try to search in the ""Bing"" in different browser(Firefox and Chrome),and the test is confused.   when I used this string ""益云公益寻儿童""  as the keyword for searching, there is only one result in Firefox browser but there are many results in Chrome browser.please see below images ( image 1 and image 2). At the same time ,there are also many results in ""Baidu"" in Firefox(image 3).  Next I changed another keywords""天气预报"",but there is still the big difference between them.  when I Searching ,I closed all the plugins.  So I think this is strongly related to Firefox browser. This phenomena makes ""Bing  search"" very  unpredictable so that I  often got no result. please help me! thanks. </p>",linux;desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",vitaecheng

Until Sonoma, but with a stipulation.  </p><p>It will not respond at all to a double click, but <strong>ONLY</strong> when I have chosen to show the title bar in Firefox. It works fine clicking in the tab plane as long as I have Show title bar turned off. This is a bit bizarre, but it appears a recent update of Firefox no longer works like that in Sonoma. Works fine on a Windows 10 machine and on a Mac running an older OS.  </p><p>Note that I did do all the proper troubleshooting, reset Firefox, start in safe mode and all to no avail.
