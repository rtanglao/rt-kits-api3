I think this is very strange, so I  try to search in the ""Bing"" in different browser(Firefox and Chrome),and the test is confused.   when I used this string ""益云公益寻儿童""  as the keyword for searching, there is only one result in Firefox browser but there are many results in Chrome browser.please see below images ( image 1 and image 2). At the same time ,there are also many results in ""Baidu"" in Firefox(image 3).  Next I changed another keywords""天气预报"",but there is still the big difference between them.  when I Searching ,I closed all the plugins.  So I think this is strongly related to Firefox browser. This phenomena makes ""Bing  search"" very  unpredictable so that I  often got no result. please help me! thanks. </p>",linux;desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",vitaecheng

Until Sonoma, but with a stipulation.  </p><p>It will not respond at all to a double click, but <strong>ONLY</strong> when I have chosen to show the title bar in Firefox. It works fine clicking in the tab plane as long as I have Show title bar turned off. This is a bit bizarre, but it appears a recent update of Firefox no longer works like that in Sonoma. Works fine on a Windows 10 machine and on a Mac running an older OS.  </p><p>Note that I did do all the proper troubleshooting, reset Firefox, start in safe mode and all to no avail. When Show Title Bar is turned on, double click to minimize simply does not work. </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1260;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",info2825
