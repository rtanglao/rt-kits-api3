The main reason is that it's currently the only browser that has smooth video streaming across other browsers I tried when I also do more demanding things on a secondary screen. However, since I started using it, I am facing a weird issue, where I am being randomly disconnected from chat on <a href=""http://twitch.tv"" rel=""nofollow"">twitch.tv</a> channels. It mostly happens on chats that are offline - but are still actively used by others - and sometimes, but rather rarely, happens on chats that are online but are slower - the error also seem to be different on those. It always looks like this: I connect to chat, use it just fine, then suddenly I get the message on the bottom saying ""Connecting to chat"". It usually takes a second, maybe two tops to reconnect.  I have checked the page using Inspect function, and noticed an error that appears when those reconnections occur: ""The connection to wss://<a href=""http://irc-ws.chat.twitch.tv/"" rel=""nofollow"">irc-ws.chat.twitch.tv/</a> was interrupted while the page was loading"". But the page is loaded already. I didn't refresh it or anything like that. So what gives?  I have tested other browsers - Edge, Chrome, Opera - however it seems that the problem is Firefox-centric. The same chat on the aforementioned apps do not have the same problem while Firefox is happily reconnecting me here and there. I have tried clearing cache and cookies, I also tested in private mode without extensions, and in Troubleshooting mode, but to no avail. I also did a full Refresh of the browser, but the error returned after a day. I am attaching some screenshots that I did during the investigation for documentation. I was in contact with my ISP and Twitch Support, but on both ends was told that no problems were found. And so I am coming to the direct Firefox support. Any advice would be appreciated! </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",slavioararagi

This problem happens only on Linux, I have firefox account and it syncs the addons on my other windows machine, I have far more tabs opened and I have them opened now for weeks, and it's working as expected and smoothly with no issues, so it must be with the linux package. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1689434;,firefox2742
