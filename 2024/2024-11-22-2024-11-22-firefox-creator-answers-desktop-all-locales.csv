This problem happens only on Linux, I have firefox account and it syncs the addons on my other windows machine, I have far more tabs opened and I have them opened now for weeks, and it's working as expected and smoothly with no issues, so it must be with the linux package. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1689434;,firefox2742
