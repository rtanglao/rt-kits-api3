When I try to play a video I get a blank screen with the message: ""Unfortunately your Targeted Advertising privacy settings prevent us from showing you this YouTube Video. Please update your consent to see this content."" I cannot find anything in settings which should cause this. I changed nothing. Settings are the same as they've been for years. So now for RacerX videos I have to use MS Edge. </p><p>I would prefer to continue to use Firefox as my browser but switching back and forth is not productive. As much as I do not want to make MS Edge my default browser it looks like I will have no choice unless you can help me solve this issue. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1641855;1641865;1641958;,miscthings4

If I click on Weather Network, I get to the main page and usually a video will start to play as I scroll down. If I scroll past the video, it changes to PIP in the bottom right corner. Once I close Firefox, my mouse cursor freezes for a moment and then all 4 screens go blank. They try to come back on, but usually just flash and I only see a portion of what I should see for a brief moment before it goes blank again and continues this cycle. I try to use Task Manager, but I only get the Task Manager dialogue box with no text, just the window with a coloured background. If any thing does finally come up, I usually restart Windows Explorer and all of my problems go away, but most of the time I have to to a full restart of the PC. I did manage to get video of the crash on my phone. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1230;firefox-12301;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1641829;,Cynthiajasmyn
