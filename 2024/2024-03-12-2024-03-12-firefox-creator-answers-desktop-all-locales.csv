If I copy an image from anywhere - Discord, a website, the snipping tool in windows - and go to paste it into Facebook/Plurk/anything similar, it doesn't work. </p><p>This works perfectly in Chrome and used to work perfectly in Firefox. This is becoming infuriating. I can't even do 'take screenshot' and have it paste. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1230;firefox-12301;,firefox,other,en-US,"",PropKitty
