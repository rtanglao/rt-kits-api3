I want Chrome to sync with itself on both devices (it does this just fine) and Firefox to sync on both (does this fine too). What I don't want is my history, bookmarks, etc. syncing between Chrome and Firefox. I didn't set this up intentionally but that's what they're doing now - my Google search history from Firefox is showing up when I open the main Google page in Chrome (on both devices). I'm not signed into my Google account in Firefox so I'm a little baffled by how this is happening. I have two completely different use cases for these two browsers and don't want them swimming in the same pool, as it were.
