I have the latest version of windows and Firefox but when I open a new Firefox browsing session it loads the Firefox homepage not the google search page, similarly when I open a new tab.

If I click on the home button the google search page appears. My question is why is Firefox not following the settings I set for homepage and new tab setting and how can I fix this? </p><p>I have tried resetting firefox made no difference. I do not think this an antivirus problem since there is no problem access google search as the homepage only on a new tab further if I click the home button when on a new tab google search pops up immediately </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",howardbes
