I want Chrome to sync with itself on both devices (it does this just fine) and Firefox to sync on both (does this fine too). What I don't want is my history, bookmarks, etc. syncing between Chrome and Firefox. I didn't set this up intentionally but that's what they're doing now - my Google search history from Firefox is showing up when I open the main Google page in Chrome (on both devices). I'm not signed into my Google account in Firefox so I'm a little baffled by how this is happening. I have two completely different use cases for these two browsers and don't want them swimming in the same pool, as it were. Anyone know how to fix this? </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",smoothsilver2010

I call for a ban of all pay-to-read articles on Pocket and futher, the abolishment of subscription offer scripts of any kind. Pocket is supposed to information for the public good, not private profiteering. And, btw, the same goes for Recommended by Pocket. Agree or disagree, I don't care what you think.
