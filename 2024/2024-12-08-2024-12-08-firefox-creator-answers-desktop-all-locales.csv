I have a program which reads a cURL command from the clipboard then runs cURL repeatedly with slightly modified versions of the command.  The command is read from the clipboard rather than pasted into the command prompt window because it may be more than 4096 characters. This no longer works with the updated version of Firefox.  Comparing the cURL commands from the two versions of Firefox showed lots of ""^"" characters had been added.  For example ""120Months|Yield|RiskScore"" had become ""120Months^|Yield^|RiskScore"".  When I edited the cURL command to remove the ""^"" characters, everything worked like it had before the Firefox update. I suspect this is related to the changes introduced by Bug 1777800. I would like to know whether the problem can be reproduced using up-to-date versions of Firefox and Windows.

Do you get a response containing the data for the next 25 funds or a very small file containing an error message? </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",paul921

Once that was accomplished, then I would enable Firefox Sync for the two devices. </p><p>Scenario: Device “A” (Profile A): Primary/Original/Source Device “B” (Profile B): Copy/Clone/Duplicate </p><p>I understand that if I set up Firefox Sync first and then sync the two devices what I will get is a combination/fusion of the information on the 2 devices, i.e., all the “good” stuff in Profile A plus all the superfluous stuff in Profile B that I would just as soon ignore/delete – which is not what I want. This issue has been raised in a number of other posts on this forum but with no suitable resolution offered (that I could find). I’m wondering if there might be a “work-around” that would achieve the desired result. </p><p>So ... would this work? </p><p>1) Back everything up first (of course!) 2) Glean any unique information to be preserved (Logins, etc.) from Profile B and incorporate it into Profile A (Profile A now has everything essential!) 3) Purge Profile B </p><pre>   a) Create a New Profile on Device B (and delete old?)    b) Delete everything possible from the new Profile B (default bookmarks, etc.) </pre> <p>4) Login to Mozilla account and enable Sync </p><p>The idea is to create a “blank” Profile on Device B so that when Profile A and Profile B are Synched together (combined), Profile A remains unchanged, and Profile B is populated with everything in Profile A (a perfect copy!). </p><p>Instead of purging Profile B as above, an alternate method might be to first “pre-load” Bookmarks in Profile B by the usual method of Backing up Profile A Bookmarks and then Restoring them to Profile B. At this point Profile A and Profile B Bookmarks would be exactly the same and Synching the two devices should make no changes to either’s Bookmarks. Logins and other information would still have to be purged, but this could at least be a head start. </p><p>Presumably this idea could be extended to more than 2 devices (but with only one being the “Primary”). </p><p>Note that I am (myself) only concerned about Bookmarks and Logins, and am thus glossing-over how other information that might be important to others (Browsing History, Tabs, etc.) might be Synched. </p><p>Could someone from Mozilla/Firefox with a knowledge of the inner workings of these features please comment as to the efficacy of this “work-around”? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",steve_oxborrow
