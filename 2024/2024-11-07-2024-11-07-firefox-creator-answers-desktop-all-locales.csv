Up until now I have been using Chrome for Work and Safari for Personal. I have been having more and more issues with Chrome, so I am moving my Work configuration to Firefox. Unfortunately, I have found a MAJOR difference in behavior. In Chrome I have 9 tabs setup to open when I start Chrome (my Home Page), these are the tools I use in my job; Jira, M365, Zabbix, GitLab, Digital Ocean, and a bunch of in-house tools. I set these up in Firefox, so far, so good. Unfortunately when I open a New Window, as I often do when working a specific problem, I get all of my Home tabs and I need to go through and close them all. </p><p>So my question is WHY there is not a setting to enable Home Page separate from New Window? I did find this <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1281079"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1281079</a> but it does not really answer the question as to why we cannot have the same behavior as Chrome. I understand that the current design just calls the same New Window code whether it is the first Window or the 100th Window, but setting a flag in memory once the first Window has been opened and checking that flag to determine if the New Window needs to open all the Tabs should not be that large a code change. Note I said a flag in memory and not on disk, as that would be a performance hit. </p><p>My second question is whether the powers that control Firefox would be open to such a code change if submitted? I understand how Open Source works and features that the volunteers working on code want to see are the ones that get developed. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",settings;firefox;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",PK1048

I created a temporary user, logged in, installed FF and configured it, also installed some add-ons (first of all, ublock origin). Then I logged out, logged as an administrator and moved the temporary user profile to the default profile location (c:\Users\Temp -&gt; c:\Users\Default), and then reset its NTFS permissions. This almost always works for all applications, including Google Chrome. I created a new user and logged in, opened FF. The settings were applied, but the extensions did NOT work, and even the buttons on the toolbar looked like empty squares. At the same time, the add-ons were present in the list of add-ons in settings, although without icons. It helped to turn off and turn on all the add-ons one by one, manually. </p><p>After some research, I realized that FF binds its settings to absolute paths to add-on files (*.xpi), specifically in the $profile/extensions.json and $profile/addonStartup.json.lz4 files. Google Chrome, for example, doesn't do anything simular, like the vast majority of applications. Removing these files from the profile will cause all add-ons to be ""reinstalled"" on first launch and set to a disabled status. </p><p>An easier way to reproduce the problem: 1. Run firefox -profile d:\temp\profile1 2. Install some extensions. 3. Rename profile1 folder to profile2. 4. Run firefox -profile d:\temp\profile2 5. Got it! </p><p>For what purposes does firefox bind to absolute add-on paths, and how can this problem be solved? P.S.
