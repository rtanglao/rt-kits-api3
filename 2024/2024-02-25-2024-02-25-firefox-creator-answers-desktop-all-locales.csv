Once in a while the first post will stay, but the remainder of the news feed keeps refreshing. It is impossible to read anything as posts flash on and off, mostly off. The news feed is the only thing that is affected, visiting pages for likes and groups load and display properly, as do the games I play. The same occurs if in the private window mode. This does not happen if in the Chrome browser. What can be done to correct this situation? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,other,en-US,"",phambel

I used to be able to do so by clicking the bookmark star as many times as I wanted and selecting the folder I wanted to save the page to and the page would show up in each folder I saved it to. Now for some reason, when I try to bookmark something in one folder it removes the bookmark from the other folders I saved it to. This is not good for me, why is it happening and how can I rectify this ridiculous change? Thank you. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",thflinkth
