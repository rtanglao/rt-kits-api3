I used to type directly into the address bar (see first image). </p><p>Press Enter, and the Startpage results page for this search phrase would show up.  Somehow, this has now changed.  I press Enter, but the result is just the Startpage home page, with a blank search box (see second image).  So I then have to type the same phrase in <em>again</em> in Startpage's own box.  This just trips me up. </p><p>The crazy thing is that this only happens <em>sometimes</em> - but more often than not.  I haven't seen it work right for weeks: I just did it now to make screenshots, and it worked wrong.  I just did it again and it worked as expected: pressing Enter took me to Startpage's results. </p><p>Any clues how to change settings to fix this? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",sebthirlway

FWIW, my CPU during 4K playback is barely used (1-2%), and my GPU's video codec (VCE) is used by around a third. Disabling HW accel makes things better, as it still stutters but it's (barely) passable. I already tried creating a new profile, but still it's the same. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",federicobarutto

Once in a while the first post will stay, but the remainder of the news feed keeps refreshing. It is impossible to read anything as posts flash on and off, mostly off. The news feed is the only thing that is affected, visiting pages for likes and groups load and display properly, as do the games I play. The same occurs if in the private window mode. This does not happen if in the Chrome browser. What can be done to correct this situation? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,other,en-US,"",phambel

I used to be able to do so by clicking the bookmark star as many times as I wanted and selecting the folder I wanted to save the page to and the page would show up in each folder I saved it to. Now for some reason, when I try to bookmark something in one folder it removes the bookmark from the other folders I saved it to. This is not good for me, why is it happening and how can I rectify this ridiculous change? Thank you. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1638520;,thflinkth
