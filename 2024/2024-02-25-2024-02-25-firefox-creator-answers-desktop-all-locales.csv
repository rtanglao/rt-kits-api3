I tried to follow your advice but was not successful. In the end, I googled ""what if Firefox doesn't install"". It took me to a website, <a href=""https://www.makeuseof.com/fix-firefox-not-installing-windows"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.makeuseof.com/fix-firefox-not-installing-windows</a>   , which took me to an article entitled ""8 Fixes to Try if Firefox Won't Install on Windows"". I tried #1 and #2 without success. #3, Temporarily Disable Your Antivirus Software, worked. Firefox is up and running. Feel free to share this with anyone who has a similar problem. No guarantee that it will work, but its worth a try. Again, thank you. drzee1946 </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",dr-z

I understand that the current default behavior makes sense, but part of what makes firefox great and different is its customizability, so having what I want be a hidden about:config toggle feels very on brand (or even a setting in the normal settings menue - but even there it might be too niche and cause bloat). </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1638551;1638570;,Christoph.Langos
