Now whenever I start Firefox on any of my profiles, it will immediately or almost immediately display a ""Welcome back"" popup stating that ""Here’s a quick reminder that you can keep your favorite indie browser just one click away."" and provides a button to make the browser the default one. That's exceedingly annoying - I can understand that Firefox wants to notify my once in a while, but this happens at least once a day, probably more often than that. I looked over the source code and got that it is a ""spotlight"" feature, but I failed to find any settings that would turn it off. Any idea how can I disable this forever? </p>",desktop;tips;windows-11;firefox-1230;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",pepak

Alternatively, do you maybe know of a plugin to allow this? </p><p>What wouldn't be useful are solutions requiring additional actions (Just unpin first, just use MMB, here is a plugin to give you a shortcut to unpin etc). </p><p>If it is just not possible right now, is it likely to become an option later on? If not it seems like a useful feature request. I understand that the current default behavior makes sense, but part of what makes firefox great and different is its customizability, so having what I want be a hidden about:config toggle feels very on brand (or even a setting in the normal settings menue - but even there it might be too niche and cause bloat). </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1230;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1638551;1638570;,Christoph.Langos

FWIW, my CPU during 4K playback is barely used (1-2%), and my GPU's video codec (VCE) is used by around a third. Disabling HW accel makes things better, as it still stutters but it's (barely) passable.
