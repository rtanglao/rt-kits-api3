This is because most of the exploits in linux have been related to namespaces vulnerabilities.  </p><p>If there is a Firefox ver 127.0.2, running on Linux in which the user namespace is turned off then the following is observed in the Troubleshooting information, i.e. about:support Seccomp-BPF (System Call Filtering)	true Seccomp Thread Synchronisation	true User Namespaces for privileged processes	true User Namespaces	false Content Process Sandboxing	true Media Plugin Sandboxing	true </p><p>So how come with the username turned off, the content process and media plugin is still sandboxed? Also is having user namespace turned off, as given above, a security risk? </p><p>However  if the network namespace is turned off, i.e. max_net_namespaces is set to zero, then it renders the browser unusable. Nothing works. Why is that?  </p><p>Is there some documentation somewhere where these namespaces and their impact is explained in detail? </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",ixian.1

I attempted reinstallation and everything else, but I couldn't solve the mystery and remain stuck on version 116.0 beta 8. </p><p>What's happening? Every time I try to load a page on any version above 116.0, it either doesn't open or keeps loading in a loop. Yet, if I use another browser or revert to version 116, everything works correctly. This issue does not occurs in others machines. </p><p>Has anyone experienced something similar? </p><p>Thanks in advance for your help. </p>",desktop;beta;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1280;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jpmagri91
