I attempted reinstallation and everything else, but I couldn't solve the mystery and remain stuck on version 116.0 beta 8. </p><p>What's happening? Every time I try to load a page on any version above 116.0, it either doesn't open or keeps loading in a loop. Yet, if I use another browser or revert to version 116, everything works correctly. This issue does not occurs in others machines. </p><p>Has anyone experienced something similar? </p><p>Thanks in advance for your help. </p>",desktop;beta;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1280;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jpmagri91

I've turn off VPNS, reset my internet router countless times, cleared cache/cookies, flushed DNS, updated firefox, updated my video drivers, updated windows,  disabled extensions (including adblock), opened Firefox in safemode, and reset hardware acceleration. This is not an issue on chrome or edge.  Some of the error messages include: Netflix F7351, Paramount Plus 5000, and error code 102630. Youtube mostly doesn't work on livestreams, and says that my browser isn't compatible. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1270;,firefox,other,en-US,1660145;1660148;,leticiatate6

Ever since I updated to Plasma 6.1, Firefox crashes constantly when using Wayland. I'm not having this problem if I'm using X11. Crash reports are sent after every crash so I'm sure someone can reference these. When starting Firefox from a console, I got this message after a crash:  ""[GFX1-]: Wayland protocol error: wp_linux_drm_syncobj_surface_v1#67: error 5: explicit sync is used, but no release point is set"" </p><p>Will this get fixed with the next Firefox update?
