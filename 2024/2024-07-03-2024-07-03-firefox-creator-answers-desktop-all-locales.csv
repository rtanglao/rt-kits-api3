The installation was from the Firefox site, I downloaded the dmg and then dragged into Applications. </p><p>I find that playback of media stutters, and is choppy--not sure of a better way to explain it. E.g., YouTube videos and the Bandcamp player have ""stuttered sound"". Opening another site in another tab can make this effect worse. Likewise, trying to run Google Meet in a browser window causes basically everything on the computer to become very slow. </p><p>This still happens even if I go to ""about:profiles"" and then ""restart with add-ons disabled"". </p><p>But if I switch to another browser, Safari or Chrome, then I don't have the issue. e.g. I can play YouTube in the background fine even when running some compute intensive task. </p><p>I have also tried turning on/off ""performance settings"" and the ""use hardware acceleration"" checkbox underneath it -- neither of those seem to have any effect. </p><p>Activity Monitor showed that at most Firefox was using ~4 GB of memory of a total 48 GB, and the memory pressure indicator seems to be quite low. </p><p>I have run Firefox on other systems (e.g. System76, older Macbook Pro) with multiple windows open each having 20-30 tabs and never had an issue like this. </p><p>It really seems like it has something to do with how Firefox is interacting with the M3? Happy to learn I'm wrong. And happy to provide more details about the hardware or my settings if it would help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1270;firefox-12702;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",nicholdav

I kept separate ones for shopping, banking, Facebook, etc. Now I had to erase my MacBook Pro IOS, and after a few days of trying to use Safari, I installed Firefox. But I can no longer see the possibility of using containers. I found them particuarly helpful when I had more than one account for a certain platform - with containers, I didn't need to sign out and sign in to switch users. It also (supposedly) kept Facebook from tracking our interests. Has Firefox done away with containers? Or have I simply forgotten what they are called (buckets, maybe?). I searched and searched the help articles to no avail. If they have done away with them, why?  </p><p>By the way, Chrome (which I had to use at work) started offering a similar product and it was also very helpful. </p>",tabs;macos;,firefox,basic-browsing-firefox,en-US,"",redwoodchoirs

Pages take a long time to load, and the browser often freezes or becomes unresponsive. I've already tried clearing the cache and disabling extensions, but the problem persists. I'm using the latest version of Firefox on Windows 10.

I've turn off VPNS, reset my internet router countless times, cleared cache/cookies, flushed DNS, updated firefox, updated my video drivers, updated windows,  disabled extensions (including adblock), opened Firefox in safemode, and reset hardware acceleration. This is not an issue on chrome or edge.  Some of the error messages include: Netflix F7351, Paramount Plus 5000, and error code 102630.

Crash reports are sent after every crash so I'm sure someone can reference these. When starting Firefox from a console, I got this message after a crash:  ""[GFX1-]: Wayland protocol error: wp_linux_drm_syncobj_surface_v1#67: error 5: explicit sync is used, but no release point is set"" </p><p>Will this get fixed with the next Firefox update?
