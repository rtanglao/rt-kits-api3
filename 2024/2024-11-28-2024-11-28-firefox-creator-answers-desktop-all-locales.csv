Immediatamente disattivo il tutto perchè preferisco la classica barra dei segnalibri orizzontale, ma però mi rimane la barra laterale comunque presente con la sola rotella delle impostazioni, ma togliendomi circa 2 cm di schermo. Non sono praticissimo ma non ho trovato come eliminare la fastidiosa barra laterale. Ringrazio in anticipo per chi mi saprà indicare la soluzione, grazie.
