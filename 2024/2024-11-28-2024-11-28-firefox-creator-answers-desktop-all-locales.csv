We understand the technical reasoning for this and that users are able to ignore the message, but this does impact our user experience and it may even discourage users from using our devices. </p><p>As these regulations will be impacting networking devices globally, we want to ask you if there are any workarounds for the self-signed sertificate ""unsecure connection"" message.
