Its possible the  problem may be I'm not using the right instruction on the Firefox options when I right click the article I want to attach to Facebook. Some of those options are, Save link as, Copy link, when I right click for options. Can someone explain what is the right option to use? And, how do I proceed once I choose the correct option to make that attachment to a Facebook message I'm replying to? There are times a picture of the article will attach to the Facebook message, but the text that is associated with the attachment will not appear? Can someone please help?
