After starting Firefox the PDF view inside the DMS works fine until I suspend (to memory) and resume my machine. Regular HTML-content looks fine but the resumed DMS session shows only blank (all white) Pages inside the PDF view. Changing to a different PDF file doesn't help. The number and size of these pages is presented correctly. I can even select and copy (invisible) text from these blank PDF pages. The problem applies to all PDFs, whether they're single or multi paged, have images inside them (like with PDFs from a scanner) or not, etc. Reloading the page/closing reopening the affected browser window doesn't help, i.e. the problem persists. </p><p>I recently found out, that this also applies to PDF files directly opened inside Firefox (which also seems to use pdf.js as a PDF viewer), that is, this is not related to a specific site like my DMS. </p><p>The problem always persists until I kill Firefox and start it over. </p><p>Pdf.js seems to use a canvas inside a div (see screenshots attached) to draw the visual PDF content and another div to make the text layer selectable/searchable etc. I don't know what's happening to canvases on a system suspend/resume cycle in Firefox on Linux, but I suspect that's where the problem originates from. </p><p>This problem already affected older versions of Firefox and pdf.js. </p><p>Please let me know, if you need further information from my side to investigate that issue. </p><p>Thanks a lot! </p>",linux;desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",thomas360

And two windows of Firefox. So two Firefox instances with several tabs on each. But because it eats a lot of memory, I have to close and reopen Firefox from time to time. And to my annoyance, sometimes it ""forgets"" about one of the windows. So opens only one instead of both. Therefore I loose some quite important tabs. Any suggestions on how to fix this? Thank you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1637353;,zarsss

I've even tried deleting cookies, cache, site data and so on, to no avail. I've also tried a clean terminal with no extensions installed and i have the same issue. Other browsers do not have this issue on the exact same form. I am at a loss, any assistance would be appreciated. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,customize,en-US,1637354;,ill7ven

(By the way I tried all suggestions to fix the error and also reinstalled Firefox  but still have the error) </p><p>jscher2000 i think you are correct. The blue link in the PDF file is not a web link but a link to the specific attachment. It appears browsers are currently unable (not programmed) to access attachments directly.  I tried in MS Edge with the same result. After contacting MS Support, MS stated that they are aware of the issue and that they are working to fix it in a future release of Edge. </p><p>Attachments can be accesses in Adobe Acrobat as you described, but it would be good to be able to access them directly from Firefox instead of having to save them and then using Acrobat. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1220;,firefox,other,en-US,"",berygan
