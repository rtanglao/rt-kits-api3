And two windows of Firefox. So two Firefox instances with several tabs on each. But because it eats a lot of memory, I have to close and reopen Firefox from time to time. And to my annoyance, sometimes it ""forgets"" about one of the windows. So opens only one instead of both. Therefore I loose some quite important tabs. Any suggestions on how to fix this? Thank you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",zarsss

I've even tried deleting cookies, cache, site data and so on, to no avail. I've also tried a clean terminal with no extensions installed and i have the same issue. Other browsers do not have this issue on the exact same form. I am at a loss, any assistance would be appreciated. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ill7ven

(By the way I tried all suggestions to fix the error and also reinstalled Firefox  but still have the error) </p><p>jscher2000 i think you are correct. The blue link in the PDF file is not a web link but a link to the specific attachment. It appears browsers are currently unable (not programmed) to access attachments directly.  I tried in MS Edge with the same result. After contacting MS Support, MS stated that they are aware of the issue and that they are working to fix it in a future release of Edge. </p><p>Attachments can be accesses in Adobe Acrobat as you described, but it would be good to be able to access them directly from Firefox instead of having to save them and then using Acrobat. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1220;,firefox,other,en-US,"",berygan
