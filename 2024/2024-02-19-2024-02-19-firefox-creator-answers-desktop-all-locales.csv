I'm trying to transfer Firefox bookmarks from a hard drive pulled from a now dead iMac (was IOS 10.13.4 + Firefox 116.6.0) to a MacBookPro laptop running BigSur (11.6.8) and Firefox 122.0.1. I have the iMac HDD plugged into a hot swap docking station. A search for places.sqlite on the old HD turns up nothing.  </p><p>I have found answers for drilling down into Windows to find the appropriate files to transfer, but not for Mac. I didn't know Firefox Sync existed until now, and I don't know where to look for a profile on the hard drive. Suggestions? </p><p>Edit: </p><p>Ok, this is going to be a bigger problem that I thought. The laptop is my wife's old university-owned mac, and there's a whole ""admin"" layer of hidden and mixed-up folders. I need to go see the admins for help. </p><p>Thanks a lot anyway, though.

The problem is, firefox is making odd decisions on what to display in the search results. I was under the impression that Firefox would prioritize the most frequently used tabs in the search results, but this no longer appears to be true, or the criteria used is more complex than that. </p><p>As an example, in the attached screenshot, i am searching for tabs with the keyword ""Stellaris"". But for some reason, Firefox refuses to show me any reddit tabs with ""Stellaris"" in them, and is instead showing a list of tabs that are much less frequently used. </p><p>Is there any way to get the search results to prioritize the most frequently used tabs, change what shows up in the search results, etc?

After starting Firefox the PDF view inside the DMS works fine until I suspend (to memory) and resume my machine. Regular HTML-content looks fine but the resumed DMS session shows only blank (all white) Pages inside the PDF view. Changing to a different PDF file doesn't help. The number and size of these pages is presented correctly. I can even select and copy (invisible) text from these blank PDF pages. The problem applies to all PDFs, whether they're single or multi paged, have images inside them (like with PDFs from a scanner) or not, etc. Reloading the page/closing reopening the affected browser window doesn't help, i.e. the problem persists. </p><p>I recently found out, that this also applies to PDF files directly opened inside Firefox (which also seems to use pdf.js as a PDF viewer), that is, this is not related to a specific site like my DMS. </p><p>The problem always persists until I kill Firefox and start it over. </p><p>Pdf.js seems to use a canvas inside a div (see screenshots attached) to draw the visual PDF content and another div to make the text layer selectable/searchable etc. I don't know what's happening to canvases on a system suspend/resume cycle in Firefox on Linux, but I suspect that's where the problem originates from. </p><p>This problem already affected older versions of Firefox and pdf.js. </p><p>Please let me know, if you need further information from my side to investigate that issue. </p><p>Thanks a lot! </p>",linux;desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1220;firefox-12201;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",thomas360

The blue link in the PDF file is not a web link but a link to the specific attachment. It appears browsers are currently unable (not programmed) to access attachments directly.
