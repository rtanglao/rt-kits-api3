I was also experiencing occasional BSODs (Blue Screen of Death). A lot of my troubleshooting searches suggested RAM was the issue, so I did memory tests, none which detected anything abnormal. </p><p>For good measure, I also did a clean reinstall of Windows. Strangely, Firefox didn't crash at all from an entire day of YouTube yesterday, but today I got 3 crashes in a very short amount of time, which you can see linked above (I don't have any more crashes). Even stranger, one of the crashes occurred when I was just browsing the Mozilla Support pages.  </p><p>Anyway, I didn't read too deeply into them, but it looks like they're all citing my GPU driver as the issue... is that correct? Thanks for any ideas. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1210;firefox-12101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",eightflat

Firstly, when I click on the Firefox icon on my new computer (Windows 11), the profile manager doesn't start up, so I can't choose the old profile. I've tried copying over all of the old files into the new profile folder, and that didn't work, either.
