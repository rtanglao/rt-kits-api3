It may not be 'a real cookie' but I still can’t get rid of it. </p><p>When I searched online for that apparent address I found: <a href=""https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/40175"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/40175</a> The info near the top of that site’s page: Torbutton INFO: tor SOCKS: http://expyuzz4wqqyqhjn.onion/static/images/home/png/block-trackers@3x.png?h=70991bcb via --unknown--:cc55771ba6d6e8c6542066863a47e223 SOCKS is a username? And the ‘onion/hidden service’ address cannot be accessed unless using the Tor browser? So that seems a dead end for me. </p><p>I have seen 3 other people posting here in the past year about this particular cookie.  hobro1 did an uninstall &amp; still had to remove directories manually after getting some answers from several others.  blazee decided – based on the answer given by jscher 2000 – that it probably wasn’t dangerous.  mekishev 1 received an answer from cor-el that is incomprehensible to me, except for saying ‘it isn’t a real cookie’. I understand it may not 'a real cookie' but then why is it showing up in 'manage website data' where everything else is a cookie? </p><p>Can anyone help, please? I’m about to migrate over to a new computer and really don’t want to take this with me. I don’t like the fact that it persists, and that the cookies ‘keeper’ – SOCKS maybe? – is completely hidden. </p><p>Thanks much in advance for any assistance! </p><p>PS The only possible explanation I've come up with for how it got this cookie is when I was checking out some Firefox extensions; I didn’t even know what Tor was till trying to figure this out. </p>",desktop;cookies;mac-os-x-1014;firefox-11560;firefox-1156;,firefox,cookies,en-US,"",mydiylife

Firstly, when I click on the Firefox icon on my new computer (Windows 11), the profile manager doesn't start up, so I can't choose the old profile. I've tried copying over all of the old files into the new profile folder, and that didn't work, either.
