Firstly, when I click on the Firefox icon on my new computer (Windows 11), the profile manager doesn't start up, so I can't choose the old profile. I've tried copying over all of the old files into the new profile folder, and that didn't work, either. What's going on? </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-1150;,firefox,customize,en-US,1630430;,FireFoxFan1
