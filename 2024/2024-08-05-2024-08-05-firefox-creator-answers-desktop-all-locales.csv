Both now demand two-factor/step authentication at sign-up which I can live with BUT every time I click a link once signed in that they deem is sensitive (like looking at the details of a particular reservation or accessing their help messaging tools), I am asked to go through the authentication again. For every task.  This means, for example, to change a room for a guest I now need to receive three different SMS codes as the platforms somehow stop recognising that I've already logged in. </p><p>I haven't changed any settings on Expedia, <a href=""http://Booking.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Booking.com</a> or Firefox so any ideas on how to solve this please? </p><p>Thanks in advance Kevin </p>",desktop;windows-10;troubleshooting;firefox-1280;firefox-12803;,firefox,troubleshooting,en-US,"",unionfan

By this I mean the countdown timer in the bottom left of the stream, which usually says something like ""Starts in 75 minutes"" but even if half a hour has passed, it will still say that message. For clarification, I'm a viewer, not the creator. </p><p>Secondly, when the stream is supposed to start, it just won't, unless I refresh the page. I doublechecked this by opening a seperate window of the same stream. Even 20 minutes after the stream has started, on the first window it still won't start (and ofcourse the big red play button has been pressed long before that). </p><p>I never had those issues with my old PC. Though it's unlikely to be a local setting with Firefox in about:config either, because I tried with other browsers like Brave and Chrome and the same issues persists there. But I'm not sure where else to go with this problem. </p>",desktop;windows-10;troubleshooting;firefox-1280;firefox-12803;,firefox,troubleshooting,nl,"",Yuveon
