The same I did when I clicked <a href=""https://chat.openai.com/c/d93ac426-c5d1-451b-abc4-fc82739f"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chat.openai.com/c/d93ac426-c5d1-451b-abc4-fc82739f</a>..... from <a href=""https://chat.openai.com/c/d93df"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chat.openai.com/c/d93df</a>...... (went from one chat to another) or to <a href=""https://chat.openai.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chat.openai.com/</a> (went from current to new chat) by clicking the list of chats at leftmost vertical panel. When I saw the top left corner of Firefox browser, the ""round circle arrow"" reload button was not change to ""X"" or any other symbol specified that the page was going to different link (different URL). Previously I have had went to this <a href=""https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/15781"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/15781</a> page, and mostly not specified the problems at all. I went to ChatGPT and it said that ""I must change the 'false' to 'true' of browser.tabs.remote.separateContentProcess object/variable in about:config. When I searched for that, it seems I found browser.tabs.remote.separatePrivilegedContentProcess"" and I have had toggle this to ensure if YouTube, ChatGPT, or other domain will refresh/reload the page when it went to different URL in the same domain, but nothing happens.  </p><p>The problem is, this is not happen in Chrome Browser. Because of Firefox is my default browser, multi-functional, configurable, I want to make this behavior can also happens in Firefox rather than Chrome. Is there any solution of this? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1240;firefox-12401;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",zyxwvut153
