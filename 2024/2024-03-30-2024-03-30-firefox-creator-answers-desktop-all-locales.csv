The first instance is in fact frozen -- it looks as it should but trying to change tabs or open a new tab is inactive. Seems I have to kill the open instance of FF, then if I click on a link in an email, FF pops up as it should with a new tab for the link, but the existing tabs are all there and all functional.  It feels like a bug -- Tbird seems not to know that FF is already running. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1150;,firefox,other,en-US,"",rayandrews

Every so often, when I load up a video from Youtube, I get a blank player with no video in it. Every other aspect of the page template loads properly, but the video is just not there. The only fix for this is to clear my cookies and it's annoying to have to do this every week just to watch Youtube videos. </p><p>I've tried using other Firefox Forks, and they've had the same issue. I've used other browsers, specifically Chromium ones, and have not run into the same issues as of yet. I've isolated the problem down to my cookies, as deleting just the cache doesn't do it. Resetting the browser doesn't do it. Clearing my search history doesn't do it. Disabling all my addons doesn't do it. Signing in and out of my Youtube account doesn't work either. Any combination of all these fixes doesn't make the problem go away. The only thing that I've found to work is clearing my cookies. </p><p>Is there a way I can fix this? Please let me know ASAP. </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-10;firefox-1240;firefox-12401;,firefox,cookies,en-US,"",greenjoker6

When I saw the top left corner of Firefox browser, the ""round circle arrow"" reload button was not change to ""X"" or any other symbol specified that the page was going to different link (different URL). Previously I have had went to this <a href=""https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/15781"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/15781</a> page, and mostly not specified the problems at all. I went to ChatGPT and it said that ""I must change the 'false' to 'true' of browser.tabs.remote.separateContentProcess object/variable in about:config. When I searched for that, it seems I found browser.tabs.remote.separatePrivilegedContentProcess"" and I have had toggle this to ensure if YouTube, ChatGPT, or other domain will refresh/reload the page when it went to different URL in the same domain, but nothing happens.  </p><p>The problem is, this is not happen in Chrome Browser. Because of Firefox is my default browser, multi-functional, configurable, I want to make this behavior can also happens in Firefox rather than Chrome.
