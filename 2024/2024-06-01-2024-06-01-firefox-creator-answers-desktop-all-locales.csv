The thought of having to sign up a completely separate second account/email for a second Firefox 'account' with a second 'mfa' token just to separate personal and work is ludicrous. </p><p>I want to sign in, pick my profile as personal / work and then it syncs my diff favourites, plugins etc. per profile for work or personal depending where I am, NOT SHARE them all on 1 login. This is not possible and a huge disappointment considering these features are considered basic in other browsers.""<em> </em> </p><p>Until firefox does this, it is unusable for multi work/private profiles and signing up a second Firefox account is just silly. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",tsullyman
