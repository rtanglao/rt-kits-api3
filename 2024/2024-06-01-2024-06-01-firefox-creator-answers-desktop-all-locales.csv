This does work properly and I'm able to pinch zoom by holding down the Shift key and scrolling my mouse wheel up and down. </p><p>However, there is an issue of sensitivity. The pinch zoom is painfully slow, and I have been unable to adjust its speed. If there exists an option to change the pinch zoom sensitivity, I'd greatly appreciate the help. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",apinologi

They are still listed under the Window toolbar option but clicking on them reveals nothing, as if hidden except they are not in the Mac toolbar.  Not sure if this is a new feature or glitch, any help would be great, the two windows I can't currently access contain alot of tabs I need. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mrkeesu

Wanted to provide feedback that hopefully someone sees, as there is going to be a mass migration to FF soon and if they do NOT fix the below, people will give up fast. </p><p><em>""There is no basic multi profile support like in edge, chrome etc. which is shocking. </em> </p><p>about:profiles is completely useless, because once you sign in with the same firefox account again, it just syncs to the same profile. </p><p>Firefox MUST have multiple profile support under 1 login, not combine them. The thought of having to sign up a completely separate second account/email for a second Firefox 'account' with a second 'mfa' token just to separate personal and work is ludicrous. </p><p>I want to sign in, pick my profile as personal / work and then it syncs my diff favourites, plugins etc. per profile for work or personal depending where I am, NOT SHARE them all on 1 login. This is not possible and a huge disappointment considering these features are considered basic in other browsers.""<em> </em> </p><p>Until firefox does this, it is unusable for multi work/private profiles and signing up a second Firefox account is just silly. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;,firefox,customize,en-US,1655335;,tsullyman
