Then the tabs start loading. Why is that? </p><p>After startup of Windows 10, I usually run a little batch script of mine starting various applications such as Outlook, Notepad++ etc, including Firefox along with my favourite websites, just like this: </p><p>start """" ""C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Firefox.lnk"" <a href=""https://de.wikipedia.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://de.wikipedia.org</a> <a href=""https://www.google.de"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.de</a> [and more...] </p><p>So Firefox loads and opens all the tabs in the background, while other apps such as Outlook or Notepad++ come in the foreground. I read mails etc. before I decide to check e.g. Wikipedia. So it might take 5 minutes after Firefox got opened before I actively put it in the foreground. THEN I see no websites got loaded, and THEN Firefox starts to load the websites, which then takes the normal amount of time of a few seconds. </p><p>I wonder why Firefox does not load all my requested websites directly after start in the background. </p><p>An annoying side effect is, when still in Outlook and clicking on a website link in an email, it won't open in Firefox, most likely due to that reason that Firefox still waits for all the other websites to load. I need to put it into foreground, wait for the loading process to complete, and then go back to the email and click on the link again. </p><p>Any ideas would be greatly appreciated! </p><p>Many thanks in advance for your assistance &amp; Best regards Volker </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1260;firefox-12601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",volker.meder
