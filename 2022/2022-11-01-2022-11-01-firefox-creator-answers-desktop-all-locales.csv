That is to say, I almost never - and by ""almost"" I just mean ""I could imagine a scenario though I can't remember one"" - send data from Firefox to a piece of paper.  But I save upload receipts to PDF from Firefox all the time.  I'd been doing it for over a decade no problem.  The Mac makes it easy - I don't know what it's like on Windows or Linux, I don't mess with those because I use a computer for business and don't have time to waste on things being cumbersome, so I just bought a good computer in the first place twenty years ago and have stuck with that platform since.  When I need to save a receipt, I just click Print (command-P on the keyboard) and then click the PDF button and save it to my computer.   </p><p>But, lately, every time Firefox runs an update - and it seems to do that about once a month - this breaks again, and when I click ""print"" I don't get my useful print dialogue with a save to PDF option, I get some other weird mess asking me about... paper handling?  Like, actual printer stuff?  Why? </p><p>I got it figured out, but it's extra annoying because I have to google this solution fresh every couple months because the developers change things so that my setting to restore proper behavior gets broken.   </p><p>And whatever, it takes five minutes a month to keep fixing this, but just why?  Why do you keep breaking my PDF print function?  Is there supposed to be a benefit to this?  Is there something I'm not aware of that is somehow inferior about the system print dialogue?  Admittedly I may be out of the loop because I don't ever actually move web content to paper, so maybe this makes it easier to print double sided or landscape or something?  I just don't understand why you have to keep changing back-door settings to make things harder for people who don't waste paper and just use the print function to save to PDF like civilized adults. </p>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,1544975;,jayratch
