Why do you keep breaking my PDF print function?  Is there supposed to be a benefit to this?  Is there something I'm not aware of that is somehow inferior about the system print dialogue?  Admittedly I may be out of the loop because I don't ever actually move web content to paper, so maybe this makes it easier to print double sided or landscape or something?  I just don't understand why you have to keep changing back-door settings to make things harder for people who don't waste paper and just use the print function to save to PDF like civilized adults. </p>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,1544975;,jayratch
