My firefox crashes immediately upon trying to play a video. Even simply scrolling over a video on youtube or google results, it breaks when it tries to the preview. This is the same on Twitter, Facebook, Campus Moodle, etc. Every website I use. </p><p>I've had this problem before and I did fix it by totalling wiping my history and browsing cache. Doing that and having to sign back into everything is super tedious though and I don't want it to keep happening. This doesn't happen when I use firefox's troubleshooting mode, everything works as normal and videos play without the browser crashing. So I think it must be something specific to my browsing history somehow? But I've no idea how that could crash the browser just from trying to play a video. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1060;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",commandoclo

I understand the reason for signing themes when they are uploaded to the Mozilla Add-ons Store, as they may contain licensed background images. I don't understand why I need to sign my own theme which I don't plan to share or distribute. I know I can use the Firefox Color addon, but it doesn't support GIFs and large images. I tried to download the resulting theme and customize it the way I like, but after that I couldn't use it. The code contained in the theme does not look like it can be modified in any way for malicious purposes, so even if someone downloads my theme, it is unlikely to harm anyone. </p><p>So why can't we just use our own themes? </p><p>Edit: Oh, and using a Developer Edition and disabling signinature check for all add-ons just to use a custom theme doesn't sound reasonable, so please don't suggest it. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1060;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",0scr

That is to say, I almost never - and by ""almost"" I just mean ""I could imagine a scenario though I can't remember one"" - send data from Firefox to a piece of paper.  But I save upload receipts to PDF from Firefox all the time.  I'd been doing it for over a decade no problem.  The Mac makes it easy - I don't know what it's like on Windows or Linux, I don't mess with those because I use a computer for business and don't have time to waste on things being cumbersome, so I just bought a good computer in the first place twenty years ago and have stuck with that platform since.  When I need to save a receipt, I just click Print (command-P on the keyboard) and then click the PDF button and save it to my computer.   </p><p>But, lately, every time Firefox runs an update - and it seems to do that about once a month - this breaks again, and when I click ""print"" I don't get my useful print dialogue with a save to PDF option, I get some other weird mess asking me about... paper handling?  Like, actual printer stuff?  Why? </p><p>I got it figured out, but it's extra annoying because I have to google this solution fresh every couple months because the developers change things so that my setting to restore proper behavior gets broken.   </p><p>And whatever, it takes five minutes a month to keep fixing this, but just why?  Why do you keep breaking my PDF print function?  Is there supposed to be a benefit to this?  Is there something I'm not aware of that is somehow inferior about the system print dialogue?  Admittedly I may be out of the loop because I don't ever actually move web content to paper, so maybe this makes it easier to print double sided or landscape or something?  I just don't understand why you have to keep changing back-door settings to make things harder for people who don't waste paper and just use the print function to save to PDF like civilized adults. </p>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,1544975;,jayratch
