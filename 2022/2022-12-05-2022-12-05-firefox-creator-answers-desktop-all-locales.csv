Yesterday afternoon, it stopped working correctly. Only the most recent 10 or so emails are shown in each folder and the rest are greyed out. It no longer allows me to select mail settings and I cannot send emails. My email was still fully functional using Chrome, so I'm not sure the problem involves any changes in the Yahoo site. Has anyone else experienced this, and if so, is there a fix? </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,other,en-US,"",parredward
