I also deleted the secondary original email attached to the account/secondary email) </p><p>Anyhow, i reset my password twice today via mail, since to do it via 'manage account' you need to give the old password and this always gives a 'incorrect password' error. After resetting my password i log into my account and try to delete the account/change the password, and i once again get the 'incorrect password'. </p><p>Unrelated to this issue i also had problems merging passwords from 2 accounts, this account did not merge its sync data but my other one did. I even tried importing passwords from csv and it did not help. </p><p>At this point I just want to delete the account. </p><p>System: Ubuntu 22 Desktop Firefox is installed via Ubuntu software, so it runs snap-store Firefox Version 107.0.1 </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",zeno.adriaenssens

I can use the 'v' tab selector to the right, and it will select the chosen tab and make that visible in the window, and make the selected tab visible in the tab bar, but when I again move the pointer into the tab area, it starts scrolling to the right.  Similarly, I can click on the '&lt;' scroll left button, or double or triple click on it, and it will scroll the tabs leftward; but immediately after completing the action, the tabs will scroll rightward to the end again. </p><p>It seems my problem is the same one as in <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/bm/questions/1353140"" rel=""nofollow"">this thread</a> but there was no solution given there (the problem persists after restarting Firefox in troubleshooting mode).

Consumindo 86% de memória de um notebook de 8GB.","<p>Já são anos, inclusive já fui banido daqui por reclamar demais dos mesmos problemas cujo nunca houveram uma solução. O exemplo desta semana passada é mais do que simples: Duas atualizações demandadas, ambas realizadas e como de costume, o meu navegador Mozilla Firefox não abre site nenhum. Eu sou obrigado a usar o Google Chrome para entrar no site deste suporte, por exemplo. As vezes eu demoro até 2h, 120min, para abrir um site qualquer. Não tenho acesso a nada pelo Mozilla, a não ser que eu espere.  Por que eu insisto nele? Ainda é o navegador que além de constituir minhas informações necessárias, ele já está com tudo que eu preciso.  Outro ponto é que não tenho nenhuma extensão instalada, já fiz durante os anos a maioria das dicas de melhoria para a questão de lentidão e travamentos e não, nunca funcionou.  Realidade é que a cada atualização, piora o desempenho aqui. Volto a dizer que já fui banido por realizar as mesmas reclamações, do mesmo nível. Esta é a primeira numa nova conta, cheguei a fazer mais de 100 reclamações do mesmo sentido.  É impossível que alguém tenha que esperar até 120min para abrir um site. Também é impossível que seja um problema do meu computador, visto que tudo funciona voando, menos o Mozilla. Tenho para mim que o assunto é PESSOAL, sofro retaliações dos funcionários da empresa com esse tanto de atualizações que não tem se quer uma descrição DO QUE ESTÁ SENDO ATUALIZADO. Aí eu pergunto: Qual é o problema comigo? Qual é o problema Mozilla? Por que nunca houve o mínimo de melhoria na lentidão e funcionamento do navegador, ao menos comigo?  O exemplo de hoje é o seguinte: estou assistindo Copa do Mundo pelo site da Globo, e, estou desde 10h da manhã esperando para abrir o site, só abriu quando já estava com 13min de jogo, ou seja, minutos atrás. E isso vem sendo recorrente. Jogos das 7h da manhã, eu acordava as 5h.  É o cúmulo da sacanagem com o usuário do navegador, O CÚMULO. É uma sacanagem do caramba! Acham que é mentira?
