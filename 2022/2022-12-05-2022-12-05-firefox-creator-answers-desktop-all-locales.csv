I don't seem to be able to find one anywhere. I am a novice at computer related issues, and require step by step basic help. Surely there must be a way to change the background image, I managed to do it in Chrome but Firefox illudes me.

I've tried every solution that Netflix recommends for this error code, I tried changing the IndexedDB permissions in private browsing, I tried disabling DuckDuckGo and TotalAdBlocker extensions but so far the only thing I've found that fixes the problem is to open a non-private browsing window. Is there any way to get Netflix to work in a private browsing window so that my history won't be tracked?? </p><p>I've attached a screenshot of the Netflix error screen if that helps. </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",Krobee

I then clicked on the ""import from another browser"" the window told me that there was not anything to import.  I then copied the bookmarks from my old machine onto the flash drive and put them in the new browser.  I guess that because there was nothing to import at first, that ""import"" feature is still looking to be satisfied and that is why it is still stuck in my Toolbar.  See image below.   </p><p>I have not tried to ""Fake it out"" not sure how I could do that at this time. </p><p>Thanks  Hal </p><p>PS.  I like the old version 3.6.4 it seems to have a less busy ""header"" than this one, and I could remove all 3 Toolbars if I need the space on the window.
