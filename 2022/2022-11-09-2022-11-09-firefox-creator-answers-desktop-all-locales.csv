Bookmarks won't sync. I've been through about 3 computers over the last year and haven't had any issues till now. I've tried everything I can think of including: reinstall Firefox, sign in and out, reboot, click on sync several times, and nothing. Help! I'm using Windows 11 for the first time. Is that the issue? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1546707;,mattjd

Which obviously NO!!! It's GOOGLE. I have to reload and reload and reload and reload and it can take absolutely forever to get it to work properly again. Only happens with Google. How do I either fix this or force Firefox to access non-secure websites anyway? There has to be a way to force access regardless of security!  </p><p>Thank you! </p>,desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1546692;1546694;1546699;1546703;1546705;,peterturbo_apologist

I also removed Japanese as an alternative language on Firefox as well but nothing seems to fix the problem.  </p><p>The attachment is what I see every time whenever I open a window in Firefox.
