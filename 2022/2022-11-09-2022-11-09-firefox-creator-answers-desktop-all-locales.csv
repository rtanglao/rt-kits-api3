Runs the whole pc really slow. It has something to do with updates because I never changed anything else. This sounds like a typical phasing out of windows 7 to me.  How do I reboot about:config to default settings? In case I did something with my privacy settings, that is causing this high memory usage? </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1060;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",herolegend

Everything works as expected, but I get a weird issue in Firefox, where the cursor constantly flickers between the last mouse position and the pen position. For example: </p> <ul><li> I opened <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> </li><li> I positioned the <strong>mouse</strong> over the search field </li><li> Leaving the mouse alone, I positioned the <strong>pen</strong> over the ""Google Search"" button. </li><li> The cursor keeps switching between a hand and a caret. It triggers hover effects on both elements as well. </li></ul> <p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/a0eVgb9"" rel=""nofollow"">Here's a video of the issue</a> (sorry about the quality). </p><p>If I click a link with the pen, it might flicker and go to the mouse position instead. I had to recover a deleted email in Gmail because this happened when I tried to open another one. It's also pretty annoying when hovering on stuff, like product photos on Amazon that keep flickering on and off the screen. </p><p>This does not happen on any other application I tried on my PC. When using other apps, moving the pen updates the mouse coordinates so that if I later move the mouse, it will move relatively to the latest pen position. E.G. if I leave the mouse on the top left corner, then use the pen on the bottom right, and try to move the mouse after, the cursor would move from the bottom right. This does not happen with Firefox; it seems that it keeps mouse and tablet coordinates separated. In the previous example, the cursor would instead ""teleport"" to the latest mouse position (top left) before moving. I've noticed this also occurs in the Edge browser, <strong>but the cursor does not flicker</strong>, it just remembers the mouse latest position. So it seems to realize that I'm using the pen and ignores the mouse entirely until I move it again. </p><p>I am running latest Firefox on Windows 11 (Insider Build) on an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X with 32 GBs of RAM and a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060. Drivers and OS are up to date. </p><p>Steps I took to try and solve the issue: </p> <ul><li> Disabling hardware acceleration (tried setting gfx.direct2d.disabled to true as well) </li><li> Opening a private browsing window </li><li> Launching in safe mode </li><li> Uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox </li></ul> <p>Unfortunately none of the above worked. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,fix-problems,it,1546742;1546751;,valerio.bulla
