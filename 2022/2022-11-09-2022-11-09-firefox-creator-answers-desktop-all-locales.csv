I am trying to find the support email so that I can ask them to delete the information associated with *that* email address. Every time I try to access some link that resembles contact information, I somehow end up in this support portal. support@firefox.com doesn't seem to work. Any advice? </p><p>Thanks </p><p>(please don't do offtopic such as: ""have you tried searching for backup codes on drive or email?"", it was more than 4 years ago). </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",cristi_feda

Bookmarks won't sync. I've been through about 3 computers over the last year and haven't had any issues till now. I've tried everything I can think of including: reinstall Firefox, sign in and out, reboot, click on sync several times, and nothing. Help! I'm using Windows 11 for the first time. Is that the issue? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1546707;,mattjd

Which obviously NO!!! It's GOOGLE. I have to reload and reload and reload and reload and it can take absolutely forever to get it to work properly again. Only happens with Google. How do I either fix this or force Firefox to access non-secure websites anyway? There has to be a way to force access regardless of security!  </p><p>Thank you! </p>,desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1546692;1546694;1546699;1546703;1546705;,peterturbo_apologist

But for some reason, all of the windows for ""open file"" ""attachments"" is in Japanese. I have both languages in my mac but I have my primary language as English.  I made sure by going over the settings, removing Japanese, restarting and going back to Firefox to see if it fixed the issue. I also removed Japanese as an alternative language on Firefox as well but nothing seems to fix the problem.  </p><p>The attachment is what I see every time whenever I open a window in Firefox. No other program has this problem.  I can still use the window in Japanese but it bothers me not knowing what is causing this issue. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,other,en-US,1546686;,foreverblue25
