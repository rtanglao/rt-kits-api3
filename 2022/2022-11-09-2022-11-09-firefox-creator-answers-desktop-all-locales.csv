Which obviously NO!!! It's GOOGLE. I have to reload and reload and reload and reload and it can take absolutely forever to get it to work properly again. Only happens with Google. How do I either fix this or force Firefox to access non-secure websites anyway? There has to be a way to force access regardless of security!  </p><p>Thank you! </p>,desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",peterturbo_apologist

But for some reason, all of the windows for ""open file"" ""attachments"" is in Japanese. I have both languages in my mac but I have my primary language as English.  I made sure by going over the settings, removing Japanese, restarting and going back to Firefox to see if it fixed the issue. I also removed Japanese as an alternative language on Firefox as well but nothing seems to fix the problem.  </p><p>The attachment is what I see every time whenever I open a window in Firefox. No other program has this problem.  I can still use the window in Japanese but it bothers me not knowing what is causing this issue. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,other,en-US,1546686;,foreverblue25
