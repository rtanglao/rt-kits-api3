Yet video boxes/windows still popup blocking part of the page.  Is there any way of stopping them?  At least now the sound has been muted.  But when I checked permissions for a particularly aggravating website I see that in Permissions I see autoplay is allowed/default.  It seems  Firefox is intent on disrupting my reading by these incessant and pestering videos, 99% of which are utter drivel and have nothing to do with what I'm trying to read.  Its like web design by 8 year old children.   </p><p>What is the solution for killing video popups once and for all?  As videos often don't even work in  Firefox I've relegated video watching to Chrome which is fine.  I use Firefox for reading and Chrome for watching.  No problem. </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-950;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",moz2u

But now I have a new laptop and I've downloaded extensions/apps to read those same QR codes from the new laptop's webcam, but Firefox is still prompting me to put in a password. Is there a way around this or am I going to have to reset my password and lose all my encrypted data? Thanks for the help. </p>",mac-os;desktop;sync;firefox-950;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",npotvin
