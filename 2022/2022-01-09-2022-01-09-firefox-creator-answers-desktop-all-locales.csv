I've looked around the web a lot and I'm obviously not the only person who wants this feature. It used to be a feature way back, and the only explanation I've found for removing it is that some shady apps could change the search settings and ""average users"" had trouble switching them back. OK, fine, but has no one figured out how to solve that without just removing the feature all together? Even if there is no way to fix that, if I am aware of the risks and want to set it up that way anyway, why can't I? I can't even find an extension to do it! Everywhere I look on the web it tells me to use keyword searches, but that is in no way the same or as convenient. I also don't get why, if keyword searches don't present a security problem, I can't just have any search in the search bar automatically add the keyword... </p><p>This has actually been frustrating me since Mozilla took the feature out years ago, but I'm just extremely surprised that there is apparently still no fix for it anywhere.

At this moment (and earlier also) keywords are the only way try check if bookmarks are correct folder. But almost always web-pages don't fill keywords. So you should do it yourself.

It will switch to the UK and Mexico sites randomly when I click on the tab. The address is saved as the US version (<a href=""http://espn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">espn.com</a>) when this happens so I can't figure out why it's doing it. It doesn't matter if I use a vpn that says I'm in the US or just my regular internet provider in the US, the site keeps changing what country it chooses to open with. I noticed that every time I click the tab it will cycle between the various different sites for each country even though as I said before, the bookmark is set for <a href=""http://espn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">espn.com</a>. It makes no sense as none of my other bookmarks do this and it doesn't do it when I use Safari's browser. Is there anything on my end I can do to get this to stop or is it coming from <a href=""http://espn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">espn.com</a>'s end?
