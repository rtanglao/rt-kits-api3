It will switch to the UK and Mexico sites randomly when I click on the tab. The address is saved as the US version (<a href=""http://espn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">espn.com</a>) when this happens so I can't figure out why it's doing it. It doesn't matter if I use a vpn that says I'm in the US or just my regular internet provider in the US, the site keeps changing what country it chooses to open with. I noticed that every time I click the tab it will cycle between the various different sites for each country even though as I said before, the bookmark is set for <a href=""http://espn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">espn.com</a>. It makes no sense as none of my other bookmarks do this and it doesn't do it when I use Safari's browser. Is there anything on my end I can do to get this to stop or is it coming from <a href=""http://espn.com"" rel=""nofollow"">espn.com</a>'s end? Thank you for your time and help.Â :) </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;firefox-950;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",mtnrydr

Also, it doesn't happen if I opened a stream but closed it after a few minutes of watching but if I watched the stream for an extended period of time then it will almost always crash.  </p><p>Anyone else have this weird issue? Any help would be appreciated thank you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1472280;,mr.chiu.simon

Yet video boxes/windows still popup blocking part of the page.  Is there any way of stopping them?  At least now the sound has been muted.  But when I checked permissions for a particularly aggravating website I see that in Permissions I see autoplay is allowed/default.  It seems  Firefox is intent on disrupting my reading by these incessant and pestering videos, 99% of which are utter drivel and have nothing to do with what I'm trying to read.  Its like web design by 8 year old children.   </p><p>What is the solution for killing video popups once and for all?  As videos often don't even work in  Firefox I've relegated video watching to Chrome which is fine.  I use Firefox for reading and Chrome for watching.  No problem. </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-950;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",moz2u

But now I have a new laptop and I've downloaded extensions/apps to read those same QR codes from the new laptop's webcam, but Firefox is still prompting me to put in a password. Is there a way around this or am I going to have to reset my password and lose all my encrypted data? Thanks for the help. </p>",mac-os;desktop;sync;firefox-950;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",npotvin
