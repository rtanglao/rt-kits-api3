Nowadays i can't do that. Actually, i can edit a bookmark but i can't save it? It doesn't happend so any more and there isn't any ""save""-button? Now I don't know how i can save bookmark if i edit it? </p><p>Currently it seems to be only way to get new modification of bookmark if i browse to some web-address then save that address to bookmarks-list. After that you can remove the old, wrong web-address. But you can't get own headline text to your new bookmark? </p><p>2. topic This is long-time idea. I have lots of bookmarks and sub-folders in my bookmarks-list (library).  When i add new bookmark to list and like to put it to some specific sub-folder i can use left side bookmark-tree to browse bookmark to correct place. When i want search e.g. all bookmarks which have string ""Firefox"", i can't see if they all are same specific sub-folder like i want to. I can see headline text and web-address but i can't see where that bookmark is in library. Could we get bookmark-tree-path somehow to search output? And, it would be nice if i could click directly to that sub-folder to see if there would be even better bookmark for my need? At this moment (and earlier also) keywords are the only way try check if bookmarks are correct folder. But almost always web-pages don't fill keywords. So you should do it yourself. The bookmark-tree-path would be much more useful info after use search to find some subject bookmarks. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",eeh211

Note that URL auto-complete is the feature I'm talking about: </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/address-bar-autocomplete-firefox#w_url-autocomplete"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/address-bar-autocomplete-firefox#w_url-autocomplete</a> </p><p>I go to usbank several times per month. I visit turbotax several times per year. `us` isn't intuitive with turbotax, but it is intuitive with usbank. Firefox thinks I mean the less-visited URL for some reason. I have usbank bookmarked, I don't have the turbotax link bookmarked; why is Firefox auto-completing a less-used non-bookmarked URL over a more-used bookmarked URL?! </p><p>I know I can disable URL auto-complete by going to about:config and searching for browser.urlbar.autofill then setting it from true to false. However, this would also prevent usbank and other useful URLs I do mean to go to from auto-completing. How do we make Firefox smart, and use the more-often bookmarked URL over the less-used non-bookmarked URL? I'm pretty sure Chrome is smart about it; it seems to populate what I use more, and stops auto-populating non-bookmarked URLs that I haven't used in a while. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,customize,en-US,1472374;,davecast

I did not recognize what was happening, but the computer slowed to a point of complete unresponsiveness. I had to hold the power button in for a hard shutdown. Next day, I was watching a YouTube video, the video stopped playing, and the computer slowed to a snail's pace. Task Manager revealed something was using up ALL system memory. A look at running processes showed that the culprit was Firefox. </p><p>Firefox would start normally, then gobble up all system memory over a few minutes, rendering the computer almost inoperable. </p><p>Tried garbage collection, CC, and minimize memory usage under about:memory. This would temporarily reduce overhead, but then it would climb back up next time I started Firefox. </p><p>The Ant Video Downloader underwent a redesign days ago; this memory issue started exactly two days ago, on Friday evening, the 7th of January, 2022. </p><p>I disabled the add-on.

There seems to be one main process using the largest share of memory (200-300,000 KB) with 12 other firefox.exe processes running concurrently, all using smaller amounts of system memory. Firefox memory use no longer climbs until all system memory is consumed. </p><p>Is there any way to rein in memory use by Firefox add-ons short of disabling them? Are other users reporting this issue? How are add-ons vetted prior to use with the browser? There are few of these video downloaders available. Most are merely copies of a single piece of non-functioning software—but listed under different names, supported by what are clearly fake reviews. Is anyone verifying the integrity of these add-ons in addition to their developers? </p><p>In this case, the developer is based in Hong Kong. </p><p>Thank you to the community for any assistance offered in this case. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-950;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",iamwileecoyote
