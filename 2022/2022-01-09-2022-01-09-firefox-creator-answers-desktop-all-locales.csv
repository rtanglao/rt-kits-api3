But now I have a new laptop and I've downloaded extensions/apps to read those same QR codes from the new laptop's webcam, but Firefox is still prompting me to put in a password. Is there a way around this or am I going to have to reset my password and lose all my encrypted data? Thanks for the help. </p>",mac-os;desktop;sync;firefox-950;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",npotvin
