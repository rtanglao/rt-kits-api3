As it stands right now, if I wanna chat with friends on facebook then I have to go through Windows and force firefox to output audio to my headset, which means that if I wanna watch a video as well, the audio from that no longer comes from my sound system, but my headset instead. When seraching for 'audio,' 'sound,' or 'playback' in the settings (after going through them all manually) I can't seem to change that. Chrome did it just fine.. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",gioserpo

When I press ctrl-B, my bookmarks appear on the browser's left side as expected.  However the text is not visible.  If I hover my mouse over an icon is the list for a bookmark, the link appears.  Also not all the bookmark icons appear.  There are gaps between bookmarks on the list.  Again, I have to hover my mouse over those gaps for bookmark info to appear.  How do I make my bookmark list readable/usable again? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1060;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",mysticfree

Xfinity says to contact you, so ...is there a bug being worked on, or a way to troubleshoot the issue? They had me look in More Tools for something about clearing something, but I don't have whatever tool that is in my Firefox 106.0.2 (64-bit). I really don't want to have to install Chrome or reinstall Edge just to pay my cable bill. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jenibski

I'm on 106.0.2 (64-bit) and I've already tried a lot of things. </p><p>Like the title says, this occurs on Safe Firefox. I have this whole video I recorded, but tbh I'd rather show through internal browser logging. Is there a way I can do that? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",janslikester
