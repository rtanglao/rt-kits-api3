It seems connected more to youtube, and I noticed recently that it constantly increases the use of RAM (up to 6-8 gb) which I am suspecting to be the cause here. Keep in mind my laptop has 16 gb RAM ddr4.  </p><p>I have resetted Firefox as well, to no avail. Next step, which I really wanted to avoid, is to make a fresh install of firefox.   </p><p>This is a crash report ID of the last days that I still can see:  </p><p>44c6d9ef-8f3d-4072-93bb-31fadaffedb9 	27/10/2022, 02:26 	 </p><p>I added a screenshot of the current RAM use of firefox. </p><p>Do you know how I could fix this?  </p><p>Thank you so much! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",carlotti.sebastian
