This is fine. But then as I move the mouse down over either the address or bookmarks bar, the Apple menu and title bar retract suddenly, shifting the Firefox bars upward just as I left click. I always end up missing the bookmark I was aiming for, or accidentally clicking on a bookmark while aiming for the back button, or similar. Driving me crazy. </p><p>To clarify. The Firefox bars do not shift upward when my mouse remains over the tab bar or higher. It only shifts when my mouse gets down over the address bar or the bookmark bar and am about to click.  </p><p>Is there any way to keep the Firefox menu bars from shifting upward until the mouse hoovers away from all the bars? </p><p>FYI: At other times, the title bar or menu bar or both will cover up the tabs or address or both. For example, when the Apple menu autohide is set to never, it still hides, but this time, when it unhides, it completely covers the tabs and address bar. </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ga7pilot

I've searched all over the settings and Internet to find an answer, but no luck in finding the answer. </p><p>The main idea of ""Full Screen Mode"" is to maximize the usable display area of the browser window.  When I'm using Full Screen Mode, I am intentionally using just one URL.  If I need a new window, then I'll get another Full Screen Firefox window (not a tab).

Keep in mind my laptop has 16 gb RAM ddr4.  </p><p>I have resetted Firefox as well, to no avail. Next step, which I really wanted to avoid, is to make a fresh install of firefox.   </p><p>This is a crash report ID of the last days that I still can see:  </p><p>44c6d9ef-8f3d-4072-93bb-31fadaffedb9 	27/10/2022, 02:26 	 </p><p>I added a screenshot of the current RAM use of firefox. </p><p>Do you know how I could fix this?  </p><p>Thank you so much! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",carlotti.sebastian
