Basically private browsing (mask) means Firefox now?,"<p>Below I show screen shots of the blank page on firefox which has the firefox logo all but diminished under the private browsing mask.  It's the same on the start bar but of course much smaller. </p><p>It makes it look like the new brand of firefox is the private browsing mask (I am always in that mode except for netflix).  </p><p>I prefer the firefox logo and I surely don't need to know when I'm in private browsing on the start bar.  The home page I don't care about, but I know I'm in private browsing cause the upper area of firefox says private browsing right on the browser itself.  I have no idea why we would need be made aware that we're in private browsing, it seems the opposite would be more helpful. </p><p>I'm writing because I don't like this new firefox tiny icon with a big purple mask over it.  Wanted to let you know. </p><p>If you're changing brands or something?  To a purple mask?  And private browsing isn't all that great. </p><p>The image on the left below is the new firefox icon on the start bar.  The one on the right is on the blank page which I don't care about at all but it's just a bigger picture. </p><p>Who/what is firefox? </p><p>I love firefox, but just saying.   </p><p>Thanks for hearing. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,other,en-US,1544362;1544364;,g888

I discovered that when you delete a book-mark entry from drop down menu, the same entry is also deleted from its saved location in Other Book Marks. I was trying to reduce number of unsorted entries in drop down menu while saving (and retaining) the same link in the Other Bookmarks section and folder. I want to continue using the sorting and discrete folder saving possible with the Other Bookmark section but clean up the clutter in the unsorted bookmark section. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",nokaoi1

As it stands right now, if I wanna chat with friends on facebook then I have to go through Windows and force firefox to output audio to my headset, which means that if I wanna watch a video as well, the audio from that no longer comes from my sound system, but my headset instead. When seraching for 'audio,' 'sound,' or 'playback' in the settings (after going through them all manually) I can't seem to change that. Chrome did it just fine.. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,customize,en-US,1544366;,gioserpo
