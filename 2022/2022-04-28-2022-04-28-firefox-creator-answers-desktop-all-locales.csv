My question is, if my Firefox download option is set for all file types to ""Always Ask"", then why are you downloading the file twice???  I have specific folders where I want files to reside.  I don't want to have to remember to go to my Windows Download folder and delete the duplicate files.  How can this duplicate file download problem be fixed? </p><p>Long time user, Leo </p>",desktop;customize;firefox-990;,firefox,customize,en-US,1500731;1500776;,bussysconsultant

The attached image shows roughly what Firefox does the first time I try to open it after starting my computer. I usually have to close and re-open it 5-10 times before it will launch properly. At this point, I usually manually recover my previous session. Does anybody know of a potential fix to this problem? I have tried updating Firefox and have also tried uninstalling and reinstalling. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;linuxmint;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1500712;1500723;,joshuamoler00
