It is not working in Firefox, but it does in other browsers. I have other examples just from today. I have used firefox as default for many years. I assume this is a security thing, but these are basic links. I have no add-ons or other complications. Most times, I do not even realize there is a problem, but when I feel something is wrong, I try another browser and it works.

Why am I getting double downloads?  I only want one copy of a downloaded file, not two copies.  Now I have to go to my Windows Download folder and delete the duplicate downloaded files.  My question is, if my Firefox download option is set for all file types to ""Always Ask"", then why are you downloading the file twice???  I have specific folders where I want files to reside.  I don't want to have to remember to go to my Windows Download folder and delete the duplicate files.  How can this duplicate file download problem be fixed? </p><p>Long time user, Leo </p>",desktop;customize;firefox-990;,firefox,customize,en-US,1500731;,bussysconsultant

The attached image shows roughly what Firefox does the first time I try to open it after starting my computer. I usually have to close and re-open it 5-10 times before it will launch properly. At this point, I usually manually recover my previous session. Does anybody know of a potential fix to this problem? I have tried updating Firefox and have also tried uninstalling and reinstalling. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;linuxmint;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1500712;1500723;,joshuamoler00
