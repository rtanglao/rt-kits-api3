When the list of bookmarks in a folder is long, you always have to scroll in addition. How to make Firefox show bookmarks automatically in order of newest on top? Or even better: It would be a great feature if the settings of ""manage bookmarks"" -&gt; ""sort"" could be applied optionally to the folders in the toolbar. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",friends1
