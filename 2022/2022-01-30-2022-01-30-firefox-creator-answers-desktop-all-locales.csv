I have tried to find a way to turn off firefox's notifications of a new update to use on my desktop, but nothing works.  It's just annoying when companies take control of computer, and try to stuff something down my throat, when I've repeatedly indicated that I don't want it all.  only thing worse is taking away/disabling what I DO want.  So, how can I ensure that I won't see incessant pop-ups, unless &amp; until I decide to upgrade/update? Thanks, ML </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Rabun1Brooks

Every time the Firefox browser updates, my default homepage is changed to ""<a href=""http://www.msn.com/?pc=ACTE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msn.com/?pc=ACTE</a>"". Currently, my homepage is set as ""Firefox Home (Default)"". </p><p>I have noticed that if the ""Custom URLs..."" option is selected, and a custom URL is set, but then changed to the ""Firefox Home (Default)"" option, the previously entered URL will revert back to ""<a href=""http://www.msn.com/?pc=ACTE"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msn.com/?pc=ACTE</a>"" if the ""Custom URLs..."" option is selected again. </p><p>I have done multiple malware checks using Malwarebytes, but found no malware. </p><p>I have done some looking around in about:config, and found two values that weren't added by the browser. I know this because it is impossible to delete values in about:config added by the browser itself. </p><p>""browser.startup.homepage_override.buildID	20220126154723"" and ""browser.startup.homepage_override.mstone	96.0.3"" are the two values not added by the browser. You can even see (in the attached image) that the two values can be deleted by clicking the trash can icons. However, when trying to delete them, they eventually return. </p><p>I apologize in advance if this is seen as a duplicate post, but after rigorous research, I have found no post that solves my issue. </p>",desktop;customize;home-page;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",hgadm
