Ever since the latest Firefox updates went into effect a couple weeks ago, when I open a window in private browsing mode, a private-browsing icon appears in my task bar. Before the latest updates, there would be no extra icon in my task bar when I opened a private browsing window - instead i could get to the private window by hovering over the regular Firefox icon in my task bar. I want it to go back to that. It sort of defeats the purpose of ""privacy"" when my screen has an icon showing that I have a private browsing window open. Also, I don't like that extra clutter in my task bar. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,other,en-US,"",mortner01

I have just installed Firefox as my default browser, but am subscribed to Sky Sport Now in New Zealand (<a href=""http://www.skysportnow.co.nz"" rel=""nofollow"">www.skysportnow.co.nz</a>) and when I try to start the application it says that this application will not work with a VPN. I use Nord VPN as my VPN, but even after stopping all Nord services, it stll says the same. I can log onto this site with Microsoft Edge no problems. Maybe I have to swap my default browser to Microsoft Edge??? Brian Coddington </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1545858;,codsy01

When I start a video, all I see is a spinning processor wheel, and then the advice to restart my device. No matter how long I wait, the video never plays. I actually have to go into Microsoft Blue, or Wave, whatever it's calling itself, to view a video. All other functionality on the site is fine: saving a video in a playlist, getting the script to copy the link, liking, etc. </p><p>I haven't changed anything in my browser settings in months. I had things the way I like them. I don't know what's changed. </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1060;firefox-10603;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",AborigenGTS
