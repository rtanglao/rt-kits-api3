This applies to any app that I'm using on the browser. For example, I typed this whole paragraph before a single word appeared, and even then, it still took another 30 seconds to actually appear. I've already reset, refreshed, uninstalled and reinstalled, updated, everything like that. I have a couple extensions, AdBlock, Honey, WebRTC Lead Shield, and Return YouTube dislike. But I ran it in safe mode and the issue was still there.
