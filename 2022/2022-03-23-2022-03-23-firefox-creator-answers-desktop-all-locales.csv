1371962,2022-03-23 01:49:30 -0700,2022-03-23 01:49:30 -0700,Weird Tab Behaviour,"<p>The problems I am facing are from the iOS and iPasOS versions of Firefox.  Often the order of the tabs as they appear are different from what they “actually” are. It’s hard to explain and surprisingly complicated. First of, tabs don’t follow the same order in the overview and the tab lists. Manually ordering the tabs doesn’t seem to resolve the problem. I believe the tabs in “full screen” mode are ordered by website while the tabs in the overview are ordered by the user opening in groups of tabs. However, the order of this also changes often, especially on iOS. That is already a big problem, especially since I like to use keyboard shortcuts to navigate efficiently. I will try to go a previous or next tab, only to be brought to a complete unexpected tab, due to the hidden order of tabs. Also, the behaviour of clicking a link is inconsistent. Sometimes, it’ll open in the same tab, while other times it will open in a new tab. When that happens, I either have to wait a while, wondering whether I have a slow internet connection. Or, I’ll click the link repeatedly, opening a bunch of new tabs.  That brings up another problem. When you close a tab, Firefox brings you to your last opened tab, which is somewhat normal. However, it doesn’t make an exception for newly opened tabs, unlike safari, and will instead bring you to your original tab. This means you’ll have to visit each tab manually every time you close a tab, or visit each tab in descending order, and then close it. A lot of hassle. This isn’t really a cry for help from the community, just a general request for fixes. </p>",desktop;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",jonathan.ch.ma
