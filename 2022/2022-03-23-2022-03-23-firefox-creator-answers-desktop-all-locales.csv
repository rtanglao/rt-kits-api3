Recently updated Firefox, now while navigating through tabs, FF randomly selects multiple tabs. When this happens, I can only view the one tab, all others are selected, but I cannot then go to that tab to view. I'm not sure I'm explaining this well. Also, I cannot close the tabs with the X but must right click for drop-down menu to close. I can open new tabs, but that tab is becomes the anchoring selected tab, any other tab I try to go to then becomes selected, as well as every tab in between, none of which I can actually view, they are stuck. I have tried ""select all"" in hopes of then de-selecting, but deselecting is not an option.  </p><p>This is really holding me up as I have work to do and cannot view the necessary tab.

I did not enjoy this new behavior, so I tried to downgrade to 95.0.2. After installing it, Firefox told me it couldn't load the user profile, as it was used on a newer version of Firefox. </p><p>I have no idea where exactly I read this, but some website contained an instruction to erase compatibility.ini and that would allow me to use the profile on older versions. Tried that and it actually worked. I did notice that, when Firefox tried to update, it would say it failed. I was hoping that, once I find a solution to the forced dark mode and I update Firefox, the problem would go away. </p><p>Fast forward a few weeks, I found AutoConfig and browser.theme.toolbar-theme option in about:config. So I updated Firefox manually and applied AutoConfig and my original problem was gone. </p><p>Fast forward more weeks, there is another update for Firefox. And Firefox was still unable to automatically update. So I tried reconstructing compatibility.ini, which I did fully. But Firefox still won't update. </p><p>At this point, it's been like 3 months with a crippled user profile and I must say I'm tired of updating Firefox manually. </p><p>Is there any way I can fix this profile? If not, what exactly should I copy over so all my preferences, cookies, addons and themes get carried over to a new one? </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",alexasergiu03

I have found it too difficult to organize my current filing system ever since they stopped the drag and drop feature. I want to type in more than the first letter to find a file or folder. I want to type in a word - have those FOLDERS only come up to chose from with that word in their titles..but alas no field to do so. The Organize page is hard to find - below the options as a postscript on the ff options submenu. Once there - it doesn't bring up just folders in one box and the files that you want to organize in another box and the ability to drag them into the right folder. Instead it brings up only misc files in no particular order. I can't work with that for type of job. This is more for finding a file I think - alone. So -that's why I left so many files up. Not my normal way to do things - I would file them then close all windows down empty - or maybe just what I was working on still up. Not my question. My question is just what was in the title bar. That's all. Thanks. Oh I know the setting is there to have them open at start up or not. Question is is I say no - will they be deleted? I know you can click on ""restore prior session"" from the ff menu after history. (altho I can't see it - poss bec I  opened with prior session. )  I basically want access to SEE my prior session windows/tabs without opening them until I CLICK on them to activate them. I  want to see the TITLE of the links basically ""off-line"" and decide if I want to go there and work or not one by one - NOT to ""restore all"" or not. And if you don't restore previous session on your subsequent session - and logoff/shutdown. Is the prior session lost for your ""3rd session and forward""? does it only save the very last session? say i had 40 windows open. chose not to open them auto next session - via settings. AND i never opened them all for that subsequent session. What happens to those 40 windows the next time? Are they unsaved? Since i never opened them - say only used the new blank windowtab to check the weather. closed the link shut down. That session had no windows or tabs left open but the home page = next session should have no windows or tabs saved in the ff menu underneath the history by how it is said. There is no clarification. It's a big deal to just try it - and lose 300 tabs I need to look at and favorite through. Get me? I hope it's clear. I feel you only need the title bar but it wouldn't allow so I felt I had to elaborate.  PLS help. I have to clean up to do MS OS upgrades, backups, I have partions, gotta read up so this thing has to be fixed first. Plus auto opening/connecting to links on all those tabs at start up is interferring with updates bec they happen at the same time - badddd news.
