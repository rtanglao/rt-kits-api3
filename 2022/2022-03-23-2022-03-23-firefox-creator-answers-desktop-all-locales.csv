Yesterday I set up my my new desktop in my office and I installed FF and when I logged onto my account my FF stayed the default color. This never happened before, and as I turned and looked at my old desktop I saw that it too now had the wrong theme. So I went into my kitchen were I have my laptop set up (it just upgraded itself to win 11 and I am using it as a training tool) the FF on it was no longer appearing correctly. </p><p>I have since spent 30 some hours uninstalling/reinstalling FF/ deleting my profile, remaking my profile, re-deleting my profile and making another new profile using a different email and when I install FF on ANY OTHER pc it will not load correctly, especially themes and add ons. </p><p>What the hell is causing this and how do I fix it??  </p><p>On every PC I used my Revo Uninstaller Pro to uninstall FF including file remnants and then meticulously scrubbed repeatedly each PC for any leftover registry and file remnants, and then I used my file eraser program to wipe all the file slack. </p><p>If this is going to be an issue why have FF ? I spend enough time now keeping Edge disabled and dont want my fav primary browser to become a ""High Maintenance"" browser having to spend time EVERY TIME I TURN ON MY PC fixing this, repeatedly. Its like having to add water to your cooling system every time you start up your car before you can use it. </p><p>Any help would be enormously appreciated. </p><p>The trouble shooting information below is for the first install tonight after getting home and making the newest profile and it is seemingly staying correct, the next install on my laptop is incorrect, it has one deleted theme installed yet is ""using"" the default theme and the correct theme I picked is not even showing. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9801;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",rbrtmac

However, when I try to open the same website on two different containers, it always asks me if I want to override my initial decision. This happens with Fastmail, Etsy, and any other site where I have multiple account logins. </p><p>I have attempted to sign in to the respective accounts before assigning them to the correct containers, but that still doesn't solve the issue. </p><p>I'm including a screenshot of one example (Etsy). I told Firefox to open Etsy when I'm signed into a particular account in my ""YBV"" container. But then when I try to open Etsy again to sign into a different account which should be in my ""Press 65"" container, this is what happens. </p><p>Please advise - thank you! </p>",desktop;customize;firefox-980;firefox-9801;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",hi33

This is about as user-unfriendly a move as they could ever do, short of blowing up the computer entirely. A fix for this would be nice to have, but more to the point, why is a fix even necessary when Firefox positively states that all open tabs will be restored? </p><p>I understand that nothing human is perfect, but errors are one thing, and persistent failure to do something straightforward that is promised is another thing. What's going wrong here, and if Firefox is going to persist in this unfortunate behavior, what can be done about it? </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9801;,firefox,other,en-US,1491655;1491672;,Arvidd
