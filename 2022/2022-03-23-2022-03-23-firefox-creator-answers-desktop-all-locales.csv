This is about as user-unfriendly a move as they could ever do, short of blowing up the computer entirely. A fix for this would be nice to have, but more to the point, why is a fix even necessary when Firefox positively states that all open tabs will be restored? </p><p>I understand that nothing human is perfect, but errors are one thing, and persistent failure to do something straightforward that is promised is another thing. What's going wrong here, and if Firefox is going to persist in this unfortunate behavior, what can be done about it? </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9801;,firefox,other,en-US,1491655;,Arvidd
