Just keep resetting!  </p><p>Another issue I encounter: When I change the resolution of a video I'm watching on Youtube (from 720p to 1080p or above), it suddenly gets laggy; you can hear the audio from it but the visual itself gets laggy.  </p><p>Hope you can fix it, Thank You! </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1013;firefox-980;firefox-9801;,firefox,other,en-US,"",kenstiriadungca

This includes animated gifs, animated pngs, blinking cursors, smooth scrolling, autoscroll, zooming, parallax, slide, carousel, marquee, jitter, judder, ease in-out, etc. as well as having non-scrolling or separately-scrolling elements alongside, in front of, or behind scrolling ones. So that's most app and web design right there... </p><p>I find that opening about:config and setting layout.frame_rate 1 can help. But I have trouble typing with that setting, and if I want to watch safe video, can't do that without frame_rate 60. Intermediate rates such as 2 and 30 are too flashy. </p><p>So an easy way to toggle this setting between 1 and 60 would be very helpful. </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1014;firefox-980;firefox-9801;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",MarjaE
