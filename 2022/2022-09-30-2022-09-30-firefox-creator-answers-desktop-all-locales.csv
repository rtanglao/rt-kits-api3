Ubuntu 22.04 (all updates). Firefox 105.0.1. I am trying to create a new profile on a shared (ext4) partition that can be accessed from either boot side. I have tried over a dozen different configurations. I can create profiles anywhere on my local disk (also ext4). I cannot create a profile on the shared partition. Error msg: ""Profile couldn’t be created. Probably the chosen folder isn’t writable."" I have checked/verified permissions/directories/access/etc, checked for typos, tried using links or direct access. I tried copying a profile I created on the local disk onto the shared partition and just point to that. Notably when I choose the directory from the partition in the FF profile tool, FF switches the path to the /run/user/(...) tmpfs instead of using the actual directory as chosen. I verified access via this path as well. I even tried modifying the profiles.ini file to the ""normal"" location.   Sorry for the long explanation. I have been configuring new Linux installs since the 90's. I'm stuck.  Help?? </p>",linux;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",csheets61
