My Windows 10 suddenly crashed, so I reinstalled on a new hard drive, with the latest version of Firefox.

I tried creating a new profile and pasting the logins.json and key3.db files, as suggested by an old Firefox KB article, but that doesn't work any more. Is there any way for me to get the saved logins out of the older JSON file with the Key3 file?
