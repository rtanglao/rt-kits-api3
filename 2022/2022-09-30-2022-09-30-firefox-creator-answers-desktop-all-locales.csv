The light text on dark background feels jarring when switching to/from the majority of websites with light backgrounds. </p><p>I've tried to override the colors with the ""only with high contrast themes"" in the Firefox ""Language and Appearance"" settings. It didn't affect podbay. Setting the option to ""Always"" does work but it also affects sites with light or white backgrounds, hiding some of the formatting. </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",futurenow8

On my desktop Mac OS FF, it only shows single line of text area no matter how much text I type. My MacBook Air FF works fine (synced and therefore has the same extensions installed). Safari, Chrome, and Brave all shows it properly. It's only the desktop Mac FF that's showing this error. </p><p>I've been opening Safari whenever I need to contact support for a while, but it's very cumbersome as FF is my main browser and one that's open all the time. </p><p>Hardware acceleration is already off on both desktop and MacBook Air so that's not the issue. </p><p>I have no idea how to read the developer codes, but enabled developer tools out of curiosity in console mode. I see bunch of yellow boxes with error messages saying: </p><p>Loading failed for the &lt;script&gt; with source ""<a href=""https://data2.gosquared.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://data2.gosquared.com/</a>......."" and a long line of URL. </p><p>The same message appears to be repeating about 5 to 6 times. </p><p>What could be causing this error? </p><p>Just tried doing the same on the MacBook Air and it's showing the same yellow boxes so I'm not sure even if this is a symptom of the problem. </p><p>I'm stumped. If I must, I can use other browser for the support chat feature, but if someone could point me in the right direction to get this resolved, I'd very very grateful. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,other,en-US,"",tomcha75
