My Windows 10 suddenly crashed, so I reinstalled on a new hard drive, with the latest version of Firefox. My old Firefox, was completely up to date but still used the Key3.db file for my saved logins, and it will not work with the newest version. I tried creating a new profile and pasting the logins.json and key3.db files, as suggested by an old Firefox KB article, but that doesn't work any more. Is there any way for me to get the saved logins out of the older JSON file with the Key3 file? I desperately need help with this, and would appreciate any that someone could give. </p><p>Regards, Brian Mercer. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",brainhose

On my desktop Mac OS FF, it only shows single line of text area no matter how much text I type. My MacBook Air FF works fine (synced and therefore has the same extensions installed).
