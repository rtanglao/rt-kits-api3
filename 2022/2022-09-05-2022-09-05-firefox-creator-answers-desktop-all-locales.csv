Of course the entire reason behind google is that they wish to spy on everyone and keep as much information as possible on each and every one of us.  So one wonders where the idea that Mozilla protects your privacy comes from, as no matter what Mozilla do, Google is still looking in and indeed listening in too.  I used to love Mozilla Firefox but of late it has almost got into the same bed as Google.  We need and want a change - Give us the option at least and be transparent.  Masking is for robbers!  I'm personally sick of google and have been for several years - they couldn't beat DuckDuckGo so now they have Mozilla on their side with most things DEFAULT and without the possibility of changing that (by the looks of it).  Google is a spy and the sooner people realise that, the better, so no good looking for an answer as to how to remove it - Mozilla will not help as it seems to be stuck with it and no amount of trying this or that will solve the problem fully.  It is up to Mozilla to get out of the grasp of Google and allow customers (the public) to have a choice - so let's have it Mozilla.   By the way, I don't share anything (not even information as to how my browser works - I wouldn't be so stupid as to trust Google even for that, but can guarantee anyone they already have that information and more. </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1040;firefox-10401;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",norrellthomas8

Within the past 6 months, certain websites that used to work properly simply will not load anymore.  For example: <a href=""https://enlighten.enphaseenergy.com/web/3419721/today/graph/hours?v=3.4.0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://enlighten.enphaseenergy.com/web/3419721/today/graph/hours?v=3.4.0</a> .  I have tried refreshing, removing and restoring, creating a new, blank profile from scratch, starting in safe mode, and other browsers.  In this particular instance, Chrome, Edge, and even my old Internet Explorer work just fine, with no alterations or modifications, as well as with my current extensions (Roboform).  So does an old version of Firefox (76.0.1).  However, current versions of Firefox simply show ""Connecting to Gateway"", and then time out.  I have even set Firefox to refresh the page on EACH access, to no avail... </p><p>The ONLY thing that works with the new versions of Firefox is to delete the Cache, and on the next load of Firefox, these and other sites will work.  However, returning to the site a second time results in the same error.  This makes no sense to me, since forcing Firefox to reload the page on entry, in my mind, should be the same as clearing the cache for the offending page.  I have no idea whether the problem is with the website coding, or with the Firefox coding.  In this particular case, the Enlighten website states that recent versions of Firefox ARE supported, along with Edge and Chrome.  But the fact is, only Edge and Chrome work flawlessly with no issues. </p><p>I am open to any and all suggestions, because I have been working with the same errors across several websites, and Firefox is the only browser that has problems with the site. </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1040;firefox-10401;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",twiggers

Now I just downloaded it because I need it for my studies.  </p><p>Now I have a really big issue. Since I installed it over a week before, I had to set my bookmarks, privacy settings and other things and my passwords for several times now. Now I'm a little bit upset, I hope you can understand that, it's nothing personal, but I don't want to waste my time for that. I never had a browser with such a bad user data management. My data got deleted several times. Today it happened again and after I noticed it I closed firefox and after reopening I got a message (it was the first one) that I have to install an update. I confirmed the message and updated it. Everything was lost again. I'm a little bit angry now. I had to google it and wasted even more time on that topic. Now I found out that firefox is setting up different user profiles after each update. As I described, I only had one update message to confirm until now. The ff-help guide suggested, I should look it up in the profile settings and I did. Now there are 8!!! different user profiles. There is no date displayed when the user profiles where created, so it took even more time to look every single profile up, to explore if anyone of them contains my user data, but not a single one did. Now I have to waste even more time again, to write you this issue and possibly wait days for an answer. You can image how happy I am right now. I'm not. Now I got several questions and I please you to answer any single one: </p><p>1. Why is a new user profile going to get created when I install an update? 2. Why is ff the only browser who creates user profiles automaticly without my permission? 3. What advantage do I take as a user from that? 4. Are you going to fix it or is this the ultimate future solution for firefox now? Then I definetly have to search another solution and to use another browser. This is really annoying, can you understand that? </p><p>Thank you alot for you help and understanding. </p><p>Best Regards Marvin </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-910;mac-os-x-1015;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1531727;,marvelous922
