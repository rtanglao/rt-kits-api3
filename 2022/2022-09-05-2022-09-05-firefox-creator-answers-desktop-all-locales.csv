Now I just downloaded it because I need it for my studies.  </p><p>Now I have a really big issue. Since I installed it over a week before, I had to set my bookmarks, privacy settings and other things and my passwords for several times now. Now I'm a little bit upset, I hope you can understand that, it's nothing personal, but I don't want to waste my time for that. I never had a browser with such a bad user data management. My data got deleted several times. Today it happened again and after I noticed it I closed firefox and after reopening I got a message (it was the first one) that I have to install an update. I confirmed the message and updated it. Everything was lost again. I'm a little bit angry now. I had to google it and wasted even more time on that topic. Now I found out that firefox is setting up different user profiles after each update. As I described, I only had one update message to confirm until now. The ff-help guide suggested, I should look it up in the profile settings and I did. Now there are 8!!! different user profiles. There is no date displayed when the user profiles where created, so it took even more time to look every single profile up, to explore if anyone of them contains my user data, but not a single one did. Now I have to waste even more time again, to write you this issue and possibly wait days for an answer. You can image how happy I am right now. I'm not. Now I got several questions and I please you to answer any single one: </p><p>1. Why is a new user profile going to get created when I install an update? 2. Why is ff the only browser who creates user profiles automaticly without my permission? 3. What advantage do I take as a user from that? 4. Are you going to fix it or is this the ultimate future solution for firefox now? Then I definetly have to search another solution and to use another browser. This is really annoying, can you understand that? </p><p>Thank you alot for you help and understanding. </p><p>Best Regards Marvin </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-910;mac-os-x-1015;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1531727;,marvelous922
