My monitor was cracked so bought a new monitor. Now web pages don't load properly. If on a message board or looking at emails, lines separating each post or email are missing. This happens throughout the web. separating lines, boxes are missing. It's like 90% of the page loads and then some parts don't. I've tried all the troubleshooting answers from Mozilla. Nothing works. Never had this issue for years of using Firefox. All of a sudden, web pages all look different. It can't be the monitor because the computer tells the monitor what to display. So something must have changed when I reinstalled Firefox.  I've added a picture below of how the Ticketmaster page loads. It would always show each individual seat. Now most of the empty seats have disappeared along with the line separating each row. Makes it almost impossible to decipher the webpage. The blue dots are seats still for sale. The empty rows should also have dots representing each and every seat, but now only about 50% of the seats actually display. Anyone have any ideas on what is going wrong? Driving me absolutely crazy. Ruined my ability to surf the web. Every page is missing something. Usually separating lines.

No leading or trailing space is selected. When I press Ctrl-c, then Ctrl-v in another page, the word is pasted with leading and trailing space. However, for some other word e.g. the label for a field, I will need to drag the mouse across the entire word to select it and there is no leading/trailing space when I paste it into another page. Is it possible to eliminate the leading and trailing space when pasting a word? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,other,en-US,1513621;,john_kho
