I got into the habit of the URL box on the right, SEARCH box on the left. Somehow they switched positions. Its been a long time since I had custom the bar at the top.  I tried to search how to customize it as I always customized on new release.  Now I can not find the CMD or current instruction of where to find it.  [that is because the internet has lots of instructions from old releases]. I KNOW THERE IA WAY to  ove icons, customize the Tool Bar but I  can find under the current release. Anyone?  </p><p>I </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",jagman55

I don't know how they got changed but they are too big now. If I try change font size and style in settings nothing happens. It is not how it looked on first install and using another browser has font sizes of a more practical size. I have tried uninstalling/reinstalling Firebox and also doing a refresh and it doesn't change anything. </p><p>Its almost like a bug that has made Firefox set these fonts larger than they should and not able to modifying them again. </p><p>I cannot for the life of me work out how to fix this and its very off putting to the point, short of a full OS reinstall I'll have to start using another browser. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,customize,en-US,1513593;1513594;1513597;,mowensworld

For instance when I order online from <a href=""http://Subway.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Subway.com</a> and get to the payment page, Firefox blocks it.   Today, I tried to go to the KellyBlueBook page at <a href=""http://www.kbb.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.kbb.com</a>   and was blocked -- even though I've accessed both of those pages and sites in the recent weeks without trouble.   My Edge browser has no such issues.  I've uploaded a screen shot. </p><p>I'm about to just switch browsers all together.  I've looked all the other postings and none of those fixes works at all.   It's random and annoying. Windows 11 </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,other,en-US,"",lcspecific

This has been happening since November 2021.  </p><p>When that happens I close the FF and then immediately open it. Now the google sites work properly. </p><p>Never had that problem with other sites.....never! </p><p>Why the hell is this happening? Is FF responsible or Google? </p><p>So what is the solution? </p>",desktop;windows-10;firefox-1010;website-breakages;firefox-10101;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",RajeshPat
