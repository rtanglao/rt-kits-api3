No leading or trailing space is selected. When I press Ctrl-c, then Ctrl-v in another page, the word is pasted with leading and trailing space. However, for some other word e.g. the label for a field, I will need to drag the mouse across the entire word to select it and there is no leading/trailing space when I paste it into another page. Is it possible to eliminate the leading and trailing space when pasting a word? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,other,en-US,1513621;,john_kho

Tonight we tried to access our history and all of a sudden it goes no further back than this month.  How did this happen, and how can we get the older history back? </p><p>We have been researching this for several hours tonight and have already tried many of the suggestions such as viewing the places.sqlite file--which we did, but which also only showed history going to the beginning of June--trying to view the index.dat file--which came up empty using the index.dat analyzer reader--and trying to read a JSON file that is called ""session store backups."" </p><p>OS Windows 10 </p><p>We know our way around a computer, more or less, but are not programmers or coders. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,other,en-US,1513622;,sarika7175

Everything works fine once I've uninstalled the latest update so the problem is clearly theirs. I can't be the only person experiencing this problem but contacting Microsoft is next to impossible. I wonder if you can: 1) alert them to this issue; and 2) pressure them to fix it as constantly uninstalling the updates is a pain! </p>,desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1513624;,sjarmain

I don't know how they got changed but they are too big now. If I try change font size and style in settings nothing happens. It is not how it looked on first install and using another browser has font sizes of a more practical size. I have tried uninstalling/reinstalling Firebox and also doing a refresh and it doesn't change anything. </p><p>Its almost like a bug that has made Firefox set these fonts larger than they should and not able to modifying them again. </p><p>I cannot for the life of me work out how to fix this and its very off putting to the point, short of a full OS reinstall I'll have to start using another browser. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,customize,en-US,1513593;1513594;1513597;1513600;,mowensworld
