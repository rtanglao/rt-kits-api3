I'm totally at a loss and anxious as hell!,"<p>Something was wrong with my computer tonight when I turned it on.  One of your FIREFOX pages came up and suggested that I ""upgrade,"" I guess. Anyway, several iterations later and I was back online.  I noticed, though, that several ICONS that I had before were missing now.  Worse than that, I went to my ""Files"" and ""Downloads"" and they have all apparently disappeared. </p><p>I am not terribly Computer Savvy and so there may be some solution that I just don't know about.

For example, anyone searches <a href=""https://sublimationhome.com/best-sublimation-printer/"" rel=""nofollow"">best sublimation printer</a>, my website should be on top. I can handle the SEO part but before that, I need to make sure that my website is compatible to show in this browser as well. </p><p>So the question is that is there any panel/dashboard or any backend for the creators in Mozilla? </p><p>Looking forward to the answers that can help.

Pages are taking forever to populate, some pages on the same site do NOT show ""add to cart"" but when I tried it on Chrome it worked.  This issue is increasing where pages work on Chrome only.  I am really frustrated I have to jump hoops just to get something done.  I do NOT want to use Chrome. </p><p>I did a FF update 2 days ago and this is where the extreme slowness and inconsistent issues started getting bad.  I want to UNINSTALL my last update: Version 97.0.2 (64-bit).  I'm on Windows 10 which is up-to-date.  If I have to unstall FF constantly to fix issues, then I'll remove it completely and find another browser.  I can't stand the fact it loads browser extensions I can NOT remove that I do NOT use and taking up precious space, every little bit helps... </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1488016;,jj
