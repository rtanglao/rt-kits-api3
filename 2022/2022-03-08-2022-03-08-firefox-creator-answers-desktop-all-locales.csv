After <a href=""https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/networking/http/logging.html#start-logging-using-command-line-arguments"" rel=""nofollow"">enabling logging</a> I finally found the culprit: ""TRRService::GetParentalControlEnabledInternal=1"". Luckily I can disable this by setting the network.dns.skipTRR-when-parental-control-enabled to false. </p><p>I am an adult who manages my own personal computer. As far as I am aware, I have not enabled parental controls in Windows. The only thing I can think of that might affect this is ""Let apps use advertising ID to make ads more interesting to you based on your app activity"" in Settings -&gt; Privacy -&gt; General, which I have turned off. </p><p>To avoid digging through the code trying to figure out why Firefox thinks my computer/user has parental controls enabled, I figured I would ask here. I got this far before realizing I was in way over my head: <a href=""https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/923f64ad8d51a0ba1540c400bb6ee63cbe1233c4/netwerk/dns/TRRService.cpp#l183"" rel=""nofollow"">line 183 of netwerk/dns/TRRService.cpp</a> and <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/DNS_Over_HTTPS/Heuristics#Parental_Controls_Service"" rel=""nofollow"">some resources about the ""Parental Controls Service""</a>. </p><p>(A note about DNS-over-HTTPS: TRR was consistently disabled until I changed network.dns.skipTRR-when-parental-control-enabled to false. TRR was reported as disabled by about:networking#dns and <a href=""https://1.1.1.1/help"" rel=""nofollow"">https://1.1.1.1/help</a>) </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",tertsoya

I'm totally at a loss and anxious as hell!,"<p>Something was wrong with my computer tonight when I turned it on.  One of your FIREFOX pages came up and suggested that I ""upgrade,"" I guess.

Worse than that, I went to my ""Files"" and ""Downloads"" and they have all apparently disappeared. </p><p>I am not terribly Computer Savvy and so there may be some solution that I just don't know about.
