In fact, the only issue I've ever had with it is one website in particular not loading. Unfortunately, that website is the site that I use to check my schedule for work, so it not working is kind of a big deal to me. On occasion, it simply will not load. Frankly, that is not a big deal. I can always check back later, when it might work. However, on Firefox, even when the site does load, certain elements do not load. For example, there is a built in tool that includes company updates, scheduling info, et cetera. While it consistently loads perfectly in Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome, it appears only as a white box in Firefox that occupies the same space but cannot be interacted with. I have tried easing up privacy settings for that website to no avail. I looked to see if there was a javascript option I could toggle, but I could not find it and I am not sure that is the issue anyway. The site is <a href=""http://feed.kroger.com"" rel=""nofollow"">feed.kroger.com</a>, although the authentication page occupies a different URL. Other Kroger family websites have worked without trouble; this is the only one that acts buggy. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",jakerobbins560
