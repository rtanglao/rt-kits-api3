I've had this problem on 98, 99 and now 99.0.1 </p><p>Whenever I am on youtube and click on a video, the video will play just fine. However, if I open a video in a new tab or I open a video from something like reddit or discord into a new tab, I get ""a playback error occurred. Please try again later. I can recreate the problem very easily. For example, I just went to the homepage and clicked on a random video.  </p><p>It played just fine, but if I open a video from the suggested videos into a new tab, I get the error. If I click on the same video in the original tab, it plays just fine. Only if I open it in a new tab does it get angry. </p><p>Now the interesting thing is, this happens randomly. it does not happen with all videos. If I didn't already watch a video on youtube and open a video from discord or reddit etc, the video is hit or miss whether it will work or not. </p><p>Restarting Firefox doesn't help as I can recreate the problem and the problem also occurs in Firefox Safe mode. I don't remember having this problem before version 98. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",brokendreamsave
1374118,2022-04-12 20:59:52 -0700,2022-04-12 20:59:52 -0700,(Some) pages of several news outlets are not displayed properly,"<p>Since a short while Firefox seems to stop displaying certain pages on news outlets like e.g. BBC, CNN or FAZ (German newspaper). When the link is clicked the page is displayed first for a short moment then the screen turns blank. On a refresh the page is shown again for a moment only to disappear again. It does not pertain to all pages on the sites, only to specific ones. Odd is too that sometimes third party adds are shown but not the main content of the page itself.  It is also noteworthy that this is only happening with news related websites others seem to work normal. This is relatively new. I cannot pin it exactly on a certain time but just about less than 4 weeks ago that problem was not there. Could the issue be related to a recent Firefox update? Do I need to change something in the settings? I would be thankful for feedback. Thank you. JM </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,other,en-US,"",vp2

In fact, the only issue I've ever had with it is one website in particular not loading. Unfortunately, that website is the site that I use to check my schedule for work, so it not working is kind of a big deal to me. On occasion, it simply will not load. Frankly, that is not a big deal. I can always check back later, when it might work. However, on Firefox, even when the site does load, certain elements do not load. For example, there is a built in tool that includes company updates, scheduling info, et cetera. While it consistently loads perfectly in Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome, it appears only as a white box in Firefox that occupies the same space but cannot be interacted with. I have tried easing up privacy settings for that website to no avail. I looked to see if there was a javascript option I could toggle, but I could not find it and I am not sure that is the issue anyway. The site is <a href=""http://feed.kroger.com"" rel=""nofollow"">feed.kroger.com</a>, although the authentication page occupies a different URL. Other Kroger family websites have worked without trouble; this is the only one that acts buggy. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,websites,en-US,1497037;,jakerobbins560
