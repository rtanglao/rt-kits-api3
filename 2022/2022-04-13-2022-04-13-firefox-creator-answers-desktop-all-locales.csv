Apart from other things, like certificate and site loading issues, often, when we reduce the browser and reopen it all except the home tab disappear. And restore session is always greyed. Yes, we have searched for solutions and tried myriad fixes - none work. We have been forced to defile our macs with chrome.

In fact, the only issue I've ever had with it is one website in particular not loading. Unfortunately, that website is the site that I use to check my schedule for work, so it not working is kind of a big deal to me. On occasion, it simply will not load. Frankly, that is not a big deal. I can always check back later, when it might work. However, on Firefox, even when the site does load, certain elements do not load. For example, there is a built in tool that includes company updates, scheduling info, et cetera. While it consistently loads perfectly in Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome, it appears only as a white box in Firefox that occupies the same space but cannot be interacted with. I have tried easing up privacy settings for that website to no avail. I looked to see if there was a javascript option I could toggle, but I could not find it and I am not sure that is the issue anyway. The site is <a href=""http://feed.kroger.com"" rel=""nofollow"">feed.kroger.com</a>, although the authentication page occupies a different URL. Other Kroger family websites have worked without trouble; this is the only one that acts buggy. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,websites,en-US,1497037;,jakerobbins560
