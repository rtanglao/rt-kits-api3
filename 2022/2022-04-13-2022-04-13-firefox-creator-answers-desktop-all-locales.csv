However, in the last 2 months, I (and others I know) are facing multiple problems with Firefox. After one of the updates in late Feb or early Mar, Firefox stops loading new pages (it still opens a tab but does not load the page). I thought maybe it is an issue with memory, however, any other browser works fine at that time. I have never faced this issue and every time I have used my laptop for an extended time this issue pops up. I would ask if this can be resolved in an upcoming update as it is impacting the user experience with the browser and it is not always possible to turn off the laptop just to fix a browser issue. In these cases, I end up using another browser (which is becoming more common). I have started hearing from some of my friends that they have already started using Chrome (WTF) instead as this issue is bothering them a lot. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>Best Varun </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-990;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",vinnys1

In fact, the only issue I've ever had with it is one website in particular not loading. Unfortunately, that website is the site that I use to check my schedule for work, so it not working is kind of a big deal to me. On occasion, it simply will not load. Frankly, that is not a big deal. I can always check back later, when it might work. However, on Firefox, even when the site does load, certain elements do not load. For example, there is a built in tool that includes company updates, scheduling info, et cetera. While it consistently loads perfectly in Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome, it appears only as a white box in Firefox that occupies the same space but cannot be interacted with. I have tried easing up privacy settings for that website to no avail. I looked to see if there was a javascript option I could toggle, but I could not find it and I am not sure that is the issue anyway. The site is <a href=""http://feed.kroger.com"" rel=""nofollow"">feed.kroger.com</a>, although the authentication page occupies a different URL. Other Kroger family websites have worked without trouble; this is the only one that acts buggy. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,websites,en-US,1497037;,jakerobbins560
