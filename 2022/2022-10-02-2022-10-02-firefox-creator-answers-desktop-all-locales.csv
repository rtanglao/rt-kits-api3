It's not as good at the app, I'll admit, but there's no intrusive ads trying to sell me crap, so I'm willing to deal with the downsides.  </p><p>The problem is that audio from YouTube in the Firefox app on Android continues to play if it was playing when I locked the screen, or if I was playing audio in my car and the app was never exited (so to speak) before I locked the screen, audio will either keep playing in the former case, or it will start playing as soon as the bluetooth connects to my car again once I get back in and turn it on. </p><p>How do I STOP this from happening? There's no settings within the app or my phone (that I can find) that will help with this. I don't know if it's a Firefox issue or an issue with my phone, but the audio thing doesn't happen with ANY other app I have. Only Firefox, and it's driving me crazy. I don't know how to keep it from doing so without the added step of making sure I close the app before I lock the screen, but I don't always remember to do so, and that's the problem. Please help me, because I'm almost about to give up on this app, too. </p><p>If it's relevant and it'll help, I have a Samsung Galaxy S22+. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,other,en-US,"",skye.allen1296
