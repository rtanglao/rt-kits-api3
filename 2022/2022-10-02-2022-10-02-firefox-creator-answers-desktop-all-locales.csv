Firefox became noticeably slower about 4 to 6 weeks ago.  There were problems with YAHOO! Mail, for example.  It was particularly noticeable when I would be watching one YouTube video and then would click on the image/icon of a different video, trying to change to &amp; open the new video.  E.g., NBC or CBS videos, like ""Jimmy Kimmel"" shows, etc.  A couple of days ago, I opened Windows 10(TM) Task Manager, and used ""End Task"" to shut off Dropbox instances.  I then uninstalled Dropbox.  I did that to prevent Dropbox from running in the background [and I don't need it, anyway].  That seemed to help. I have also switched to Firefox ""Troubleshoot Mode"" -- that seemed to help, somewhat, but not necessarily in every case. </p><pre> Yesterday, there were problems opening MyADP (to view salary pay stubs) with Firefox [in regular mode].  The application just seemed to be ""stuck"" while trying to open the view to payment listing.  So, this morning, I ran MS-Edge(TM), and MyADP opened properly and operated with no problems.    Is it possible that some MS-Windows 10(R) update is causing problems with Firefox? </pre> <p>Moments ago, I opened YAHOO! mail in a separate, new tab, and logged-in quickly, without a problem.  I'm happy about that. </p><pre>  I just opened another tab, easily started the video.  However, clicking on a different video's icon -- the result is that the YouTube red line only moves left to right about 2/3 of the way across the screen, and the newly-selected video does not load.  Clicking repeatedly on the different video's icon seems to ""clog"" YouTube to the point that the message, ""Connect to the internet.  You are offline.  Retry"", appears. </pre> <p>So, I'm a bit puzzled.   What do you suggest, please? </p><pre>  Thank You in Advance,  </pre> <p>Dave </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",DaveRheoSkier

There's no settings within the app or my phone (that I can find) that will help with this. I don't know if it's a Firefox issue or an issue with my phone, but the audio thing doesn't happen with ANY other app I have. Only Firefox, and it's driving me crazy. I don't know how to keep it from doing so without the added step of making sure I close the app before I lock the screen, but I don't always remember to do so, and that's the problem. Please help me, because I'm almost about to give up on this app, too. </p><p>If it's relevant and it'll help, I have a Samsung Galaxy S22+. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,other,en-US,"",skye.allen1296
