Its a bit inconvenient because anytime it pops up, it basically tabs me off a page and interrupts my writing or the like. This wasn't an issue last year when after successful downloads, the downloads icon in the toolbar just lights up blue to signify a successful download. The preview panel popping up every time Firefox successfully downloads something (due to reasons, I download files in bulk from multiple sources) is incredibly irritating. The problem goes away when I just remove the download icon/panel from the toolbar entirely. I just wanna know WHY this bizarre phenomenon happens. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1000;,firefox,customize,en-US,1505071;,HazamaTerumi
