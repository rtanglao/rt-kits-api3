On <a href=""http://dictionary.com"" rel=""nofollow"">dictionary.com</a> when I type in a word in the search bar and press enter, it works fine, but when I am on a definition page on <a href=""http://dictionary.com"" rel=""nofollow"">dictionary.com</a> (not the homepage) and I type a word in the search bar and press enter, it does not work. The page does not respond. </p><p>Also when I am on <a href=""http://biblehub.com"" rel=""nofollow"">biblehub.com</a> and I type in a reference (like Genesis 1:1) in the search bar at the top and press enter, I get directed to a blank page: <a href=""https://biblemenus.com/topmain/send.php?q=undefined"" rel=""nofollow"">https://biblemenus.com/topmain/send.php?q=undefined</a>  </p><p>In the search bar at the top of <a href=""http://biblehub.com"" rel=""nofollow"">biblehub.com</a> I must click the magnifying glass icon in order for it to work, which is annoying.  </p><p>Note that a while ago (I don´t know how long ago) these things used to work correctly. I don´t know whether a Firefox update caused the problem or whether it was a change to the coding on the webpages. I am on the latest version of Firefox. Neither of these problems happen on Chrome.  </p><p>Let me know what can be done to fix it. Thank you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1000;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jjbradbury
