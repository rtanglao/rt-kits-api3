When I view this map in Firefox on Android or Windows 11, the icons show up correctly. For instance in the example map, next to Lincoln. In Android/Windows the icon shows a small castle in a drop pin while here in a Linux desktop it just shows a cross hatched box. The link to the web page still works. The roads in the Android/Windows versions correctly show A1, A46 etc. But here in Linux, you can just make out the road numbers behind the vertical hatching. Over a long period I have seen this has occur on a number of sites but I think that the maps are probably (cannot prove it) Mapbox/OpenStreetMap. But when I look at OpenStreeMap it self, the Road Numbers are fine and when I add a layer involving tags, they show as normal. </p><p>I know I could address this inquiry HHA but they will simply say 'they do not support Linux'.  The site works in other environments so why not Linux? Also, as I have said, it has occurred on other sites in the past (though I must admit I cannot remember which ones and when - I tried a few while writing this support request) Is it likely that the web pages are being downloaded with a catalogue of Icons but this fails in the Linux version of Firefox? Would this account for the road numbers being corrupted as well? </p><p>The PC is running a fairly new (last 10 days) installation of Linux Manjaro with Mate desktop. However, this has been happening for some time (a couple of years) during which time, I have used Linux Mint, Debian and Manjaro, with Mate and Gnome desktops.  Firefox is used as provided by Linux Manjaro, including Noscript and Adblocker - I have tried viewing this page with both disabled. The only changes I have made to Firefox settings is to enable 'when you open a link .... switch to it immediately', 'search for text when you start typing' and set 'browser.tabs.closeWindowWithLastTab' to false.  </p><p>I have put up with the problem because it only affects me, however I am about to load Linux Manjaro on to computers for other less computer literate/tolerant people who will be using similar maps. It would help them if I could get a fix. </p><p>Thanks for your time </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",clod.turner+ffdt

I have a Macbook Pro (2012) with MacOS 12.4. The old MacBook Pro is not supported by Apple. </p><p>Since the update a few days ago, Firefox won't play all videos (for example <a href=""http://vimeo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">vimeo.com</a>, <a href=""http://youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com</a> (not always)). Some videos will be played. </p><p>I tried it with deleted cache and website data, with no luck. I tried it with disabled hardware acceleration also with no luck. It also won't work with a new und empty profile (without any extensions). </p><p>The sides are loading the video but the playback won't start. Sometimes I get a spinning loading wheel. I suspect the advertising before the videos. Or it is a problem with graphic-libraries from macos, that do not work propper with my MacBook Pro. </p><p>With other browser (Chrome, Safari etc.) all videos will be played. </p><p>I now, it was my decision to switch to an unsupported OS on my old computer, but everything works (except for Firefox) and I get two more years security updates. I don't want to switch to another browser. :-( </p><p>Best regards Kay </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1010;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",kay.patzwald

With single profile at time I can play multiple  videos at once and have multiple large images and other stuff open on tabs that put load on system and nothing happens. Even opening multiple windows within same profile with Ctrl + N doesn't cause any problems. But as soon as I load 2 profiles at the same time I get this problem.

For years now, I have always used Gmail and its integrated chat function on a daily basis through Firefox. I upgraded to their new chat a while ago with no problems until yesterday. </p><p>Starting yesterday, Gmail started getting a bit choppy with me in Firefox on my home connection. Google chat, if it loads at all, will very quickly tell me that it is unable to connect to individual conversations. Indeed, the windows for those conversations will not even load. This is the same regardless of whether I try to load chat through the main Gmail window or if I try to load chat directly at <a href=""http://chat.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">chat.google.com</a>. The site works fine when I test it through Chrome. I have tried clearing cookies and refreshing the site data. It does not seem to matter if I am in incognito mode, so I don't think this is an extension problem. I've added exceptions for my antivirus, so I don't think it's that either. </p><p>The REALLY odd thing, however, is that the problem apparently seems to appear only when I am using Firefox and I have my computer connected to my router over ethernet. Firefox loads chat fine when my computer is just on wi-fi (and, again, seems to be fine regardless of whether I'm on ethernet or wi-fi when it comes to Chrome). </p><p>I'm not quite sure what to make of this. Other websites seem to be loading in Firefox as normal, regardless of whether I'm on ethernet or wi-fi. Perhaps the only other notable connection problem is that I have had problems with buffering on Spotify that has cropped up at roughly the same time (this one happens on both Chrome and Firefox). </p><p>It may well be that my ethernet cable got damaged somehow overnight, but given the fact that other websites have been fine and that I load Gchat fine when using Chrome, I figured I'd ask here to see if there is something I can check on the software side of things because given the setup up in my apartment, restringing a new ethernet cable would be a bit of a hassle. I'm happy to provide any additional information or logs that I can, but I only consider myself an educated layperson when it comes to computers, so I'm not sure what to attach that could be helpful.  </p><p>Thank you in advance! </p>",desktop;windows-11;firefox-1010;website-breakages;firefox-10101;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1514770;,webspaceships
