When I run firefox normally then everything works fine. When I start another firefox with firefox -P and then selec another profile for another instance then my monitors start to flash black. When I close the other instance then it goes away again. </p><p>I tried to update my Intel UHD 630 graphics driver from device manager but it already says I have latest driver. </p><p>When I ignore that flashing for too long time I will eventually get BSOD. The driver that causes BSOD seems to be igdkmd64.sys. </p><p>What is interesting is that it only happens when I run multiple profiles of FF and once with -P option. With single profile at time I can play multiple  videos at once and have multiple large images and other stuff open on tabs that put load on system and nothing happens. Even opening multiple windows within same profile with Ctrl + N doesn't cause any problems. But as soon as I load 2 profiles at the same time I get this problem. Any ideas? </p>,desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",wybqogzigoxruxdhnp

I have searched long and short where this would be hidden at in the settings and I can't find it. Anything I search for just gives me basic troubleshooting for autocomplete in the search bar. </p><p>First, Firefox has 2 twitter logins successfully stored in the password vault. When I go to Twitter the only suggestion for the login is ""tulsa"" and I have no idea where it's getting this. It will not auto fill in either of the 2 stored emails, not even if you begin typing them. I have to type them in manually and then when I submit it, the password is automatically typed into the next page.  </p><p>Highlighting ""tulsa"" and not clicking or hitting enter and using the delete key does nothing.  </p><p><strong>This is really, really driving me nuts.

Por mi parte estoy conforme en ""perder"" la información de las claves individuales...  He intentado utilizar la solución aportada en el artículo ""Restablece tu contraseña maestra si la has olvidado"", es decir, ejecutar ""chrome://pippki/content/resetpassword.xul"", sin ningún resultado. Tal vez lo hago mal, o falta  algún parámetro... pero no me da respuesta. Intenté ver algún rsultado desinstalando Firefox... t volviendo a instalarlo... pero muy astutamente, no sé si es mérito de Mozilla o de Windows, la máquina ""recordaba"" la existencia de la versión anterior deinstalada. Así que, la nueva instalación se ha realizado con el mismo inconveniente de la anterior. Estoy pensando que si vuelvo a desinstalar, t después le paso el CCCleaner, o similar, tal vez se borraría la información ""resistente""... y después podría instalar de nuevo la versión sin los ficheros malditos de la anterior.

For years now, I have always used Gmail and its integrated chat function on a daily basis through Firefox. I upgraded to their new chat a while ago with no problems until yesterday. </p><p>Starting yesterday, Gmail started getting a bit choppy with me in Firefox on my home connection. Google chat, if it loads at all, will very quickly tell me that it is unable to connect to individual conversations. Indeed, the windows for those conversations will not even load. This is the same regardless of whether I try to load chat through the main Gmail window or if I try to load chat directly at <a href=""http://chat.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">chat.google.com</a>. The site works fine when I test it through Chrome. I have tried clearing cookies and refreshing the site data. It does not seem to matter if I am in incognito mode, so I don't think this is an extension problem. I've added exceptions for my antivirus, so I don't think it's that either. </p><p>The REALLY odd thing, however, is that the problem apparently seems to appear only when I am using Firefox and I have my computer connected to my router over ethernet. Firefox loads chat fine when my computer is just on wi-fi (and, again, seems to be fine regardless of whether I'm on ethernet or wi-fi when it comes to Chrome). </p><p>I'm not quite sure what to make of this. Other websites seem to be loading in Firefox as normal, regardless of whether I'm on ethernet or wi-fi. Perhaps the only other notable connection problem is that I have had problems with buffering on Spotify that has cropped up at roughly the same time (this one happens on both Chrome and Firefox). </p><p>It may well be that my ethernet cable got damaged somehow overnight, but given the fact that other websites have been fine and that I load Gchat fine when using Chrome, I figured I'd ask here to see if there is something I can check on the software side of things because given the setup up in my apartment, restringing a new ethernet cable would be a bit of a hassle. I'm happy to provide any additional information or logs that I can, but I only consider myself an educated layperson when it comes to computers, so I'm not sure what to attach that could be helpful.  </p><p>Thank you in advance! </p>",desktop;windows-11;firefox-1010;website-breakages;firefox-10101;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1514770;,webspaceships
