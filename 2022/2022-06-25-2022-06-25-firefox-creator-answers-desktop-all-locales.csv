On my Windows install, every time I boot Windows, I have to toggle off ""Recommended by Pocket"" on the new tab page. It does not stay toggled off on its own when I next boot Windows.

Once having signed in and selected a table the next screen is comprised of two parts;  the interactive gaming table on top , with commentary and other info below.   I have used Firefox exclusively and this poker site for several years.  Suddenly, I assume after a recent Firefox update,  Firefox is displaying only the bottom portion.  Suspecting perhaps the site software, or a problem with my system I installed Edge and Chrome to investigate.  Both rendered the screen correctly. Any thoughts? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1514756;,ben555
