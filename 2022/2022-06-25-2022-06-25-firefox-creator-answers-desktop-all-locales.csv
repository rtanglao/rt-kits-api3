For years now, I have always used Gmail and its integrated chat function on a daily basis through Firefox. I upgraded to their new chat a while ago with no problems until yesterday. </p><p>Starting yesterday, Gmail started getting a bit choppy with me in Firefox on my home connection. Google chat, if it loads at all, will very quickly tell me that it is unable to connect to individual conversations. Indeed, the windows for those conversations will not even load. This is the same regardless of whether I try to load chat through the main Gmail window or if I try to load chat directly at <a href=""http://chat.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">chat.google.com</a>. The site works fine when I test it through Chrome. I have tried clearing cookies and refreshing the site data. It does not seem to matter if I am in incognito mode, so I don't think this is an extension problem. I've added exceptions for my antivirus, so I don't think it's that either. </p><p>The REALLY odd thing, however, is that the problem apparently seems to appear only when I am using Firefox and I have my computer connected to my router over ethernet. Firefox loads chat fine when my computer is just on wi-fi (and, again, seems to be fine regardless of whether I'm on ethernet or wi-fi when it comes to Chrome). </p><p>I'm not quite sure what to make of this. Other websites seem to be loading in Firefox as normal, regardless of whether I'm on ethernet or wi-fi. Perhaps the only other notable connection problem is that I have had problems with buffering on Spotify that has cropped up at roughly the same time (this one happens on both Chrome and Firefox). </p><p>It may well be that my ethernet cable got damaged somehow overnight, but given the fact that other websites have been fine and that I load Gchat fine when using Chrome, I figured I'd ask here to see if there is something I can check on the software side of things because given the setup up in my apartment, restringing a new ethernet cable would be a bit of a hassle. I'm happy to provide any additional information or logs that I can, but I only consider myself an educated layperson when it comes to computers, so I'm not sure what to attach that could be helpful.  </p><p>Thank you in advance! </p>",desktop;windows-11;firefox-1010;website-breakages;firefox-10101;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",webspaceships

Firefox 101.0.1 (64-bit).

Alternately I'm concerned that the change queue might exceed some size and cause sync to generally fail across my devices. My tablet got ""stuck in the past"" once and couldn't send or receive new bookmarks despite Sync seemingly working and connected, so I'm worried that perhaps that's what happened already. </p><p>On the other hand, if I were to remove that device from Sync, what happens if I were to add it back to Sync? </p><p>...If I deleted its bookmarks during or after disconnecting it? I feel like this might cause the bookmarks on my other devices to get deleted too. </p><p>...If I don't delete its bookmarks? I feel like this might cause any bookmarks I deleted in the interim to reappear. </p><p>Also, is there a maximum size to Sync? I have several thousand bookmarks. </p>",linux;desktop;sync;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",CallMeSteve
