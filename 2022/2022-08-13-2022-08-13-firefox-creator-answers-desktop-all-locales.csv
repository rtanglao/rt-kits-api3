With the update, the user surface was changed completely. I have tried everything possible to change back to the earlier surface without success.  I have tried to change to an earlier version. The user surface was fine, but my profile was lost! If not possible to change back to the earlier user surface, I would have to switch to a different browser after almost 20 years of using Firefox! Thank you for your assistance, Johann </p>",desktop;beta;customize;windows-10;firefox-1040;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",js35
