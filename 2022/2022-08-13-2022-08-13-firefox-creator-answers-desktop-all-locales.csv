I notice on several forums that this has been like this for the last 2 months, are the team at Mozilla working on a fix, cheers </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Tezzajg

Download stops after roughly 30 seconds and cuts the file,"<p>Hello, </p><p>I am trying to download a 5GB .zip file from a website. Inside the .zip file is a single .netCDF file. When I download the file and open it, both windows explorer and 7zip say there is a problem with the file: ""Unexpected end of data"". I have downloaded this file multiple times and the file size is different every time. The largest proportion I have managed to download is 1.7GB. I have noticed that the file size I end up with is proportional to the download speed during the download (usually between 20 to 40 Mbps). </p><p>I have also noticed that the download never lasts longer than ~30 seconds, which is why I think it could be a Firefox issue. Is there some way I can remove this 30 second cap? The download speed is limited by the host website so I am afraid there is not much I can do in that regard. </p><p>Any help would be much appreciated :) </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",arturmbnunes

I see from wading through help pages that this has been an issue before. It's been happening for a couple of weeks now-ish, each time I click a link it opens it on the tab I'm already on (say my emails page) rather than a new tab, so then I can't refer back to my email tab for reference or to copy tracking numbers etc. I've tried in safe mode and no change. I know I can right-click&gt;T, and that works okay, but I have to remember - as it's not normal behaviour. I found a thread to check my ""about config"" or something, and all seemed set correctly according to the thread - &amp; my limited understanding. </p><p>I'm on FF 103.0.2, which is up-to-date and is set to Auto-update, as are all add-ons. I'm running Windows 10 - 21H2 OS build 19044.1889, which is also set to auto-update &amp; reports that it is. </p><p>Does anyone know if it's a known issue and being worked on, or if a solution has been found, please? It's driving me insane! Have a great day all. :-) </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",richardchaise

With the update, the user surface was changed completely. I have tried everything possible to change back to the earlier surface without success.  I have tried to change to an earlier version. The user surface was fine, but my profile was lost! If not possible to change back to the earlier user surface, I would have to switch to a different browser after almost 20 years of using Firefox!
