When I enter a url or do a random search or even try to open about:config, nothing happens.

Odd Firefox behavior. </p><p>Been using Firefox forever. And the same way every day. Same way. Have a working group of 88 sites I open after starting Firefox. Usually takes 2-3 minutes tops for all to be readied. Now taking 10-12 minutes or more. Just last few days. </p><p>I have three versions of Firefox. Right now main is 91.12 ESR which updated a few days ago. Also 91 ESR portable and 102.1 ESR Portable. All act the same. All used the same profile, copied from one to another. </p><p>Things do change so I see that my ESET antivirus updated and could be it. Turning ESET off temporarily made no difference. </p><p>Opening the session does use 100% CPU, but that is not new. Always has pegged. Comes down to normal when all opened. Single sites open as expected. And after all sites opened, FF acts as it always did with no issues. Its just loading all the tabs that is the issue.  </p><p>ODD Note: If I open the 91 ESR profile, then Startup Cache folder, clear the cache from about: Support, it does not delete the files. Yet that IS the profile being used. On at least one of the portables, that works as expected. If I delete the Startup cache files and open FF 91 ESR, it does not rebuild them. Makes me think it is using a different profile, but I am sure it is not. </p><p>I cannot try Safe Mode as the Session Manager would not be there to open the saved session. I may try turning off some Add-ons to see if a conflict, maybe with something added or updated recently. </p><p>Connection speeds have not changed and are above 400 Down and 150 Up. </p><p>As mentioned, this has worked for years. Sometimes with as many as 120 tabs. So it has to be a recent change. </p><p>I do have changes made to about:config but no idea where to try to make changes there to sleuth this issue.

I see from wading through help pages that this has been an issue before. It's been happening for a couple of weeks now-ish, each time I click a link it opens it on the tab I'm already on (say my emails page) rather than a new tab, so then I can't refer back to my email tab for reference or to copy tracking numbers etc. I've tried in safe mode and no change. I know I can right-click&gt;T, and that works okay, but I have to remember - as it's not normal behaviour. I found a thread to check my ""about config"" or something, and all seemed set correctly according to the thread - &amp; my limited understanding. </p><p>I'm on FF 103.0.2, which is up-to-date and is set to Auto-update, as are all add-ons. I'm running Windows 10 - 21H2 OS build 19044.1889, which is also set to auto-update &amp; reports that it is. </p><p>Does anyone know if it's a known issue and being worked on, or if a solution has been found, please? It's driving me insane! Have a great day all. :-) </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",richardchaise

With the update, the user surface was changed completely. I have tried everything possible to change back to the earlier surface without success.  I have tried to change to an earlier version. The user surface was fine, but my profile was lost! If not possible to change back to the earlier user surface, I would have to switch to a different browser after almost 20 years of using Firefox!
