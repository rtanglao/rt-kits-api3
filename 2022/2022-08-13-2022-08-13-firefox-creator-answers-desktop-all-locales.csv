Download stops after roughly 30 seconds and cuts the file,"<p>Hello, </p><p>I am trying to download a 5GB .zip file from a website. Inside the .zip file is a single .netCDF file. When I download the file and open it, both windows explorer and 7zip say there is a problem with the file: ""Unexpected end of data"". I have downloaded this file multiple times and the file size is different every time. The largest proportion I have managed to download is 1.7GB. I have noticed that the file size I end up with is proportional to the download speed during the download (usually between 20 to 40 Mbps). </p><p>I have also noticed that the download never lasts longer than ~30 seconds, which is why I think it could be a Firefox issue. Is there some way I can remove this 30 second cap? The download speed is limited by the host website so I am afraid there is not much I can do in that regard. </p><p>Any help would be much appreciated :) </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,customize,en-US,1526759;,arturmbnunes
