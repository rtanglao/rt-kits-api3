Occasionally i will open a page in ""new window"" so that I can make better use of multiple screens. If I inadvertently or quickly close the window with all my pinned tabs first, and then close the singular ""new"" window, all my tabs are gone. and of course the open previous or recently closed window only opens the on with no tabs. Is it possible to save the all tabs, or a ""master"" or ""default"" window? </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-11;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",abipes

But no definitive answer. And my feature request still remains for a history of sent tabs. </p><p>Dear Mozilla Team, </p><p>during the recent weeks I was away from my main PC and primarily used my iphone to browse the web. Every now and then I sent a link to the PC using Safari's share and the integrated send to function of Firefox for iOS. This usually worked really well, even when my PC was powered off. When I got back home and started my PC, sync would take forever, but was then interupted and all further tries to sync (hoping to get those tabs eventually) failed. </p><p>My question is if there is a log file of all those links that are sent to different devices? I believe there has to be one given that Mozilla's servers are being used and tabs (usually) arrive on powered-off devices following a request to the server. </p><p>If there is, please tell me how to access it/send it to me.  If there is not, please take this as a feature request (a sent links history being gathered locally as part of the wider Firefox profile maybe and as a viewable list of all shared tabs for all devices so that tabs can still be sent to single devices but also accessed from others, similar to how tabs can be accessed from all synced devices). </p><p>xxhen </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,sync,en-US,1538769;,xxhen

The ""FIRST ITEM"" listed below has to do with an improvement Mozilla Firefox should implement based on what I had to go through to this point of being able to type what I have typed here and below.   </p><p>FIRST ITEM:   This is NOT related to the subject matter I am seeking assistance with.   Just an improvement Mozilla Firefox should seriously consider.   Upon seeking help Mozilla asks one to enter ones ""email"", which I assumed meant ""email address"".   Since it has been years since I set up the Mozilla Firefox account I have, I was not sure which email address I had originally inputted into my Mozilla Firefox account information.   I therefore typed one of my email address's.  Next a new page appeared that asked me to enter my ""Passcode"" or ""Password"".  I do not recall which word was printed.   Upon entering my Mozilla Firefox account Password or Passcode that I had stored away, the page then asked questions like my age etc., indicating to myself that it was wanting to set up a new Mozilla Firefox account.  Which I was not wanting to do.  I was trying instead to enter my existing Mozilla Firefox account so that I could proceed and get assistance from Mozilla Firefox for the items I needed help with.   Thinking that maybe the reason questions relating to setting up a ""new"" Mozilla Firefox account, was due to the Mozilla Firefox computer ""Account"" system was NOT recognizing my Mozilla Firefox email address that I had entered, even though it did NOT state that it did not recognize my Mozilla Firefox email address, I changed the email address to another email address that I have, thinking it may be the email address that my Mozilla Firefox account is registered under.   Upon doing so and then entering either my password or passcode (whichever term Mozilla Firefox had printed), the Mozilla page then allowed me to enter my Mozilla Firefox account so that I could proceed to this Mozilla help/assistance section.   </p><p>The improvement from all that I have described above that Mozilla Firefox should implement is, that the ""Sign-In"" screen or page one types ones Mozilla Firefox ""email"" on (""email"" being the word Mozilla Firefox has it printed on that page), or as I and others correctly term ""email address"", that should Mozilla Firefox NOT recognize that ""email"" or email address as being what is registered with Mozilla Firefox, that Mozilla Firefox then display a red colored printed notice stating words or a phase such as:  ""The email (or email address) you entered is not recognized.  Please try again.""   Or: ""The email (or email address) you entered is not correct.  Please try again."" This way the Mozilla Firefox account holder who has multiple email addresses can then try inputting a different email address they have.   </p><p>Mozilla Firefox should NOT upon the ""email"" or ""email address"" not being the correct ""email"" or ""email address"" Mozilla Firefox has on file, then act like we are setting up a ""new"" Mozilla Firefox account by asking us questions that are for ""new"" users who do not have an existing Mozilla Firefox account.   </p><p>As a matter of fact, Mozilla Firefox to prevent this from occurring again, can simply have the Mozilla ""user"" seeking more individual help/assistance for something not covered in the listed topics Mozilla has, select from two listed titles such as:   1.)  Press here if you are an existing Mozilla account customer.   2.)  Press here if you are a Mozilla user wishing to set up a ""new"" Mozilla account.   The Mozilla ""user"" or ""existing"" customer then selects which one applies to them, and is taken to the correct screen of Mozilla questions for either ""existing"" Mozilla account customers, or ""users"" of Mozilla wishing to set up a ""new"" Mozilla account.   </p><p>SECOND ITEM:   Now as to why I was seeking Mozilla's assistance.   I wanted to look up a previous bookmarked item that I had stored in Mozilla's designated ""Bookmark"" storage area, as I have done hundreds of times previously.  Which one accesses by placing one's cursor arrow over the star shaped symbol located in the top address bar, over to the right side of that address bar, and then ""clicking"" it, that then drops down a list of previously bookmarked items one has stored.   </p><p>This time upon the list of previously bookmarked items being displayed, I noticed at the bottom of the first page of listed stored bookmarks shown on my screen, a folder titled ""Other Bookmarks"".   Wondering what bookmarks were contained inside of that ""Other Bookmarks"" folder, I opened it.  As I did NOT at that time recall ever seeing before a folder titled ""Other Bookmarks"".  And I do not recall Mozilla displaying each time I want to bookmark something, a list of ""areas"" or ""folders"" that I can select from to store that newly created ""bookmark"" into.   Meaning, my NEVER having previously seen anything but the star shaped symbol on the right side of the top web address bar that Mozilla uses to indicate the word and option ""Bookmark"".  A star shaped symbol that upon placing one's cursor arrow on top of it, one then see the printed words and characters ""Bookmark this page (Ctrl+D)"".   </p><p>Upon opening that folder titled ""Other Bookmarks"", a list of bookmarked items appeared.   I went to the bottom of that list and selected the down facing arrow to scroll down the rest of the list of bookmarked items.   Well this went on and on and on, leaving me frustrated.  As I did not know if the ""top"" or beginning of that list of bookmarks was the most ""recent"" or ""oldest"" bookmark.  As no title was listed at the ""top"" or beginning of that list of bookmarks that would indicate one is looking at the most recently added bookmark, or the oldest added bookmark.   And what was just as frustrating was that NO ""date"" was listed in the displayed title or description of each bookmark, or next to the displayed title or description for each bookmark listed.  Leaving me not knowing where the list of bookmarks began or ended.  Or being able to figure it out due to no date being listed with each bookmark title or description.   </p><p>I then exited from that folder titled ""Other Bookmarks"", only to find that later on I could NOT find that folder again that was titled ""Other Bookmarks"", anywhere else in the different areas Mozilla Firefox lists options one can select from, as well as the option titled ""Bookmarks"".  Or the star shaped symbol that Mozilla uses for the word ""Bookmarks"".   </p><p>Therefore with the explanation listed above, which I believe is pretty thorough, please inform me as well as educate me, as to what was or is going on.  As well as answer the following questions.   </p><p>NOTE:  Please Please answer the following questions in the same order as listed below.   This way I can follow along with each answer you supply me, which question it goes to as listed below.   Please answer each question even if you think it is a repeat of a previous question.  As I have my reasons for stating each question the way I have.  As each question is a different question, even if you in reading it initially think it is a duplicate question that I have typed a different way.   Each question worded the way I have, will allow me hopefully with your explanations and answers to fully understand what is going on, or has gone on, or is the reason why a certain item happens or exists, or does not happen or exist.   Thank you for your assistance with this.   </p><p>1.)  How did that Mozilla Firefox folder titled ""Other Bookmarks"" come into existence, with me only now seeing it for what I  </p><pre>     recall as being the first time?     </pre> <p>2.)  Why is the Mozilla Firefox folder titled ""Other Bookmarks"" not displayed all the time upon opening up the Mozilla Firefox  </p><pre>      browser?   </pre> <p>3.)  What causes the Mozilla Firefox folder titled ""Other Bookmarks"" to appear or be displayed?   </p><pre>      Meaning, is it some internal Mozilla Firefox operation?  Or is it something that I ""clicked"" or selected that causes that        Mozilla Firefox folder titled ""Other Bookmarks"" to appear or be displayed?   </pre> <p>4.)  How in the world did all the bookmarks get placed into, and stored into, that Mozilla Firefox folder titled  </p><pre>      ""Other Bookmarks"", when I do NOT recall ever seeing, let alone selecting, a folder titled ""Other Bookmarks"", or any other        titled folder for that matter, to place and store an item I just bookmarked into?   </pre> <p>5.)  Is the Mozilla Firefox folder titled ""Other Bookmarks"" a Mozilla Firefox ""archive"" folder of bookmarks that ones bookmarks  </p><pre>     are transferred into (should an Mozilla Firefox ""archive"" bookmark folder even exist), when the ""main"" Mozilla Firebox       bookmarks storage area is full, that would normally have a newly created bookmark be placed into, and stored inside of?   </pre> <p>6.)  How, if it is even possible, can I place or transfer or arraign through some Mozilla Firefox instruction should such exist, for  </p><pre>      ALL the bookmarks I have created, to be placed into, and stored into, one central Mozilla Firefox ""Bookmark"" storage        area, and or, folder such as the one Mozilla Firefox titles ""Other Bookmarks""?   </pre> <p>7.)  Is there a limit in the amount, and or, quantity, of bookmarks that Mozilla Firefox will allow one to create and store within  </p><pre>     the Mozilla Firefox ""Bookmarks"" option?        I ask this question as I have NEVER seen Mozilla Firefox list any numerical number of either the ""K"" for kilobytes, or ""MB""       for Megabytes ""used"" for the bookmarks one has created, listed at the top or bottom of the list of stored ""Bookmarks"",       indicating the total amount of data that has been used so far to store bookmarks in Mozilla Firefox.        Along with a notice like:  ""Total of 123 Kilobytes Bookmark storage still available"".        Or:  ""Total of 12 Megabytes Bookmark storage still available.        Leaving one thinking there is no limit to the amount of bookmarks one can create and store with Mozilla Firefox.   </pre> <p>8.)  Does Mozilla Firefox even have a warning or notice that it displays that states one has reached the total capacity limit of  </p><pre>     bookmarks Mozilla Firefox will allow to be created and stored?        I ask this question as I have NEVER seen any notice or warning of any type from Mozilla Firefox that would let one know       that one has reached the total capacity limit of bookmarks Mozilla Firefox will allow to be stored.  And that one needs to       erase or delete or transfer existing stored bookmarks before Mozilla Firefox can store any ""new"" bookmark one wants to       create and store.   </pre> <p>In closing, since I have never used this Mozilla ""help"" or ""assistance"" feature before, I do not know if your explanations and answers to the questions I have listed above are going to be sent to the email address that is listed with my Mozilla account, or if your explanations and answers are going to be posted to some Mozilla ""Public"" site, or Mozilla ""Chat"" site, or whatever Mozilla terms such.   </p><p>Therefore PLEASE if at all possible, email your explanations and answers to the email address I have listed with my Mozilla account that I imputed at the beginning of all of this in order to be able to proceed with this letter of comments and questions I need your assistance with.

When I alt-tab at times, Firefox completely freezes. Every Firefox window hangs on a single image and I am unable to interact with anything for a few seconds. During these seconds, I can see the memory % in the Windows Task Manager slowly climbing until Firefox unfreezes itself, so it seems to be loading stuff back into memory. For example, it'll climb from 55% to 70%, taking its sweet sweet time. I also see some disk usage with 'System' during this time. </p><p>This behavior occurs even when I'm active on the browser and at 50% memory. It seems to occur more often once I hit the 60% memory mark. </p><p>I'm almost certain that this is a Firefox-specific issue, because I can interact with any other program during this period. It is only Firefox that stops dead in its track. </p><p>Is there a way to make this behavior less aggressive?
