I should have around 7900 tabs and the session restore never failed me. Everything I needed loaded relatively quickly too.  </p><p>My addons seem to work fine, I sometimes get random crashes (though I think this is due to GPU driver issues). Suddenly none of my tabs load which is very unfortunate.  </p><p>Whenever I go into settings and scroll down to ""Firefox Updates"" Version 108.0 is stuck at 0 bytes and doesn't seem to download at all.  </p><p>I would appreciate if I could fix this without losing my session.
