The documentation of the extension says that I need to download the xpi file, extract the contents and to overwrite one of the js files and to hardcode the API key inside and compress it back to xpi but when I do that I'm getting error that the file is corrupt because when I change the file I'm breaking the add-on signing. I also tried to navigate to about:addons and put the code there in the preferences tab of the extension but I can't interact with input field for the API key. Is there a workaround for this? I went trough the code of the extension and I see that this key is saved in the extension local storage is there a way I can interact with this storage outside of the extension when I set up the browser driver? Any help will be appreciated. I'm using python-selenium 3.141.0 </p>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",r.angelov33
