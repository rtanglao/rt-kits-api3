I had tried everything before I did that, but nothing worked.   </p><p>Every other website I go to works great for me - loads fast, etc., but when I do a google search, I often have to fresh the page several times.  I don't understand why it is that just ONE site is slow.  I end up opening Chrome when I want to do a search which is kind of a pain.    </p><p>Is there anyone else with this issue? What can I do?? I hate the thought of switching search engines.   </p><p>Thanks for any help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",avivaldi72
