Firefox on my work computer is signed into Sync w/ my work Firefox account and Firefox on my personal computer is signed into sync w/ my personal Firefox account. This is crazy and unacceptable. </p><p>I have not previously signed into my personal Firefox account on my work computer, the Connected Services section of the Firefox Account Settings for my personal account does not show my work computer and the Connected Services for my work account does not show my personal computer. </p><p>Both computers are on the same physical network, but do not otherwise interact. </p>",mac-os;desktop;sync;firefox-960;firefox-9602;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",baronmog

I continue to get same request but not if I use MIcrosoft Edge browser.  How can I correct this so can continue to use Firefox.

I can successfully send a tab from my PC, however, when I attempt to send a tab from my iPhone, it won't show up on my PC.  </p><p>Things I've tried; - Uninstalling/reinstalling Firefox for PC. - Uninstalling/reinstalling Firefox for iPhone. - Signing out then back in on both devices.  </p><p>Whatever I try, I can only manage to send tabs from the PC to iPhone and not the other way around. When I manually sync from PC, I can (sometimes) see what tabs are open on my phone. I am out of ideas. </p><p>Build Versions; PC: 96.0.2 (64-bit) iOS: Firefox Daylight 96.0 (7403) </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",jordan.keating

I'm glad that Pocket has reappeared on my home page, since I spent hours trying to find it a couple of years ago, unsuccessfully, after it disappeared, but now this spell check issue is a bit disconcerting. But now it appears that it only happens within Facebook ...there's a surprise. Nope, it's Messenger/Firefox only. Messenger/Edge works as it should (red squigglies remain, despite depressing Backspace), and the squigglies also remain within this text field. So it seems specific to Messenger/Firefox. Firefox (96.01) </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;facebook;spellchecker;messenger;firefox-960;,firefox,other,en-US,1476872;,mnjaskiw
