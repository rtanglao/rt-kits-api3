However, the next time I start Firefox the reminders once again don't display. Once I have the reminders set I save the settings, but that doesn't help. I don't have this issue with Edge or Chrome.

The reason is I have a ""tabstrip"" that hilites the currently selected tab and the target document is displayed in an iframe. If I click the back or forward buttons the page is updated with the last or next document in the iframe, but the tabstrip is not updated to reflect the change. Part of this is due to me not knowing how to update the tabstrip, but also because I don't know how to detect the back or forward buttons being clicked. </p><p>So I need to know how to detect those button clicks. Also, in researching this, I noticed that there seems to be an idea that you can't distinguish between the forward and back button, only that a button was clicked. That doesn't make sense given that each button has a specific action that is opposite of the other. I need to know the truth about this. </p><p>Finally, as much as I use only Firefox myself, I know there will be others who use other browsers.
