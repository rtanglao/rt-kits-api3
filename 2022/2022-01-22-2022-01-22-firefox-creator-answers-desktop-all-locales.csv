Trying to fix the problem, I decided to uninstall Firefox and installing it again. In order to clean even more the previous installation, I even manually deleted the C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox folder to remove all possible traces. I restarted the laptop and downloaded again the Firefox installer. I don't know how, but the installer detected that I had already installed Firefox before. I unchecked restart Firefox and hit the button to continue with the installation. After this, was impossible to install Firefox again. I got a message saying that <strong>the installation cannot continue because the VCRUNTIME140_1.dll was not found</strong>. The message said that this problem can be fixed by reinstalling the program, but that is not true, everytime I try to reinstall it, I get again the <strong>VCRUNTIME140_1.dll error</strong>. </p><p>After this, the installation stops and the Firefox icon appears on the desktop, but it doesn't install properly the software and when I open it, I cannot browse the Internet. </p><p>Do you know what's going on here and how to solve this? </p><p>Cheers </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;needsinfo;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1476945;1477046;,mrmister23

The reason is I have a ""tabstrip"" that hilites the currently selected tab and the target document is displayed in an iframe. If I click the back or forward buttons the page is updated with the last or next document in the iframe, but the tabstrip is not updated to reflect the change. Part of this is due to me not knowing how to update the tabstrip, but also because I don't know how to detect the back or forward buttons being clicked. </p><p>So I need to know how to detect those button clicks. Also, in researching this, I noticed that there seems to be an idea that you can't distinguish between the forward and back button, only that a button was clicked. That doesn't make sense given that each button has a specific action that is opposite of the other. I need to know the truth about this. </p><p>Finally, as much as I use only Firefox myself, I know there will be others who use other browsers. Is there any difference between detecting the back and forward buttons on other browsers compared to Firefox? </p><p>One of the pages I need this for is <a href=""https://wayneca.neocities.org/FFXII/items1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> </p>",desktop;beta;other;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,other,en-US,"",WayneCa
