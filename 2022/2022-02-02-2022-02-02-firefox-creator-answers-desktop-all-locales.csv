In my opinion this is a security threat, as it makes password guessing nearly trivial. Sure, an attacker would have to get their hands on your laptop/computer, but they can use this strategy to find your password without having to know your master password. I'd love to know whether A) this is intended behavior, and B) if so, if there is a way to turn this off. </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-960;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",erik.takke

I would load the video, and after 10 seconds or so it would throw ""An Error Occured"" without any more specific detail. </p><p>Today I discovered the cause, but not the solution. I have a very old YouTube account, 2006 era. Over the years this was eventually merged with my primary Google account. This means that in order to use and manage youtube, I need to specifically select that account in the ""Switch Account"" dropdown, rather than the primary profile directly associated with my google account. </p><p>If I have this account (or any other sub accounts) selected, Embedded videos do not load. However, if I have the primary Google account profile selected, embedded videos load correctly. </p><p>This has only started happening in the last couple of months. I've tried clearing down cookies, logging in and out, reinstalling firefox - the works. The only reason I discovered the solution was by accidentally selecting the primary profile when switching to another sub profile earlier. </p><p>I've got no idea how to solve this. I've been using this YouTube account for 16 years, so switching to the primary account is not an option. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",Jademalo
