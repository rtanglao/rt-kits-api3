I believe that I ticked all the right bowes when doing the Refresh. When it had completed my Orange function duly  worked again - but! I could no longer see my (quite extenive) Bookmarks. There's no loner any button to enable me to Bookmark a current page.. My efforts via the drop-down Get-Help-on-Bookmarks function have not worked either. So, please, I need your help!
