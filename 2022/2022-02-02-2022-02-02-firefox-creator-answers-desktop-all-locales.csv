There will be little descriptive remarks about the image that show over the block.  I can even click on  the image to enlarge it, and still has the same issue.  Right now, I have the line through the shield for Facebook; but... still the same thing repeatedly happens.  Not a fan of firefox for that reason. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,websites,en-US,1480152;,arthammond2020

The best I can do is not play full screen, and detach the tab of my game to minimize the amount of tabs visible (and clickable) but there are still these ""landmines"" on the screen that actively sabotage playing the game without having the handicap of firefox taking over and messing with the screen. </p><p>Is there any way to completely disable the popups from a fullscreen mode, show no toolbars, tabs, or anything else (except when exiting fullscreen mode via the keyboard.)  I want the mouse to have no interaction with changing the display except for the game itself. </p><p>Playing <a href=""http://slither.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://slither.io</a> is a good example of what I'm talking about. </p><p>Thanks! </p><p>CS </p>",linux;desktop;tips;firefox-960;,firefox,tips,en-US,1480135;,cs2991
