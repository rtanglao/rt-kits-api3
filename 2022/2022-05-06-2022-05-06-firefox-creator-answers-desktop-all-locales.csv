We distribute Firefox add-ons on PC and macOS outside of Mozilla store. </p><p>Until Firefox 100.0 our users were able to install the add-on by clicking a button on the product side which was opening a link to XPI file hosted on our company's download server. That was triggering a usual install dialog from Firefox where it asks user to confirm the installation. </p><p>Starting from Firefox 100.0 this stopped happening and we started receiving numerous support calls from our customers about not being able to install the add-on. The issue now is that when the XPI link is opened in Firefox, the install dialog does not appear which brings a lot of confusion to the user. Firefox shows the link to the XPI in the address bar but does not start the usual install process (attaching screenshot of how it looks like on my Mac). The issue applies to both macOS and Windows platforms. I've opened a bug case on bugzilla. The link for reference: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1766965"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1766965</a> </p><p>Could someone please clarify how we should proceed with this issue? We are now getting reports of this issue from many of our customers. Thank you. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,1502810;,artur.valiev
