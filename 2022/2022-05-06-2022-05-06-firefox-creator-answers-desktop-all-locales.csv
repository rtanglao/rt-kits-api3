I am a long term Firefox fan/user. </p><p>My problem is I cannot find anywhere an easy method to add a shortcut on my Home Screen (which has now been a FF feature for some considerable time). </p><p>I am sure there was something available to do this in a prior version some time back.  If I search the internet, I only come across articles describing how to do it on Firefox Android. </p><p>I know I can manually edit a box on the Home Screen to create what I need. </p><p>Sometimes new web sites that I visit appear in the boxes and I can then pin them in place - but the behavior around this is very erratic and unreliable - seems like random chance for an icon to appear on the home screen for a newly visited site.  If this was more consistent, I could work with that. </p><p>BUT - where is the **intuitive** option??!! </p><p>I should be able to right-click on a tab and select ""Add to Home Screen"". </p><p>As simple as that. </p><p>Or drag and drop a link, or tab to the home screen - but this just opens the link.
