It crashes often, and has usually crashed when I come back to my desktop after a few hours or the weekend. Today it has crashed on me at least 10 times. It does not seem to relate to a particular website or activity.  It is becoming so difficult to work with that I am going to have to go to Chrome or something else if it's not fixed.  I saw on other similar complaints where you asked for crash reports, so am pasting some info below. Note that the first few from today don't start with bp and also will not ""submit.""

I am a long term Firefox fan/user. </p><p>My problem is I cannot find anywhere an easy method to add a shortcut on my Home Screen (which has now been a FF feature for some considerable time). </p><p>I am sure there was something available to do this in a prior version some time back.  If I search the internet, I only come across articles describing how to do it on Firefox Android. </p><p>I know I can manually edit a box on the Home Screen to create what I need. </p><p>Sometimes new web sites that I visit appear in the boxes and I can then pin them in place - but the behavior around this is very erratic and unreliable - seems like random chance for an icon to appear on the home screen for a newly visited site.  If this was more consistent, I could work with that. </p><p>BUT - where is the **intuitive** option??!! </p><p>I should be able to right-click on a tab and select ""Add to Home Screen"". </p><p>As simple as that. </p><p>Or drag and drop a link, or tab to the home screen - but this just opens the link.  I have tried everything obvious that I can think of. </p><p>Anyone? </p><p>Many thanks :) </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1000;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",aufladen
