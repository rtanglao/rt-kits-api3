Prima di effettuare l'aggiornamento a Monterey qualche settimana fa, riuscivo ad effettuare correttamente ogni tipo di download. Faccio qualche esempio: salvataggio dal sito Canva di files con estensione .jpg . png .pdf oppure salvataggio in locale dal cloud Mega di file in varie estensioni. Mi succede anche con i semplici allegati della mia mail (che consulto online, senza l'ausilio di un client) di varie estensioni. Solo dopo l'aggiornamento a Monterey non riesco più a salvare in locale. Mi succede solo da Firefox perchè da Chrome riesco a salvare come facevo prima dell'aggiornamento, per questo temo che dipenda da Firefox. Quando provo a salvare il sistema mi chiede se voglio aprire/salvare il documento. Quando seleziono ""salva"" e do invio, invece di chiedermi la destinazione del file, non si apre nessuna finestra.  In compenso, nella cartella di download del Mac, trovo un file generato in quel preciso momento, che ha un nome alfanumerico senza senso che alla fine del nome ha l'estensione del file+ la scritta .part (esempio: VghT5De4.pdf.part) Cosa può essere successo? Dipende effettivamente da Firefox o mi sfugge qualche impostazione?  Grazie </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-990;,firefox,download-and-install,it,1495696;1495700;,enrica2

I used win 10. HW decode stop working at all. I don't changed anything(no new version of driver have been installed, no browser update, bios and etc) hw decode just stop working in Firefox. Edge and video players still use hw decode. I tried to reinstall firefox with fully cleared(remove Mozilla folders from appdata and clear temp folder) but it don't solve the problem. Recently I hear that in firefox 100 av1 will be accelerated with hw decode. I decided to make clean install of win 11. And in clear system(no matter win 10 or win 11) firefox use hw decode. I was happy with it, but no long. When I turn ac charge off and tried to start youtube video it tried to start in 10-20 seconds and then plaing without hw decode. And It not changed back when I connect ac charge back and make reboot. And clear install of firefox also has no effect. I think it in the same state as it was before windows reinstall. It can be matter than I set windows settings for ac mode max performance and for battery mode max energy efficiency. Also I had klite codec pack installed but all work with it while I was on ac(and other programs continue work now). </p><p>I think hw decode very matter for notebooks battery lifetime.
