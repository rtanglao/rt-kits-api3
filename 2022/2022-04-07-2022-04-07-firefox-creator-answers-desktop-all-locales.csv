The problem is not the code nor greasemonkey, it is when it logs a long URL string into the console log, it gets the truncated version (although clickable and goes to the right page) and if you copy the text or ""Export Visible Nessage to"", it will copy the truncated text instead of the full text, which those are now invalid URLs. </p><p>Is there a way I can disable this in the options?

I mainly notice it with the password and download dialog boxes, as i get those frequently. I have tried reinstalling Firefox, but that didn't help. I have tried using firefox in troubleshoot mode and get the same results. I have also deleted all Mozilla folders on my pc between installs in hope of fixing the problem, but nothing changed. The folders I deleted were in the Local, LocalLow, and Roaming folders. Other dialog boxes seem to work fine. It has been this way for about a year, and don't remember what caused it, as I didn't really notice it until I had to download something, and didn't have time to troubleshoot at the time. I would like some guidance on how to fix this issue. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-990;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jc97xz
