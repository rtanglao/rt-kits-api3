Their site uses two-factor authentication and after entering an email address and password, the site generates an error message asking the user to contact Sainsburys support.

Now after updating to FF 106, where I had the option of setting that value using the onLoad option, the page remains absolutely blank until I confirm or reject the window.pageYOffset value. Since I cannot see where on the page I am positioned (because it won't finish loading) it is now useless. This tool had been my most frequently used function for many years as I could reposition to a desired location by merely pressing my home key. OnKeydown it would jump to the top of the page and onKeyUp, it would return me to virtual bookmarked position, no matter where I was on the page. For some of my pages, I would invoke it more than once in less than a minute. It was really useful!. (Now it is useless!) These problems happened immediately after each FF update. </p><pre> /russ </pre>",desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1544158;,csuflinux
