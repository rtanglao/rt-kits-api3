With 106 update last week, the desktop went inactive whenever FF started. Just saw the hourglass icon everywhere outside the FF window.  Had to right-click out, then saw a dialog something like ""Windows Explorer Not Responding.""  Forcing a stop of WE got everything working again.  Was fine for a couple of days with 106.0.1, but 106.0.2 just downloaded, and the problem is back!  Sure, there's a workaround, but it's a pain in the butt!

Now after updating to FF 106, where I had the option of setting that value using the onLoad option, the page remains absolutely blank until I confirm or reject the window.pageYOffset value. Since I cannot see where on the page I am positioned (because it won't finish loading) it is now useless. This tool had been my most frequently used function for many years as I could reposition to a desired location by merely pressing my home key. OnKeydown it would jump to the top of the page and onKeyUp, it would return me to virtual bookmarked position, no matter where I was on the page. For some of my pages, I would invoke it more than once in less than a minute. It was really useful!. (Now it is useless!) These problems happened immediately after each FF update. </p><pre> /russ </pre>",desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",csuflinux

The login information is not share, the behavior is the same a new instance of Firefox. In yesterday feature, I can drag and drop tabs to be grouped, also ""minimize"" and the appearance is similar to ""Firefox View"" in ""Hidden Tabs"" and with double click expand all tabs grouped. I would like to recover that functionality. Thanks in advance! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",elrengo
