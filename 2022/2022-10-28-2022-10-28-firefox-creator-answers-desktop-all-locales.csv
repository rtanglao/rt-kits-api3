In the past month, 2 common national sites (AutoZone and Advance Auto Parts) will open to their normal opening site with numerous options to click on such as what part do you need...what specials are, etc. That opening site is ""frozen"" and will not accept searches or ANY navigation on site. You cannot even close (X) the site...and I must shut down the desktop to escape. I called both national sites and they had no clue what I was talking about. I tried a different search engine (Google not Duck Go) but still after initially opening these 2 sites...they remain frozen. I then downloaded Google Chrome...and that fixed the problem. Both AutoZone and Advance Auto Parts now open... and function normally. Back on FireFox I tried opening the NAPA Auto Parts (who I rarely use) and their site opens and functions normally. My question:  Why is Autozone and Advance Auto Parts not usable with Firefox for me ? I navigate hundreds of sites and forums a week with Firefox without problem. I have been using Firefox and visiting those 2 parts sites for Years with FireFox... and no problem. I reloaded newest version of Firefox ...and that didn't fix the problem. Any ideas ?
