Immediately after starting Firefox, the Intel graphics driver stops working, which causes Firefox to hang on a white screen. The windows warning is something close to ""Intel graphics driver stopped responding and has recovered"". The only way I can start Firefox is in troubleshoot mode. I tried disabling hardware acceleration, which solves the problem but I'd like to keep using the GPU so it's not really a good solution. So I forced Firefox to use the NVIDIA GPU (gtx 960m) on the NVIDIA control panel. This worked, Firefox starts and works as normal again but within just a few hours has already caused the NVIDIA GPU drivers to stop responding once, prompting Firefox to stop responding too and hang on a white screen. Restarting Firefox fixed the problem. This might have been a fluke but I'd like to keep using the Intel integrated GPU, if possible. </p><p>I'm using Windows 8.1 and my laptop has an i7-4720HQ (Intel HD Graphics 4600) and a GTX 960m. I'm using the latest version of Firefox 106.0.2 </p><p>Any idea what might be causing the problem? I haven't had any trouble with either GPU on any other occasion </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-81;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",walkingthyroid

You cannot even close (X) the site...and I must shut down the desktop to escape. I called both national sites and they had no clue what I was talking about. I tried a different search engine (Google not Duck Go) but still after initially opening these 2 sites...they remain frozen. I then downloaded Google Chrome...and that fixed the problem. Both AutoZone and Advance Auto Parts now open... and function normally. Back on FireFox I tried opening the NAPA Auto Parts (who I rarely use) and their site opens and functions normally. My question:  Why is Autozone and Advance Auto Parts not usable with Firefox for me ? I navigate hundreds of sites and forums a week with Firefox without problem. I have been using Firefox and visiting those 2 parts sites for Years with FireFox... and no problem. I reloaded newest version of Firefox ...and that didn't fix the problem. Any ideas ?
