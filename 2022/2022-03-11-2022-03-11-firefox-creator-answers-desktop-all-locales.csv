It goes directly to ""Save to"" download location. This is not how the .acsm files are supposed to be handles. They all have the same name and are supposed to be opened into Adobe Digital Editions directly. </p><pre>In Firefox Settings there is a box for - ""Applications </pre> <p>Choose how Firefox handles the files you download from the web or the applications you use while browsing."" </p><p>However, .acsm files do not appear and typing "".acsm"" or the filetype name ""Adobe Content Server Message"" yields nothing inside this box so I cannot get Firefox to open these files with Adobe Digital Editions. </p><p>This is beyond annoying. These files are meant to be opened straight by Adobe Digital Editions. I tested it on Chrome and Chrome lets you open them fine.  </p><p>Either the ""Applications Choose how Firefox handles the files you download from the web or the applications you use while browsing."" box functionality needs to be fixed to recognize .acsm filetypes or the previous default functionality of allowing me to choose ""Open with Adobe Digital Editions"" or ""Save to"" for this filetype needs to be restored. </p><p>If there is some other way to get this functionality back in the most current Firefox version, please advise. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ZenmasterJ
