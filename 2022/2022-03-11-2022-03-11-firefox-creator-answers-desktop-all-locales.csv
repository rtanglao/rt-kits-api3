I absolutely hate because after I print, it closes out the thing that I was printing.  If I want to see it again on the web page, I have to open it back up again.  How can I disable this feature and go back to having a PDF automatically open a separate when I want to print something?

I cannot figure out how to turn it off, although just by messing around it has turned off twice. Later it comes back on. I have looked at DevTools, and I do not know what to do with it. I looked through settings, expecting to find the answer, but never found anything clearly stated that would help. I have looked at remote browser debugging, but could still not figure out what to do. I would appreciate some help on this, because I have no idea what to do. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",LadyRedLight
