It happens extremely consistently even in troubleshoot mode and after several reinstalls of Firefox. Occasionally it also seems to happen when an external application asks the operating system to open a URL (Since Firefox is my default browser this of course causes Firefox to open a new tab... eventually). </p><p>The exact amount of time the hang lasts seems to vary quite a bit, but it's usually less than 30 seconds. Even when the hang lasts a long time I have never seen Windows indicate that the app is not responding which seems to imply it's not getting stuck so much as getting slowed down by something. </p><p>I can reproduce the unlocking version of this issue extremely reliably. In Task Manager I can see all of the Firefox processes sitting at 0% CPU, but when I lock and unlock the computer (with Windows Key + L to lock) exactly one of the Firefox processes (the ones grouped together in task manager) shoots up to ~8% CPU for the duration of the hang. The process that reliably spikes is using~500MB of memory while all of the other Firefox processes average about 40MB of memory so I assume the spike is happening in the main Firefox process. One of the two Firefox processes that ISN'T grouped together with any others in Task Manager also spikes to ~4% CPU when the hang starts fairly reliably, and some of the other grouped processes usually spike but to a much lesser degree and for a much shorter time. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-950;firefox-9502;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",semicoleon

I've tried clearing the cookies, and then reloading my open tabs, but it ends up losing the connection, just the browser itself.  Other browser still works.
