I have to restart Firefox. </p><p><strong>Details:</strong> </p><p>I have a div element with multiple paragraphs inside. The div has the following attributes: spellcheck=""true"" lang=""hu"" contenteditable=""true"" (I have the same results with lang=""en"") </p><p>After the page load, spelling errors are visible (red wavy underline), but if I edit one of the paragraphs with an error, the underlines are disappear in that paragraph. If I reload the page, the spelling errors are now completely missing. Only browser restart helps, but it only shows the errors again once. </p><p>This worked before nicely. </p><p>Is there any log I could check? </p><p><strong>Versions:</strong> </p><p>Firefox: 95.0.2 (64-bit) I have reinstalled language packs and dictionaries with the newest versions. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-950;firefox-9502;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",zedas74

That particular site can only be accessed through my demat account so replicating my situation is not possible. Other browsers like Chrome, Edge are able to open it but Firefox cant, it does only when OCSP is disabled. I reinstalled the browser but the problem remains. Pls tell me how to add that website to exception if its possible or delete all the certificates currently loaded on Firefox or a full reset of the browser removing all previous data. And is it okay if I keep OCSP off all the time? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",dheeraj.murthy

The most apparent one being ads appearing on the sites I browse (I have the Adblock extension installed and active). The extension that reveals the ""dislike"" ratio on Youtube only works if I disable and then enable the extension, for each video I watch. My entire extensions toolbar seems faulty as well.  </p><p>I've attached images to illustrate: - Rakuten just appears as a blank box upon clicking it - Video downloader extensions just appear as a white line (doesn't open at all) - Bitwarden (password manager) says ""not available in private mode"", even though I'm not using a private window </p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Matt </p>",desktop;customize;firefox-950;firefox-9502;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",mattam53
