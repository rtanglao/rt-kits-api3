Não é possível que cada atualização piore!! Minhas últimas reclamações davam 20, 30 minutos, agora são 60 minutos...SOMENTE NO NAVEGADOR MOZILLA FIREFOX!! Não acontece com o Earth, com o Opera, com o Chrome, Brave, Safari, tentei todos... SÓ A PORRA DO MOZILLA FIREFOX QUE ATUALIZA TODA A MERDA DE SEMANA, CONTINUA SENDO UM PROBLEMA DE UTILIZAÇÃO! É inconcebível a aceitação de que é algo benéfico pro usuário. Como alguém pode demorar 60 minutos para abrir QUALQUER SITE? Inclusive o de suporte que eu abria para acelerar os processos. Bizarro, Bizarro! Eu fico PUTO PRA CARALHO TODO SANTO DIA! Continuo utilizando porque é possível um processo legal contra a empresa, vou até as últimas consequências pelo tanto de sacanagem que essa porra de Mozilla ja me fez passar de caos e raiva.

I'm using the latest version (95.0.2) on Windows 10, but this was a problem in other recent versions. It only happens on some systems. No other browser I've tried has the same problem, so the issue is definitely Firefox-specific. </p><p>One example of a problematic page is <a href=""https://arxiv.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">arxiv.org</a>, another one is <a href=""https://www.caltech.edu/about/news"" rel=""nofollow"">Caltech News</a>; see the attached screenshots for how Firefox renders these pages on my system. </p><p>Here's what I found out. </p> <ol><li> The issue goes away if I disable the ""Allow pages to choose their own fonts, instead of your selections above"" font setting. </li><li> The issue remains even if I disable/uninstall all add-ons. </li><li> Refresh-install doesn't resolve the issue. </li><li> After uninstalling and installing Firefox cleanly again, with old settings auto-imported (bookmarks, history, logins ...) and no add-ons present, the issue is not present at first. However, if I enable ""Open previous windows and tabs"" option to restore my session on startup, the issue reappears after I close and re-open Firefox a couple of times, and doesn't go away after that. It doesn't matter whether the problematic pages are included in the restored session or not; they will simply not show all text as expected if I visit them. </li><li> Deleting the entire cache, cookies, site data and site settings doesn't help. </li><li> Opening Firefox in <em>Troubleshoot mode</em> make the problem disappear, but it returns immediately when I leave the <em>Troubleshoot mode</em>. </li></ol> <p>Any ideas how to fix this? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",w987

Pls tell me how to add that website to exception if its possible or delete all the certificates currently loaded on Firefox or a full reset of the browser removing all previous data. And is it okay if I keep OCSP off all the time? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,websites,en-US,1472098;,dheeraj.murthy

My entire extensions toolbar seems faulty as well.  </p><p>I've attached images to illustrate: - Rakuten just appears as a blank box upon clicking it - Video downloader extensions just appear as a white line (doesn't open at all) - Bitwarden (password manager) says ""not available in private mode"", even though I'm not using a private window </p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.
