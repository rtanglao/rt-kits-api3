My login credential, my account, etc. are all in order.  When attempting to submit the login credential to access my account I get over the submit button a red circle with a red diagonal line across the circle that inhibits pressing the submit button.  The first time I attempted this on a different laptop I was asked by their tech support to not attempt to press the button but instead to hit the enter key on my keyboard.  It worked!  I got in!  However, when I tried it again at a later time I could not get in.  So, I decided to try a different browser; Edge repeatedly worked by hitting the enter keyboard key.  This clearly suggests an issue with Firefox an this web portal.   </p><p>I am running security add on features on Firefox.   I turned them all off and run the browser in troubleshooting mode.  No Joy!  The problem persists.  That's where you come in.  I would rather not migrate to Edge, I do not like living on the edge so to speak.  I am attaching a screenshot of the problem.  I hope that you can help me find a solution.  I look forward to your reply.   Thank you. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-81;firefox-950;firefox-9502;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",p.pagratis
