When applying from Indeed to the State of Wisconsin, Firefox goes into a loop whereas the other browsers do not. Trying to click the button to apply for a job only works in other browsers. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1020;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1516236;,toddchilson

I don't get the error on other browsers, nor do i get the error on other sites within Firefox. I've cleared my cache, cookies, restarted my browser, tried turning off the proxy functionality in network settings, etc. This all started immediately after my browser was upgraded to 102 (current version is 102.0 (64-bit)).  Please help. This is so frustrating that I'm ready to simply delete Firefox and revert to Chrome, which is a bummer, but this is kind of a dealbreaker bug and i've already spent an hour on the forums (using Chrome, because I can't access Google search) trying to fix this. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;website-breakages;firefox-1020;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",jiggawotts
