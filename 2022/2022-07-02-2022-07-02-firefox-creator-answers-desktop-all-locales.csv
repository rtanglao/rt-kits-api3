Firefox is my default browser but will not let me log in to KDP. No problem with other websites including <a href=""http://Amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon.com</a> When I open the KDP log in page it accepts my email address but the password button has a row of asterix right across the window. I cannot delete whatever is in there or change the password via the forgotten password route. Thus to sign in to KDP I have to use an alternate browser. With both Opera and Chrome I can sign in with no problems. I have added a screenshot of the KDP log in which illustrates the problem. Grateful for any solution to this irritation. Thanks, Paul </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1020;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1516262;,paullie1

I don't get the error on other browsers, nor do i get the error on other sites within Firefox. I've cleared my cache, cookies, restarted my browser, tried turning off the proxy functionality in network settings, etc. This all started immediately after my browser was upgraded to 102 (current version is 102.0 (64-bit)).  Please help. This is so frustrating that I'm ready to simply delete Firefox and revert to Chrome, which is a bummer, but this is kind of a dealbreaker bug and i've already spent an hour on the forums (using Chrome, because I can't access Google search) trying to fix this. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;website-breakages;firefox-1020;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",jiggawotts
