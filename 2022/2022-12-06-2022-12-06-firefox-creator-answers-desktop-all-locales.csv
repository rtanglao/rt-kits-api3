The Create New Login form says ""Make sure this matches the exact address of the website where you log in."" I enter the exact address, username, and password and save it. But what shows after it is saved is a truncated form of the address. It lopped off the specific account ID information for my login page. So when I try to go to that site, my login page can't be found. Why can't the full address be saved? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",wonderinggal

If i force a manual synchronization, there are some chances that the devices get in sync in a few minutes (I have to do this on each of them). If I don't do anything and just wait, they get hours before getting in sync. I don't have any strange network configuration and I tried reinstalling, logging in-out, switching on-off various sync options but nothing changed so far. </p><p>Any idea? Thank you. </p>",desktop;sync;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,sync,it,"",aleks0493
