If i force a manual synchronization, there are some chances that the devices get in sync in a few minutes (I have to do this on each of them). If I don't do anything and just wait, they get hours before getting in sync. I don't have any strange network configuration and I tried reinstalling, logging in-out, switching on-off various sync options but nothing changed so far. </p><p>Any idea? Thank you. </p>",desktop;sync;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,sync,it,"",aleks0493
