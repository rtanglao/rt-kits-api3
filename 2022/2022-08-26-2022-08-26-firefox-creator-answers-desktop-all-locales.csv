Solutions Unacceptable,"<p>I followed all of the steps for Firefox taking up too much memory, and stopped when it said to add RAM or upgrade my computer. Browsers shouldn't be maxing out my RAM and it's getting worse. In the last 6 months or so, my computer started crashing while doing other things unrelated to Firefox.

Why is it being such a pig?  </p><p>I have 32GB of RAM and that stuff is costly. I might not be able to find RAM for this computer and may have the max amount (will have to check that). So is buying a new computer because this one cost me over $4.5k and one like it today will cost over $6k ... just because Firefox wants to eat up more and more? Once I kill Firefox, my RAM goes back down to 45% instead of 90%, but I don't like it closed. I have to restart too many steps for extensions when I open it and like to have it open while I do other things. </p><p>Please, stop increasingly taking up all of my RAM! Firefox is causing all sorts of strange things to happen when there's too little RAM.

Firefox is selected as the default web browser in the OS preferred applications setting.  If I launch Firefox and check its preference settings, it also displays that it is the default browser. </p><p>I'm also running Thunderbird v78.13.0.  If I get an email with a link, and click the link, if Firefox is already running, the link opens normally in Firefox.  If Firefox has not already been launched, clicking the link in Thunderbird will cause Firefox to be launched and open the link in it.  However, in that case, Firefox then displays a message that it is not the default browser, and asks to make it so.  In an adjacent window, I can see the OS preferred applications displaying Firefox as the default. </p><p>If I click the button in Firefox to ""make it the default"" (even though it already is), Firefox is happy and remains happy as long as it is open.  However, if I ignore it, the next time I click a link in Thunderbird, Thunderbird does weird stuff with the link instead of opening it in Firefox (behavior similar to not having a default browser set, or having a browser setting conflict).   Even then, the OS default browser setting still displays as Firefox. </p><p>The behavior suggests that there's another place storing the default browser setting that is losing the setting if Firefox is spawned by an application (perhaps Firefox is spawned in a shell that isolates it from the system settings?). </p><p>Restarting Firefox with all extensions disabled doesn't affect this behavior. </p><p>How do I get Firefox to recognize that it is the default browser?  Or if Firefox is correctly determining that it is not, how do I get the system to retain the default browser setting when Firefox is spawned by an application? </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1040;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1529493;,Fixer1234
