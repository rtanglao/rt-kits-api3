Firefox is the worst, but Chrome and Edge are also affected.  Stopping and re-running the browser helps.  Only trading instructions are affected.  Up to now, that is : Firefox has now started occasionally failing with less sensitive instructions.  In fact Firefox is now so bad that I must use only Chrome.  I don't know where the fault lies -- broker, browser, me or all of us.  Thanks if you would convey this issue to your software team.   </p><p>Possibly the problem lies with overly tight security somewhere in the communication.

It seems to be in an update ""loop"". It advises an update is available but it's 102.2.0 which is already installed!  And this interference perhaps is causing the program lock up when I delete some read messages, so the only way out is a shutdown via Task Manager. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",bwfairhall

For example, if I pull up Google Docs, if I type a statement and try to bolden the text with Ctrl + B, I get the Bookmark sidebar instead. Ctrl + I for italics? Instead I get page info. Ctrl + U to underline? Instead I get a wall of coding. This issue is a consistent thing on all websites, for a variety of hotkey commands. </p><p>I can't find where I can change, or turn off hotkeys in general, the last three hours of scouring the internet, including the FF forums, have been no help. I can't tell if this is a setting I can't find, I change with an update, but whatever it is, it needs to be reverted. I'd very much prefer not to switch browsers over an issue that <em>should</em> be a changeable setting. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1040;,firefox,customize,en-US,1529431;1529433;1529435;1529436;1529441;1529445;,aaron.pounds91

If i hover / right click on the ""+"" to open a new tab i do not get a new container menu.  In customise toolbar there is not a facebook container icon/button (fence icon) to place on my toolbar. when i goto facebook there is no fence icon in the address bar.

I disabled all my addons restarted Firefox and enabled facebook container, but it still didn't work.
