I have not checked the box to block pop up windows, and although I seem to get most ads, sometimes pages full of them, at times, mostly on emails, there are empty spaces where an ad is supposed to be and I don't know how to disable any ad blocker because the only reference the Firefox settings has regarding ad blocking is the block pop up windows option, which I have not chosen.  CWTV thinks the shield in front of the address box means I have an ad blocker, and they told me how to disable that, but I know that is the Firefox traffic blocker icon. not an ad blocker.  So what do I need to do so I don't have any ads blocked? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1040;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1529455;,maruss

All of her passwords are in Apple's Keychain, which doesn't work with Firefox (or chrome, for that matter.) So I exported everything as a CSV for Firefox to import, changing settings as instructed to enable the option. However, importing the csv does Nothing. Nothing changes. What is wrong here? Did the function just break? How do we work with this? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1529456;,tallesttower1

Firefox is the worst, but Chrome and Edge are also affected.  Stopping and re-running the browser helps.  Only trading instructions are affected.  Up to now, that is : Firefox has now started occasionally failing with less sensitive instructions.  In fact Firefox is now so bad that I must use only Chrome.  I don't know where the fault lies -- broker, browser, me or all of us.  Thanks if you would convey this issue to your software team.   </p><p>Possibly the problem lies with overly tight security somewhere in the communication.

For example, if I pull up Google Docs, if I type a statement and try to bolden the text with Ctrl + B, I get the Bookmark sidebar instead. Ctrl + I for italics? Instead I get page info. Ctrl + U to underline? Instead I get a wall of coding. This issue is a consistent thing on all websites, for a variety of hotkey commands. </p><p>I can't find where I can change, or turn off hotkeys in general, the last three hours of scouring the internet, including the FF forums, have been no help. I can't tell if this is a setting I can't find, I change with an update, but whatever it is, it needs to be reverted. I'd very much prefer not to switch browsers over an issue that <em>should</em> be a changeable setting. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1040;,firefox,customize,en-US,1529431;1529433;1529435;1529436;1529441;1529445;,aaron.pounds91
