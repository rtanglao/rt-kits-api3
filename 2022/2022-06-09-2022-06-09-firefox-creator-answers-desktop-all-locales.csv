Currently have 22-23 open windows and over 1/2 have single tabs.,<p>For weeks my Firefox on my 2011 iMac 27 running High Sierra is opening a new window instead of opening a new tab automatically. If I right click on a link I can force it to open a new tab. My screen is full of 22 windows! I now have to copy the single tab in the new window and paste it in a new tab and then close the new window. Firefox has always been reliable on my iMac...until now. My OS is High Sierra running 32 bit programs only. </p>,desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1013;firefox-1010;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",andyhutch1947
