Firefox should copy Safari pinned tabs.,"<p>The best example of pinned tabs functionality on web browsers can be seen on what MacOS Safari is doing. Safari maintains pinned tabs across multiple windows and sessions, it also remembers the initial url used when the pin was placed, that means that when you open a new Safari session, the pinned tabs will always display the url you pinned and not the last page you visited on that tab. Firefox pinned tabs lack real world functionality, this point can be proven by seeing how many Firefox extensions for specific sites are on the extension browser.
