However, Google Docs does not work correctly.  Every time I open a Google Docs/Sheets/etc. file in one container, it loads in a new tab in another container. It does this even if I copy the link into a tab with the correct container. I need to keep my Google accounts separated: one is personal, the other is for work. I like Firefox, and use it to get away from Google in other ways. But I can't escape Google because of work and sharing files with certain people. I hope there is a fix for this. Thanks in advance. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1070;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",matthew.n.millar

I have looked at multiple (~3) Reddit threads (two of which were archived) which gave me a total of 0 answers, I've looked at other forums, and I've found, get this, <strong>nothing</strong>. It's so annoying when for whatever reason, my music gets paused and then it's not at the volume I need it to be at, so I turn it up and then almost immediately turn it back down because of the audio fading. All I want is to know how to disable this, PLEASE. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1070;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",SomeGuyNamedPhoenix
