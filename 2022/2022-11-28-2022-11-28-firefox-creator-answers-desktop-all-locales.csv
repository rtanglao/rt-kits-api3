I found an article that might be the answer (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1308646"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1308646</a>).  I tried to create a simple policy (below), but somehow it does not work (I can still install any add-on/extension).  What is wrong with my script? I'm using Firefox ESR 78.11.0 (64-bit) by the way. </p><p>My ""policies.json"" looks like this: </p><p>{ </p><pre>""policies"": {   ""ExtensionSettings"": {     ""*"": {       ""blocked_install_message"": ""Blocked!"",       ""install_sources"": [""<a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/</a>""],       ""installation_mode"": ""blocked""     }   } } </pre> <p>Sincerely, Jonathan </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1550595;,realdonut

On Nov 26 2022 I used Google Translate.

However, Google Docs does not work correctly.  Every time I open a Google Docs/Sheets/etc. file in one container, it loads in a new tab in another container. It does this even if I copy the link into a tab with the correct container. I need to keep my Google accounts separated: one is personal, the other is for work. I like Firefox, and use it to get away from Google in other ways. But I can't escape Google because of work and sharing files with certain people. I hope there is a fix for this. Thanks in advance. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1070;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",matthew.n.millar

I have looked at multiple (~3) Reddit threads (two of which were archived) which gave me a total of 0 answers, I've looked at other forums, and I've found, get this, <strong>nothing</strong>. It's so annoying when for whatever reason, my music gets paused and then it's not at the volume I need it to be at, so I turn it up and then almost immediately turn it back down because of the audio fading.
