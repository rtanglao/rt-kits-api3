Contrary to the support page, there is no option to report this to Mozilla; the only option is to retry. When I click retry, I get the same page with the error code PR_CONNECT_RESET_ERROR. This is not a problem with the website -- same website works fine in Firefox on both other computers in house, one running Windows 10 and one running Windows 11. This is not a problem with the operating system -- I have used both the system file check and distribution manager to check/repair Windows system files, and also successfully accessed the web page using Internet Explorer (Microsoft Edge is disabled in Policy Management). So this is clearly a problem with Firefox. I attempted to reset Firefox, but it didn't help. I then uninstalled Firefox, and attempted a clean re-install; I'm not sure how clean the reinstall was, because it detected the prior installation, and imported things. The sites I can't access include Wikipedia (of all things!), some links in the Firefox support pages, and my on-line banking website, which is pretty critical. Other websites work just fine, including most of my other financial accounts -- credit cards, etc. HELP! </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-960;firefox-9603;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",king.david

When I enter any URL address and click Enter, the browser goes to a continuous search mode.  The URL is never found.   </p><p>This is the address on the pop up tab:  moz-extension://a3413469-7bfd-4c15-be38-21f71d0ee74d/content/ui/privacy-prompt.html.   </p><p>The tab has a heading, “Norton Safe Search.”  Is this a Mozilla extension?  Is this a valid Norton extension?  How can I get around it.?  I would like to use my Firefox browser again.  Suggestions would be appreciated.  Thanks!   </p><p>Henry Meier, Jr.   [removed email from public] </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,other,en-US,1481188;,hmeier404
