I have ""Never remember History"" selected in my settings,  and I'm running is Strict Privacy mode, but every time I open a tab and the Pocket page appears - at the top of the page are icons of some sites I have visited in the past.   How can that be disabled so History is not remembered ? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-960;firefox-9603;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",eba212

I have a new computer. I never knew I could connect my mobile phone to retrieve my bookmarks and passwords, etc. If possible I need to recover my passwords to my Firefox browser on this new computer.  I signed into my Firefox account to see if I could locate them.  But have no clue if they were there or not. Is it possible for you to send them to my email or mobile phone on file?  My new computer is using the  IP address, so it should not be an issue to track and verify my IP location with my email address. Thanks, Kenneth McGowan [removed phone# from public] </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-710;,firefox,other,en-US,"",KNMSr

Then something happened which i never saw before. At first i tought the chinese must have hacked the global internet, turns out all i had to do was restart my pc. Anyways i still want to understand what happened. So i was using duckduckgo search engine as many many times before but i was prompted ""security issue ahead ssl error bad cert domain"". I was woondering what is wrong with duckduckgo as i never had any such issue before and i klicked ""i accept the risk continue"" then i saw chinese letters from what i can tell, might be somthing different.. I really tought for a moment the chinese hacked duckduckgo, so i decided to use searx as search engine, same result.. then i tryed google which for some reason was working normally. Inside of google i searched for ""top 10 privacy search engines"" and klicked on the first result, also the seccond and third result, all with the same outcome, ""connection not secure"". </p><p>But enough here, you should take a look at the screenshot attached. </p><p>My question , what reasons are there for something like this to happen? What exactly did happen? Why did i see chinese letters and what website was it displaying those? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1481209;1481212;,Firefox_Beginner

English is set as the preferred Menu and Content Language in Firefox. The menu is displayed in English as it should be. </p><p>Problem now is, some Firefox messages, i.g. the message that a website is asking me to confirm I want to leave, is in German, for apparently no reason. Even on English websites. It's not a major inconvenience, just weird. </p><p>I attempted to remove German from the alternative menu languages, for testing, but cannot. English and German both cannot be removed. A third language I add randomly can be removed. </p><p>I am aware that the locale I downloaded Firefox in cannot be removed, but I hardly downloaded Firefox in two Locales at the same time, did I? From what I can see I originally probably downloaded German Locale, since English is listed under Language Add-ons. </p><p>So what I am curious about is, how is it possible that Firefox gives me part of the menu/browser messages in English and parts of it in German? Does the English Language lack some translations? Hardly I'd guess. And why do I have two languages I cannot remove? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;language;firefox-960;firefox-9601;,firefox,customize,en-US,1481201;,glorenz2
