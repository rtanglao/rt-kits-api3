Unfortunately, this tends to result in me losing my tabs and having to find them all over again in Firefox. Usually it's not a big deal, as it's just a few tabs missing, and I can just remember what I need. This time, however, I've lost a weeks worth of tabs, and it was a very busy week. I can't remember what tabs I had open, and the few things I've tried to get them back, are not working.  </p><p>I have, unfortunately, already tried restarting my computer, which inevitably led to firefox being closed and reopened, and though I have tried to find my previous session data in the profiles information on my computer, it only has this session that is currently missing a week of work, and the session from the week previous.

I was woondering what is wrong with duckduckgo as i never had any such issue before and i klicked ""i accept the risk continue"" then i saw chinese letters from what i can tell, might be somthing different.. I really tought for a moment the chinese hacked duckduckgo, so i decided to use searx as search engine, same result.. then i tryed google which for some reason was working normally. Inside of google i searched for ""top 10 privacy search engines"" and klicked on the first result, also the seccond and third result, all with the same outcome, ""connection not secure"". </p><p>But enough here, you should take a look at the screenshot attached. </p><p>My question , what reasons are there for something like this to happen?
