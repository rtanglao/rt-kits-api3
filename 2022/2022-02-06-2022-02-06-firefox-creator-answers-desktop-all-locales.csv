Is there a way for me to restore that data? I haven't restarted my computer yet. </p><p>I was looking at other options:  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1290163"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1290163</a> and apparently there is an index.dat thing I could use as well, but I can't find it. I really can't afford to lose yet more data after my last mistake. </p>",desktop;websites;needsinfo;windows-10;firefox-960;firefox-9603;,firefox,websites,en-US,1481186;1481187;1481199;,allan.pregetter

English is set as the preferred Menu and Content Language in Firefox. The menu is displayed in English as it should be. </p><p>Problem now is, some Firefox messages, i.g. the message that a website is asking me to confirm I want to leave, is in German, for apparently no reason. Even on English websites. It's not a major inconvenience, just weird. </p><p>I attempted to remove German from the alternative menu languages, for testing, but cannot. English and German both cannot be removed. A third language I add randomly can be removed. </p><p>I am aware that the locale I downloaded Firefox in cannot be removed, but I hardly downloaded Firefox in two Locales at the same time, did I? From what I can see I originally probably downloaded German Locale, since English is listed under Language Add-ons. </p><p>So what I am curious about is, how is it possible that Firefox gives me part of the menu/browser messages in English and parts of it in German? Does the English Language lack some translations? Hardly I'd guess. And why do I have two languages I cannot remove? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;language;firefox-960;firefox-9601;,firefox,customize,en-US,1481201;,glorenz2
