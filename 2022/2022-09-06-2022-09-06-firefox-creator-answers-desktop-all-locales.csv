I REALLY NEED HELP ON THIS PLEASE!!  Hello, I have no idea where almost 270 website / user names &amp; passwords have Gone?? I used to have Over 300 in my Firefox/Mozilla Options/Passwords File, (Password Manager) up until 2 or 3 weeks ago.. Now, I have Only 33 user names/Passwords when I opened it up tonight..  The reason I went to FIND a user name &amp; password for it, is Because I have (2) Programs that are NOT OPENING UP now, And (1) Program happens to be my ( WEBROOT Internet Security &amp; Anti-Virus Software from Best Buy / Geek Squad..) This Webroot Loads Automatically every time I Boot my Computer, and Runs in the Background of my Windows 10 64-Bit operating System.. But, just about 2 weeks ago, the Webroot Dashboard that ""Normally Opens"" up in ""Green"", Now Opens up in ""RED"" and wants me to Provide my ""Membership ID"", and The ""Product Key"" to it.. And this is a Paid Subscription thru Best Buy / Geek Squad Every Year, ( and Does Not Expire until This coming November of 2022..)  So, Now I Know why this Webroot is Not Loading, and is asking me for my ""Information"".. Because I am MISSING This Information, And 269 Other Logins, &amp; Passwords from Mozilla Firefox..  Could SOMEONE? Please, Advise me as to ""WHERE"" the ""Encrypted"" (User names &amp; Passwords) are on my Hard drive?? And How do I ""IMPORT"" These ""FILES"" back into Firefox's (Password Manager)Â ?? Thank You, DEXTER in Texas.. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10401;,firefox,other,en-US,1531945;,harley-pilot
