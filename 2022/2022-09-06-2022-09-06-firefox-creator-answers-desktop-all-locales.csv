I do not have time to go back and forth because my help request was not actually read carefully (I have been having a lot of trouble with that lately everywhere I ask for help and it is frustrating). Thank you in advance. </p><p>My school uses Savvas Realize for assignments. EVERY other browser opens it perfectly, via the link we are given from the teachers, but I HATE OTHER BROWSERS. It does not automatically log me in like it is supposed to, just constant redirect then sign in screen which will not let me sign in (error message). I made sure all the other browsers were set up as identically as possible to this Firefox. I have tried *every*single* privacy and browsing function to try to unblock the constant redirects. Antivirus is not the problem nor is my VPN. Savvas, the school and the school district do not see anything on their side, &amp; I believe them, since this seems to ONLY be a ""on Firefox problem""; not Chrome, Opera GX or Edge. They all work. I even purchased a new laptop! </p><p>This STARTED occurring about the middle of last school year, sometime between October-March(?). It just all of a sudden stopped working and never came back. At this point my fingers are pointing to whatever update Firefox had around that time. </p><p>Thank you for help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1040;firefox-10401;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ninjadobot

I REALLY NEED HELP ON THIS PLEASE!!  Hello, I have no idea where almost 270 website / user names &amp; passwords have Gone?? I used to have Over 300 in my Firefox/Mozilla Options/Passwords File, (Password Manager) up until 2 or 3 weeks ago.. Now, I have Only 33 user names/Passwords when I opened it up tonight..  The reason I went to FIND a user name &amp; password for it, is Because I have (2) Programs that are NOT OPENING UP now, And (1) Program happens to be my ( WEBROOT Internet Security &amp; Anti-Virus Software from Best Buy / Geek Squad..) This Webroot Loads Automatically every time I Boot my Computer, and Runs in the Background of my Windows 10 64-Bit operating System.. But, just about 2 weeks ago, the Webroot Dashboard that ""Normally Opens"" up in ""Green"", Now Opens up in ""RED"" and wants me to Provide my ""Membership ID"", and The ""Product Key"" to it.. And this is a Paid Subscription thru Best Buy / Geek Squad Every Year, ( and Does Not Expire until This coming November of 2022..)  So, Now I Know why this Webroot is Not Loading, and is asking me for my ""Information"".. Because I am MISSING This Information, And 269 Other Logins, &amp; Passwords from Mozilla Firefox..  Could SOMEONE? Please, Advise me as to ""WHERE"" the ""Encrypted"" (User names &amp; Passwords) are on my Hard drive?? And How do I ""IMPORT"" These ""FILES"" back into Firefox's (Password Manager) ?? Thank You, DEXTER in Texas.. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10401;,firefox,other,en-US,1531945;,harley-pilot
