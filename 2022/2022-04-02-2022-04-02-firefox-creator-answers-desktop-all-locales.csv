When downloading the pdf it automatically opens up in the same tab, effectively closing whatsapp web.  Very annoying, especially when im trying to look at multiple files send in the chat, because every time i need to open whatsapp web again.  Instead of opening the file in the same tab I would like it to open either in a new tab or a new window but can't find any settings option that would allow me to do so. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",marvin0894

I've tried other browsers and have not had a problem, it's only firefox. I've done all of the technical things I can think of (clearing cache, resetting the browser, restarting my computer, completely uninstalling firefox and all data on my computer and then reinstalling) and nothing has worked. I can get the browser to run fine in troubleshoot mode but I'm unsure of what to do next to fix it. I've included a picture of the issue. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1494428;1494450;,mayakw2
