However, I am trying Firefox for a couple reasons, and there seems to be no way to have a bookmarks sidebar open. All the Help topics on this say to click the Bookmarks button in the taskbar, but there is no Bookmarks button in my version. Has this been taken away? Is it possible to have a Bookmarks sidebar in Firefox on MacOS? </p><p>Thanks! :) </p>",desktop;bookmarks;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1494555;1494566;,carol.teater
