I've tried other browsers and have not had a problem, it's only firefox. I've done all of the technical things I can think of (clearing cache, resetting the browser, restarting my computer, completely uninstalling firefox and all data on my computer and then reinstalling) and nothing has worked. I can get the browser to run fine in troubleshoot mode but I'm unsure of what to do next to fix it. I've included a picture of the issue. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1494428;1494450;,mayakw2
