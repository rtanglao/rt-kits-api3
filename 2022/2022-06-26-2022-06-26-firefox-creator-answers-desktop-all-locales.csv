I have an extension that shows my external IP as a country flag when FF starts up. If the flag doesn't show, I know I still cannot connect to any site. Similar to Zaayl's case, my FF can be able to connect to sites only after a certain amount of time, which varies from instant - very rarely - up to over 10 minutes. The wait always gets longer, especially when FF crashes and have to restart.  </p><p>I've been searching a long, long time for the right fix. I cringe at the idea that I have to reinstall FF every time there's a major issue, like this one. Syncing back bookmarks and passwords and reinstalling the extensions are the easy part. The painful part is having to set details of accounts in the containers afterwards. I am so glad that is over now. Connection to sites is no longer prolonged after FF startup.  </p><p>I wanted to thank the persons concerned, but I couldn't reply to their messages, which are now archived. So, I decided to post a new one here to do that; also, to help users who have to same issue as mine. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1514987;,mobilesuit600
