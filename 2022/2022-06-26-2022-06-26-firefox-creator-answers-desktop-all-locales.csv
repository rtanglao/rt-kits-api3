I will be using firefox, and anywhere between a few minutes, or a few days, it will suddenly stop loading anything and I will have to completely quit it and restart it to get anything working again. No, it is not the HTTP3 problem; that was the first thing I tried. I've also uninstalled, and reinstalled the entire program, clearing all settings, etc. I am on windows. Generally good on firefox updates, will check and update usually every week or two.  </p><p>Funny thing is, I also installed firefox nightly and that does not have this problem (although I have not used it as extensively as I normally do when browsing, so maybe I didn't hit whatever triggers this issue). It also works properly on other computers (as far as I'm aware). So I still think something is corrupt or wrong with my normal firefox program. I just don't know what or how. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1010;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",chibblesthegreat
