This had the desired effect on websites, but unfortunately also applies to plug-ins, some of which (like uMatrix) depend on changes of background color to convey information or have dark icons which become invisible on the dark background.

I have an extension that shows my external IP as a country flag when FF starts up. If the flag doesn't show, I know I still cannot connect to any site. Similar to Zaayl's case, my FF can be able to connect to sites only after a certain amount of time, which varies from instant - very rarely - up to over 10 minutes. The wait always gets longer, especially when FF crashes and have to restart.  </p><p>I've been searching a long, long time for the right fix. I cringe at the idea that I have to reinstall FF every time there's a major issue, like this one. Syncing back bookmarks and passwords and reinstalling the extensions are the easy part. The painful part is having to set details of accounts in the containers afterwards. I am so glad that is over now. Connection to sites is no longer prolonged after FF startup.  </p><p>I wanted to thank the persons concerned, but I couldn't reply to their messages, which are now archived. So, I decided to post a new one here to do that; also, to help users who have to same issue as mine. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1514987;,mobilesuit600

I will be using firefox, and anywhere between a few minutes, or a few days, it will suddenly stop loading anything and I will have to completely quit it and restart it to get anything working again. No, it is not the HTTP3 problem; that was the first thing I tried. I've also uninstalled, and reinstalled the entire program, clearing all settings, etc. I am on windows. Generally good on firefox updates, will check and update usually every week or two.  </p><p>Funny thing is, I also installed firefox nightly and that does not have this problem (although I have not used it as extensively as I normally do when browsing, so maybe I didn't hit whatever triggers this issue). It also works properly on other computers (as far as I'm aware). So I still think something is corrupt or wrong with my normal firefox program. I just don't know what or how. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1010;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1515014;,chibblesthegreat
