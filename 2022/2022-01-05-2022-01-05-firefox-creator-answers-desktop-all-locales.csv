Specifically, the tab crashes when I click on an link to open an email and see the email contents. The tab will not crash every single time, just occasionally (i.e. sometimes I am able to read an email without the tab crashing, other times not). I do not think that the timing of the crashing has anything to do with the email contents (e.g. length, format). I also do not think that the tab crashing issue is happening for any other websites. The crashing started recently, sometime late December.  </p><p>I installed the latest version of Firefox, and I cleared the web cache, but nothing has changed.  </p><p>Any suggestions? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",grittyminder
