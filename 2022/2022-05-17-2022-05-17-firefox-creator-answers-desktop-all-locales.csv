For that reason it seems, I keep getting prompted to pin Firefox to the Taskbar. </p><p>I don't want to do that, as I keep my taskbar small and uncluttered (nothing is pinned there). Hence I'd like to turn off being asked. However, when  I get the above message I have only 2 options: Yes or Not Now. And it seems 'Not now' means ""not now, but of course feel free to keep asking"". </p><p>Is there any way I can turn of this pop up permanently? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1000;,firefox,other,en-US,1505688;,Spinner5000
