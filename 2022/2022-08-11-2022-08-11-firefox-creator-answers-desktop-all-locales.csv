My doc is local php file, saving calendar events to text files, run on localhost. The field in question is a line number on my calendar. Javascript uses that number to load another input with the calendar entry so I can confirm that it's the correct line before submitting it to PHP for deletion.  I have unchecked 'Remember search and form history', ran 3 cleaners, restarted the computer and the data is (correctly) not displayed. But it is not deleted. When I rechecked 'Remember search and form history'  the old input data comes back. If I change id, field name, javascript function name and variable names the history disappears  but when I restore those names, the history is back. I want to know why that input can't be permanently deleted.
