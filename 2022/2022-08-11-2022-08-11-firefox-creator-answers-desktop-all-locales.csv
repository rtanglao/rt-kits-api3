App I am working on need to connect to remote host by webscoket and send auth cookies to it (aws guard). The problem is when I run app on the local host (dev mode), it works fine in every Chrome based browser, and even Safari, but unable to connect in FF. </p><p>For example, my app runs on localhost:8080, and Websocket host is <a href=""http://ws.dev.myapp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ws.dev.myapp.com</a> For successeful coonection, handshake request should include cookies from .dev.myapp.com domain, or even .myapp.com. So, you can see on screenshots, cookies not included on request from localhost, and we get 403 error instead of 101 on second pic. </p><p>I guest this is some secutiry setting I can tweak, but I can't see what exactly. Or can it be a bug? </p>",desktop;cookies;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,cookies,en-US,"",ilya5

My doc is local php file, saving calendar events to text files, run on localhost. The field in question is a line number on my calendar. Javascript uses that number to load another input with the calendar entry so I can confirm that it's the correct line before submitting it to PHP for deletion.  I have unchecked 'Remember search and form history', ran 3 cleaners, restarted the computer and the data is (correctly) not displayed. But it is not deleted. When I rechecked 'Remember search and form history'  the old input data comes back. If I change id, field name, javascript function name and variable names the history disappears  but when I restore those names, the history is back. I want to know why that input can't be permanently deleted.
