Also, I've checked the 2 relevant items in about:config an they are enabled.

This isn't a huge issue but it is affecting some text as well, meaning I can't print the documents directly from Firefox. I can download the documents and print them from Preview just fine, so it isn't an issue with the printer. </p><p>I'm attaching a screenshot of my print settings and an example of what Firefox is outputting (converted to JPEG so I can upload it). </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1014;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,other,en-US,1526291;1526292;,manicex

My doc is local php file, saving calendar events to text files, run on localhost. The field in question is a line number on my calendar. Javascript uses that number to load another input with the calendar entry so I can confirm that it's the correct line before submitting it to PHP for deletion.  I have unchecked 'Remember search and form history', ran 3 cleaners, restarted the computer and the data is (correctly) not displayed. But it is not deleted. When I rechecked 'Remember search and form history'  the old input data comes back. If I change id, field name, javascript function name and variable names the history disappears  but when I restore those names, the history is back. I want to know why that input can't be permanently deleted.
