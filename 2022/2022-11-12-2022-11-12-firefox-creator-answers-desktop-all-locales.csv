It's always worked fine but now won't open.  I get a white page with greyed out frames but no text or graphics or colours It works ok on other browsers, so if this is not fixed, I will ditch firefox for good. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Sunshiine

None of my extensions should be affecting this, and if it's UBlock Origin then....*sigh* </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",vltrykin

Probably existed on Firefox 105.?.? though unsure of extent as in the middle of upgrading entire system. Private browsing has not been used at any point. </p><p>Problem 1: some tabs do not appear in ""recently closed tabs"". They do appear in normal history. Other tabs appear as hoped and restore normally.  </p><p>Problem 2: some tabs do not restore when the session is restored. Again, these do appear in normal history. Other tabs appear as hoped and restore normally. </p><p>Problem 3: sometimes the tabs which had been restoring nicely stop doing so, and sometimes the tabs which were not restoring nicely do.  </p><p>Problem 4: intermittent, tabs seem to appear in ""recently closed"" and seem to restore, but to old pages which had long since been navigated away from. Annoyingly, when these appear in the ""recently closed tabs"" they are listed with the hoped for title and favicon (for example, about three days ago I navigated to an article from <a href=""http://ExampleForum.org"" rel=""nofollow"">ExampleForum.org</a>, then used the back button to return to <a href=""http://ExampleForum.org"" rel=""nofollow"">ExampleForum.org</a> and continued to navigate around <a href=""http://ExampleForum.org"" rel=""nofollow"">ExampleForum.org</a>, but if I close the <a href=""http://ExampleForum.org"" rel=""nofollow"">ExampleForum.org</a> tab and try to restore, it reverts to the article tab despite appearing in the list of recently closed tabs as an <a href=""http://ExampleForum.org"" rel=""nofollow"">ExampleForum.org</a> tab). </p><p>Unable to figure out what is different about the tabs which do not restore as hoped compared to the tabs which do, and am having considerable trouble performing sufficiently methodical tests. I guess I have as many cognitive glitches as my current browser settings! </p><p>Things I have tried, in approximate order, several repeated having tried different things: repopulating tabs with the desired content then closing them, repopulating a new window with desired tabs then closing it, adjusting preferences in about:preferences and about:config, clearing the startup cache, solutions suggested here <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1202514"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1202514</a> and here <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1197599"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1197599</a>, plus attempt to revert same, updating Firefox, rolling Firefox and the profile back to a previous version from a backup, resetting all containers, disabling multicontainer extension, opening tabs in new windows, consolidating windows, opening all tabs in one container, scrubbing older history, scrubbing all history, more combing over my settings, disabling syncing (this isn't set up with a separate device yet).  </p><p>Things I have yet to try: disabling all containers, using a fresh profile, disabling all extensions. </p><p>Further details part 1: when the sessions are restored, new tabs appear in lieu of the pages I want. These are in the containers assigned to the desired pages and appear in the correct order from left to right. Sometimes the tabs have the titles of the desired pages and their favicons despite being like new tabs in other respects, but more often they just appear as normal new tabs. </p><p>Further details part 2: from my fiddling around trying to find a fix, the problems worsen sometimes, but othertimes improve. I have yet to figure out a pattern with this or clues for how to move forward. </p><p>Further details part 3: results obtained from Firefox History Scrounger at <a href=""https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/scrounger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/scrounger.html</a> somewhat map to the behaviours described above, but unsure what to do with this behaviour. Some tabs show up here as much older than those displayed at the time even though the time stamps on the files in the folder all seem correct. The back/forward history view suggests related sessionstore glitches. </p><p>Thoughts on possible cause:  - corrupted sessionstorebackups-backups and/or xulstore.json, but unsure how to remedy these since suggestions did not work. - some kind of timestamp issue creating some fallback weirdness (unsure if this is possible) - being too addled to notice some obvious settings conflict </p><p>On the plus side, I don't tend to have more than 8 tabs open at a time with some constants, very rarely more than one window and never more than two windows, so restoring stuff manually isn't as much of a headache for me as it might be for most users. </p><p>Would really love some help with this as really lost and confused at this point. My apologies for the garbled account. </p>",desktop;tabs;mac-os-x-1014;firefox-1060;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",stuff14
