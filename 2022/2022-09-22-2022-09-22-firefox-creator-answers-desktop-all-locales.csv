I close the Firefox app, go to the Droid settings/App. I then Force Stop the app, go to Storage and clear Cache. When I restart Firefox the web page it was trying to load then loads properly. This problem happens continually- it does not mater if I am on Amazon, a news site, a forum, there is no different what place I am on the web. This is also happening with two separate devices running different versions of the Droid OS. The only common factor is Firefox for Android.

A common error message is K-Mode exception not handled but there are also watchdog errors.

The common factor is that a mouse cursor movement in Firefox always seems to cause the crash.

This turns out not to be entirely correct; I had lost them only when the active screen was an external screen (#2) connected by HDMI. Functionality was always correct on the laptop screen, or an external screen connected by VGA. This is entirely repeatable and demonstrable so there is something fundamentaly wrong with the way Windows 10 reports mouse movements to apps when they are displayed via HDMI. I will normally have Firefox running on an external screen on HDMI, and so this seems too much of a coincidence.

Firefox has been my default browser for the past few centuries and is likely to remain so until the internet itself becomes obsolete.  Recently I also installed Brave because I want to separate some of my internet activities from the rest.  The Brave installation process apparently set Brave as my default browser without consulting me.  So I went into my Firefox settings to return Firefox to ""default"" status.  That was simple enough, but what I also noticed at the top of my Settings page is a message I've never seen before which reads, ""Your browser is being managed by your organisation.""  </p><pre>   err... WHAT ORGANISATION???  My computer is a stand-alone ""home"" computer which I own and manage, and is not networked to anything, not even a printer.  When I connect to the internet it is by password protected mobile hotspot through my phone, but I make this connection only when I need it and disconnect when it is not in use.  </pre> <p>So, this unexpected message alarms me.   Have I been hacked and my browser been taken over by some unknown entity of whose existence I was unaware until I saw this message... or what?  </p><p>How do I block whoever/whatever the ""organisation"" is and take back permanent, secure control of my browser?
