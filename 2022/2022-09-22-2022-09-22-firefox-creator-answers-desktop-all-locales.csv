I am not sure if I have the correct settings activated so hopefully someone may be able to advise.  I have Windows 10,  laptop Accessing a ""********@usa.net"" address via  ""<a href=""http://smtp.postoffice.net"" rel=""nofollow"">smtp.postoffice.net</a>"" ""port 587"" Problem is that my junk, sent, draft, trash messages re download when I log back in again.  My understanding is that Thunderbird only downloads the headers whereas my Eudora downloaded the complete message so is the fact that it is only the headers being downloaded that it then re downloads them when logging back in?? It is so frustrating having to wait for these messages to download AGAIN when I am just trying to check my emails quickly. Can anyone advise what I might be doing wrong or what settings may need tweaking? Thank you </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;,firefox,tips,en-US,1535503;,waynemathieson

All other sites work normally.,"<p>Until a few days ago, the site <a href=""http://dailykos.com"" rel=""nofollow"">dailykos.com</a> worked relatively normally. (By normally, I mean that the body of each article, including links and some of the embedded videos/photos were there and could be read. The comments and some of the pictures have never loaded. I thought it might be due to my privacy settings or extensions, but those weren't that important to me, and I never tried to fix that.) Now the site's pages are blank except for the title (see screenshot). The site loads normally in Safari on my iMac, and in the latest version of Firefox on my wife's MacBook Pro. I've compared the settings between her copy of Firefox and mine, and I can't see any significant differences. (We are both still using MacOS Catalina, but plan to upgrade to Monterey very soon.)  </p><p>Things I've tried that didn't work include restarting both Firefox and my Mac, clearing my cache (it was zero bytes, but I clicked ""Clear"" anyway), deleting all cookies, including any for Daily Kos, except for a few cookies I need to keep, disabling all my extensions (see photo) and turning off enhanced tracking protection for the site. After these actions, I restarted Firefox, but the DK pages are still empty. An Internet search found only a few articles about similar but not identical problems from several years ago to January 2022. A search of the Mozilla returned zero results.  </p><p>I should mention that I -think- this started after one of the last two Firefox updates. I'm using version 105.0. I'm fresh out of ideas, and I'd appreciate any help the community or developers can give me. Thank you very much. - Don </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;website-breakages;firefox-1050;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1535490;1535491;1535499;,pthg3
