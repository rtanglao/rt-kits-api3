The app presents 3 small graphics images of their card and card reader to demonstrate where to find/enter info. These graphics are greatly elongated laterally, and crucial data entry box is missing or obscured, thus making login impossible. At the bank's suggestion, I logged in without problems using a different browser (AVG Secure), so it would appear to be a problem peculiar to Firefox. Can  I suggest that you liaise with Barclays to fix this problem? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1040;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",bluebottle47

Firefox has been my default browser for the past few centuries and is likely to remain so until the internet itself becomes obsolete.  Recently I also installed Brave because I want to separate some of my internet activities from the rest.  The Brave installation process apparently set Brave as my default browser without consulting me.  So I went into my Firefox settings to return Firefox to ""default"" status.  That was simple enough, but what I also noticed at the top of my Settings page is a message I've never seen before which reads, ""Your browser is being managed by your organisation.""  </p><pre>   err... WHAT ORGANISATION???  My computer is a stand-alone ""home"" computer which I own and manage, and is not networked to anything, not even a printer.  When I connect to the internet it is by password protected mobile hotspot through my phone, but I make this connection only when I need it and disconnect when it is not in use.  </pre> <p>So, this unexpected message alarms me.   Have I been hacked and my browser been taken over by some unknown entity of whose existence I was unaware until I saw this message... or what?  </p><p>How do I block whoever/whatever the ""organisation"" is and take back permanent, secure control of my browser?  Anyone who can throw some light on this will be much appreciated.

Now the site's pages are blank except for the title (see screenshot). The site loads normally in Safari on my iMac, and in the latest version of Firefox on my wife's MacBook Pro. I've compared the settings between her copy of Firefox and mine, and I can't see any significant differences.

After these actions, I restarted Firefox, but the DK pages are still empty.

A search of the Mozilla returned zero results.  </p><p>I should mention that I -think- this started after one of the last two Firefox updates. I'm using version 105.0.
