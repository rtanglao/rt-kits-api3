I have done this and using about:profiles can open the non-default (USB stick) profile in a new window, or set the non default profile as default, close, re-open FF into the alternate profile. All good so far. However this isnt working quite as I expected. If I switch to alternate profile, save a bookmark to the shortcut bar, then switch back to the other profile then after a second or two the bookmark I saved in the other profile appears on the shortcut bar?!? This happens whether I have opened alt profile in a new window, or have changed the default profile and restarted FF into the other profile. Is this because in both instances it is using the same local directory? The doesnt seem to be an option to choose a different local directory for the alt profile. This would be ideal if possible as it would ensure that there are no data crumbs left on my PC when using the USB stick profile which is important for my work security.
