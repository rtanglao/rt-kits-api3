Now I've come back to this issue and decided to just load v 102 to my laptop.  I want to be able to load all those emails and the address book.  Does v 102 read earlier versions of files, and which ones?   I have a large volume of emails that I want to load, review, and then archive about 99% of them.  I really need to retrieve the address books, get rid of duplicates and dead addresses, and then save about 85% of them a vcards before deleting them from the address book. </p><p>It would really help to have a list of the files that changed with each version, so that we can see what files we need to look for. </p><p>I'm hoping that 102 will convert all previous formats, and if not, I can have a list so I can migrate these v 68 files to 102 when it imports them. </p><p>Running Win10 21H1. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",ffs1

I got up and went to the kitchen and when I came back, Firefox was not present so I clicked the icon and a new tab opened up; all my previous tabs were gone. I went to ""about:crashes"" to submit a report for tonight but this didn't show in the reports. I really don't know what to do about the continuing crashes of Firefox? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",metaphysicial
