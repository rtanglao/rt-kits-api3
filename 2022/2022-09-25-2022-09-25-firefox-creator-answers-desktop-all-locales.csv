To restore, I just used the normal ""recently closed windows"" option and reopened my windows. Immediatly, all my tabs that were assigned to ""Containers"" were duplicated, and I lost the ""Simple Tab Groups"" order. For each tab on a container, a second was created without an assigned container. Fine, i thought, just closed 130 tabs that were unassigned, and moved them to the right Groups again. Next day, i open firefox, same thing. All tabs duplicated (but now on the proper groups). Closed 130 duplicated tabs and moved on. But I can't spend 5 minutes each day doing it! Testing more, I realized that every time I close and reopen Firefox, all the tabs assigned to a Container get a copy. If i close and reopen firefox 10 times, i will get 10 copies of all tabs, with no assigned containers to them, ending up with 1300 unnecessary tabs. </p><p>I just cant figure out how to fix it. Any advice? </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",stereohearts0242

Not with other browsers and, with the Internet Download Manager extension, I'm usually able to download multimedia content in FF. (That's been my workaround.) </p><p>For example, when loading this humble URL ... <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/d/d8/Plattenknistern_record.ogg/Plattenknistern_record.ogg.mp3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/transcoded/d/d8/Plattenknistern_record.ogg/Plattenknistern_record.ogg.mp3</a> ... if I have autoplay enabled, it'll crash right away (""Your tab just crashed""), without autoplay, it'll crash as soon as I hit play. No report gets created under about:crashes. </p><p>No difference if I create a new user profile and disable add-ons. Disabling hardware acceleration doesn't help either. I can't do without most of my settings and add-ons, so refreshing FF is not an option. I'd sooner try a new install (and then import my profile and reinstall add-ons), but that's laborious, not guaranteed to solve the problem, and I figure that there ought to be some way to diagnose a crash in such straightforward circumstances? Telling the JS debugger to pause on exceptions seems to be no help. </p><p>Twitter videos used to work, albeit without audio, so long as I didn't pause and then resume playback. Lately, after upgrading from FF 104 to 105 (or possibly through a change on Twitter's end), I get ""the media could not be played."" </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1050;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1536332;1536337;,fucsi
