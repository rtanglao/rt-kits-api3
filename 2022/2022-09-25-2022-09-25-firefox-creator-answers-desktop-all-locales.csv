So both firefox and chrome are bricked and refuse to work. </p><p>Im currently using microsoft edge to write this and im afraid to touch anything here or login to anything incase it also breaks. </p><p>Shortly after chrome gave up the game, i tried to do a full reinstall of firefox, again did not work, i then tried to do a reinstall of chrome, and the chrome installer now claimed i had no internet, whilst i was on call in discord and using other programs with internet. so chrome refused to install, I then managed to install the chrome 'standalone' which doesnt require internet and it worked, i did not import anything this time and just browsed around, and shortly after, once again, without logging into anything, it gives me the same error, and now even if i reinstall the standalone chrome, it refuses to work, once its broke its broke for good. </p><p>Im completely at a loss here i feel like ive been hacked or something because it works then suddenly its broke forever, ive been reading up that it may be something on my PC cutting the connection to everything but i really am clueless on what it could be, this was the first time i used my PC today, i didnt have any driver or windows updates, if anyone can provide literally any context or help here it would be greatly appreciated, im not one to make support tickets because i usually research until i fix it, but im out of options </p><p>Thank you! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Marc-ladzee

Next day, i open firefox, same thing. All tabs duplicated (but now on the proper groups). Closed 130 duplicated tabs and moved on. But I can't spend 5 minutes each day doing it! Testing more, I realized that every time I close and reopen Firefox, all the tabs assigned to a Container get a copy.
