Is it possible to check via JavaScript if a user has PIP enabled?

When will this happen? It is important for web designers to know whether a visitor uses this feature - for example to hide the original video. Or is there another method to hide it? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ChristophSchmid
