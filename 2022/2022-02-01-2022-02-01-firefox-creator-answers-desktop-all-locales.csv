Well, that wasn’t the one you needed after all, musta been the one next to it (Here is where we get to that strange and annoying part). You tap on the hamburger button again, expecting to still be in the same bookmark folder, but alas, you find yourself back at the very beginning (the default BM menu) again.  </p><p>I apologize for the long narrative, but it may serve for you to know what it feels like to have to keep starting over every time the bookmark menu is opened. To what end does that serve? It obviously couldn’t be for the sake of privacy or FF would be courteous enough to allow us an option to hide the Recently Bookmarked if one should so desire. I do understand why it would go back to default upon browser restart, but not upon closing the menu, there is no option to keep that open. Could someone please put that back the way it was? PLEEEEAASE? </p>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",lpsears63
