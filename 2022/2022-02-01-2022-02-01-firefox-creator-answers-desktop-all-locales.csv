But now when i use Mozilla firefox browser, a lot of websites are being displayed with a blark/dark background. I know it is the firefox browser as it does not do the same if i use other web browsers.  I tried looking up the issue and solutions. All i could find was some suggestion that websites are displayed according to the settings on my PC i.e if it is set to light or dark mode. I checked this and the settings have not changed. Also as previously mentioned, then if that was the reason, surely the websites would display dark when using another browser. I have attached a screen shot of the twitter website as an example. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,websites,en-US,1479980;,TKTrooper
