So in FF's address bar, I typed <em>yt</em> (my search keyword for YouTube), the composer's last name, and the piece's name in quotes. </p><p>This YouTube search-results page appeared (see screenshot), with a list of recordings of that particular music by that composer... Normal, right? </p><p>But when I right-clicked one of the results and clicked ""Open Link in New Tab"", the new tab told me I wasn't online. And indeed, I'd forgotten to turn my PC's WiFi adapter on. </p><p>How is it possible FF had already cached all this info—including thumbnail images—based on a search I'd never done?  </p><p>Yes, I've looked up other composers' music... But does this mean FF has cached links related to every possible YouTube search for <em>every</em> piece by <em>every</em> composer?? Or is it some particularly creepy kind of privacy invasion?  </p><p>Tech note: In <em>about:config</em>, I'd turned off <em>network.prefetch-next</em> but not <em>network.predictor.enable-prefetch</em> —could that have something to do with it? (Both are turned off now.) </p><p>Thanks for your theories! Baffledly, A. </p>",desktop;beta;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1090;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",ander111
