In Chromium-based browsers they have the URL ""*browser name*://settings/content/notifications"", so I could add this URL to bookmarks and access it quickly. Is there any way to do something similar in Firefox? Thanks </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,customize,en-US,1554289;,Chemitaa
