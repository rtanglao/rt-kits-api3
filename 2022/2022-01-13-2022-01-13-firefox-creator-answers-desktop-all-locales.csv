When I tried reloading the page it did not load at all. I have tried with many other websites and none of them loads. I have tried waiting to see whether an error appeared, but nothing. Whenever I try to close the browser after a while (approximately a minute) it shows an error message that the process has crashed. I have already sent the report a couple of times before quitting the process from within the error message. </p><p>I run a Dual Boot system of Windows 10/Ubuntu 20.04 I am only experiencing the problem with firefox in Ubuntu and other browsers work correctly on the system. I have re-installed firefox with ""sudo apt remove firefox"" and ""sudo apt install firefox"" and nothing changed. I have also updated to the latest version, tried disabling all the add-ons and switching the connection to ""no-proxy"" as suggested in the support webpage.

Ho provato ad utilizzare la funzione di aiuto per caricare il browser senza componenti aggiuntivi ma non funziona. Ho provato a disattivare tutti i componenti aggiuntivi uno alla volta e anche in blocco ma non si risolve nulla. Dal browser non funziona neanche la funzione per contattarvi.

Go to uninstall it, they ask if I want to refresh instead so I say yes. Browser refresh works for about 30 seconds and then stops loading the pages again.

After manually setting paper size to 8""x10"" and changing to black &amp; white printing in the Firefox print menu and in the Epson printer, and clicking the Firefox Print button, the Epson printer displays an error message "" PAPER DOES NOT MATCH YOUR CURRENT PRINT SETTINGS"". When the ""confirm current print settings"" command in the printer is opened , the only command that activates the printer is the ""continue printing"" button, which results in a color print without ANY black ink! </p><p>Please change the Firefox print operation and menu. Upon opening the print menu, The ""Preparing Print"" function Immediately begins the uninterruptible process of agonizingly SLOWLY previewing  EVERY page in the document before the ""Custom"" Button can be opened to request ""Print ONLY Page One"". There is also no menu item for two-sided printing, media type (photo paper, envelope, plain paper, etc.), or print quality (imitate the Safari Print Menu perhaps?) </p><p>I would appreciate help correcting these compatibility issues. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-960;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",pnugent3

Since its latest update it is far from nice. Too much stuff is set to darkmode, even though I have googled like crazy and fiddled with most, if not all, about:config options to try and restore it. </p><p>I will do whatever it takes, but my firefox theme (abstract firefox) must remain intact. Surely there is something I can do in the userChrome.css or whatever it's called. </p><p>It is just so very tiring having to fix mistakes made by firefox, that keeps changing stuff for the worse. Changes that nobody ever asked for. I am giving the browser one more chance for old times sake, since I have been using it for 20 years or thereabouts. So please, firefox... <strong>stop</strong> trying to force your users into using stuff that your staff team or whatever likes to use. <strong>Think of your users.</strong> </p><p>And please help me out. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,other,en-US,1473393;1473396;1473397;1473400;1473424;,fopibab368

I'd rather use Firefox, as I do for everything else. I have turned off the enhanced tracking protections and turned off my ad blocker and my anti-tracking add-on from Disconnect, and it still won't work.

Normally, this message does not appear and I go right to my email account. I have also unplugged both my router and modem, waited 30 seconds and powered them back up. This did not fix the problem.  </p><p>Any suggestions would be very much appreciated.  </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Andy </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,websites,en-US,1473373;1473392;,funemail
