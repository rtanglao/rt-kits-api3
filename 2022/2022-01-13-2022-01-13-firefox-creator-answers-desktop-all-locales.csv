The other bookmarks are in folders located in the "" Other Bookmarks"" folder and I have 6 links in the ""Bookmarks Toolbar"". </p><p>When I need to backup I use Export Bookmarks to HTML and save on PC. </p><p>Problem is that when I use Import Bookmarks from HTML, all folders are empty including Bookmarks Toolbar. All the missing links are now added to the bottom in Bookmark Menu.  I now have to cut and paste the links back into the empty folders. </p><p>Why are the links not going back to the same place when importing back. </p>",desktop;beta;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",ShadowAD

I'd rather use Firefox, as I do for everything else. I have turned off the enhanced tracking protections and turned off my ad blocker and my anti-tracking add-on from Disconnect, and it still won't work. I had this trouble earlier today when there was an internet outage in my area for my Wowway internet service, but after service returned I was able to log back into their system and open my email. </p><p>Now, I can still log into their system for my account, but when I click on the ""email"" icon, I get a message that says ""attempting to log you into your email now"" and something flashes in the bottom, left corner of the screen and my email never comes up. Normally, this message does not appear and I go right to my email account. I have also unplugged both my router and modem, waited 30 seconds and powered them back up. This did not fix the problem.  </p><p>Any suggestions would be very much appreciated.  </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Andy </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,websites,en-US,1473373;,funemail

The current iteration 96.0/Windows 10 of Firefox does not allow me to view these assignments and offers a pop up that says these apps require me to use session cookies. How to I install them? Will that need to occur once or each time I try to grade a video presentation?  </p><p>It seems your browser is blocking 3rd party session cookies which are required for the Kaltura application. To resolve this issue, please update your settings to allow 3rd party cookies. </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,cookies,en-US,1473375;,ginger.fv.angstadt
