After manually setting paper size to 8""x10"" and changing to black &amp; white printing in the Firefox print menu and in the Epson printer, and clicking the Firefox Print button, the Epson printer displays an error message "" PAPER DOES NOT MATCH YOUR CURRENT PRINT SETTINGS"". When the ""confirm current print settings"" command in the printer is opened , the only command that activates the printer is the ""continue printing"" button, which results in a color print without ANY black ink! </p><p>Please change the Firefox print operation and menu. Upon opening the print menu, The ""Preparing Print"" function Immediately begins the uninterruptible process of agonizingly SLOWLY previewing  EVERY page in the document before the ""Custom"" Button can be opened to request ""Print ONLY Page One"". There is also no menu item for two-sided printing, media type (photo paper, envelope, plain paper, etc.), or print quality (imitate the Safari Print Menu perhaps?) </p><p>I would appreciate help correcting these compatibility issues. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-960;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",pnugent3

Since its latest update it is far from nice. Too much stuff is set to darkmode, even though I have googled like crazy and fiddled with most, if not all, about:config options to try and restore it. </p><p>I will do whatever it takes, but my firefox theme (abstract firefox) must remain intact. Surely there is something I can do in the userChrome.css or whatever it's called. </p><p>It is just so very tiring having to fix mistakes made by firefox, that keeps changing stuff for the worse. Changes that nobody ever asked for. I am giving the browser one more chance for old times sake, since I have been using it for 20 years or thereabouts. So please, firefox... <strong>stop</strong> trying to force your users into using stuff that your staff team or whatever likes to use. <strong>Think of your users.</strong> </p><p>And please help me out. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,other,en-US,"",fopibab368

I'd rather use Firefox, as I do for everything else. I have turned off the enhanced tracking protections and turned off my ad blocker and my anti-tracking add-on from Disconnect, and it still won't work. I had this trouble earlier today when there was an internet outage in my area for my Wowway internet service, but after service returned I was able to log back into their system and open my email. </p><p>Now, I can still log into their system for my account, but when I click on the ""email"" icon, I get a message that says ""attempting to log you into your email now"" and something flashes in the bottom, left corner of the screen and my email never comes up. Normally, this message does not appear and I go right to my email account. I have also unplugged both my router and modem, waited 30 seconds and powered them back up. This did not fix the problem.  </p><p>Any suggestions would be very much appreciated.  </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Andy </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,websites,en-US,1473373;1473392;,funemail
