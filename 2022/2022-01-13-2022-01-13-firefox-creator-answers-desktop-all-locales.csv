This browser has everyday now for the longest time gone downhill and it is just getting worse and worse to the point it is unusable. To navigate the internet one can no longer simply use the great firefox to do so. Besides the browswer having issues itself, it seems just about every webpage does not work on firefox at all either. Sync is a joke, history doesn't even work ans saving passwords is useless. But my last issue, enough is enough and I am done. Trying for quite so time figure out why firefox is not loading my school book. It is redirect the URL a million times. Mobile and desktop FF. Use chrome and now only does it work, it is faster.
