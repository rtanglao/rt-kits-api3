Firefox Dev si apre non a tutto schermo ma a finestra ridotta e, nel mio caso, lo uso per gestire le richieste da una live chat. </p><p>Per avviare Firefox ridotto ad icona utilizzo il programma Min2Tray scaricato da Internet. </p><p>Il problema è che spesso Firefox Dev sia quando si accende in automatico richiamato dall'esecuzione automatica che quando lo ripristino da icona vicino all'ora di Windows a finestra intera non visualizza correttamente la pagina e mostra un rettangolo nero che scompare solo se muovo il mouse sulla barra della finestra. </p><p>È un problema fastidioso e mi piacerebbe risolverlo. Al posto di visualizzare la pagina visualizzo una finestra bianca con rettangolo nero, se poi muovo il mouse sulla barra della finestra allora compare il contenuto dentro Firefox. </p><p>Come posso far riprodurre questo problema e capire se può essere risolto?

I can change to the directory I want to save to and it will save there, but when I next save something it will again want to go to the /run/user/1000/docs folder. Further, I find that a copy of anything I save has also been saved into that folder, creating a new sub-directory to do so. I tried clear data in settings but that didn't delete those files and they are protected in file manager so I can't delete them myself. This will fill my hard drive pretty quickly as well as being really annoying having to change the save directory every time. What can I do to rectify this?

I opened the gnome system monitor and it showed that GeckoMain was overusing the CPU. There's also a process running called ""Privileged Content"". For as long as this additional process is running, Firefox is behaving as if there were no internet access - infinite time to load any page and if left undisturbed, after a while Firefox closes with a crash message. Also, for as long as this problem is happening, simply closing Firefox with the X button doesn't close it - GeckoMain is still running and the only way to actually close the browser is ""killall GeckoMain"". So I removed all extensions one by one in order to make sure it's not an extension causing this. It's not. Even after removing all extensions the problem continued which lead me to believe something in my prefs.js is causing it.
