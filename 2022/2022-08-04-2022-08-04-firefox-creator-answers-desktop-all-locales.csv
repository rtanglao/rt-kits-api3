I have read extensively about this problem, and it seems that the only solution is temporary. Any time I take my laptop to a different location (and thus use a different internet connection), my search settings are undone and the Yahoo redirect function is restored. Please help!! I have tried to run antivirus / anti-spyware software, but my Apple Chip Macbook Air 2020 is incompatible with a lot of existing software.

Firefox has no phone number or email system for technical support (or any type of support) just this hit and miss system of 'forums' (or is that fora). I tried to send a bug report but I am NOT signing up for another (geek speak) account just to send you the problem. Please fix this issue  - it never used to happen on older versions - how can I roll back my firefox to something that works properly??
