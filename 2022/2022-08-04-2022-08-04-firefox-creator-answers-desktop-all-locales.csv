The home page has no remote content - it's all local so I don't believe any remote content is being opened. There is only one tab open. </p><p>For each new tab I open I get at least one additional process. So with 10 tabs opened I ended up with 24 processes. </p><p>In FF91esr this was 3-5 processes. I also noticed under performance settings I can no longer specify the number of processes. </p><p>Is there any way to reduce this number to something more sane, like 3-5? </p><p>Also, why is there a Console Window Host running under Firefox? </p><p>Is the Node.js also new? I don't recall seeing it before </p><p>thanks </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",citizen1138x

On tumblr, the audio usually plays but the video is blank. On Twitter, the videos are always stuck loading. Thumbnails always load, there is no way for me to know if a video will work or not without trying to play it. </p><p>They work when I use a different browser, and Youtube is fully functional, so it can't be an issue with my laptop. The other person in the house who uses Firefox is able to play the same videos without issue. </p><p>I've searched for solutions and exhausted the possibilities in dozens of articles and support sites saying the same things over and over again. I'm at my wit's end.  </p><p>I've tried: -disabling hardware acceleration -audio and video permissions -clearing cache and cookies -disabling enhanced tracking protection -switching off adblocker -running it in troubleshooting mode  -refreshing Firefox </p><p>None of these did anything. Can anybody give me even a scrap of an idea as to what I can do? </p>",windows-7;desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1524725;1524730;,desperateforanswers

I´ve tried a few of FF versions and settings. My current version 103.0.1 64 bit loads it for few minutes and crashes when tabs appear. Some older versions loads it but after that have various problems with program interface: new tabs sometimes won´t open, no float tips when I´m hove cursor over tab header and so on. Also in such cases browser often crashes and not update old sessionstore file.  I have 16 Gb of RAM, FF takes up to 5,5 Gb before tabs appear for moment and FF crashes. I have such big sessionstore file earlier (for example, 24.07.22 it has size of 6,5 Mb), but all worked fine. Maybe there are any internal setting that I have to try? </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1524728;,goblin_online
