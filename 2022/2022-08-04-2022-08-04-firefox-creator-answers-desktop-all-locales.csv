There is only one tab open. </p><p>For each new tab I open I get at least one additional process. So with 10 tabs opened I ended up with 24 processes. </p><p>In FF91esr this was 3-5 processes. I also noticed under performance settings I can no longer specify the number of processes. </p><p>Is there any way to reduce this number to something more sane, like 3-5? </p><p>Also, why is there a Console Window Host running under Firefox? </p><p>Is the Node.js also new?

I´ve tried a few of FF versions and settings. My current version 103.0.1 64 bit loads it for few minutes and crashes when tabs appear. Some older versions loads it but after that have various problems with program interface: new tabs sometimes won´t open, no float tips when I´m hove cursor over tab header and so on. Also in such cases browser often crashes and not update old sessionstore file.  I have 16 Gb of RAM, FF takes up to 5,5 Gb before tabs appear for moment and FF crashes. I have such big sessionstore file earlier (for example, 24.07.22 it has size of 6,5 Mb), but all worked fine.
