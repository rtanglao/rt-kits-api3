No video or audio. This is incredibly  frustrating. Also, even when I was able to watch videos, the default was that the sound was off. I would like to know how to fix both these issues ASAP!! Thank you </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,other,en-US,1507434;,louisewats

Then if I refresh the page with CTRL-R, resources on the page (such as .js files) very often (seemingly 75% of the time) only partially load and therefore parse errors occur in the console.  <strong>To reload a page, I have to hit CTRL-SHIFT-R to bypass cache and then the page loads normally again.</strong>  I can also just launch the page in a private window (this loads properly), close the window and launch it again in another private window (this loads perfectly still) but it's becoming a chore to juggle with private windows only to reload a page I'm working on.  I can see the resources loaded under the NETWORK tab in the console but they don't seem to be available to the page renderer or something. </p><p>Is this a bug in v100.0.2 or was I only having a bad weekend and all of this is just a random glitch that will go away soon? I've never had a problem like this with any previous Firefox releases (even v100.0) and I've used FF for approximately 15 years.  It immediately began to happen after the v100.0.2 update! </p><p>What I have done so far: </p><p>- Exit out of Firefox and launch it again. - Rebooted the computer. - Site Information &gt; Clear Cookies &amp; Site Data - Waited 2 days for another FF release in case this was a bug and it rapidly got fixed (no update rolled out since). - Help &gt; More Troubleshooting Information &gt; Clear Startup Cache </p><p>Am I going crazy or? </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mozilla342
