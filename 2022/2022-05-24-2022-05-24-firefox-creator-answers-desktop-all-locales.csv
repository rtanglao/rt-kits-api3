Egy 8 perc hosszú mp3 esetében kb. 10 másodperccel  a zene vége előtt behal, mig a 12 perces számot csak 2 és fél percig játsza le. Tehát úgy néz ki a dolog, hogy minél hosszabb egy mp3 fájl, annál rövidebb ideig hajlandó foglalkozni vele. Ez a probléma 7.5 percnél még nem fordul elő. A weboldalamon hallgatom a zenéimet. Először azt hittem, hogy a scripteléssel van a probléma, ezért teszteltem a hosszabb zenéket a google cromban is. Ott ez a probléma egyszer sem fordult elő, míg a firefox egyfolytában ezt produkálja. A Firefox 100.0.2 32bites verzióját használom. A webldalon HTML5 audioba tagbe vannak beolvasva az mp3 fájlok. Az audio tag tipusa audio/mpeg. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,other,hu,"",gf_physics

If I browse to <a href=""http://www.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.google.com</a>, I just get a blank screen. </p><p>This seems to have coincided approximately with the release of Firefox 100, but I'm not totally sure it's related. If I clear all cookies and cache, that seems to resolve the problem temporarily, but it comes back.  If I open a Private window or another container, that also seems to resolve the problem temporarily, but it comes back. </p><p>Other browsers work with no problem. </p><p>If I open a new container, it will work for a while, but eventually stop connecting.  This doesn't happen with other websites.

Then if I refresh the page with CTRL-R, resources on the page (such as .js files) very often (seemingly 75% of the time) only partially load and therefore parse errors occur in the console.  <strong>To reload a page, I have to hit CTRL-SHIFT-R to bypass cache and then the page loads normally again.</strong>  I can also just launch the page in a private window (this loads properly), close the window and launch it again in another private window (this loads perfectly still) but it's becoming a chore to juggle with private windows only to reload a page I'm working on.
