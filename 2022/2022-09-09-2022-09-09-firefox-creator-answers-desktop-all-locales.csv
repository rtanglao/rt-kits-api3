However after 5 or 10 minutes the speed drops to a much lower leve. The Speedtest display shows 25Mhz for a few seconds then drops to a low level – a different level on each test. The problem does not seem to be affected by what web pages I open.  </p><p>Other applications in Windows 10 are also affected by the speed drop but if I close Firefox then other applications regain full speed. If I then re-load Firefox the same thing happens, initially full speed that after a few minutes the speed drops. </p><p>I have tried a different WiFi hardware and drivers but the problem still occurs. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",myken
