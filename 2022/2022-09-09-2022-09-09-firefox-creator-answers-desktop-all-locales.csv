I have copied my Firefox profile before from my last computer to this one that is crashing without issues at all. It copied all of my bookmark data, settings, logins, themes, add-ons, etc last time. This time it refuses to read any of the files copied. No add-ons, no bookmarks no nothing. I need this taken care of ASAP as this comptuer is on it's way down and the monitor likely only has days left the way it's running. Why does copying profiles no longer work? I know how to do it and I did the exactly the same as I did before. It's been an hour fighting with it and nothing is working. I need this done ASAP. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1040;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jen26

To be clear, this is a firefox issue because other browsers such as chrome still display everything perfectly. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1532662;,SchwhatNow
