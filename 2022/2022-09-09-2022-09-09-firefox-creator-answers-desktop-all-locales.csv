Since then Firefox 104.0.2 (64-bit) has been arbitrarily freezing; sometimes i have to restart the computer while most of the times I am able to kill the Firefox main process and restart Firefox.   </p><p><strong>The freeze occurs when i try to save a Web page</strong>; i don't see any ""logic"" as to which Web pages cause Firefox to freeze. It seems totally arbitrary.   </p><p>I clear my downloads list everyday (sometimes more frequently than that) and clear cookies &amp; cache everyday.   </p><p>I have selected ""no proxy"" by default, in 'Connection Settings'.   </p><p><strong>This never happened until after i upgraded to Ubuntu 22.04. </strong>  </p><p>I've browsed the support pages and don't find anything relevant to my problem.

I need this taken care of ASAP as this comptuer is on it's way down and the monitor likely only has days left the way it's running. Why does copying profiles no longer work?
