This issue seems to only be on firefox, I've tried chrome to see if it does it there and it's all fine. The issue is when you have the better TTV addon you can see custom emotes on twitch and some emotes are animated, the animated emotes sometimes freeze for a split second and lags the chat for the same time. I've disabled all addons on firefox except better TTV to see if other things are causing it, still does it. Made sure to test this on chrome as well with just the one addon. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1070;,firefox,other,en-US,1550389;,Skaithakk
