Basically; it no longer shows the URL info in the drop down box, only a blank, box appears.  I am using Windows 7 and the current Firefox 107.0.

If I manually disable my add-ons in normal mode on either machine however, the problem does NOT go away.  </p><p>One last odd point.  On my desktop, when I am in normal Firefox mode, and look at Bookmarks in the History tab from the menu bar, the last (bottom most) bookmark, and ONLY the last bookmark WILL display the box info correctly.  On my Win 7 laptop the same effect occurs, but the last (bottom most), bookmark will sometimes work properly in other folders, such as Other bookmarks for instance. </p><p>Also; the URL box does work properly with the ‘Show your bookmarks’ button, and the bookmarks menu if I use the “Open application menu”.  These options produce too much ‘white space’ however, and are not as convenient to use.  The drop down box works fine with other browsers, but Firefox is my favorite browser.  I have searched the Internet and the forum, and not found a similar problem. </p><p>Attached are two photos showing the result in normal and troubleshooting mode.

I just need to know what files to copy over from the backup drive Profile folder to the messed up drive's Profile folder. I am hoping it will be that easy and I can copy the tab files and not the entire Profile folder. Thanks. </p>",windows-7;desktop;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1550533;,WW13

For example often if I type something into the google search box at the right of the address bar and hit return nothing happens until I go down and select Bing instead of the google setting. Also in hotmail (I am on a desktop) if I go to reply, the original is now ether twice. This does not happen if I use Google browser. But I prefer Firefox as I have used it for years. </p><p>My concern is if I delete Firefox and reinstall it, I may lose some of the settings or bookmarks that I have set over the years. </p><p>Any suggestions? Please simple as i am old and not computer savvy. </p><p>Your help would be so appreciated.

This issue seems to only be on firefox, I've tried chrome to see if it does it there and it's all fine. The issue is when you have the better TTV addon you can see custom emotes on twitch and some emotes are animated, the animated emotes sometimes freeze for a split second and lags the chat for the same time. I've disabled all addons on firefox except better TTV to see if other things are causing it, still does it. Made sure to test this on chrome as well with just the one addon. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1070;,firefox,other,en-US,1550389;,Skaithakk
