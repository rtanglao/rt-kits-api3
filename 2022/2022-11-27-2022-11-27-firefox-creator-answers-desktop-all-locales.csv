For example often if I type something into the google search box at the right of the address bar and hit return nothing happens until I go down and select Bing instead of the google setting. Also in hotmail (I am on a desktop) if I go to reply, the original is now ether twice. This does not happen if I use Google browser. But I prefer Firefox as I have used it for years. </p><p>My concern is if I delete Firefox and reinstall it, I may lose some of the settings or bookmarks that I have set over the years. </p><p>Any suggestions? Please simple as i am old and not computer savvy. </p><p>Your help would be so appreciated. I am currently on Firefox 107.0 (64 bit) </p><p>Thanks, Anthony </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1070;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",avwood

This issue seems to only be on firefox, I've tried chrome to see if it does it there and it's all fine. The issue is when you have the better TTV addon you can see custom emotes on twitch and some emotes are animated, the animated emotes sometimes freeze for a split second and lags the chat for the same time. I've disabled all addons on firefox except better TTV to see if other things are causing it, still does it. Made sure to test this on chrome as well with just the one addon. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1070;,firefox,other,en-US,1550389;,Skaithakk
