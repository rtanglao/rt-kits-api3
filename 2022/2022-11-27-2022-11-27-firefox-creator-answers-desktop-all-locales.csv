I tried refreshing and restarting the computer but the problem persisted. I look at task manager and it was using 90% of my computer's memory. Naturally I looked online and tried using Firefox in Troubleshoot mode. This resolved the issue so I refreshed Firefox and disabled every add-on only to find that the problem was still there. It seems that some tabs are using too much memory almost instantly. For example, I had gmail open and it used 2gb in 1 minute. </p><p>I'm attaching some screenshots and files that may work. Would love to know how to resolve this! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1070;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",bautilurbe

This issue seems to only be on firefox, I've tried chrome to see if it does it there and it's all fine. The issue is when you have the better TTV addon you can see custom emotes on twitch and some emotes are animated, the animated emotes sometimes freeze for a split second and lags the chat for the same time. I've disabled all addons on firefox except better TTV to see if other things are causing it, still does it. Made sure to test this on chrome as well with just the one addon. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1070;,firefox,other,en-US,1550389;,Skaithakk
