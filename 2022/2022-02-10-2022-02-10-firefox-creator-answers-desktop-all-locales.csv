This included: instances of the browser not opening after closing all tabs (I have been unable to open Firefox again unless restarting/shutting down and booting up the pc again), webpages failing to load properly (seen in attached screenshot), links to websites or content like videos on YouTube failing to load if right-clicked and the option ""Open Link in New Tab"" is selected and must be clicked at least twice, otherwise they fail to load like in the screenshot, and hanging while connecting to some websites with certain addons active (namely <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a>). I also have reason to believe trying to fix these issues crashed my computer by locking it into a perpetual loop of crashing, collecting error data, restarting, and crashing again. Going back to Chrome to write this, I have had no problems. </p><p>I have tried refreshing Firefox several times, disabled hardware acceleration in the options, reinstalled about three times after deleting <em>all</em> Mozilla folders on my pc, disabled browser addons one by one to determine if one of them was causing problems, and removed and added Firefox to my firewall's allowed connections at least seven times by now. </p><p>tl/dr; Firefox broke after it automatically updated and I tried every solution I could search up. The browser still isn't working. Please help? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",silentthinker882

Unless this is linked to the new update I don't know why this has started now unless I have installed malware unknowingly or my new roommate or Vodafone have ""put something on the network"". Though from looking at other similar questions I think it may just be an issue with certificates?  </p><p>I don't have any third-party antivirus, just Defender, date and time zone are set automatically and HTTPS Everywhere doesn't seem to be affecting the issue. </p><p>Does anyone know what ""root.home"" is, why it is causing this problem, and how I can stop it recurring every other time I use Firefox?

I also checked my history and there is nothing. All have been wiped out.  I restarted my firefox because it detects my letters as keyboard shortcuts , I tried to exit and open it first but it is still there. Then, I used troubleshoot mode to restart the firefox. It was fixed after that but after using firefox for a while I noticed all my bookmarks are gone, then, checked everything was gone. I tried restoring bookmarks by profiles but firefox didn't create a profile it was only a default profile in there. I haven't log in my account on this device because i forgot. Please help I really those bookmarks back.

Then I went ahead and tried again still no improvement. If I try opening a new tab and closing the others the same thing no difference.  </p><p>I then noticed a windows update was going so I let it finish then restarted the computer and when it was ready checked firefox again and still nothing. So now I'm using Edge to type this out and am having no issue getting to any site that I was trying earlier.  </p><p>Is there anything else I can do?

I tried restoring my last browsing session, and all tabs where similarly blank.  Attached an image of what I see on a new tab page as well as any other page. The only settings menu I was able to open was ""more troubleshooting info"" page, by which i mean it is the only thing that actually loaded any content.  Things I have tried: -Refreshing Firefox. It seem to go through the process, but when it is done the pages are similarly blank.  -Uninstalling, then reinstalling. I reset my computer after uninstalling and then re-downloaded Firefox, same results. -Logging out of Firefox. I didn't really expect this to do anything but tried just in case. -Refreshing the cashe. I used the shortcut to open the browser history clear, and cleared cookies and cashe. -Opening Firefox in safe mode, has the same issue. -Used my anti-malware Webroot Security to check my computer for malware, nothing turned up.  -Re-allowing Firefox through windows firewall. Did this by removing it from the list of allowed programs, then adding it again. -Ensuring my compatibility preferences didn't have anything selected.  -Through the troubleshooting page I was able to access the about:config page (this page would not load if i opened a new tab and typed in about:config, ONLY if I changed the URL from about:support, the only page i could load, to about:config) and ensuring that browser.newtabpage.enabled was set to true. </p><p>Firefox is working perfectly fine on my laptop, and I was working last night on my PC, the only difference being that was a small windows update.
