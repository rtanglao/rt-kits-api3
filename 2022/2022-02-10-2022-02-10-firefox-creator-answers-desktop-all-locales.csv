On my laptop PC, when FIREFOX updated to the latest version in the past several months, the Bookmarks no longer appear on the left side of the screen immediately when I open FIREFOX.  In order to see the Bookmarks, I have to click on a small icon at the upper right hand corner of the screen. Then, the Bookmarks appear on the right side of the screen. I have been through all the items in the Settings screen, checked each subheading for any item pertaining to moving the Bookmarks to the LEFT side, but have found nothing. I first checked your knowledge base, and while it reported 2 responses, neither one of them correctly addressed this particular problem. Please help. </p>",windows-7;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-970;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1482271;1482272;,KARL_TAUSCHEN

Today when I opened it, it was slow loading my homepage (my email account) and would open new windows but never open anything in them. It would open new windows from links in an email. It would give no error messages and there was no spinning circle or anything else to indicate that it was working. When I typed in an address and entered, nothing happened. I tried the refresh, but that window wouldn't open. I did a reinstall and now my home page won't even come up. I have an Alienware x17 R1 running Windows 10. Other browsers (Microsoft Edge, Opera) run fine. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1482274;1482276;,bunnydaddyx11

I've tried refreshing the install, uninstall/reinstall, and updating my Microsoft visual c++ redistributables and this problem persists. By ""not loading webpages,"" I mean that it doesn't even show that it's directing to any webpages when I attempt to route to them.

I tried restoring my last browsing session, and all tabs where similarly blank.  Attached an image of what I see on a new tab page as well as any other page. The only settings menu I was able to open was ""more troubleshooting info"" page, by which i mean it is the only thing that actually loaded any content.  Things I have tried: -Refreshing Firefox. It seem to go through the process, but when it is done the pages are similarly blank.  -Uninstalling, then reinstalling. I reset my computer after uninstalling and then re-downloaded Firefox, same results. -Logging out of Firefox. I didn't really expect this to do anything but tried just in case. -Refreshing the cashe. I used the shortcut to open the browser history clear, and cleared cookies and cashe. -Opening Firefox in safe mode, has the same issue. -Used my anti-malware Webroot Security to check my computer for malware, nothing turned up.  -Re-allowing Firefox through windows firewall. Did this by removing it from the list of allowed programs, then adding it again. -Ensuring my compatibility preferences didn't have anything selected.  -Through the troubleshooting page I was able to access the about:config page (this page would not load if i opened a new tab and typed in about:config, ONLY if I changed the URL from about:support, the only page i could load, to about:config) and ensuring that browser.newtabpage.enabled was set to true. </p><p>Firefox is working perfectly fine on my laptop, and I was working last night on my PC, the only difference being that was a small windows update. It has never done this before. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1482253;1482262;,cakedustmc
