I have cleared history, refreshed, uninstalled and reinstalled the browser several times. This is a problem with both my laptop and my desktop. The desktop will not even arrive at the opening screen.  Microsoft Edge works.  AOL works. I have screened for viruses.  The tabs are blank and they keep churning.      I am running Windows 10 on both computers. I have gone thru the Control panel series of steps to make sure Foxfire is enabled properly with Windows 10 firewall.      I can get to the opening screen of Foxfire, but none of my bookmarks work.     For instance, I can sometimes access Yahoo Finance, but only when I open and close tabs that don't work several times using the box links to the several common websites featured in the opening screen for Foxfire. When I do the same routine with the Pocket recommended links the tabs open but just keep churning.    When I try to open <a href=""http://Fidelity.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Fidelity.com</a>, neither clearing history, nor accessing through a Google Search nor from my favorite meets with any success. I've tried every means I know to open Fidelity.       Appreciate any suggestions.       Michael W. Styga </pre>",desktop;websites;,firefox,websites,en-US,1482513;,michaelwstyga
