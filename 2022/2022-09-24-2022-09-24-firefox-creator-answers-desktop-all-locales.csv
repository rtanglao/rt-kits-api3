This is a pretty strange problem and I'm having trouble describing it, so please bear with me. </p><p>Since a day or two ago, I've been experiencing a problem where a small number of videos play, but once they get to <em>right</em> before the end, it'll abruptly stop. The play button looks as though the video is still playing even though it's really not, and clicking the play button does nothing. The only way to get the video to play again is to either refresh the page, move the progress bar back to a previous part of the video, or go all the way to the end of the video, in which case it'll allow me to replay it. The videos this problem happens on are completely random, but the problem persists on the same exact videos. This happens with both direct links to videos (i.e. <a href=""https://v.redd.it/kp4vglhwenp91/DASH_1080.mp4?source=fallback"" rel=""nofollow"">videos like this one</a>) and ""embedded"" videos (like videos on Reddit, TikTok, YouTube, etc). However, this only happens if the video has no sound or the sound is off, whether I've muted the tab or turned the sound off on the video directly. It also doesn't matter if the video is looped. </p><p>There's also a slightly different variation of this issue that seems to happen less often. With this problem, videos will stop right before the end like the videos that have the other problem, but only for a few seconds - after that, the video will end like normal and I can replay it. </p><p>I've tried restarting my computer, playing the problematic videos in a private window, disabling all of my extensions, using Troubleshoot Mode, refreshing Firefox, and even uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox. This problem does NOT happen on Microsoft Edge. I'm 99% sure it's because of the new update (105.0), as this issue has only started happening after I updated to it. I updated to 105.0.1 earlier today, and it's still happening. I'm thinking of going back to 104.0.2 if this glitch doesn't get fixed (or at least I don't get help) soon, because I know this issue will seriously get annoying after a while. </p><p>Two of the videos that have this problem are <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalsBeingBros/comments/xm4pu7/weighted_blanket/"" rel=""nofollow"">this video</a> and <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalsBeingBros/comments/xk5ri1/bros_from_day_one/"" rel=""nofollow"">this video</a>. Note that both have the secondary version of this problem. I would have uploaded a video of the problem to this post, but this website doesn't let me, so I attached the best screenshot I could take instead. </p><p>Any help would be appreciated! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",David_H23

The Player eventually catches up with the downloaded data and simply Quits when there is none left. This has never been a problem before until this last update . . . .  I have tried with Avast's Secure Browser and with MS Edge Browser and BOTH these stream WELL AHEAD of playback - so the problem doesn't arise . . . .  With these two Browsers playing an 8 minute .mp3, by the time the player has reached 5 minutes, ALL the remaining data has been downloaded . . . .  I made a video from the screen (Bandicam) but the &lt;add images&gt; doesn't allow it . . . .  Any Ideas? Or perhaps I wait for the next update and hope it gets fixed . . . .

Not the bookmark folders in the toolbar, url address bar or tabs. The default is a microfont that is hard to read for some of us. The old add-on is no longer useful, and one other suggestion I was able to find involved changing the settings in configsys. That is an absurd solution for someone not familiar with changing code or intimidated by the process. I'd love to know if there is an easier solution that I'm missing here.
