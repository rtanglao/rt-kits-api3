Up until two days ago, Firefox would always consider it to be in light mode (which I prefer) whenever I'd use it. Now, however, it's in dark mode, and the only way I can return to light mode is to give up my custom theme and instead choose Light as a theme, which I don't like as much as Charlies Red. </p><p>Is there a way to force light mode on regardless of which theme I use? One source said I could go to about:config and create a ui.systemUsesDarkTheme number, setting it to 0, but I tried it to no avail and so deleted the number. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-960;firefox-9601;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",nick151
