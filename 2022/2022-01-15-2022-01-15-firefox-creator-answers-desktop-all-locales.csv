During the latest update Mozilla removed my most loved feature that asked you what you wanted to do with a file before downloading it. I tried to fix this by going into the settings and changing it to always ask for every file type, but many file types are just missing and I am unable to get them to appear. I looked on my other computers and all file types are present there but not on my desktop for some reason. Is there any way to fix this or to get Firefox to ask before downloading again? </p><p>Thanks </p><p>(I added an img of what the settings look like) </p>",desktop;beta;customize;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,customize,en-US,1474381;,parker.wallenmeyer
