Now my Firefox will not open the tabs. Is there some setting I need to change someplace?  Also when I use the Google search it will not search for anything as well.  When I opened MS Edge, sometimes I can get my tabs to open.  When I close down the next time I open Firefox it will not open my saved Tabs </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-11;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",jschomber
