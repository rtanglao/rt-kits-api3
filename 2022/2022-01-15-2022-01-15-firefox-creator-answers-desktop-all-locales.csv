Can you tell me how to accomplish this? I may have requested it stay in plain sight-not sure, but I would feel better to have it removed so that I would fill it in each time. Thank you for your time in this matter. Sincerely Bruce R. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",bremington1

Now my Firefox will not open the tabs. Is there some setting I need to change someplace?  Also when I use the Google search it will not search for anything as well.  When I opened MS Edge, sometimes I can get my tabs to open.  When I close down the next time I open Firefox it will not open my saved Tabs </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-11;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",jschomber
