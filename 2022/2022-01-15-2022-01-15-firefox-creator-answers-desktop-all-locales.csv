During the latest update Mozilla removed my most loved feature that asked you what you wanted to do with a file before downloading it. I tried to fix this by going into the settings and changing it to always ask for every file type, but many file types are just missing and I am unable to get them to appear. I looked on my other computers and all file types are present there but not on my desktop for some reason. Is there any way to fix this or to get Firefox to ask before downloading again? </p><p>Thanks </p><p>(I added an img of what the settings look like) </p>",desktop;beta;customize;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",parker.wallenmeyer

Can you tell me how to accomplish this? I may have requested it stay in plain sight-not sure, but I would feel better to have it removed so that I would fill it in each time.

Now my Firefox will not open the tabs. Is there some setting I need to change someplace?  Also when I use the Google search it will not search for anything as well.  When I opened MS Edge, sometimes I can get my tabs to open.
