I am using a Windows 7 PC with whatever Firefox version is the most current. </p><p>Among the responses from their ""experts,"" I see something that has to do with ""browser add-ons may be causing your problem."" </p><p>I have looked at my Firefox settings &gt; manage your extensions as well as settings &gt; manage your plug-ins.  Under Extensions enabled I  have 2: Norton Safe Search and Norton Safe Web.   Under Plug-Ins enabled I have OpenH264 Video Codec and Widevine Content Decryption Module.   That's all.  Could any of these be causing the problem? </p><p>Does this ""rendering"" error have anything to do with Javascript?  (I thought Firefox did not support Java so never paid any attention).  If it does relate to Javascript, how do I fix my Firefox browser settings to enable it for the <a href=""http://Xfinity.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Xfinity.com</a> website to see if that fixes anything? </p><p>This is so incredibly discouraging. </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",smittydm

It takes a lot of work to get Windows itself to respect these options, to the extent that I have to make it believe Segoe UI isn't present by modifying a different registry location (Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts). </p><p>However, Firefox does not respect the FontSubstitutes settings. Based on a previous post here, this is something it did prior to Firefox 89, but has stopped doing. </p><p>An ideal solution would be a way for Firefox to correctly read my FontSubstitutes settings. An acceptable workaround would be a way to provide Segoe UI for Firefox to use while still preventing its use in other applications. (I know that, for instance, Adobe Photoshop allows users to install fonts to Photoshop itself, bypassing the system fonts folder entirely.) </p>",desktop;beta;customize;windows-10;firefox-1090;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",wobbuvahi

This used to work just fine until today: now the tab opens as usual, load gmail, I can glimpse at an email with the correct recipient but the tab closes straight away, without giving me any opportunity to interact.
