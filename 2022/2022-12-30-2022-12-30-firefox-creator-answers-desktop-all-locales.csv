This used to work just fine until today: now the tab opens as usual, load gmail, I can glimpse at an email with the correct recipient but the tab closes straight away, without giving me any opportunity to interact. I found a very similar post from half a year ago: <a class=""new"" href=""/en-US/kb/new?title=Clicking+on+a+%22mailto%22+link+opens+a+new+tab+then+automatically+closes+immediately"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Page does not exist."">Clicking on a ""mailto"" link opens a new tab then automatically closes immediately</a>, but as far as I understand the solution was to restart the computer (which I tried...). I could not find any other lead... Any idea? </p><p>With thanks and best regards </p>",desktop;tabs;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",cambray.guillaume
