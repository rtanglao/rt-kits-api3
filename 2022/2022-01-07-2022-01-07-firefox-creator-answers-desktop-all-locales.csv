I have Firefox set up to have new tabs be the default Firefox home page.  Those new pages display a Google search section but when I type in that section, the text switches to the address bar for the search.  How can I make the search happen on the page, not the address bar? Under Settings/Search, it has a search setting section with only 2 choices - Use the address bar for search and navigation &amp; Add search bar in toolbar.  I've tried it both ways, and the same thing happens.   My previous computer (both are Windows 10) did not have this problem.  I could type/search in the Google search section. Thoughts? </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-950;firefox-9502;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",judydevore
