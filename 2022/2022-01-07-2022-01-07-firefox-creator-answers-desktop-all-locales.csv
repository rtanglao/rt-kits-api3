Upon browser update, Firefox stopped displaying mask of any image format (SVG or PNG). </p><p>I did solve this issue in 2020 by changing the settings. about:config &gt; privacy.file_unique_origin changing: to 'false' &gt; refresh tab. Yet, since October 2021, it's no longer helping. After a browser update, I don't see the images with a mask, see attachment. The mask images show OK when the HTML page is on the server, but codding requires a constant 'quick check,' and usually uploading to the server is a final step. Can anyone help? </p><p>I prepared a simple example page [<a href=""https://artenergy.com/mask"" rel=""nofollow"">https://artenergy.com/mask</a>] with a download link. Thus one can open this file locally to see the issue. </p><p>Thank you! </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-950;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1471844;,sergey16
