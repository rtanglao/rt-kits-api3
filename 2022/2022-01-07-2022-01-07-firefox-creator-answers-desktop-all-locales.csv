I am a Nord user who is a little disenchanted with their extension on Firefox, and simply want to use a manual proxy to browse instead.  </p><p>When updating my proxy settings, I do what every YouTube or WikiHow article would tell you, and I search for the best available Nord server for my region, copy the link directly, apply it to the manual proxy setting, set all proxies to this same link, and set the port to 80. </p><p>However, instead of prompting me for a login/password after closing and reopening the browser, every single page instead goes through a connection timeout and ultimately fails to load altogether.  </p><p>Has anyone else experienced this and discovered a fix? Or can you perhaps guide me through a mistake I am making, perhaps in my process or a setting which I overlooked?  </p><p>Thank you all very much in advance. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-950;firefox-9502;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",FourthFromHere

Upon browser update, Firefox stopped displaying mask of any image format (SVG or PNG). </p><p>I did solve this issue in 2020 by changing the settings. about:config &gt; privacy.file_unique_origin changing: to 'false' &gt; refresh tab. Yet, since October 2021, it's no longer helping. After a browser update, I don't see the images with a mask, see attachment. The mask images show OK when the HTML page is on the server, but codding requires a constant 'quick check,' and usually uploading to the server is a final step. Can anyone help? </p><p>I prepared a simple example page [<a href=""https://artenergy.com/mask"" rel=""nofollow"">https://artenergy.com/mask</a>] with a download link. Thus one can open this file locally to see the issue. </p><p>Thank you! </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-950;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1471844;,sergey16

I have Firefox set up to have new tabs be the default Firefox home page.  Those new pages display a Google search section but when I type in that section, the text switches to the address bar for the search.  How can I make the search happen on the page, not the address bar? Under Settings/Search, it has a search setting section with only 2 choices - Use the address bar for search and navigation &amp; Add search bar in toolbar.  I've tried it both ways, and the same thing happens.   My previous computer (both are Windows 10) did not have this problem.  I could type/search in the Google search section.
