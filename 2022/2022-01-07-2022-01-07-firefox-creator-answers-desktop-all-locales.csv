Upon browser update, Firefox stopped displaying mask of any image format (SVG or PNG). </p><p>I did solve this issue in 2020 by changing the settings. about:config &gt; privacy.file_unique_origin changing: to 'false' &gt; refresh tab. Yet, since October 2021, it's no longer helping. After a browser update, I don't see the images with a mask, see attachment. The mask images show OK when the HTML page is on the server, but codding requires a constant 'quick check,' and usually uploading to the server is a final step. Can anyone help? </p><p>I prepared a simple example page [<a href=""https://artenergy.com/mask"" rel=""nofollow"">https://artenergy.com/mask</a>] with a download link. Thus one can open this file locally to see the issue. </p><p>Thank you! </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-950;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1471844;,sergey16

I can't get it to work with Firefox,"<p>When I sign in to my Google account on my PC it sends a link to my phone for me to click ""Yes it's me"" to authenticate the sign in. The Google sign-in screen on my PC (Firefox browser) has a checkbox to 'trust' this device. Even though I select that option it still insists on sending the phone link to click on. How do I get Firefox/Google to remember the 'trust' checkbox state? </p><p>PS.

I have Firefox set up to have new tabs be the default Firefox home page.  Those new pages display a Google search section but when I type in that section, the text switches to the address bar for the search.  How can I make the search happen on the page, not the address bar? Under Settings/Search, it has a search setting section with only 2 choices - Use the address bar for search and navigation &amp; Add search bar in toolbar.  I've tried it both ways, and the same thing happens.   My previous computer (both are Windows 10) did not have this problem.  I could type/search in the Google search section.
