That is why though the application itself is installed and works properly on the device, Intune portal does not know the status of the installation and gives the error. This error causes a lot of issues to the further application management. Dose any one knows what those codes are? Or maybe can point into the correct direction on how to get them.

This works when the setting is on. However I have noticed twice in 3 days the setting has been turned off- but not by me! This is unacceptable. I would be grateful if you can advise me of anything I can do to ensure that when I change a setting/preference in FF that it stays changed until I select a different setting myself. In the case of email it is important as may miss something important.
