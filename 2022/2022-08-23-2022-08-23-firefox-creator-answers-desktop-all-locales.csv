We have tried using chrome and we dont have the same issues, it works perfectly. We would prefer to use firefox due to the security settings, so we would love to resolve this issue. We have reset and wiped our Mac and reinstalled all of our drivers and software (including firefox) and we are still having the same issue across all of our computers.  </p><p>Our number is 0404220530, we would appreciate your help! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1528668;,admin574

This works when the setting is on. However I have noticed twice in 3 days the setting has been turned off- but not by me! This is unacceptable. I would be grateful if you can advise me of anything I can do to ensure that when I change a setting/preference in FF that it stays changed until I select a different setting myself. In the case of email it is important as may miss something important. Thank you,  </p><p>Steven Kiernan </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,customize,en-US,1528670;1528690;,stevenk581@live.co.uk
