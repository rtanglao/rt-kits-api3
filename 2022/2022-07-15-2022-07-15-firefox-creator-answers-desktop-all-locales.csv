I noticed a lot of suspicious activity on my personal/work computer that led me to suspect my internet router was compromised. I work from home sometimes and I may have been tricked into downloaded and installing a malicious version of Firefox. </p><p>I suspect this Firefox installer is different because this installer is capable of circumventing the safeguards placed on my work laptop. My work laptop is managed by a university and I require an administrator's credentials in order to install/uninstall any programs, change/view any environment settings, or even open up and view task manager. This process entails actually having an administrator remote into my laptop, take remote control, enter their credentials, and ensure the installer completes. </p><p>So far, this unusual Firefox installer is the only installer capable of bypassing these security hurdles. And it does not detect any existing versions of Firefox to prompt an uninstaller before re-installing. The installer's visuals/progress bar appears to be a scripted animation. </p><p>I still have the installer in question saved on my computer and I'm not sure what to do with it.
