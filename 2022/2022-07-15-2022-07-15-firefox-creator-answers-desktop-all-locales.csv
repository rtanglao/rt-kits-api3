I've assigned <a href=""http://mail.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.google.com</a> and <a href=""http://accounts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">accounts.google.com</a> to my Work container, and it works fine in that container. </p><p>When I try to sign IN to my personal gmail in a personal tab, it still works fine if I select ""Would you still like to open in this current Container?"" -&gt; ""Open in container"". But when I sign OUT, I get the same prompt multiple times and each opening a new tab. I believe this is because gmail does some redirecting during the sign-out process.
