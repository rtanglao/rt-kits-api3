Its url is: moz-extension://285d678c-ecb3-4003-923d-835fc9d8e0bc/reader.html </p><p>If I use it as a normal tab (instead of a pinned tab) ... it survives a Firefox restart.  But if I use it as a pinned tab (which I want) ... it disappears after a Firefox restart.  </p><p>I suppose it has to do with it being an addon-page instead of a ""normal"" page. </p><p>Is there a way to make it stay permanently pinned? </p>",linux;desktop;tabs;firefox-880;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",thomasvonderelbe

I've assigned <a href=""http://mail.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.google.com</a> and <a href=""http://accounts.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">accounts.google.com</a> to my Work container, and it works fine in that container. </p><p>When I try to sign IN to my personal gmail in a personal tab, it still works fine if I select ""Would you still like to open in this current Container?"" -&gt; ""Open in container"". But when I sign OUT, I get the same prompt multiple times and each opening a new tab. I believe this is because gmail does some redirecting during the sign-out process. If I don't go through all these container prompts, I don't get signed out. </p><p>I'm probably missing something obvious, but how exactly do I achieve different gmail accounts in different containers if they all use the same domain? </p><p>Cheers! </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-11;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",iainure56
