I cannot access my mail using the Firefox browser. I have tried the TalkTalk Mail website without success as it has ""timed out."" I can access my TalkTalk account but when I click the ""Mail"" button, after about 30 seconds I get a message saying that it has also ""timed out."" I also use Thunderbird and although I can receive Emails, I cannot send them. After sending, I receive a message that a password is required and when I enter it another message comes in stating that that they ""could not authenticate to outgoing server, check password"" etc which I have done. I can send and receive Emails on my iphone and Fire tablet. I can access my mail on the two aforementioned sites using the Windows Edge browser. I contacted TalkTalk and after two hours it was decided that the Firefox browser was at fault. I have used Firefox and Thunderbird for too many years to remember and it has always served me well. I would be extremely grateful if there is someone who may have had the same problem and would be able to assist. Kind regards, John </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,other,en-US,"",john.cuth
