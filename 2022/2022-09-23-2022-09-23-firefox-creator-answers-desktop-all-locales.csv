Ideally Firefox should have a friendly way to change that (UI or config file), but I accept editing binaries files. </p><p>Also, why extensions with shortcuts like Shift+D are treated as invalid and get removed? </p>",linux;desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,1535838;1535839;,rcd99

But I found out that firefox hates it's user base by making xpinstall.signatures.required option in about:config only available to dev builds. </p><p>If I use firefox dev build will I loose on performance?  For example is it compiled with debug symbols that slow down code execution? And if so, is it somehow possible to get the release version of firefox where xpinstall.signatures.required is set false so that I would not loose because of dev build? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,customize,en-US,1535837;1535840;1535843;1535853;,fdoywugozklvsndgax
