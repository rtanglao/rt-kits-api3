This makes a lot of webpages difficult to read. This does not seem to be happening all the time. Neither does it seem to happen in other apps other than Firefox. I have my preferred languages for displaying webpages in Firefox set as En-GB, en, es-es, in that order. Ditto for my wider system settings.  In terms of my wider system keyboards I do have Russian installed, in order of preference this is gb &gt; us &gt; es &gt; ru. I'm wondering if there is anything I can do to ensure Spanish and other Latin letters display correctly? </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-970;firefox-9701;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",crabapplepie

But I am logged in to my account in another session, so I have access to my account. I want to create a recovery key so I can reset my password without losing everything. Problem is, to create a recovery key you need to enter your password. If you ask why didn't you create one when you set your password. This recovery key thing did not exist when I was setting my password. Can anyone please help me with this?

Plus it's using nearly all 16 GBs of my RAM. With every new update, I pray it will mean the browser will just work, and not use up all my computer's resources, but it just never does. Pretty soon, more &amp; more of us will just give up on this browser, which used to work better, years ago, and has only gone downhill since. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-970;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1485187;1485193;,StevenCee

The confusing this is that it's happening on sites where I was able to actually watch the video just a few seconds before, then I'll browse a few pages then suddenly all the video will show this. I click on the video, it will actually show it for a split second, then shows the ""HTML5 video file not found"". Most of the time I have to clear cookies, shut down Firefox, and in some cases even restart my PC before it fixes itself. But on some sites, it takes month's before it will suddenly work again.  I don't understand why this keeps happening? I've googled fixes for this, and not a single one ever works. Is this a flaw with the Firefox browser, or the websites? Is there a way to stop this from happening because it's incredibly annoying? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-970;firefox-9701;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Nightlistic
