I use Norton Password Mgr and nothing shows up on this page to get Norton to fill in the blanks for me. Is there something actively blocking <a href=""http://accounts.firefox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">accounts.firefox.com</a> --  <a href=""http://a.ff.com"" rel=""nofollow"">a.ff.com</a> that prevents an overlay from Norton PW Mgr? </p><p>1c) Once I paste my PW into that area, I arrive on <a href=""https://accounts.firefox.com/settings"" rel=""nofollow"">https://accounts.firefox.com/settings</a> that is a nutty homepage. Please choose anything else except the settings page that has a big red ""Delete Account"" on it at the bottom. </p><p>1d) So on the settings page there is a section that says: ""Connected Services."" Hey, I see Pocket! Great, I click on Pocket and.... well it sends me to a Pocket page where I am not logged on???? What? I am logged on to <a href=""http://a.ff.com"" rel=""nofollow"">a.ff.com</a> so why wouldn't you pass the PW under the covers to have me logged in when I click from a secure page in ff? Make it easy for us users, please. </p><p>1e) I believe a federated website is in order. If I am logged into <a href=""http://a.ff.com"" rel=""nofollow"">a.ff.com</a> then why am I not logged into Pocket automatically and with no effort by me, when I arrive at the Pocket website? This is relatively easy to do under the covers to make it... easier for the user. </p><p>2) OK, now I am moving over to Pocket's website, but since F/M owns pocket, I think I am still in the correct support page.  </p><p>2a) I logged into M/F and then bring up another browser tab and go to Pocket. I should be logged into Pocket as stated above. I am not. So, I try to use Norton PW Mgr again. Hey, the Norton PW-M overwrite is there! Yeah! I click on it, it fills in my ID, Yea! I click on it again it fills in my PW. Great! I click Login and, nothing. I try again to login, nothing. I type my ID and paste in my 16-digit password with random symbols, numbers and u/l case letter, nothing. Why is this not working? Here is the bug: cannot log in to Pocket with my ID and PW.  </p><p>2b) I go back to <a href=""http://a.ff.com"" rel=""nofollow"">a.ff.com</a> &gt; Settings &gt; Connected Services and see that <a href=""http://a.ff.com"" rel=""nofollow"">a.ff.com</a> thinks that I logged in to Pocket a few minutes ago? Really? Well Pocket does not think I am logged in??? I go up to the 3x3 squares in the upper right-hand corner and select Pocket, nope, that does not get me logged in either. I look at this Pocket website (<a href=""https://getpocket.com/en/pocket-and-firefox/?src=ff_bento"" rel=""nofollow"">https://getpocket.com/en/pocket-and-firefox/?src=ff_bento</a>) and click on ""Activate Pocket in Firefox"" and it shows me the old <a href=""http://a.ff.com"" rel=""nofollow"">a.ff.com</a> login. I enter the PW and... wait... yes! I am logged in to Pocket. </p><p>2c) Clearly that was insane. I cry for my peers who like to read (with Pocket) and hate Chrome. </p><p>3) Please F/M people, tell me there are a bunch of bugs and design errors due to the absorption of Pocket's website and you have not had time to fix them yet? </p><p>4) Or, tell me what ff setting I change that blew my user experience out of the water? </p><p>Thanks.

Since your last upgrade to 97.0.1 I have no problem with all other newspapers except for Washington Post.  FF will not save them, so I am forced to click on the ""progress of ongoing download"" down pointing arrow and click again on the circular arrow to actually save the web page.  This involves a loss of time doing a task that I should not be forced to perform.  See the graphic image below to see what I'm talking about.  Once I click on that circular arrow the web page will be saved as it should have to begin with.  Since I normally save 30 to 40 Washington Post files every day, this adds up to a useless waste of my time.  I'd appreciate it if you would look into this matter and issue a correction update so I can save Washington Post web pages without all the double stroking.

This makes a lot of webpages difficult to read. This does not seem to be happening all the time. Neither does it seem to happen in other apps other than Firefox. I have my preferred languages for displaying webpages in Firefox set as En-GB, en, es-es, in that order. Ditto for my wider system settings.  In terms of my wider system keyboards I do have Russian installed, in order of preference this is gb &gt; us &gt; es &gt; ru.
