Plus it's using nearly all 16 GBs of my RAM. With every new update, I pray it will mean the browser will just work, and not use up all my computer's resources, but it just never does. Pretty soon, more &amp; more of us will just give up on this browser, which used to work better, years ago, and has only gone downhill since. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-970;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",StevenCee

One of the laptops is windows 11 and the other is windows 10 . Please let me know if there's any fix to this. Thank you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-970;firefox-9701;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1485178;,silver_trashsh

The confusing this is that it's happening on sites where I was able to actually watch the video just a few seconds before, then I'll browse a few pages then suddenly all the video will show this. I click on the video, it will actually show it for a split second, then shows the ""HTML5 video file not found"". Most of the time I have to clear cookies, shut down Firefox, and in some cases even restart my PC before it fixes itself. But on some sites, it takes month's before it will suddenly work again.  I don't understand why this keeps happening? I've googled fixes for this, and not a single one ever works. Is this a flaw with the Firefox browser, or the websites? Is there a way to stop this from happening because it's incredibly annoying? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-970;firefox-9701;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Nightlistic
