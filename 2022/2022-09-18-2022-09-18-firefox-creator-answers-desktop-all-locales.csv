But not to worry, I thought, because important folders (including Firefox's Profiles folder) get backed up automatically every night, and just yesterday I reset my ""homepage"" to include all the currently open tabs. So I thought restoring my session and recovering my open tabs would be a simple matter of replacing current files with backed-up versions of those files. But I can't figure out which files to use or if that strategy is even possible. For example, some of the support materials state that recovery.jsonlz4 in the sessionstore-backups folder gets updated continuously with session and tabs information, but on my system that file abruptly stopped being updated in July. Similarly, previous.jsonlz4 and upgrade.jsonlz4-*** stopped being updated in May. (FYI, sessionstore.jsonlz4 gets created when I close Firefox, just like it's supposed to, but I don't have any backed-up versions of it because it only exists when Firefox is closed.) And the tabs currently listed in the ""homepage"" are also from a month ago, and I can't figure out what file those tabs are stored in.
