Not sure if a bookmark should be in a sub-directory and/or I add multiple tags. I've thought of adding them to generalized directories and then adding as many tags as needed, but am not able to search/select multiple tags in the Library window. Any pointers on what is a good way to do this? </p><p>I have things like Coding, Learning, Tools. But then also Git, PHP, Linux. I can't figure out how to sort all theseÂ :( Thanks for any input you may have. </p><p>Cheers. </p>",linux;desktop;beta;bookmarks;firefox-1050;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",seedsca

Please install the latest version or install another browser.

Any help you can offer would be appreciated very much.  I have two plug ins: Facebook Container and EFF Privacy Badger.  There is no update available to update Firefox.  It appears that when the new version of Widevine updated yesterday (see image 2), the browser stopped working for streaming on Netflix.
