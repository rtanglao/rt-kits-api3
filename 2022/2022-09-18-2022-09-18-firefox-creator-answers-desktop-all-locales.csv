The crash is strange, there is no popup window stating that FF crashed, just it gets closed. So I cannot present an error log.  The first sign of this upcoming crash is that the FF window gets bigger, the bottom Windows taskbar disappers and FF freezes, then it becomes normal again and then it closes without warning.  This same error could be experienced since at least 5 or 6 previous versions of FF. Although with every update it became scarcer, but still it can be experienced.  </p><p>Thanks for your help in advance. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,fix-problems,hu,"",kadocsa.krisztian

But not to worry, I thought, because important folders (including Firefox's Profiles folder) get backed up automatically every night, and just yesterday I reset my ""homepage"" to include all the currently open tabs. So I thought restoring my session and recovering my open tabs would be a simple matter of replacing current files with backed-up versions of those files. But I can't figure out which files to use or if that strategy is even possible. For example, some of the support materials state that recovery.jsonlz4 in the sessionstore-backups folder gets updated continuously with session and tabs information, but on my system that file abruptly stopped being updated in July. Similarly, previous.jsonlz4 and upgrade.jsonlz4-*** stopped being updated in May. (FYI, sessionstore.jsonlz4 gets created when I close Firefox, just like it's supposed to, but I don't have any backed-up versions of it because it only exists when Firefox is closed.) And the tabs currently listed in the ""homepage"" are also from a month ago, and I can't figure out what file those tabs are stored in.
