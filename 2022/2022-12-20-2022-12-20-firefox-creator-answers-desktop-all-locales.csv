When I did Firefox updated itself as well, using a version (108) grabbed from the snap servers instead of the one from the repositories. When it did, this plugin was broken. </p><p>When I log into the OctoPi server through the Firefox browser, this plugin is supposed to show voices installed from which I can choose. That drop-down is empty now, though, so the plugin cannot speak. </p><p>Someone on reddit suggested I try using a .deb instead of the snap package. I couldn't find a .deb but I did try installing using the PPA as well as the direct download from mozilla. </p><p>Using the PPA instead of the snap, the web page for OctoPi hung without fully loading, with CPU usage for something called Isolated Web Co up to 50%! </p><p>Using the direct download and manual install method, that same process rose up to about 30 or 40% and the page took a minute before it finally fully loaded, but it did load and the plugin did find voices, so... </p><p>The issue does seem to be in the snap distributed version. I just can't deal with the load times and CPU usage of the other methods. But this does narrow it down, though... </p><p><br> </p><p>Does anyone have any ideas on how I can fix this?
