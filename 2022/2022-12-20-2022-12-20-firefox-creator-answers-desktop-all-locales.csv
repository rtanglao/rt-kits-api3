When I did Firefox updated itself as well, using a version (108) grabbed from the snap servers instead of the one from the repositories. When it did, this plugin was broken. </p><p>When I log into the OctoPi server through the Firefox browser, this plugin is supposed to show voices installed from which I can choose. That drop-down is empty now, though, so the plugin cannot speak. </p><p>Someone on reddit suggested I try using a .deb instead of the snap package. I couldn't find a .deb but I did try installing using the PPA as well as the direct download from mozilla. </p><p>Using the PPA instead of the snap, the web page for OctoPi hung without fully loading, with CPU usage for something called Isolated Web Co up to 50%! </p><p>Using the direct download and manual install method, that same process rose up to about 30 or 40% and the page took a minute before it finally fully loaded, but it did load and the plugin did find voices, so... </p><p>The issue does seem to be in the snap distributed version. I just can't deal with the load times and CPU usage of the other methods. But this does narrow it down, though... </p><p><br> </p><p>Does anyone have any ideas on how I can fix this? I don't know what to look for and the plugin developer doesn't know, either. </p>",linux;desktop;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",rebeltaz1

However, possibly after an update, the display of Comcast Mail has missing items, failure to update some, and just a very messed display that cannot be relied on. Tried the same mail account on Edge and it is perfect. Do I stay with Edge or can my Firefox account be fixed? </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,other,en-US,"",boleyd

For example you click on a link thinking you are going to download something, but you are redirected to an AD site, or a Game site. Someone is racking up ""clicks"" for cash. </p><p>I.E. had a way to stop scripting altogether, or to allow you to choose to be be ""asked"" if you want to be redirected to another page, when a site wants to be redirected years age. So it shouldn't be that hard for you guys to set it up too. </p><p>I'm sure you just didn't think of it, but it is becoming a common problem with many sites, where someone manages to hack in a redirect an make some money getting ""clicks"", and worse, tricking people into downloading bogus shit programs like chromius. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-81;firefox-1080;,firefox,customize,en-US,1554825;,whiz666
