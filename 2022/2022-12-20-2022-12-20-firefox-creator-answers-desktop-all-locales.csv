It doesn't matter what else may be using parts of communication nor how badly Viasat (ViaSnail is my opinion) is throttling me. When they have me down to pre-56K dialup speeds Firefox frequently stalls. I am differentiating between browser stalls and website timeouts. I use Chrome mostly and Edge occasionally. Dell Inspiron 3670, I5 speedstep, 12GB RAM, NVME(?) 190GB system disk 90% empty, 2 SSD disks neither over 20% full, 1 950GB Sata disk partitioned in half. One I use for data the other is kept empty for emergency or backing up my other computer(s) data when I hose it testing my things or momentary lapse of reasoning.  </p><p>Secondary concern is a message in settings telling me my organization is controlling the browser. I have no organization and do not recall granting permission to any biz or person. This may be due to Viasat ISP and you can be assured if there were ANY other option I'd use it. Cellular requires a bounce to get any signal into the valley my home is located. Very frustrating as it is a only 12 air miles to downtown San Jose, CA. Anywho that option takes 3 to 5 thousand in specialized equipment, solar power, 2 ubiquity dishes... among other unthought of pieces. It is also very close to the edge of legality under FCC rules. We did have it setup and worked fine on inbound side. Outbound side hitch hiked on ATT primary backhaul link from Fremont Peak to LA. It required an ATT cell phone plan to work constantly which is understandable.  </p><p>My Dell runs fine and has no trouble with multiple browsers running alongside open chat, online games or other net intensive apps. As mentioned earlier I have run comparisons at various times of day/night and Firefox is always running less than 1/2 the speed of the others. I have gone through the settings and only made changes after reading docs to make sure what effect it would bring in. My work for 25 years was IT group and user tech support. Positions held run the gamut from Computer Ops, help desk at all levels, designing and building out technical help desks, then staffing positions, acquisition of work space and equipment, training as needed and managing the new department(s). So I do have well beyond a rudimentary understanding of computers from the IBM 3090 series down to PC with my first home computer bought in 1988. An aside here, text messaging we did every morning between Atari HQ in Sunnyvale, Ca communicating with Tokyo and Paris to verify financials, inventory for hardware manufacturing, order entry, sales... One cardinal rule was, NEVER use quit when done. I got sloppy one morning and did so. I did not realize all the groans about dam* computer is down were my fault on the way out to my car. Until getting home and finding 5 messages with increasing panic from the Computer Ops VP. I'm babbling, sorry. </p><p>To recap: 1) Firefox is extremely slow. </p><pre>              2) How to take back control of my browser on my machine </pre>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",LostValley
