I have set network.captive-portal-service.enabled to false in the config, which has greatly reduced the number of connection attempts and therefore intrusive alerts, but it has not stopped them completely.

This has been occurring for more than two years, across many websites/Firefox updates. Currently using Windows 10 and Firefox 97 (Firefox is set to clear all cookies/information when closing). EXAMPLE: Open browser (Firefox) and in the URL type the website (e.g. shrepc) Press CTRL + ENTER to auto-fill the URL Firefox displays message ""Warning: Potential Security Risk Ahead"" giving the options to ""Go Back"" or ""Advanced"" At this point close Firefox. Open Firefox again. In the URL link type ""<a href=""http://www.shrepc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.shrepc.com</a>"" and press ENTER The website is displayed with no errors.

By update, I mean that when your are on a Disqus comment page, what you should see is a bar at the top stating how many new comments have been added.  You should see new responses to comments as a link that you can click on to display the update.  You should see ""one other person is typing"" before a new response is displayed.  It is dynamic and real-time.  With Firefox, all I see is a static comments page with no updates.  I must refresh the page to see changes, and the changes are not highlighted. </p><p>To see this behavior, or lack thereof, you must be on an active, popular page that is actually being changed in real time.  Below is a link to one at The Hill that is active now. </p><p><a href=""https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/595707-biden-says-us-will-sanction-russian-banks-impose-export-controls#bottom-story-socials"" rel=""nofollow"">https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/595707-biden-says-us-will-sanction-russian-banks-impose-export-controls#bottom-story-socials</a> </p><p>If you check it later, the comment window may have become inactive. Then you will need to find another popular story by looking in the right margin of the story display. </p><p>The way to see this is to have Firefox and another browser open concurrently on your desktop task bar to the same window.  I use Firefox and Edge on my desktop.  I use Samsung Internet on my phone. Only Firefox fails to update.  Tech support people in my orbit have confirmed this behavior but have no suggestions. </p><p>Kindly let me know if there is a fix. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Peter_Smith

It would be different if <strong>Apple</strong> ever made in applications that were useful / helpful, but they don't and anything they do put out that is worth a spit costs literally <strong>THOUSANDS of Dollars</strong> because they are so full of themselves at that company that they believe they are the only ones who know how computers should work, or be used. Can someone please explain to me how to make this addon work again, even on a piece of garbage <strong>Macintrash</strong> device?? <strong>Thanks in advance!!</strong> </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-970;firefox-9701;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",zlloyd2
