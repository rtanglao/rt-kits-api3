This is only a problem because <strong>Macintosh</strong>, and <strong>Apple</strong> are such kill joys when it comes to security that nothing works on them, and it will not install the <strong>companion app,</strong> because it cannot scan it for viruses or some such nonsense.

I just do not get how this makes for a better computer experience at all. <strong>It all seems like overkill to me</strong>, and ridiculous when you cannot even use addons for a browser anymore without the <strong>Apple Super Geeks</strong> deciding not to allow it for whatever ignorant reason, but making a computer that cannot use any software you didn't purchase from <strong>Apple</strong> does not improve the experience at all <strong>JERKS</strong>. It would be different if <strong>Apple</strong> ever made in applications that were useful / helpful, but they don't and anything they do put out that is worth a spit costs literally <strong>THOUSANDS of Dollars</strong> because they are so full of themselves at that company that they believe they are the only ones who know how computers should work, or be used. Can someone please explain to me how to make this addon work again, even on a piece of garbage <strong>Macintrash</strong> device?? <strong>Thanks in advance!!</strong> </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-970;firefox-9701;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",zlloyd2
