It remembers 30-40 passwords so I always log in with ease, but recently when I go to security tab and click to show saved logins, only 3 would show. All others are remembered and log in fine, but I cannot show them, which only happened recently, so it happened after a newer version was installed, I assume. </p><p>How can I show all remembered passwords?

This is only a problem because <strong>Macintosh</strong>, and <strong>Apple</strong> are such kill joys when it comes to security that nothing works on them, and it will not install the <strong>companion app,</strong> because it cannot scan it for viruses or some such nonsense. (attached) <a href=""https://user-media-prod-cdn.itsre-sumo.mozilla.net/uploads/images/2022-02-23-22-31-14-480a6b.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://user-media-prod-cdn.itsre-sumo.mozilla.net/uploads/images/2022-02-23-22-31-14-480a6b.png</a> I swear to god, I wish to the lord above that I had <strong>NEVER</strong> switched over to an <strong>Apple</strong> computer from my <strong>Windows</strong> machines, but I thought it was supposed to be a better device, not realizing that it is secure to the point where almost <strong>NOTHING</strong> can be installed on it. I just do not get how this makes for a better computer experience at all. <strong>It all seems like overkill to me</strong>, and ridiculous when you cannot even use addons for a browser anymore without the <strong>Apple Super Geeks</strong> deciding not to allow it for whatever ignorant reason, but making a computer that cannot use any software you didn't purchase from <strong>Apple</strong> does not improve the experience at all <strong>JERKS</strong>. It would be different if <strong>Apple</strong> ever made in applications that were useful / helpful, but they don't and anything they do put out that is worth a spit costs literally <strong>THOUSANDS of Dollars</strong> because they are so full of themselves at that company that they believe they are the only ones who know how computers should work, or be used. Can someone please explain to me how to make this addon work again, even on a piece of garbage <strong>Macintrash</strong> device?? <strong>Thanks in advance!!</strong> </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-970;firefox-9701;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",zlloyd2
