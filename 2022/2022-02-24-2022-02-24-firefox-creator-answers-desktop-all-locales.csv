I mistakenly clicked on save.  I don't want to automatically open the web site with a click of the mouse.  I want to enter my account information and enter my password each time.  I don't know how to reverse my mistake and have the requirement to log in each time.  (Out of curiosity, just where is the password data saved?)  </p><p>Additionally. how can I avoid having that nuisance window from popping open each time I want to log in?  It is an extra step I don't need to make to keep answering no every time I access the site. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,websites,en-US,1485735;,gacrane
