Up until today I thought it was an issue with the site itself. While streaming videos on <a href=""http://viki.com"" rel=""nofollow"">viki.com</a> the video quality keeps dropping from full HD 1080p down to a measly SD 360p; they automatically adjust the video quality based on your internet speed, yet despite having a very stable connection (220mbps) it keeps constantly changing which is very annoying. The weird thing is, though, that this doesn't happen ALL the time, just for a select few (Chinese or Taiwanese) shows. Playing the same episode of one such a show on another browser (in this case Edge), however, is completely normal. Steady 1080p quality throughout. I don't have this problem on any other streaming sites with Firefox (Netflix, Youtube, Prime, etc.), either.  </p><p>Is there a throttling misstep somewhere in config that I might have overlooked? As far as I know I haven't changed the settings on it. </p><p>Would appreciate any help you can provide as I'd rather not switch browsers to fix this issue.  </p><p>Sincerely, Isabella </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",evendia

I already told the support team at Tutanota that I have no images loading, but it's still showing the error. They said the connection should still be secure, but that doesn't make sense if the browser itself is saying it's not secure.
