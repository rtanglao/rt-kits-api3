A FireFox alapból letiltja ezeket az átirányításokat. Igaz, hogy RÁKÉRDEZ, de ha az ember nem reagál gyorsan a rákérdezésre, akkor megszakad a fizetési folyamat. Le akarom tiltani az átirányítás figyelését és a rákérdezést! Ezt hogy tehetem meg?

I've been getting this monkey error saying ""Oops, something went wrong."" Please advise. </p><p>Variables: - I'm a user in China. - I'm on the latest version of Firefox (detailed info attached below). - My macOS is up to date (macOS Monterey, detailed info including hardware info given below). - I access Youtube via ExpressVPN (also up to date), as Youtube is still officially blocked in China. - Youtube is accessible on both Safari and Chrome browser on my macbook, with Firefox being the only exception (but Firefox is also my favorite and default browser, which is why I'm trying to fix this). - I've also tried accessing Youtube via Firefox on my windows 10 PC, and all is fine. All other variables remain the same.  - All the above tests were done in the exact same internet (wifi) environment. - Conclusion: There's nothing wrong with the local internet, VPN service, or Youtube site. It could only be with either the current build of Firefox for mac, or some unknown settings on my macbook. I can't be certain which is it because I only have 1 macbook hence I can't reproduce or test on another. </p><p>My email address for contact: [email removed from public forum]. Looking forward to your prompt reply. </p><p>Cheers, Aaron </p>",desktop;websites;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",multimixmeta

At the Connected Services screen there is no link or button which provides an explanation - as to what Firefox DOES with the Connected Services.
