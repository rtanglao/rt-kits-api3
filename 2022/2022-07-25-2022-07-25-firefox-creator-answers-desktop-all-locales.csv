Why have settings if websites can just ignore them??  Also another thing, Autoplay dosen't make any sense to me, if you wan't to watch the full video, you have to first turn on sound, and then move the slider bar the the start. This is stupid! Just let the user choose if they would like to have videos autoplay or not. I hate the internet. </p><p>One more thing, I do realize there is a setting in Twitter to disable autoplay, however you need to be logged in for that option to be available. Websites should just repesct the settings of there webusers. Thants why ""global settings' exist. Unfortunately just another redisculous control feature of the modern internet. </p><p>Thank you for reading and or helping. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",ThankYou88

The image quality varies during a show, regularly appearing more blurry for a few seconds and then improving again. There are also regular flashes which I think are between scenes. </p><p>I spent the weekend upgrading the computer (it was long overdue) hoping that it might fix the problem but it didn't. </p><p>Last night I decided to try Microsoft Edge. Not only was there no variation of blurriness and no flashes, the video images were way way sharper.  </p><p>What's going on here please? Is there an add-in to provide better quality streaming? </p>",desktop;other;firefox-1020;,firefox,other,en-US,1522157;1522177;,dhanslip

If I remove it from the container's site list, it just shows back up again shortly after. </p><p>I do have sync enabled for the add-on and I am logged in on 3 different devices. However, I have tried to remove the website from the container simultaneously on all my devices, but the problem still persists. </p><p>Is there any viable way to actually remove a website from a container's site list, or do I have to resort to more extreme measures like deleting the container itself? </p><p>Thanks for you help! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-91110;firefox-9111;,firefox,customize,en-US,1522152;,corywilson1993
