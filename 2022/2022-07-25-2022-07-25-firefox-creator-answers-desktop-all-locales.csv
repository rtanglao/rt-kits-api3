Ho seguito le guide del sito per recuperare segnalibri e password e sono arrivato alle seguenti conclusioni: - Nei profili di firefox c'è solo un profilo, quindi non è stato creato nessun nuovo profilo. - Le password sono ancora li, significato che il profilo è sempre lo stesso. - I segnalibri sono scomparsi dal browser ma nella cartella del profilo in ""bookmarkbackups"" sembra esserci traccia dei segnalibri quindi non capisco perche siano scomparsi. - I temi che scaricati e il tema applicato a firefox non c'è più, poco male. - i plug-in anche quelli scomparsi nel nulla e a differenza dei temi che posso riscaricare vorrei recuperarli.

There's pop-up asking for Username and Password. I log in and then when I: </p> <ul><li> left click on file it  opens in internal viewer but... </li><li> when I right click on file and use ""Save Link As..."" authentication pop-up opens again.  </li></ul> <p>I can then put my credentials or I can just press Cancel, whatever I choose file is downloaded. Same happens for every file dowloaded with right click. </p><p>This is annoying if someone wants to download multiple files. </p><p>OK, now what happens on server side? There's Apache2 configured with basic authentication method. When I left click server log shows: <strong>192.168.1.99 - user1 [25/Jul/2022:14:46:39 +0200] ""GET /area1/test_file.pdf HTTP/1.1"" 200 849985</strong> but when I right click, server says: <strong>192.168.1.99 - - [25/Jul/2022:14:48:11 +0200] ""GET /area1/test_file.pdf HTTP/1.1"" 401 464 </strong> 192.168.1.99 - - [25/Jul/2022:14:48:13 +0200] ""GET /area1/test_file.pdf HTTP/1.1"" 401 464<strong> </strong> </p><p>So, as you can see with left click server respons with ""200 OK"" status code, but with right click it says two times that I'm unauthorized (401 Status Code). And even I'm so called unauthorized, I can download this file. </p><p>Chrome do not asks for authorization every time I try to download file. I log in only once and then I can dowload many files with right click.  </p><p>I tested it with other than PDF formats and FF asks for auth everytime.  </p><p>Will someone help me understand this situation? </p><p>Cheers, Paweł p.s.

Just let the user choose if they would like to have videos autoplay or not. I hate the internet. </p><p>One more thing, I do realize there is a setting in Twitter to disable autoplay, however you need to be logged in for that option to be available. Websites should just repesct the settings of there webusers. Thants why ""global settings' exist.
