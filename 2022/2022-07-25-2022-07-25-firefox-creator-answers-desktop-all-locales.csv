The image quality varies during a show, regularly appearing more blurry for a few seconds and then improving again. There are also regular flashes which I think are between scenes. </p><p>I spent the weekend upgrading the computer (it was long overdue) hoping that it might fix the problem but it didn't. </p><p>Last night I decided to try Microsoft Edge. Not only was there no variation of blurriness and no flashes, the video images were way way sharper.  </p><p>What's going on here please? Is there an add-in to provide better quality streaming? </p>",desktop;other;firefox-1020;,firefox,other,en-US,1522157;,dhanslip

However, a month or two ago I accidentally added a website to one of my containers, and since then I have found it impossible to remove. If I remove it from the container's site list, it just shows back up again shortly after. </p><p>I do have sync enabled for the add-on and I am logged in on 3 different devices. However, I have tried to remove the website from the container simultaneously on all my devices, but the problem still persists. </p><p>Is there any viable way to actually remove a website from a container's site list, or do I have to resort to more extreme measures like deleting the container itself? </p><p>Thanks for you help! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-91110;firefox-9111;,firefox,customize,en-US,1522152;,corywilson1993
