Ever since sometime in 2020, the Windows 10/11 on screen keyboard   has been COMPLETELY broken in Firefox if the Windows Taskbar is also set to ""automatically hide""! If a text entry box is selected, the keyboard will pop up for less than a second and then disappear. </p><p>Now in W10 the on screen keyboard is only broken in Firefox if in ""tablet mode"", but as that's the ""only display mode"" available in W11 it's COMPLETELY &amp; UTTERLY broken in the newer OS!!! This means that while a workaround ""fix"" exists for W10 by changing the on screen keyboard's settings to have the same behavior in tablet mode as in desktop mode, in W11 the ONLY WAY to make the keyboard WORK AT ALL is to turn off Taskbar auto-hiding, which is simply UNACCEPTABLE on small screen devices!!! </p><p>And this has been broken and reported to you guys COUNTLESS TIMES for literally FREAKING YEARS at this point!!! Do you need a patch from Microsoft or something to fix this bug, because this is getting freaking absurd at this point... </p><p>I've been a diehard Firefox user for literally DECADES at this point, but I WILL LEAVE if this doesn't ACTUALLY get fixed in the near future!!! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Cooe14

When I go into Settings, General, Firefox Updates, it says ""Firefox is up to date"". I click the button to the right which says ""Check for updates"" and it comes back with the same message.

Now, within the last month or so, Firefox has started just crashing. It shuts down for no apparent reason, 2-3 TIMES A DAY. I could be just reading and the browser will just shut down. Firefox is no longer a reliable browser to use. I'm sure I'm not the only one with this issue.  If it can't be fixed, I will just have to stop using the browser. I can't have it just randomly shut down, OFTEN!! </p><p>rboyd04@sbcglobal.net </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1495138;,montereybeachguy

I've checked settings and ""About Mozilla Firefox"" and both say ""Firefox is being updated by another instance"".  Ending the process doesn't close the browser, and it will usually function fine for a little while, before resuming again. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",CJ1998

Do you people think any of us have such important stuff on our home, student computers we need the tools of a CFO or CEO of a major corp. REALLY I think it is time we realize 2/3 of the tools on a computer be it windows or moz:lla are superfluous. To make me have to remember that many numbers is torture or try to remember where I put the print out is mean. Is cruel and why? So our egos can feel filled with smoke? Anything more than 5 fonts is a waste. How much time do you think gets wasted while people ""play"" or fart around with all the empty tools on computers? The world wide web is a huge wall surrounding all the companies that take our money. You built it for them Then showed consumers shinny new toy we waste our money our time our lives and we will never be able to get into the wall you built to get back money we spent or time we wasted. A 15 number key, you think someone wants the answers to my midterm? If they need it Let them have it. You technological people, who build this trap, who blow smoke up where it tickles, should be ashamed. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-11;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1495133;1495137;,a_hill11
