I've checked settings and ""About Mozilla Firefox"" and both say ""Firefox is being updated by another instance"".  Ending the process doesn't close the browser, and it will usually function fine for a little while, before resuming again. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",CJ1998

It's like similar to the unloading feature on the browser but this targets plugins and the memory is not used. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ms.dawndejesus

Do you people think any of us have such important stuff on our home, student computers we need the tools of a CFO or CEO of a major corp. REALLY I think it is time we realize 2/3 of the tools on a computer be it windows or moz:lla are superfluous. To make me have to remember that many numbers is torture or try to remember where I put the print out is mean. Is cruel and why? So our egos can feel filled with smoke? Anything more than 5 fonts is a waste. How much time do you think gets wasted while people ""play"" or fart around with all the empty tools on computers? The world wide web is a huge wall surrounding all the companies that take our money. You built it for them Then showed consumers shinny new toy we waste our money our time our lives and we will never be able to get into the wall you built to get back money we spent or time we wasted. A 15 number key, you think someone wants the answers to my midterm? If they need it Let them have it. You technological people, who build this trap, who blow smoke up where it tickles, should be ashamed. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-11;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1495133;,a_hill11
