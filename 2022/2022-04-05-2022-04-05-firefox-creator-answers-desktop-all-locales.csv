When I hover over the Firefox logo in my taskbar, all my open web pages are shown in miniature, which is great. The problem is, each of those small pages is shown at the top of the respective page rather than the position where I was working within them.  In other words, I can't just pass my mouse over one of the miniatures and see the page displayed in the position where I was working; all I see is the top of that webpage. To get back to the spot where I had been working, I must actually click on the miniature and go back to that page. When I do, it opens correctly, exactly at the spot where I left it.  But this means I have to click on each page to see where I was.  So if I have 6 or 8 web pages open, and want to get a quick glance at any one of them, I have to hover then click on the page and go to it. I guess I got spoiled by the way Yahoo used to work; when I hovered over any of the miniatures, I was looking at the location on that page where I was working.  I didn't have to actually click on the page to get a quick look.  Hope this is making sense.

I use the Autodesk Free Online Viewer to share models with clients so they can see their house designs in 3D. Just recently, many of the tools stopped working on Firefox and the model itself is grayed out so that you can't see most of the detail. When I open the model on Chrome it works just fine. I usually use Firefox for my personal business interactions just because it makes it easier to keep things separate from my emails and research for my full time job at a commercial architecture firm. Any ideas? My Firefox is updated and I didn't add anything to the browser since the last time I used the viewer. Here is a link that will be viewable for the next 25 days if you want to take a look: <a href=""https://autode.sk/35Jdz2Q"" rel=""nofollow"">https://autode.sk/35Jdz2Q</a>. I have also attached an image to show how the model is grayed out and I circled the tools that are not working or are missing.

Ever since sometime in 2020, the Windows 10/11 on screen keyboard   has been COMPLETELY broken in Firefox if the Windows Taskbar is also set to ""automatically hide""! If a text entry box is selected, the keyboard will pop up for less than a second and then disappear. </p><p>Now in W10 the on screen keyboard is only broken in Firefox if in ""tablet mode"", but as that's the ""only display mode"" available in W11 it's COMPLETELY &amp; UTTERLY broken in the newer OS!!! This means that while a workaround ""fix"" exists for W10 by changing the on screen keyboard's settings to have the same behavior in tablet mode as in desktop mode, in W11 the ONLY WAY to make the keyboard WORK AT ALL is to turn off Taskbar auto-hiding, which is simply UNACCEPTABLE on small screen devices!!! </p><p>And this has been broken and reported to you guys COUNTLESS TIMES for literally FREAKING YEARS at this point!!!
