I use the Autodesk Free Online Viewer to share models with clients so they can see their house designs in 3D. Just recently, many of the tools stopped working on Firefox and the model itself is grayed out so that you can't see most of the detail. When I open the model on Chrome it works just fine. I usually use Firefox for my personal business interactions just because it makes it easier to keep things separate from my emails and research for my full time job at a commercial architecture firm. Any ideas? My Firefox is updated and I didn't add anything to the browser since the last time I used the viewer. Here is a link that will be viewable for the next 25 days if you want to take a look: <a href=""https://autode.sk/35Jdz2Q"" rel=""nofollow"">https://autode.sk/35Jdz2Q</a>. I have also attached an image to show how the model is grayed out and I circled the tools that are not working or are missing. Appreciate any ideas. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",juliebenintendi

Luckily I knew what this email was for (it was confirming that I signed in on a new device), but why is it in a language that I dont use anywhere? Is there a way to fix this?

Ever since sometime in 2020, the Windows 10/11 on screen keyboard   has been COMPLETELY broken in Firefox if the Windows Taskbar is also set to ""automatically hide""! If a text entry box is selected, the keyboard will pop up for less than a second and then disappear. </p><p>Now in W10 the on screen keyboard is only broken in Firefox if in ""tablet mode"", but as that's the ""only display mode"" available in W11 it's COMPLETELY &amp; UTTERLY broken in the newer OS!!! This means that while a workaround ""fix"" exists for W10 by changing the on screen keyboard's settings to have the same behavior in tablet mode as in desktop mode, in W11 the ONLY WAY to make the keyboard WORK AT ALL is to turn off Taskbar auto-hiding, which is simply UNACCEPTABLE on small screen devices!!! </p><p>And this has been broken and reported to you guys COUNTLESS TIMES for literally FREAKING YEARS at this point!!! Do you need a patch from Microsoft or something to fix this bug, because this is getting freaking absurd at this point... </p><p>I've been a diehard Firefox user for literally DECADES at this point, but I WILL LEAVE if this doesn't ACTUALLY get fixed in the near future!!! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Cooe14

REALLY I think it is time we realize 2/3 of the tools on a computer be it windows or moz:lla are superfluous. To make me have to remember that many numbers is torture or try to remember where I put the print out is mean. Is cruel and why? So our egos can feel filled with smoke? Anything more than 5 fonts is a waste. How much time do you think gets wasted while people ""play"" or fart around with all the empty tools on computers? The world wide web is a huge wall surrounding all the companies that take our money. You built it for them Then showed consumers shinny new toy we waste our money our time our lives and we will never be able to get into the wall you built to get back money we spent or time we wasted. A 15 number key, you think someone wants the answers to my midterm? If they need it Let them have it.
