You may need to restart your connected device and/or router.    * If you’re able to connect to the Internet on other devices, update your connect device’s DNS settings. Please check with your device’s manufacturer for further details.    * If you’re attempting to control a device using Alexa, try to unpair then pair the device again in the Alexa app.    * Deactivate any VPN or proxy servers. ) </pre> <p><br> Similar issue with Audible.
