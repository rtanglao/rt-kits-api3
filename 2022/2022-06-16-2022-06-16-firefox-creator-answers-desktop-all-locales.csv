Below is the image I get when I try to log into twitter - the black box that has the login info remains and the entire page is no longer useable. When I refresh, it is like I never logged in in the first place. </p><p>I cleared cookies, my cache, I did the about:serviceworkers thing and unregistered the site. What else can I do? I can log in on chrome, plus whenever I try to log in I get a message on twitter that someone's trying to log in so I know its not an issue with my account </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,other,en-US,"",domochicka

However, this master password is required to start a session with Firefox. My suggestion is that you do not require the master password to start a Firefox session, only to access the passwords information, or to create and remember a login password for a new website. It is a hassle to enter the master password every time I want to use Firefox. Or should I keep firefox open the entire day? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",mcrick07-firefox
