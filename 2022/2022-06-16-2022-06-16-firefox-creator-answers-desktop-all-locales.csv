I'd get the error ""Video unavailable. For assistance, please go to amazon help"". </p><p>Amazon prime videos stream fine in Chrome Amazon prime app on my Android phone also works fine. </p><p>I have tried everything on the amazon help page (unless they don't apply), still won't work.  </p><p>(List of their tips: </p><pre>   * Close the Prime Video app on your device (or your web browser, if you're watching on your computer).    * Restart your computer or connected device.    * Ensure that your device or web browser has the latest updates.    * Ensure that you’re not using the same account on multiple devices - you can only stream the same title to two devices at a time.    * Ensure that any external device is connected to your TV or display using an HDMI cable that is compatible with HDCP 1.4 (for HD content) or HDCP 2.2 (for UHD and/or HDR content).    * Pause other Internet activity – especially if other devices are using the network at the same time.    * Check your Internet connection. You may need to restart your connected device and/or router.    * If you’re able to connect to the Internet on other devices, update your connect device’s DNS settings. Please check with your device’s manufacturer for further details.    * If you’re attempting to control a device using Alexa, try to unpair then pair the device again in the Alexa app.    * Deactivate any VPN or proxy servers. ) </pre> <p><br> Similar issue with Audible.

Below is the image I get when I try to log into twitter - the black box that has the login info remains and the entire page is no longer useable. When I refresh, it is like I never logged in in the first place. </p><p>I cleared cookies, my cache, I did the about:serviceworkers thing and unregistered the site. What else can I do? I can log in on chrome, plus whenever I try to log in I get a message on twitter that someone's trying to log in so I know its not an issue with my account </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,other,en-US,"",domochicka

However, this master password is required to start a session with Firefox. My suggestion is that you do not require the master password to start a Firefox session, only to access the passwords information, or to create and remember a login password for a new website. It is a hassle to enter the master password every time I want to use Firefox. Or should I keep firefox open the entire day? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",mcrick07-firefox
