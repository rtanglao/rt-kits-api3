This seems to be an issue with Firefox on my PC, as I have tried using the Netflix mobile app and (reluctantly) installing Chrome on my PC to test things out -- both had no problems -- yet I'm stumped! Again, I have gone through every option presented by the troubleshooting page; I have refreshed and reinstalled Firefox, made a new Firefox profile and tried it out with no extensions, scanned my PC thoroughly (with no issues presented), and nothing seems to budge. </p>",desktop;windows-10;firefox-1010;website-breakages;firefox-10101;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1512744;,igotmyphdindunk

You may need to restart your connected device and/or router.    * If you’re able to connect to the Internet on other devices, update your connect device’s DNS settings. Please check with your device’s manufacturer for further details.    * If you’re attempting to control a device using Alexa, try to unpair then pair the device again in the Alexa app.    * Deactivate any VPN or proxy servers. ) </pre> <p><br> Similar issue with Audible.
