When this happens, I exit and relaunch.  </p><p>Previously, it would be nearly instantaneously where the windows would close and the firefox.exe process would cease within seconds. Now, it's taking upwards of 5-10 minutes for the process to stop AFTER the windows have closed and, during that time, it'll bring the system to a near crawl. Once the process finally closes though, everything is back to working fine. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1070;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",rdr.mail
