I have been having issues opening Tumblr in firefox for about a month now. I have been clearing my cache, i deleted all of my browser history and cookies to the beginning of time, and tumblr still hangs whenever i open it, going unresponsive until I forcequit from the task manager. sometimes, if I grab the scrollbar and get it away from the top of the page before it hangs, itll let me browse no issue, but most of the time it takes about 2 seconds to become hanging/unresponsive. I have not experienced this issue on any other site with the frequency that Tumblr experiences, and I cannot find any help desk information about a problem like this. I would really like to avoid moving to a different browser but its getting kind of insane how hard it is to live around it. if I have music/video going in the background, it will continue to play while Im forced to hang on tumblr, until I forcequit. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1070;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",littlebluecolor
