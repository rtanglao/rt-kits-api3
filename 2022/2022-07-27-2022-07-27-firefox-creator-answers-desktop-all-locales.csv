It seems to me this isn't a windows 10 (21H2) problem, but a Firefox bug, or there's a setting I don't know about. I download many PDF statements every month, so it would be great if this auto encryption feature is restored.

I have checked the proper boxes to save and re-open the tabs from the previous close. This works amazingly well; often for vastly extended periods of time, as in months or years. Then I accidentally close the main window holding the desired tabs while having a second window open with some temporary webpage I was using earlier in the day hidden behind another window. Yes, it's almost not too late to save the mistake but it is often late in the evening and I just don't have the time to remember or find the correct steps to restore the lost tabs. Like what just happened to me at the end of my last session. I try and fail, and then try sleeping!  Also, if a tab sits for a few sessions without actually being activated by a mouse click, my experience suggests it is lost from history.  </p><p>Pease for the love of gawd fix this!!!  </p><p>There are several obvious choices for the programmers to consider. 1.) close the ""main"" and all other windows open with Firefox.  On restarting Firefox open all the previously open windows. 2.) let the user assign or define a master opening page with the desired web pages set as tabs. Then until 100 thousand years have passed always open this page with the defined tabs as set by the user. :-) 3.) do something else even more magical. </p><p>Finally, if anyone can update the steps to restore session tabs for version ~102. I've viewed several Q/A on restoring TABS but they seem to no longer apply.  I cannot restore from history, so I'll need to go a little deeper into the woods.
