But I don't want to use multiple profiles in google chrome for privacy reasons. I am already using one account in brave browser. If chrome is 100%, brave is 70% for me. I am testing opera and it has to be the WORST. My main usages in browser are reading pdfs, bookmarking, reading google books, watching youtube videos. And opera sucks for everything. Its bookmarking function is of 1947 age. I need sth better. I don't like edge as it is too slow in my laptop not sure why(although my laptop is decent). I prefer to use google account. Mozilla was too IDK what to tell, it wasn't slow, but it didn't feel professional, it was childish browser. Recommend me sth. I'll have to go with mozilla if things go wrong. Sell mozilla to me. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1518777;,davecomputertips

It always worked fine, set up to automatically open PDFs in Adobe, and they save to Downloads folder. For some reason now, after an update, the PDF always pulls up a save box and asks me to name the file (significantly slows down workflow). This only happened after an update. </p><p>I've figured out that the issue is related to a way that the PDFs are generated. So if I click it via a link that ends in .html instead of .pdf, it assumes it's a webpage and opens the pdf link in browser, and from there I have to click save, and then I'm prompted to type in the file name. </p><p>If I open a PDF link that's an actual .pdf file URL, then it saves to Downloads automatically and names the file ""contractfile-1111"" or whatever, numbered consecutively. Any ideas on how to get around this? </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,other,en-US,1518751;1518754;1518755;1518756;,peter.wolkow.

If it doesn't, well I'll have to manually restore it by sifting through the history. </p><p>I repeat, the key here is for me to find out whether or not firefox always keep a record of previous session somewhere. </p><p>So my question is, does it? Or does it purge all the previous session clean as long as the shutdown was deemed ""correct""? </p>",desktop;beta;other;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,other,en-US,1518734;,cruelintention869
