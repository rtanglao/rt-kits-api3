That was fixed by uninstalling/reinstalling and using links from the 'old firefox data' file. Some things did not come back as expected so I did a system restore. The last restore point was before the problem. That did not bring back the missing items though. </p><p>One of the things that changed is the 'shortcuts'  The shortcuts I used have mostly gone away and do not re-populate, so far. I liked the convenience of having this list of frequently used shortcuts and half the ones I always used are gone. </p><p>The recent activity links seem to be limited to 16 and are huge icons. </p><p>Now there was a change to the control bar top of the page. Specifically the download status icon. It used to show the download progress and terminate when the dl is complete. NOW, and I find it annoying, upon completion of the dl, a drop down list of the most recent downloads pops-up. Why? I do not need to see that list every time a dl successfully occurrs. And why is there no way to let it go back to the previous operation? </p><p>There is an old adage that software developers don't seem to get: ""If it aint broke, don't fix it."" </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Rosaliy-Lynne

If I close Firefox the updated folder disappears and and installs the latest update. Once I reopen Firefox I can see that it updated. I need this to happen without the browser being launched, closed and reopened. I went into Settings&gt;General and noticed that my update section is missing some of the update options that I see when researching. Automatically Install Updates and When Firefox is not Running options (see screen shots) are missing from my install. I am pretty sure this is why it will not truly silently auto update.
