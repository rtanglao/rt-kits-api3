RESET PASSWORD THROUGH AN EMAIL LINK AND IT WIPED MY ACCOUNT OF ALL DATA!,"<p><strong>bold text</strong>i had to reinstall windows and had trouble remembering my password and had no idea that resetting the password would refresh or wipe clean all my saved tabs and passwords.  This is aster-nine to think you browser gave no warning that this would happen.. I need my links, my tabs, password.  No I had no other sync's, don't think I ever set a key.  This is straight up stupid.   I need to recover my account!!<strong>bold text</strong> </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",juneannmystic

But this profile folder was modified by the restart process obviously, as windows gave firefox ""normal shutdown"" command. How do I know that? The next time I opened it up, it's ""brand new"" without the ""restore session"" interface.  </p><p>So my idea is to figure out if firefox keeps a track record of previous sessions EVEN IF THE SHUTDOWN WAS PROPER.  </p><p>If it does, well I'll have to figure out a way to ""trick"" firefox to restore it. If it doesn't, well I'll have to manually restore it by sifting through the history. </p><p>I repeat, the key here is for me to find out whether or not firefox always keep a record of previous session somewhere. </p><p>So my question is, does it? Or does it purge all the previous session clean as long as the shutdown was deemed ""correct""? </p>",desktop;beta;other;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,other,en-US,1518734;,cruelintention869

Sometimes, a veil comes over the page, and I can't click on anything.  And after this starts, I can go back to a book that worked fine, and now it gets veiled up.  If I get to other Amazon pages, this doesn't happen.  Restarting the computer, at times, doesn't help. </p><p>Current Firefox updated, Windows 10 Up to date.  Current Norton 360.

I am not allowed to progress past this screen. Any way I leave that screen, closing the app, using back, praying the 'x' in they lower left corner, reverts my login. So sync is not allowed on FF mobile anymore? I wish they wouldn't still list it as an option in the app if it's depreciated and no longer supported. If this is a bug, well you got me since FF also doesn't allow bug reporting. </p>",desktop;sync;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",jaredstander

The first time I tried to print a pdf from this computer via firefox (as windows does not allow pdf printing by default) and the print preview pops up with the loading symbol and just... never loads. Ever. I tried to switch to the default system dialogue via about:config and print.prefer_system_dialogue and setting it to true, but when I did that firefox just crashed every time I tried to print. I'd appreciate any help, as everything online in regards to this issue doesn't seem to help me at all. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1518716;1518720;1518721;,coolestclown
