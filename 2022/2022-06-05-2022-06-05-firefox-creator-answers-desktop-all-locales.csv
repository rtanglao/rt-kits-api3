Originally, Firefox was installed on the C: drive and working perfectly. In order to clear up space, I tried to use the Windows Move feature to move the program from the C: drive to the secondary (and larger) E: drive. Since then, Firefox won't work aside from opening a Firefox window. It will load no pages, settings, etc.  </p><p>I've tried uninstalling Firefox from both the C: and E: drives. Searched for any remaining files and deleted them. Deleted Old Firefox Data folders. I've reinstalled Firefox, without the option of where to install it, but it still fails to work at all. I get an error message regarding a missing file, VCRUNTIME140_1.dll. I've searched for the file and it's NOT missing. It is in both the Firefox folder and the Windows/Systems32 folder.  </p><p>I've searched for data in the Users folders that might relate to Firefox but NOTHING seems to work that will allow Firefox to work again. I've tried putting Firefox in Troubleshooting Mode but it won't restart as it says it needs to. It just won't work! </p><p>If anyone can just tell me how to COMPLETELY remove Firefox from both hard drives so that I can just do a clean, new Firefox install, that would be preferable. I know how to import bookmarks from Chrome. </p><p>If anyone can offer some help for someone who isn't great with computers, I would greatly appreciate it. If you need any other information, please don't hesitate to ask. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-11;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1510258;,shadley02

I had to find a way to delete the update so I could boot my system back. I asked few of my colleagues that use the same OS and they experienced the exact same problem. Surfing the web , makes it quite clear - this update is faulty and not compatible with win 7 as Microsoft claims.  I would like to get a straight answer - can I update my FF99 to FF100 , without the notorious KB4474419 , or , as of FF100 , win7 sp1 is no longer applicable to Firefox ?

For context, I use the dark theme provided default by Firefox. I need it for almost all other pages. But when it comes to viewing images, almost all are intended to be viewed on a white background so up till now I used the extension ""Image Background Color Picker"" to force the page to be white. I never had an issue with this until today.  </p><p>The extension is still functioning, I can see the lines of code its running on the page using inspect element. It has a feature that creates a checkered background instead of a flat color, which does also work if I turn that on. What I realized is that it seems like suddenly Firefox is using a flat .png as a background image for seemingly no reason? If it worked this way before, it did not interfere with extensions until now. When I disable this through the inspect feature the background underneath is white like intended. This is consistent even if I disable all relevant Add-ons. I've attached image examples of this, with no Add-Ons that should be effecting the page running.  </p><p>How can I get this to go away? Is there a way to go into Firefox's config and disable it through there? I don't want to have to keep installing more and more Add-ons seeing as Firefox can barely handle the ones I do run. I'm unable to use an ad-blocker to block it because they can't detect the .png on their own, presumably because its a Firefox asset instead of a webpage element? I have no clue. I just want to fix this. I can't use the light theme due to eye strain so for now I'm stuck disabling this .png manually every time I open an image. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1010;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",sixsevensheep

Very occasionally they will work for up to an hour or so but most of the time it is error messages or blank pages.
