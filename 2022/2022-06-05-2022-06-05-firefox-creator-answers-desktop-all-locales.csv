I am running widows 7 sp1. I installed the update as you mentioned in your Firefox 100 release notes.  After reboot , I got a beep and a black screen - win 7 won't start. I had to find a way to delete the update so I could boot my system back. I asked few of my colleagues that use the same OS and they experienced the exact same problem. Surfing the web , makes it quite clear - this update is faulty and not compatible with win 7 as Microsoft claims.  I would like to get a straight answer - can I update my FF99 to FF100 , without the notorious KB4474419 , or , as of FF100 , win7 sp1 is no longer applicable to FirefoxÂ ?

For context, I use the dark theme provided default by Firefox. I need it for almost all other pages. But when it comes to viewing images, almost all are intended to be viewed on a white background so up till now I used the extension ""Image Background Color Picker"" to force the page to be white. I never had an issue with this until today.  </p><p>The extension is still functioning, I can see the lines of code its running on the page using inspect element. It has a feature that creates a checkered background instead of a flat color, which does also work if I turn that on. What I realized is that it seems like suddenly Firefox is using a flat .png as a background image for seemingly no reason? If it worked this way before, it did not interfere with extensions until now. When I disable this through the inspect feature the background underneath is white like intended. This is consistent even if I disable all relevant Add-ons. I've attached image examples of this, with no Add-Ons that should be effecting the page running.  </p><p>How can I get this to go away? Is there a way to go into Firefox's config and disable it through there? I don't want to have to keep installing more and more Add-ons seeing as Firefox can barely handle the ones I do run. I'm unable to use an ad-blocker to block it because they can't detect the .png on their own, presumably because its a Firefox asset instead of a webpage element? I have no clue. I just want to fix this. I can't use the light theme due to eye strain so for now I'm stuck disabling this .png manually every time I open an image. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1010;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",sixsevensheep

This happens even when starting up Firefox in troubleshooting mode. This does not happen when visiting Youtube with the Google Chrome browser. I'm using version 101.0 (64-bit) in Windows 10 Home. How can I get it to stop displaying duplicates of things on the Youtube site? </p>",desktop;firefox-1010;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1510101;,Mailleweaver

Whenever I attempt to access ANY website that is operated by Cloudflare, I'm often presented with a blank page, or a Firefox error message. Sometimes I'm even presented with the DDoS protection error, even though my computer is clean having being scanned by Kaspersky and Malware Bytes. </p><p>I reiterate this and say that it's only Cloudflare sites that are causing problems. Very occasionally they will work for up to an hour or so but most of the time it is error messages or blank pages. Interestingly, other web servers such as Amazon, OVH SAS and Akamai all run with no problems so I wonder what is Cloudflare's problem? Is this something to do with my browser or the web hosting services? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1010;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1510093;1510095;1510096;1510097;1510098;1510099;1510100;1510103;1510104;1510105;,ichigatsusayonara

Installed it.  Super.  Great.  Now ALL of my addons and bookmarks are nowhere to be found!  It's a 'blank browser.'  It *did* prompt me to import bookmarks from another browser; I assumed that meant *in addition to* my already existing Firefox bookmarks.  Nope.  The only bookmarks I have are the ones I imported from Chrome.  And no add-ons.  No password manager.  No Ant downloader.  No adblock.  Nothing.  All just gone. </p><p>How can I put all this back in place?  Failing that, how do I roll back from this ""new and improved"" version back to my old one? </p><p>And why did Firefox see fit to totally trash my existing install settings and bookmarks and addons when it upgraded?  Just swept it off the table and glommed this new thing in its place.  Not appreciated.  Most grateful for any help here! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1510109;1510171;1510185;,kharrisma
