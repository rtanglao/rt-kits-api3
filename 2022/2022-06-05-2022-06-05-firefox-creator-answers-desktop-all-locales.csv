This happens even when starting up Firefox in troubleshooting mode. This does not happen when visiting Youtube with the Google Chrome browser. I'm using version 101.0 (64-bit) in Windows 10 Home. How can I get it to stop displaying duplicates of things on the Youtube site? </p>",desktop;firefox-1010;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1510101;,Mailleweaver

Whenever I attempt to access ANY website that is operated by Cloudflare, I'm often presented with a blank page, or a Firefox error message. Sometimes I'm even presented with the DDoS protection error, even though my computer is clean having being scanned by Kaspersky and Malware Bytes. </p><p>I reiterate this and say that it's only Cloudflare sites that are causing problems. Very occasionally they will work for up to an hour or so but most of the time it is error messages or blank pages. Interestingly, other web servers such as Amazon, OVH SAS and Akamai all run with no problems so I wonder what is Cloudflare's problem? Is this something to do with my browser or the web hosting services? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1010;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1510093;1510095;1510096;1510097;1510098;1510099;1510100;1510103;1510104;,ichigatsusayonara

Installed it.  Super.  Great.  Now ALL of my addons and bookmarks are nowhere to be found!  It's a 'blank browser.'  It *did* prompt me to import bookmarks from another browser; I assumed that meant *in addition to* my already existing Firefox bookmarks.  Nope.  The only bookmarks I have are the ones I imported from Chrome.  And no add-ons.  No password manager.  No Ant downloader.  No adblock.  Nothing.  All just gone. </p><p>How can I put all this back in place?  Failing that, how do I roll back from this ""new and improved"" version back to my old one? </p><p>And why did Firefox see fit to totally trash my existing install settings and bookmarks and addons when it upgraded?  Just swept it off the table and glommed this new thing in its place.  Not appreciated.  Most grateful for any help here! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",kharrisma
