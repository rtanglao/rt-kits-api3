I cant do anything on that tab but when I quit and restart it ends up on this new tab -  quit and restart FF -  it ends up on this new blank tab -  go to “Preferences” -&gt; ""saved logins” -  it then asks for the Primary password again and this time it works -  now when I go to the original page that needed a password, it works and all other tabs work </p><p><br> I've waited across 4 major releases to see if this issue gets fixed - I have a feeling it may have worked in 107.0 but then definitely didnt work in 107.1.  I've recently upgraded to 108 and it's still there. </p><p>I'm happy to send screen shots or a screen video capture if any of this doesn't make sense. </p><p>Please let me know if there is any setting i can use to fix this.  I hate to move away from FF but this is getting pretty annoying. </p><p><br> thanks, peter </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1080;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",psucic

I want to transfer my History in Ice Dragon to Firefox (I already have successfully imported the Ice Dragon bookmarks). I have so far tried 3 ways of doing so, all of which have been unsuccessful: 1. through the History file menu in Firefox, I tried to <strong>Import </strong>the History, but IceDragon is not listed as one of the browser choices to import from 2. I have tried to <strong>Export</strong> the History through the Ice Dragon History file menu, but it does not provide for History to be exported, only bookmarks (unlike the Export option in Firefox) 3. I have copied the <strong>Places</strong> file from my profile in Ice Dragon to my profile in Firefox, but can't figure out how to get Firefox to recognize that old history Can anyone please advise whether there is a way to accomplish what I want? Please bear in mind that while I am an experienced computer user, I have no technical background for revising the registry or doing any coding.  If it makes a difference, I am using a desktop PC with Windows 10. Thank you. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,other,en-US,"",mattoys
