At 90% and 120% its renders correctly. </p><p>I have attached a sample PNG with the font at 120% and the font at 100% resized so they are equal in total pixel volume to illustrate the difference. </p><p>Already looked at the following: </p> <ul><li> Turning off ClearType in Windows. </li><li> Various settings using the font-smoothing css property: </li></ul> <p><a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-smooth"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/d.../font-smooth</a> </p><p>Neither of these seem to have any effect. Because my font is meant to have an old school video game style and feel the way that it renders, trying to smooth it over has a negative effect. </p><p>I realize the fix may not be something that can be changed in FireFox itself, but if anyone who has experience with this type of issue can offer any advice or guidance it would be greatly appreciated. </p><p>You can play around with the zoom levels with my font here: <a href=""https://www.stevesgames.com/about"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.stevesgames.com/about</a> </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",stevesgames
