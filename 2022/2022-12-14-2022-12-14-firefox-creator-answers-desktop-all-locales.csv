This works by allocating a socket             to listen to port on the local side, optionally bound to the specified bind_address.  Whenever a             connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and the             application protocol is then used to determine where to connect to from the remote machine.              Currently the SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 protocols are supported, and ssh will act as a SOCKS             server.  </pre> <p>Tried it today and it doesn't work any more.

I have tried to <strong>Export</strong> the History through the Ice Dragon History file menu, but it does not provide for History to be exported, only bookmarks (unlike the Export option in Firefox) 3. I have copied the <strong>Places</strong> file from my profile in Ice Dragon to my profile in Firefox, but can't figure out how to get Firefox to recognize that old history Can anyone please advise whether there is a way to accomplish what I want?
