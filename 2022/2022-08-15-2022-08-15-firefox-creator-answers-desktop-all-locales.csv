I want to load Firefox as my browser (I've been using it almost since it's inception) thru the Microsoft store. I do NOT want to activate Edge which is preloaded and want's everything but my bloodtype to set up Edge so that I can go get Firefox. I've pulled up article after article that it can now be directly loaded from the Microsoft store but when I open the store and search for Firefox... it's nowhere to be found. I really don't wanna start up the edge. Anyone know what's going on with this?  Or is Microsoft being it's usual sneaky self and forcing me to activate edge and then maybe firefox will show up in the store?  Hopefully someone will answer this quickly as I sit here waiting to continue my setup.

I have tried to move my cursor to the edges of the dialog box so I can drag the box edges to make it smaller but the little arrow that appears can only make it bigger not smaller. How can I go back to the regular default  ""Save Page As"" dialog box that I had before?  I have included a screen capture of the big dialog box and a picture of the regular dialog box.
