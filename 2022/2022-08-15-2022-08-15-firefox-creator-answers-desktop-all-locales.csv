(2) But the ""Send Page to Device"" and ""Send Tab to Device"" commands are not available (see the screen shots below).

The last time I logged-in successfully was in late May 2022. Later attempts, starting in July, all failed. I then proceeded to trouble shoot by clearing the History’s cookies, cache, Browsing and downloaded history, followed by deleting Site cookies and Site data. I ensured JavaScript, Cookies and third Party Cookies were enabled. The above steps did not fix the problem. I further checked that the CPU time &amp; Zone was correct and I ran a Norton Security full system drive scan. I also Refreshed Firefox and reinstalled Firefox (I did not clear any Firefox related App Data profiles in Windows. Using the Edge Browser did not help. The Internet security options TLS 1.1 to TLS 1.3 boxes were all selected. There were no errors reported when accessing the site.  The above steps did not fix the problem. To further investigate the problem,  I clicked on the site lock icon next to the address field which showed the correct site information followed by another lock icon and the clause that the  “Connection is secure. I then clicked on the adjacent &gt; arrow, which opened a new dialog box displaying another lock icon followed by “You are securely connected to this site” and “Verified by: “Sample Ca2” certificate.
