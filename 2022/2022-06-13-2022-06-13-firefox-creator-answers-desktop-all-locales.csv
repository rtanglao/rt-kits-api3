UGH </p><p>It doesn't happen with Chrome, so something is wrong with Firefox. Every other update seems to break that website. Whenever I go to comment, the links don't do what they're supposed to do. When I submit a comment, Firefox just spins forever, and I refresh the page and see that my comment did indeed post. For every friggin' comment? UUUUUGH!  From trying to see the Pending posts to simply clicking 'Load more comments', everything is broken in that section of articles. </p><p>I can manage to see pending posts if I toggle the 'Sort by' to something else, but I can't see all the comments because clicking on 'Load more comments' just sits there doing nothing. Sometimes there are comments and Firefox acts like there are none. I double checked by using Chrome and could see everything. </p><p>What's wrong with Firefox? It's getting so convoluted, I'm having a tough time wanting to use it anymore, and I've been using this browser for a long, long time. </p><p>I don't feel like showing any images of this, because you can't see what isn't available to be seen. Oh, and if one more green tech tells me to clear my cookies &amp; cache, I'm going to pull the rest of my hair out, and it's hard to grab because it's disappearing on me ... hahahahaha. If that's the problem, then why don't I have to do that with Chrome? Is Firefox stepping on itself? Clearing that makes me have to login to a crap-load of websites and isn't a catch-all solution.

Problémy jsou celkem zatím 4. 1. problém pokud chci kliknout na kterékoliv stránce na nabídku možností tak mě ihned zmizí a já nejsem schopen zadat možnost, třeba je tam otázka jak se cítíte a na sloupci jsou různé možnosti vyčerpaný veselý nebo smutný a ta nabídka mě vždy ihned zmizne. 2. Problém je ten že prohlížeč fotek po zobrazení fotek se mě automaticky zvětší na maximální rozlišení přitom to nikdy nedělalo. 3. problém je ten že když kliknu na odkazy tak se automaticky začne rolovat stránka takže nic nedělám s myší a automaticky se mi posunuje stránka. 4. Problém je že na některých videích mi automaticky zlumí hlasitost můžete se prosím na to podívat a problém vyřešit momentálně musím používat konkurenci Microsoft Edge děkuji moc za vyřízení. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;,firefox,fix-problems,cs,"",burza.akcie

So here's what happened: I had Rayrsn's <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/dark-space-full-transparent/"" rel=""nofollow"">""Dark Space Full Transparent"" theme</a> installed; its code is also available on <a href=""https://github.com/Rayrsn/Dark-space-full-transparent"" rel=""nofollow"">GitHub</a> and it has been forked from another theme called <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nicothin-space/"" rel=""nofollow"">""Dark Space""</a> by Nicothin. It is a nearly all-black theme, sporting an animated dark UI (including a black/dark Find bar that popped when pressing Ctrl+F); it had been working perfectly fine for many months now. </p><p>Then, I got a notification saying Firefox now had a new feature called Firefox Colors, which allows custmomization of the UI colors. </p><p>I hopped on tried and played around changing a few colors here and there. Then, dissatisfied with the results, I tried undoing a few of the changes I've made and it didn't work out well. So, I clicked <a href=""https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/firefox-color-addon-screenshot.png"" rel=""nofollow"">this cursed button: ""Revert All""</a> (the leftmost button on top). </p><p>After that, my theme glitched and got corrupted, and now the Find bar always appears in a milky-white color, instead of the theme's default black color. I am unable to undo or revert this one change, either from Colors or from anywhere else. </p><p>I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the theme. It doesn't work. I tried uninstalling the Firefox Color addon. Zero results. I tried restoring Firefox. It didn't work either. I tried fully uninstalling Firefox. Nope. I tried disabling Firefox Sync. It took me a while to succeed in it, but it didn't solve my problem. Finally, I tried uninstalling Developer Edition and using other editions of Firefox instead. The issue persists. </p><p>I suspect there must some setting buried down deep somewhere in my OS must be affecting this one theme. What should I do? What files or settings do I need to dive into and change? </p><p>I know it may sound like a very trivial problem, but for me, it has become so annoying and aggravating that I don't even feel like using Firefox anymore. </p><p>PLEASE HELP ME.
