It does not mater where the cursor is placed on the screen either the arrow or the hand will flash when moving. My system is a windows pro 10 system with all updates, last updates for W10 were made a couple of weeks ago, on Firefox whenever it asks to upgrade I do it.   </p><p>Specifically: 1.	 If the mouse is stationary there is no cursor, if I move it the cursor flashes.  2.	When the system comes up and I launch Firefox all is OK for about 2 – 3 minutes then the flashing begins. 3.	If I stop Firefox ie “X” it and restart it the flashing occurs within 0 – 30 seconds. 4.	If I restart the PC steps 2 &amp; 3 repeat. </p><p>I have two other PC’s Windows Home, and Windows 7, as well as a laptop with Windows Home all with Firefox 101.0.1 all up to date all do not have the above issue.  This does not occur with any other programs.  I have two monitors, tried Firefox on each makes no difference same problem. </p><p>I have tried searching the internet and all I find is about  Caret which is off.  I uninstalled Firefox and installed it. That made no difference. </p><p>Any assistance will be appreciated. </p><p>Thank You </p><p>Bob </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",bobsmodels1
