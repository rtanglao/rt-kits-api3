I have two devices: </p><p>1. Personal laptop 2. Work laptop </p><p>I'd like to keep my bookmarks, history, addons etc separate, but be able to access my work environment when working from home on my personal laptop. I've read a lot about profiles and sync and multi-account container but I'm still confused as to how I achieve what I'm trying to do. </p><p>Having multiple profiles on one device is straightforward. But AFAIK if I attach two profiles to the same sync account, and try to sync both between two devices, it will only sync one of the profiles (and then merge everything if I try to sync the other). And if I have two separate sync accounts (work and personal), each with a single profile, I can't switch between them without also merging everything. How does one achieve this then? </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",tom.saunders90

When I opened Firefox, the newly-opened Firefox window appeared separated from the pinned icon in the taskbar. I liked this because it allowed me to open new windows faster. Now, I had to uninstall and re-install Firefox (the last version as of today) because of some problem. Now, this separation no longer occurs. If I open Firefox, the opened window and the pinned icon in the taskbar become the same thing. How can I fix this? </p><p>I am using Windows 8 Pro btw. </p><p>I attached a screenshot to show how it looks like. </p>",desktop;other;windows-8;firefox-1010;,firefox,other,en-US,"",KingMassen

UGH </p><p>It doesn't happen with Chrome, so something is wrong with Firefox. Every other update seems to break that website. Whenever I go to comment, the links don't do what they're supposed to do. When I submit a comment, Firefox just spins forever, and I refresh the page and see that my comment did indeed post. For every friggin' comment? UUUUUGH!  From trying to see the Pending posts to simply clicking 'Load more comments', everything is broken in that section of articles. </p><p>I can manage to see pending posts if I toggle the 'Sort by' to something else, but I can't see all the comments because clicking on 'Load more comments' just sits there doing nothing. Sometimes there are comments and Firefox acts like there are none. I double checked by using Chrome and could see everything. </p><p>What's wrong with Firefox? It's getting so convoluted, I'm having a tough time wanting to use it anymore, and I've been using this browser for a long, long time. </p><p>I don't feel like showing any images of this, because you can't see what isn't available to be seen.
