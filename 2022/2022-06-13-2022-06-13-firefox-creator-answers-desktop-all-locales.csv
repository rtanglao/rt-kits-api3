I am running Windows 10, version 21H2.  So here's what happened: I had Rayrsn's <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/dark-space-full-transparent/"" rel=""nofollow"">""Dark Space Full Transparent"" theme</a> installed; its code is also available on <a href=""https://github.com/Rayrsn/Dark-space-full-transparent"" rel=""nofollow"">GitHub</a> and it has been forked from another theme called <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nicothin-space/"" rel=""nofollow"">""Dark Space""</a> by Nicothin. It is a nearly all-black theme, sporting an animated dark UI (including a black/dark Find bar that popped when pressing Ctrl+F); it had been working perfectly fine for many months now. </p><p>Then, I got a notification saying Firefox now had a new feature called Firefox Colors, which allows custmomization of the UI colors. </p><p>I hopped on tried and played around changing a few colors here and there. Then, dissatisfied with the results, I tried undoing a few of the changes I've made and it didn't work out well. So, I clicked <a href=""https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/firefox-color-addon-screenshot.png"" rel=""nofollow"">this cursed button: ""Revert All""</a> (the leftmost button on top). </p><p>After that, my theme glitched and got corrupted, and now the Find bar always appears in a milky-white color, instead of the theme's default black color. I am unable to undo or revert this one change, either from Colors or from anywhere else. </p><p>I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the theme. It doesn't work. I tried uninstalling the Firefox Color addon. Zero results. I tried restoring Firefox. It didn't work either. I tried fully uninstalling Firefox. Nope. I tried disabling Firefox Sync. It took me a while to succeed in it, but it didn't solve my problem. Finally, I tried uninstalling Developer Edition and using other editions of Firefox instead. The issue persists. </p><p>I suspect there must some setting buried down deep somewhere in my OS must be affecting this one theme. What should I do? What files or settings do I need to dive into and change? </p><p>I know it may sound like a very trivial problem, but for me, it has become so annoying and aggravating that I don't even feel like using Firefox anymore. </p><p>PLEASE HELP ME. Thank you. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",lucaspestana
