Does anyone know how to get google back as my search engine? Going into preferences, then search, and then clicking the drop-down list for search engines, no longer works. The list now only gives an available option of ""a browser"", with no clear way of adding anything to the list. And any search on the topic only tells me how to change the default IF that drop-down list gives other options. I'm assuming I can add to the list, but it doesn't give any clear way of doing that from there. Like for example, I seem to recall that in the past it showed ""add default browser"" at the bottom of the drop down list, or somewhere readily visible like that. Searching extensions and add-ons gives me a dozen options that aren't just google search.

As Microsoft has done its thing with reguard to windows and my PC and because it only seems to happen with a combination of firefox and facebook they don't think they have a problem but it is with their development team for further investigation.

Issue is - the apple support person did not remind me to save down my firefox browser data/bookmarks. Now my mac is updated and it's like a brand new computer. I searched previous forums and apparently firefox automatically saves down your data but I don't see it in the appropriate folder (Old Firefox Data &gt;bookmarkbackups) - I see data from 2016 and 2017. Can I recover these bookmarks?? I had a lot of important ones saved.. </p>,desktop;bookmarks;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1498324;1498397;1498409;,pujadevi204

For page loads, fastest is Mozilla. Further information is needed please. Name: Kevin Michael Callihan Sr, 2 emails with gmail: [edited email from public] @gmail.com and [edited email from public] @gmail.com, then another outlook account added because Microsoft claimed it was needed when it was for sake of greed and profits: [edited email from public] @outlook.com *I would not share this unless a belief in trusted caretakers online exist knowing the dominant system is Microsoft/Windows which is why I sense something being wrong, on occasion.

Consequently, this is not a genuine upgrade but instead is the implementation of a new client. Previously, Firefox upgrades saved both Tabs and Bookmarks. Unfortunately recent upgrades no longer perform this function.  </p><p>Requiring users to manually (dangerously) search through past Profiles and hopefully select the correct profile to launch in an attempt to restore these two features is burdensome to users. Additionally, when one of many past profiles is selected for launch, Tabs are not restored. Previous Bookmarks are restore under different headings that require new navigation clicks to access. </p><p>The first attempt to upgrade installed Firefox 72. After reverting back to the older version and attempting a second upgrade, the new launch was Firefox 100b. Go figure. </p><p>As I write this message in a newly upgraded Version 72, I am uncertain as to whether or not to set this as the default version out of fear of not being able to eventually get my Tabs from my older version. So I will revert back to the older version in the hope that I might eventually learn how to defeat this current Firefox Fault. </p><p>Thank you for the help and links to instructions to fix this problem that were sent. The steps provided were not clear enough to follow without repeatedly failing to fix the problem. IE: ""Restore Session"" options did not exist; Tabs were not restored when Bookmarks were restore in a completely modified user interface; the means to determine which of dozens of Profiles to select was not provided. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-720;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",Doc10
