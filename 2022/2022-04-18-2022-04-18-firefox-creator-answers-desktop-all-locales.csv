Issue is - the apple support person did not remind me to save down my firefox browser data/bookmarks. Now my mac is updated and it's like a brand new computer. I searched previous forums and apparently firefox automatically saves down your data but I don't see it in the appropriate folder (Old Firefox Data &gt;bookmarkbackups) - I see data from 2016 and 2017. Can I recover these bookmarks?? I had a lot of important ones saved.. </p>,desktop;bookmarks;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1498324;,pujadevi204

For page loads, fastest is Mozilla. Further information is needed please. Name: Kevin Michael Callihan Sr, 2 emails with gmail: calsonassociates24@gmail.com and callihan.kevinmichael@gmail.com, then another outlook account added because Microsoft claimed it was needed when it was for sake of greed and profits: primitivecool2020@outlook.com *I would not share this unless a belief in trusted caretakers online exist knowing the dominant system is Microsoft/Windows which is why I sense something being wrong, on occasion.

Consequently, this is not a genuine upgrade but instead is the implementation of a new client. Previously, Firefox upgrades saved both Tabs and Bookmarks. Unfortunately recent upgrades no longer perform this function.  </p><p>Requiring users to manually (dangerously) search through past Profiles and hopefully select the correct profile to launch in an attempt to restore these two features is burdensome to users. Additionally, when one of many past profiles is selected for launch, Tabs are not restored. Previous Bookmarks are restore under different headings that require new navigation clicks to access. </p><p>The first attempt to upgrade installed Firefox 72. After reverting back to the older version and attempting a second upgrade, the new launch was Firefox 100b. Go figure. </p><p>As I write this message in a newly upgraded Version 72, I am uncertain as to whether or not to set this as the default version out of fear of not being able to eventually get my Tabs from my older version. So I will revert back to the older version in the hope that I might eventually learn how to defeat this current Firefox Fault. </p><p>Thank you for the help and links to instructions to fix this problem that were sent. The steps provided were not clear enough to follow without repeatedly failing to fix the problem. IE: ""Restore Session"" options did not exist; Tabs were not restored when Bookmarks were restore in a completely modified user interface; the means to determine which of dozens of Profiles to select was not provided. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-720;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",Doc10
