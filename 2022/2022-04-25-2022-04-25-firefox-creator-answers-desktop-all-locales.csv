However, recently in the last few months (not sure) when the change happened, the timezone (stamp) at the end of the screenshot is NOT based on the ""local"" PC that is using it. I am in EST but it shows a different time zone which creates a problem. Since Mozilla Online is China based entity, I believe it is showing their timezone. I checked the settings and I could not find where to change the timezone to local time. This is key for many users as we need a ""correct"" local timezone.  </p><p>Previous versions had this feature (automatically) and I did not have to set it up.  Can we have the option to change the timezone please? Thanks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,other,en-US,"",azitam

Dopo aver eliminato un profilo aggiunto da poco, si sono eliminati tutti i miei file presenti sul desktop senza alcuna possibilità di recupero. Avevo salvato il profilo creato sul desktop e quindi nell'eliminarlo ha riconosciuto tutti i file presenti come associati al profilo stesso, eliminandoli. </p><p>C'è qualcuno a cui sia successo lo stesso che magari è riuscito a recuperare i dati? Mi sono già rivolto a centri specializzati ma per loro i dati risultano purtroppo irrecuperabili, non capendo in che modo sia correlato mozilla con la perdita dei file. Posso fare qualcosa?
