I tried doing what was listed in them to make a backup/export but looking at the html only shows the book mark and no other fields related to the them.  The bookmark-notes add-on is 4 years old so I don't know if that would help me get my stored information.  This is causing me lots of problems.  Please advise. </p>",linux;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-990;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1499932;,ittome
