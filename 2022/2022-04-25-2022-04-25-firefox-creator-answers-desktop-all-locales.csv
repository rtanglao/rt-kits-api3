Also, as I am replying to an email, the ""system"" occasionally opens another email document and at the same time moves the email I am trying to respond to.  It moves the email, not to trash, but to Archive.  I never use the archive feature.  How do I fix these problems.  Something has obviously gotten changed in ""settings"" but I cannot figure out where or how to fix.  The ""suggested text"" feature is disasterous and annoying and it has got to be removed somehow.

So my moan/quesion is this: why the blankety blank, doesn't Firefox add something into the menu (View or Options or somewhere) that says ""Show toolbar permanently"". Would save all this frsutration and irritation. The impression I get is that Mozilla thinks we should not want to have the menu on screen all the time. But that is the problem with users!

All other browser functions work fluently from the beginning. Also the slowness only happens after opening and not during further use. Which Firefox is refusing to load I can open other tabs and e.g. do a Google search and then the ""slowness timer"" starts again (independently if the first tab is closed or stays open) and refuses to do anything on that tab. Once the slownedd period is over all tabs are loaded and no further problem occurs. This issue occurs only when the GPO ""URL for Home Page"" is applied. But this page is reachable and when Firefox is working it loads within milliseconds. For testing I created a new profile and on the first startup the problem already occurs. And all other startups too. When temporarily removing this one GPO entry it immediately works again fluently. It also doesn't matter what I set as home page (company internal website or some random web page); it is always slow once this setting is in place. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-990;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",FelixFT
