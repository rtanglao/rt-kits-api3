School just started and I'm now finding my SCORM modules will not open with Firefox.  If I use Chrome they work just fine. I have refreshed Firefox and also gone into troubleshooting mode.  They still won't load.  They do load when played directly from my hard drive.  I can't help that some security feature in a newer version of Firefox is blocking this. </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,other,en-US,1528487;1528497;,Tom-Brox
