It works if I try in an incognito window (with all the same extensions active) or another browser. I have noticed the problem on a Linux Mint laptop as well as on a macbook. On the Linux laptop I tried replacing the built in Firefox with the one from the the Mozilla homepage with no improvement. If I clear history in Firefox it seems to work once or twice and then the problem reappears. I also tried disabling hardware acceleration but no dice. There does not seem to be any difference whether I am logged in to my YouTube account or not. I have even tried reinstalling the computer but the problem does not disappear. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",joakim6

Whenever I search for something from the address bar, there's a chance I'll instead get directed to a page suggesting that I search with duckduckgo. The thing is, I was using duckduckgo for a while and even with it set as my default search engine, this page still came up sometimes instead of my search result. And then I have to type in my search again. I eventually found an option in duckduckgo settings that said something like ""occasionally suggest using duckduckgo?"" and I unchecked that. And yet, the problem still persisted. Annoyed by this, I eventually uninstalled duckduckgo completely and decided to stick with google, but I was still getting redirected to this page! I'd say I get taken here instead of to my search results at least 5-10 times a day depending on how much searching I'm doing, and that's enough for it to get irritating. Does anyone know how to permanently block this intrusive feature for good? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",EaredEars
