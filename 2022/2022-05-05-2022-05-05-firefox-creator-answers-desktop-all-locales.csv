I don't have any 3rd party password managers and I've tried with my VPN disconnected. I've used the password generator to secure some of my websites so I don't even know was some of my passwords are, so resetting the primary password would be a huge hassle.

I have never had a problem with closing a Firefox session with 8-12 open tabs and then re-opening Firefox later and having all the same tabs re-open with the new Firefox session.

It happens enough that I almost read past it as if it was correct english. </p><p>For example, a quoted Tweet on this site is shown as: ""You clearly didn\u2019t bother to read her reply to him lol!

Ellipses, colons, quotations, brackets, dashes all appear fine.  </p><p>I saw an article regarding Thunderbird that seemed very similar but didn't see much to help me.  (questions/1312056).  I saw a post about FF not using the Symbols font but that didn't help and I can't see how this should be a font issue (especially Symbol v. apostrophe). </p><p>Is there a way to fix it?  The issue maybe due to the way the website is publishing quotes--I checked and found apostrophes appearing correctly on that page in the article headline and body text.  The error is only inside the posted quotes. </p><p>Also, I don't see the pics of the quoted Tweets, just the text and I have to click on the date of the post to go to Twitter to see any graphic.  Maybe that will help figure out what the apostrophe error is or maybe it is a second error/issue? </p><p>I run NoScript and uBlock Origin but I don' see any setting that would cause an issue. (uBlock is not blocking remote fonts. <a href=""http://Twitter.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Twitter.com</a> is not blocked by NoScript). </p><p>I'm no computer programmer or web designer but I find it hard to believe that an apostrophe should cause such a silly error. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",windows-7;desktop;websites;firefox-1000;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",zaneszoo
