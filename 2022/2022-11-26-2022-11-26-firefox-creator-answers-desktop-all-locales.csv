For such customers, the Pinnacle Sports website requires the use of a WiFi internet connection and a GeoComply App. However, since then, I am no longer able to connect successfully with the Pinnacle Sports website with the Firefox browser, although I am still able to connect successfully with Microsoft Edge and Chrome, etc. Thus far, neither, Pinnacle Sports nor GeoComply App Support has been able to tellme what might have changed over the last few days with the Firefox browser, in order to bring this problem about, so I thought I might be able to get some help with this situation from Mozilla Firefox Support. Might you be able to identify the source of this recent problem? And, erhaps, provide a solution that will allow the use of the Firefox browser with the Pinnacle Sports website for customers based in Ontario Canada, moving forward?
