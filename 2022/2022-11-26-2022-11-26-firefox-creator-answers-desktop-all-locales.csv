The color of tab add button was changed, and the button is not visible with my Windows 7 classic windows system theme. So, I'm trying to find a way to port System theme 1.0 color scheme to newer firefox versions. </p><p>Creation of a simple theme with firefox color extension works. But it is unable to recreate the effects related to active and inactive window color changes. As, I had to use bitmap to get the OS blue color transition pattern. </p><p>It seems the system theme is stored in omni.ja file. Modification of the omni.ja seems to be not a practical solution. So, it would be a better way to create an addon theme with the same code as the System Theme 1.0. </p><p>The first question is, if it will be possible to create a theme with the same code as a system theme has. Will it be able to perform the same way? </p><p>The next question is: Where the source code of the system theme is? I was unable to find it in the Firefox source. It seems, it is not stored in any obvious location. </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-919;firefox-9191;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",sforforsoft
