In fact, the oldest crash report had been from August. It'll start by freezing up, and then it will stop responding, and even if I wait for a bit, it never starts up again. Sometimes I cant even close it normally (like with the ""would you like to close (insert program) or wait for it to respond?) panel) and have to resort to using the task manager. Other browsers work just fine, but Firefox has been a long time favorite, so I'm hesitant to stop using it altogether despite it's current issues. </p><p>I've tried just about everything, including troubleshooting mode - it still crashes - and refreshing it repeatedly. I've also tried uninstalling and reinstalling, doing full scans of my computer multiple times for malware - coming up empty - and doing full computer restarts as well. Nothing I've done has managed to work, and every other suggestion is something I've already tried. I'm even beginning to think it's a problem with my PC itself, even though Firefox is the only thing having this issue. </p><p>This never happened before the most recent update, and my current version is 106.0.2. I'm not sure what to do now, and I'm very tech-illiterate, so I'd like some help please. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",p1nkdw3ll3rmask

Now i dont think its a big deal because so far i can tell those connections to the adress 127.0.0.1 should be only local connections that dont leave my local network, right? Question is, why does it do that? The standard firefox browser doesnt ever behave like that, so why does the dev version? What i dont like here is the fact that a program does things on its own without me interacting with it, firefox is a browser and should only be active when i use it, not on its own. So what are these connections and why are they there? How do you disable the browser acting on its own? I did not install the maintenance service. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1060;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1544533;1544538;1544559;,Firefox_Beginner
