I have 2 computers and at least 3 mobile devices in regular use, all with Firefox as the default browser. I have been using Firefox for over a decade and I have literally thousands of bookmarks saved. Whenever I go into the bookmarks menu to find a saved bookmark, I am confronted with multiple folders with the same names and the same bookmarks saved in each folder. Is there a Master record of bookmarks saved in the cloud that I can use as a default for each device or am I stuck with all of the duplicates and hours of comparing and deleting in order to make it all make sense? </p>",windows-7;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-1050;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1544532;,truvoice1

Now i dont think its a big deal because so far i can tell those connections to the adress 127.0.0.1 should be only local connections that dont leave my local network, right? Question is, why does it do that? The standard firefox browser doesnt ever behave like that, so why does the dev version? What i dont like here is the fact that a program does things on its own without me interacting with it, firefox is a browser and should only be active when i use it, not on its own. So what are these connections and why are they there? How do you disable the browser acting on its own? I did not install the maintenance service. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1060;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1544533;1544538;,Firefox_Beginner
