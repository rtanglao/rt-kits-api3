It seems to be on just about every webpage I click on in the lower right hand corner. I can move it around, and when I click on it it ""pulses"" but doesn't really seem to do anything else. The ""10"" will sometimes disappear and the little ball will ""jump"" when I click on it before settling back into place. The little ball will switch seemingly at random from top to bottom.  </p><p>The only webpage I haven't seen it on so far is this one...I have tried right clicking and nothing happens. I don't see any way to remove it. </p><p>Can you tell me what this is and/or how to get rid of it? Is it possible it's from one of my extensions? I haven't added any new ones in a while and it seems weird that it would show up all of a sudden with no explanation of how to use it or what it is... </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,other,en-US,1544705;,caseyj.mattsen

Mi trovo molto bene ma ho riscontrato un problema che davvero non mi consente di navigare con la stessa semplicità e dimestichezza avuta con altri browser. Mi spiego meglio: Ho installato e creato account sul mio pc fisso (DESKTOP), ho tranquillamente importato password, segnalibri, etc. dal vecchio browser...tutto perfetto, funziona a meraviglia. Installo firefox per android sul cellulare, effettuo l'accesso, sincronizzo con codice QR per par riconoscere il dispositivo. Qui cominciano i problemi....le password non vengono importate. Per accedere ai siti non mi visualizza le credenziali, nulla, come se non esistessero (ho anche aviato sincronizzazione manuale ma niente). Faccio la stessa operazione sul LAPTOP. Eseguo accesso al mio account, mi carica tutti i segnalibri ma con credenziali e password lo stesso porblema! Nono posso accedere ai siti salvati e sono costretto ad aprire il vecchio browser. Premetto che tali operazioni erano semplicissime su EDGE e CHROME, che sincronizzavano all'istante tutti i segnalibri, le credenziali, etc.  Nel mio caso ho settato tutte le impostazioni possibili ma nulla...non mi sincronizza su nessun altro dispositivo. Voglio concludere facendo notare che ho consultato tutte le guide possibili e verificato il corretto settaggio delle impostazioni ma nulla, non so come fare....

In fact, the oldest crash report had been from August. It'll start by freezing up, and then it will stop responding, and even if I wait for a bit, it never starts up again. Sometimes I cant even close it normally (like with the ""would you like to close (insert program) or wait for it to respond?) panel) and have to resort to using the task manager. Other browsers work just fine, but Firefox has been a long time favorite, so I'm hesitant to stop using it altogether despite it's current issues. </p><p>I've tried just about everything, including troubleshooting mode - it still crashes - and refreshing it repeatedly. I've also tried uninstalling and reinstalling, doing full scans of my computer multiple times for malware - coming up empty - and doing full computer restarts as well. Nothing I've done has managed to work, and every other suggestion is something I've already tried. I'm even beginning to think it's a problem with my PC itself, even though Firefox is the only thing having this issue. </p><p>This never happened before the most recent update, and my current version is 106.0.2.

Question is, why does it do that? The standard firefox browser doesnt ever behave like that, so why does the dev version? What i dont like here is the fact that a program does things on its own without me interacting with it, firefox is a browser and should only be active when i use it, not on its own. So what are these connections and why are they there? How do you disable the browser acting on its own?
