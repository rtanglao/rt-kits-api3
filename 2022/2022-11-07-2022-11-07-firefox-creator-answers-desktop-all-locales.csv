This is the default on most email systems I've used.  I think it was the default on Firefox until recently. </p><p>Now, when I do a reply, or reply all, the message now starts with the original email, without the email headers. I understand some people may prefer that, but I definitely don't like it.  It can be useful to see who the original email had been sent to, especially if there are errors in that list of people, or the people included are fewer or more than the previous email. </p><p>Note, if I forward the email, the email does contain the email addresses from the original email header. </p><p>This behaviour caused me some real grief when I realised some people had made a mistake when sending me an email recently. </p><p>Is there a setting to adjust this? </p><p>Regards </p><pre>   Mark Dunn </pre>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",markedunn

After the most-recent update, Firefox has been hanging whenever I type, and I'm right in the middle of typing a novel. The CPU usage spikes, according to the Firefox Task Manager, to 300% or MORE just from typing a few words. Even right now, typing this, the screen is sentences behind where I am in my typing. Took an entire minute for the page to catch up. On a single paragraph. </p><p>The hanging/lag does not occur when I navigate between pages, stream videos on Youtube or Netflix, or other things which should be about 100x more resource-intensive than typing a few sentences. And yet, that's all that does it. </p><p>There are no problems with lag when using Chrome, Discord, or other internet-based programs for typing. There are some issues with my word processor, Open Office Writer, but only when Firefox is open and running too, even though the two don't interact, to my knowledge. </p><p>I have followed every step on this page: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-hangs-or-not-responding"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-hangs-or-not-responding</a> This page: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-and-diagnose-firefox-problems"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-and-diagnose-firefox-problems</a> And this page: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-uses-too-much-memory-or-cpu-resources"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-uses-too-much-memory-or-cpu-resources</a> beyond upgrading my computer, because it is absolutely ridiculous to consider doing that given the circumstances. It's only Firefox having the problem, after all. </p><p>In addition, I have reinstalled my keyboard driver, turned off cursor highlighting (it wasn't on, but I enabled it and disabled it again, just in case), and removed any delay in repeat keys in the keyboard config. No difference. </p><p>Honestly, I don't know that there's a community-based solution for this, but I'm willing to be wrong about that. I just want to make certain someone more official than myself is aware of the problem. </p><p>Thanks in advance, -Tyr </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1546397;1546399;,tyrhawk85
