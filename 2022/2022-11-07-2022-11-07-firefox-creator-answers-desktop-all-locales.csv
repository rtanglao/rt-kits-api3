I transferred  the 2 accounts i use the most, my personal and school account. My school uses a different email address to the official department of education email provided by most schools in my area. Now recently, my school has decided to transfer everything to the official email and disable the school made email. I went to the about profiles page and pressed create account. I tried creating a new account and it didn't work. i forget the error message given. I went to my school and they said that it's already made, you just need to sign in. I tried and it gave me an error message saying 'Primary account required for sign in' I know the email and had my password reset to the default an it still isn't working. What can I do? </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1060;firefox-10603;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Dev.Mehta
