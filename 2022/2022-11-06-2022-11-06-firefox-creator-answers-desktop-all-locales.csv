But it would keep crashing until I end it form the task manger but this made it worse. As now I can not even access my old tabs and there are no tabs to restore. I have search up most of the common solutions but none of them work for me. I want to know if there are anymore solutions to get back my old tabs form before the update. Could I go back to the previous window or do I have to stay like this? </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",cooldeath66

It contained 4-5 links which I deleted assuming this would delete the folder and I added a random bookmark to see if that might do anything. No! I have searched for fixes including going into ""About:Config"" chamed tried changing the command (i.e., browser.toolbars.bookmarks.showotherbookmarks, and other similar commands from True to False), none of this did anything. There is no right-click command over the folder, ""Show Bookmarks"" as you can see in the screen shot.  I need to get rid of this, as it is taking up valuable real estate and is an eyesore so to speak. Again, this just popped out of nowhere when I was moving/deleting bookmarks on the toolbar that wouldn't cause this folder to appear out of nowhere.  Thank you in advance.  I do hope someone can help! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1060;,firefox,other,en-US,1546096;,StevenLAX16
