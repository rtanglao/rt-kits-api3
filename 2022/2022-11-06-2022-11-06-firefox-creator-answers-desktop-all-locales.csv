I have removed that extension from the browser and now I have uBlock Origin, however, I wonder if any data was stolen while using it (passwords, personal names, credit card information, etc.). </p><p>My question is, is there any history stored locally, where I could see what permission, I gave to the clone version of uBlock Origin? At this point I don't even know the specific name of that add-on, is it possible to at least get the name? That way I would look up what I was using. </p><p>Also, are there any known scams, where uBlock Origin clone was in the Firefox store and it gathered personal data?

Many blog owners use a fantastic publishing tool called WordPress to manage their blogs easily. If you want to learn how to blog, knowing the fundamentals of WordPress can prove very helpful for <strong><a href=""https://elementsready.com/best-elementor-addons-and-plugins/"" rel=""nofollow"">Royal Elementor Add-ons</a></strong>. </p><p>Be certain you avoid using the same designs as all the people who have WordPress. While using something that others already have up is simple, it doesn't create a great first impression of your site. You want to get off on the right foot with your visitors. </p><p>If your title is long, clean up your post's permalink. Avoid cumbersome URLs like ""The Ten Ways Intelligent Parents Manage Their Children."" Rather, seek out keywords in the long URL and create a shorter permalink for it. </p><p>Video blogging is easy with WordPress. Although you may have to put in a little more time, you will get rewarded for your effort in the end. Internet users are a visual group. Videos can convey things words cannot, so they are very useful. </p><p>Gain as much knowledge as possible before you start installing WordPress. Planning beforehand is going to put you in a much better position. Learn all you can about SEO, good content and using WordPress to your advantage. </p><p>Create a posting schedule. You will be more motivated when you have a schedule. In fact, to save even more time, you can create a week's worth of posts at once, then schedule WordPress to upload them for you automatically. </p><p>Whether you read blogs, write blogs or just like to post on them, WordPress can help you. The more that you know about this program and how to use it, the better off you will be. Each time you log on to your blog, remember what you have learned here. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1546111;,alexander.metcalfe

Agora estou beirando as 6h pra acessar essa merda novamente!  Parece ridiculo! Desde que reativei os cookies pra logar nessa página do Mozilla, tudo piorou no meu notebook. É impressionante como vocês não servem pra NADA, pra ABSOLUTAMENTE NADA!!!! E ai eu entro aqui, com 87% de Memória sendo consumida pelo MOZILLA Computador ao mesmo tempo funcionando tranquilamente E adivinhem? Tudo passa a funcionar quando abre a página de digitar a reclamação. Se isso não é sacanagem, o que é? Tenho que vir aqui TODO DIA pra acessar essa merda? Volto a repetir TODO FUNCIONÁRIO DESSA EMPRESA DEVERIA ENCONTRAR ALGUÉM DISPOSTO A ARRANCAR O SORRISO DELE!! VAI TOMAR NO CU, EMPRESA FILHA DA PUTA!! Todas as atualizações que já fiz nos últimos 5 anos não resultaram em NENHUMA MELHORIA DO NAVEGADOR. Pelo contrário, TUDO PIOROU !!! Já teve dia de fazer mais de 3 atualizações, no mesmo dia, e só piorar!! Falta de respeito TOTAL !!!! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,fix-problems,pt-BR,"",hugocarvalho.cs
