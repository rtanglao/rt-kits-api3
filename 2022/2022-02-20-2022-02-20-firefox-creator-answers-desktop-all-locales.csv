Is my firefox account email used to identify my usage of Firefox?,"<p>About:telemetry shows an ID value in General Data. Is this the basis for firefox calculating the number of active users? Because the ID value is different for my across different versions of Firefox on the same computer.  </p><p>In a reddit thread, someone has made this claim:  </p><p>""    MAUs are industry standard KPIs. Usernames, emails, user ids are tied to guids or uuids for the purpose of ensuring that you track unique users. Anyone who has used software like Segment understands this. </p><pre>   Mozilla needs to know its platform usage. This comes from device identifiers and os data, and is used in tandem with user data to track the statistics of it’s MAUs. Any software firm or website runner will be able to confirm this. </pre> <p>So when you use Mozilla and create a username, they tie that data to the browser and user info they get from you using their platform. Because that’s what you’re doing: using their software."" </p><p>I do not believe this statement could be correct, because it seems contradictory to <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Anti_tracking_policy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Anti_tracking_policy</a> </p><p>I have spent an hour researching Firefox articles on telemetry, privacy policy and I still do not know what is the basis of the active users statistic.
