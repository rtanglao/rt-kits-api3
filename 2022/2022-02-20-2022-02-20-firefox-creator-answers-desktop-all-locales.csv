I've been trying to be very methodical in figuring out whether one of the apps I use is causing the problem  During this time, I have been getting notifications that there is a new version of Firefox available.  I have been pushing the update off until checking on other apps.  This morning, I checked to see what version I was running on, before making a support query.  Imagine my surprise, when I discovered ""Firefox is up to date.""  Because I had been telling it not to update yet.  It doesn't seem likely that I accidentally updated it without noticing, since I have been working with several windows open.  It's hard not to notice the windows closing, and re-opening, and the time lag while the front pages all refresh.  Has Firefox begun forcing updates on Macs, as it has done for Windoze?  I hope not!  It's painstaking enough doing this kind of troubleshooting, without versions of apps changing, unannounced! </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-970;firefox-9701;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",contrawise

How do I get my website subdomain to be included in Firefox's automatic URL color-distinction for domains in the address bar?,"<p>Firefox currently has a URL color formatting scheme which greys-out all parts of the URL in the address bar except for the top-level domain and the 2nd-level domain (with some exceptions). </p><p>I am building a website where my organization-specific domain is NOT located on the 2nd-level domain, but rather on the 3rd-level domain. </p><p>I plan to use the domain ""obb.ll.land"". The ""ll.land"" part is basically a domain that the Liberland Government operates and from which it <a href=""https://market.ll.land/product/get-your-ll-land-domain/"" rel=""nofollow"">sells</a> 3rd-level domains to members of the public. Think of ""ll.land"" as a temporary <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_code_top-level_domain"" rel=""nofollow"">ccTLD</a> for Liberland. (ICANN requires countries to be on the ISO-3166 list—which Liberland is not yet on—in order to register an official Internet ccTLD.) Therefore, any domain that is formatted as ""[SUBDOMAIN].ll.land"" should be presumed to be the foundational domain for a given organization that uses it.  </p><p>Therefore, <strong>when a client sees a Liberlandic website, the domain should have the 3rd-level domain included in the black-text portion of Firefox's URL color formatting scheme</strong>. Otherwise the scheme would be misleading about the true nature of the website involved. For example, the 3rd-level domain of ""https://www.floating.ll.land/"" should be included in the black-text portion. Same with the 3rd-level domain of ""https://register.ll.land/"". However, as of this writing, no "".ll.land"" site has the appropriate URL coloration to my knowledge.  </p><p>How can I solve this problem? Is there something which developers like me should add to our websites individually, or will Mozilla be responsible for handling this matter? </p><p>Thank you all in advance! :) </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,"",obb
