Každou další aktualizací se mi systém buď změní k horšímu, zakáže mi více dříve přístupných stránek kvůli kecům o protokolu (do toho je blbému prohlížeči naprosto hovno, mám antivirus a mám zodpovědnost), zabírá furt více zbytečného místa a procesorového času. Že neumíte programovat optimalizované kódy je jasné už od toho, co učím na vysoké. ALE! Proč nemůžu vypnout aktualizaci, když ji nechci a vím, že povede dál ze svahu?!!! Ano, nastavím a odmítnu. Otravné okno mi za chvíli zase vyběhne na pravé straně obrazovky. Už mi připomínáte Win10 s jeho vlezlostí. Jak to kromě smazání červené pandy vyřešit? Existuje v proměnných třeba EliminateFuckingUpgrade=True??? Moc prosím za help. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-940;,firefox,other,cs,1485098;,wasik
