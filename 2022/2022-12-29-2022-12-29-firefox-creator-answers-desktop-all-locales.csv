When I am in a Facebook container tab and I click a link to a video, a new tab opens and suddenly all the tabs I have open in Facebook start flashing. All I can do is close Firefox. If I open it again, the page is blank and the tabs have stopped flickering. Is there a solution to this problem? I have about a dozen tabs open, roughly half are in Facebook containers. Please help! Thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1556295;1556372;1556412;,75pintail

When trying to access a bookmark or folder on my bookmarks toolbar, nothing happens (color change or tooltip on hover, nor clicking) unless the mouse is at the very bottom edge of the button area, well below where the icon and text are. Is this happening to anyone else? I use the bookmarks toolbar heavily, so this is very annoying. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1556293;,osakawebbie
