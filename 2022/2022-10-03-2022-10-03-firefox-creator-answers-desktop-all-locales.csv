I have to get this to stop or I will no longer be able to click on any PDFs with Firefox anymore. I have also tried setting it to always ask, but if I do that and then tell it to open, then it STILL DOWNLOADS THE FILE! I cannot understand why anyone would ever want files they just wanted to read to just randomly download. I am a genealogy researcher and used to click on dozens of PDFs a day to read, now I can't with Firefox or I won't have internet for half the month after I use up my data. There has to be someway to stop this, I don't like other browsers, but right now, if it involves a PDF I have to use a different browser. (also quite annoying to have to delete multiple files that I never wanted to download - I was using Firefox to pay a bill and downloaded it SIX times) Please help! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,other,en-US,"",wildkat781

I then have to kill the process, which of course means it looses my session so when I re-open it I get nothing, all my open tabs are gone and there is no restore session option. </p><p>Further, it can't even play streaming videos properly anymore. After one or two episodes of a TV show its lagging sometimes by minutes, eaten gigs of ram and the video often gets stuck, the audio helpfully carries on with a frame of video from about 5 minutes ago. This is not an exaggeration, I had a YouTube video where it changed to a graph with a voice over, after 5 minutes I started to notice the voice over was talking about things not on that graph and sure enough the video had frozen. Its an i9 10850K with 32GB of RAM. The previous version of Firefox didn't mind restoring a session with over 350 tabs and plenty were videos, this one can't handle 2 when one is a video without freezing or locking up the whole browser. </p><p>No other apps/ programs on this PC are having any issues, it is only happening in Firefox, I can for example open a media player and play a video just fine while the video is stuck in the browser or it has the graphic glitches. I also tried opening another instance of Firefox while it had the graphical issue, the new instance started and created a new entry on the task bar, but switching to it gave the same display as the broken one, I can't tell you what tabs either had open as nothing inside the window was rendered at all, not even the menu bar which I set to always being visible. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1023;firefox-10230;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",BasilFawlty

Hardware accelerated decoding is enabled on my AMD gpu, but the performance in Firefox is not as good as it should be. I first noticed the issue when trying to play an 8K video. The stuttering and frame drops at 8K make the video unplayable, but I also noticed that it was happening at 4K as well. At 4K, the stuttering is much less severe, and there are no dropped frames, but it can still ruin the experience of watching the video once I notice it stuttering every few seconds. I know this is an issue with Firefox specifically because the same videos play back much better on edge. There are still a few dropped frames in edge, so I think AMD might need to improve their drivers as well, but the videos are playable on edge whereas in Firefox they're not. I have also found that disabling hardware acceleration in Firefox actually results in the videos playing back much smoother. The cpu decoding is working far better than gpu decoding, but my general understanding of computers tells me this should not be the case. </p><p>Please help me figure out why this is happening, and let me know if you need any more information about my system or the issue. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",micromine2004

Previously, when I downloaded something, an alert would automatically pop-up asking me whether I want to save the file or just open it. For those files which I only want to open them once, I would click Open. Then, I would either save the file into another format or copy the content to somewhere else and be done with it. Those 'Opened' file were just temp files which would be deleted automatically after some time. But since the previous update of Firefox, the option to 'open downloaded files as temp files' seems to have been completely gone. I've already manually change the settings for all types of files back to 'Always ask' but the files I 'opened once' are no longer just temp files but permanently saved in the Downloads folder. I personally seldom save things in C drive. Today I occasionally opened the Downloads folder and was astonished to see that all the 'temp files' I opened last month are all saved in there. It's very annoying. Why should I even be wasting my time to clear these temp files manually? The only reason I've been using Firefox over Chrome for these many years is because Chrome always forces me to save all the downloaded files to my local drive and doesn't provide me the option to open them as temp files. If Firefox has become just like Chrome, forcing me to save all unwanted files to my local drive, what's the point for me to continue using Firefox? </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1538245;,rachel_auyeung
