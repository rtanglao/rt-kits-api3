Hardware accelerated decoding is enabled on my AMD gpu, but the performance in Firefox is not as good as it should be. I first noticed the issue when trying to play an 8K video. The stuttering and frame drops at 8K make the video unplayable, but I also noticed that it was happening at 4K as well. At 4K, the stuttering is much less severe, and there are no dropped frames, but it can still ruin the experience of watching the video once I notice it stuttering every few seconds. I know this is an issue with Firefox specifically because the same videos play back much better on edge. There are still a few dropped frames in edge, so I think AMD might need to improve their drivers as well, but the videos are playable on edge whereas in Firefox they're not. I have also found that disabling hardware acceleration in Firefox actually results in the videos playing back much smoother. The cpu decoding is working far better than gpu decoding, but my general understanding of computers tells me this should not be the case. </p><p>Please help me figure out why this is happening, and let me know if you need any more information about my system or the issue. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",micromine2004

1391497,2022-10-02 20:27:31 -0700,2022-10-02 20:41:56 -0700,How to prevent 'opened files' (temporary files) saved in the Downloads folder,"<p>The latest version of Firefox is giving me a nightmare. Previously, when I downloaded something, an alert would automatically pop-up asking me whether I want to save the file or just open it. For those files which I only want to open them once, I would click Open. Then, I would either save the file into another format or copy the content to somewhere else and be done with it. Those 'Opened' file were just temp files which would be deleted automatically after some time. But since the previous update of Firefox, the option to 'open downloaded files as temp files' seems to have been completely gone. I've already manually change the settings for all types of files back to 'Always ask' but the files I 'opened once' are no longer just temp files but permanently saved in the Downloads folder. I personally seldom save things in C drive. Today I occasionally opened the Downloads folder and was astonished to see that all the 'temp files' I opened last month are all saved in there. It's very annoying. Why should I even be wasting my time to clear these temp files manually? The only reason I've been using Firefox over Chrome for these many years is because Chrome always forces me to save all the downloaded files to my local drive and doesn't provide me the option to open them as temp files. If Firefox has become just like Chrome, forcing me to save all unwanted files to my local drive, what's the point for me to continue using Firefox? </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1538245;,rachel_auyeung
