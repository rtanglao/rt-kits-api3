I called their support and the first question they asked is what browser I'm using.  After responding that Firefox was my browser, they told me that everyone who uses Firefox is having problems.   They contend there is nothing on their end causing the problem and that since users of other browsers were not having problems that the only solution they could offer was to switch to Edge or Chrome.  That's ridiculous!  What is causing this problem?

When I go to the menu panel/passwords, the password for the site is different. It is only one character different, but it would not allow for a login. The menu panel password is probably older and perhaps the Lockwise discontinuation is an issue, but there seems to be no relation between the passwords in the login procedure and the menu panel. I cannot find where the login procedure password is stored, but it works. This is confusing, but I cannot find an answer in any of the Firefox password manager papers.

All settings are as described to save history, etc.    After closing Firefox and later restarting, only the window with a single tab is restored.    I've saved the session backup files in another location and manual copied and renamed them into the main profile folder but in each attempt, only the single tab window was restored, which is obviously not what I want.   I know the 100+ tabs are in the file because of the filesize and because I've used <a href=""https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/scrounger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/scrounger.html</a> to scrounge the URLs from the backup file. But the point is that Firefox is NOT extracting the data from this file and restoring the other window, which makes me suspect there is a bug or problem with session restore when more than one window is open at the time of shutdown. </p><p>Thanks for any suggestions.
