Looking at the network debugger, all I get for a status is a Get method and nothing happens...but in the tab It looks like its loading. Sometimes existing tabs will work, sometimes not and sometimes its not always every tab that will or will not work... </p><p>The only fix is to close firefox then kill every firefox process and then things are fine again. Other browsers work, and other systems I remote onto work, therefore its not an an internet or system connectivity issue...its very specific to firefox only. </p><p>Not sure how to troubleshoot this further.  I could wireshark but since the browser doesn't appear to be actually making a call to the network based on the network inspector in the browser, I'm not sure thats going to show much. </p><p>Anyone else have any idea's?  This has been occurring through at least 2 firefox updates and I am pretty sure I saw it happen on my laptop before as well, but I don't use my laptop as much as my desktop... </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mark.hodges

I've saved the session backup files in another location and manual copied and renamed them into the main profile folder but in each attempt, only the single tab window was restored, which is obviously not what I want.   I know the 100+ tabs are in the file because of the filesize and because I've used <a href=""https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/scrounger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/scrounger.html</a> to scrounge the URLs from the backup file.
