First I thought that they define the esr itself as obsolete vs. the normal FF version. However when I checked how websites see my FF version I received FF 52 myself: </p><p><a href=""http://whatsmybrowser.org/b/SSI2N"" rel=""nofollow"">whatsmybrowser.org/b/SSI2N</a> </p><p>When I click on Help / About Firefox I get FF 91.13.0.esr and a green check that it´s uptodate. </p><p>So - is there some leftover old data in FF from updating that makes it pretend to be FF 52? In the shared data below the ""user agent"" seems to do that but I did not use an add-on to change that after I had moved the system from Windows XP SP3 32bit to Windows 10 64 bit. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1534219;,ConjurerDragon

(Please see the descriptions of what I see, later in this question) </p><p>Can someone please advise me on what I am doing incorrectly in trying to restore URLs to my Firefox printouts?
