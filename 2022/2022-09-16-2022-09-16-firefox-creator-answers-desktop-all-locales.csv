I am the sole beneficiary and executor of his estate and provide a copy of the will and death certificate if necessary.  The issue here, is unlike me, I cannot find the Firefox account to sync his passwords to my machine.  I do have access to his machine and could open each web site and copy the information to a spread sheet if necessary - but obviously not a great workaround.  So is there any way to gain access to that password. </p><p>Now for the obvious question - it's just a matter of equipment:  he used a trackball, I prefer my mouse and I am considerably more comfortable with the keyboard on my machine. </p><p>Any help you can offer would be very helpful! </p><p>Best regards!
