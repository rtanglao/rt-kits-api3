They also removed the AVG Anti-Virus and installed McAfee Anti-Virus instead.  When I got the PC home, many of my Firefox settings had been changed, I don't know by what or whom.  And my Greasemonkey and Adblocker extensions had been removed.  I reinstalled those, but now cannot get my two desired scripts for Greasemonkey to download, let alone install.  I also now have a message, ""your browser is being managed by your organization.""  But this is my own PC that I use for both work and personal purposes.  I've tried all the recommended approaches for removing the ""organization"" message, to no avail.  Tech support from McAfee recommended removing and reinstalling Firefox, but I don't know if that is likely to fix the problem, and I would lose all my bookmarks, some of which are important for my work.  I don't know how to save the bookmark links before trying to uninstall/reinstall Firefox.  Need help. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",KayTa

At the next login it would not use the new password. ATT then sent me a secure message key to my phone. This allowed the reset, but then after exiting ATT and Firefox, the next time in the new password would not work, and my ATT account locked up with ""too many tries"".  This took me about eight service calls to find the problem.  It turns out that during a secure password reset, ATT generated a new file in Firefox's password list that had their new password name with a BLANK name for the users email address.  So now Firefox was showing TWO PASSWORD FILES and ATT's login locked up.  I was able to fix it within Firefox by entering my email address in the password file's blank name entry, and deleting the old Firefox entry by hand. Nowhere did either ATT or Firefox detect this condition. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",gpapp46

Some articles say that it will stop syncing, while others seem to say that it will be erased all together. </p><p>Is there any way I can avoid this? Somewhere where I can see the password for my Firefox account anywhere? It automatically logs me in on the website without issue so it has to be stored somewhere.

(Sometimes a site allows access over TLS 1.0 but disables certain features such as submitting credit card numbers.) </p><p>However, I am now getting inconsistent results when trying to do this.  I set security.tls.version.max to 1 and restart the browser.

Note, TLS 1.3.  But I could swear the first time I loaded <a href=""https://www.google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/</a> the same dialog box said the connection was using TLS 1.0. </p><p>Meanwhile other sites like <a href=""https://wikipedia.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wikipedia.org/</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/</a> fail to load with SSL_ERROR_PROTOCOL_VERSION_ALERT.  I understand why (they don't support TLS 1.0), but I don't understand why the connection to Google is showing TLS 1.3 in the same browser window. </p><p>Is there some mechanism by which a site that initially accepts the TLS 1.0 connection, is then forcing Firefox to switch to 1.3, overriding the security.tls.version.max setting?
