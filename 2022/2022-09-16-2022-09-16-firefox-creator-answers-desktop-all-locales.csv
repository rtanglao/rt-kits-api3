(Sometimes a site allows access over TLS 1.0 but disables certain features such as submitting credit card numbers.) </p><p>However, I am now getting inconsistent results when trying to do this.  I set security.tls.version.max to 1 and restart the browser.  Then I go to <a href=""https://www.google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/</a>, click the padlock and navigate to more information, and it says ""Connected encrypted (TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256, 128 bit keys, TLS 1.3)"".  Note, TLS 1.3.  But I could swear the first time I loaded <a href=""https://www.google.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/</a> the same dialog box said the connection was using TLS 1.0. </p><p>Meanwhile other sites like <a href=""https://wikipedia.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wikipedia.org/</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/</a> fail to load with SSL_ERROR_PROTOCOL_VERSION_ALERT.  I understand why (they don't support TLS 1.0), but I don't understand why the connection to Google is showing TLS 1.3 in the same browser window. </p><p>Is there some mechanism by which a site that initially accepts the TLS 1.0 connection, is then forcing Firefox to switch to 1.3, overriding the security.tls.version.max setting?  That doesn't make sense but it's the only thing that seems consistent with observation. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",bennetthaselton
