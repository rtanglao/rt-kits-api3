My computer crashed recently ending my Firefox browsing session along with the 3 windows and likely close to 50 combined tabs I had open. Upon re-opening Firefox I'm pretty sure I clicked ""Restore previous session"" on the page that pops up with that prompt as I normally do expecting all previous windows and tabs to reappear, but for some reason it didn't load as usual and instead reloaded a new window saying that I'm on the latest version of Firefox with 1 additional blank homepage tab instead of my previous 3 windows with multiple tabs. In that new window the ""Restore previous session"" option from the menu bar was greyed out and nothing appeared in the ""Recently closed windows"" or ""Recently closed tabs"" areas. I ended the new window using the End Task feature in Task Manager and have not opened Firefox back up in hope of being able to recover the now 2 (or I guess 3 if the restore re-load is considered a new session) sessions ago windows/tabs. </p><p>I have tried 2 methods to get my previous tabs back: 1) sessionstore-backups subfolder in the Profiles folder - the recovery.jsonlz4/baklz4 are both from the newer blank tab session, the previous.jsonlz4 is from 2 months ago, and the upgrade.jsonlz4 files are also older from 2 months ago so none of those files have the data I'm looking for 2) ShadowExplorer to find an older version of the sessionstore-backups, but this too did not have helpful files from either the recovery/previous/upgrades file types after extracting and seeing only 3 tabs from the older session they logged </p><p>Before reopening Firefox again, is there any other method or attempt I should try to restore the now 2 sessions back 3 windows and their tabs? Any relevant help or advice would be greatly appreciated! </p>",desktop;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",joshmoon

Thus, please, don't hit me if I happen to violate some etiquette or to omitt some important info or so :-). </p><p>As to my issue:  I'm not a social media person, also; thus I only recently discovered that there might be the option, by now, to leave feedback by email -- i.e. per the 'mail-to' link. By then, I had a laptop with MS Windows 10; and I managed to activate MS Windows Mail: If I click on such an email/mailto link now, Windows Mail opens up a window into my gmail account with my sender address and a lot of proper references -- but, unfortunately, the main field: i.e. the email address of the addressee, stays blank, empty (see attached pic). </p><p>I tried 'googeling' the issue, but there seems so many aspect to it (partly how to set-up such a mailto link) that I gave up and turn to you in the Firefox/Mozilla community. Please ask me about anything special you'd need to know about my set-up! I'll be happy to provide this information as good as I can while, as for me, I have not the slightest clue about where the issue could be rooted.
