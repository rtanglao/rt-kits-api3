You can also find those other settings below. </p><p>Anyways, i remember someone from this forum told me there is no ""official documentation"" for the firefox settings which are listed in about:config. Is there an ""inofficial documentation""? If you could reply with the exact setting that i have to change according to the screenshot attached below that would be awesome, otherwise an URL for some sort of documentation would be welcome.. </p><p>Basically all the setting i want to change exists and can be manually edited using the firefox settings, but theoretically could be easily pre-configured with the firefox.cfg. </p><p>All i need are setting-names/ids. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Firefox_Beginner

(i.e. DISABLED)  I slide the toggle to OFF, and in roughly 10 seconds it toggles itself back on.  So, Short of closing the multiple tabs I have open and or clearing my caches and shutting down my browser and restarting it, is there a way to DISABLE extension(s) that WILL NOT remain DISABLED by making some change in the ""INSPECT"" menu or in the ""about:config"" menu?  This is REALLY ANNOYING! </p><p>This has been happening for about two / three years.  I'm just now inquiring for help with this issue.  I'd be surprised there isn't some way to disable browser extensions that WILL NOT remain disabled, using advanced methods, i.e., something a intermediate PC user that can tweak / change. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;needsinfo;firefox-980;firefox-9801;,firefox,other,en-US,1490945;1490947;,ml44012

If the download and save routines are activated then, if the settings are set to 'ask' - it should [profanity] ASK. </p><p><em>Zero tolerance for profanity even if censored.
