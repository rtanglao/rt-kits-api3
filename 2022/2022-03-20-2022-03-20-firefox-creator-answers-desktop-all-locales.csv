(i.e. DISABLED)  I slide the toggle to OFF, and in roughly 10 seconds it toggles itself back on.  So, Short of closing the multiple tabs I have open and or clearing my caches and shutting down my browser and restarting it, is there a way to DISABLE extension(s) that WILL NOT remain DISABLED by making some change in the ""INSPECT"" menu or in the ""about:config"" menu?  This is REALLY ANNOYING! </p><p>This has been happening for about two / three years.  I'm just now inquiring for help with this issue.  I'd be surprised there isn't some way to disable browser extensions that WILL NOT remain disabled, using advanced methods, i.e., something a intermediate PC user that can tweak / change. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;needsinfo;firefox-980;firefox-9801;,firefox,other,en-US,1490945;1490947;,ml44012

If the download and save routines are activated then, if the settings are set to 'ask' - it should f**in' ASK. </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-980;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1490949;1490950;,annoyingfirefox
