Specifically this is happening with sites between different ""iterations"" of itself while still being the same and having fully integrated layouts and UI.  </p><p>For example: Most pages on the site have an update ""<strong>https://www1</strong>"" prefix, but some pages have the old ""<strong>https://</strong>"" only. Firefox keeps opening new tabs when navigating between these different pages despite them being the same website. I know the pages themselves are not sending new tab requests because this doesn't happen in Chrome.  </p><p>So far, my ""solution"" has been to go through <strong>about:config</strong> to adjust the <strong>browser.link.open_newwindow</strong> value to <strong>1</strong> instead of <strong>3</strong>, which forces all links to stay within the same window. This unfortunately causes a whole host of other issues though.  </p><p>Because its an override, it also means any links opened from an external program (like discord) forcibly open in the last active tab, navigating away from the page. This is obnoxious and annoying in and of itself because it means to save the tabs I already have open I need to manually open a new tab in FF before clicking any link, which I never remember to do. (Goodbye post progress (': ) </p><p>If that weren't bad enough, when trying to hit the back button to get to the previous page FF ends up in some sort of weird redirection loop ""between"" pages, where the last page will disappear but FF won't navigate to the link it was trying to open either, so its just a blank infinitely loading page with the URL of the link that was opened. The only way to stop this from happening is to navigate back 2 pages, losing the current page, before it starts the redirect loop. If the loop starts before this happens, the tab locks up and needs to be hard-refreshed with f5 or completely closed due to the weird lag it causes.  </p><p>Literally all I want Firefox to do here is not assume a new tab needs to be opened just because the URL ""seems"" different to it. Is there ANY way to get this behavior? </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",sixsevensheep

In that new window the ""Restore previous session"" option from the menu bar was greyed out and nothing appeared in the ""Recently closed windows"" or ""Recently closed tabs"" areas.

Those settings are pre-configured with the firefox.cfg file. I would like to also pre-configure a list of other settings. You can also find those other settings below. </p><p>Anyways, i remember someone from this forum told me there is no ""official documentation"" for the firefox settings which are listed in about:config. Is there an ""inofficial documentation""? If you could reply with the exact setting that i have to change according to the screenshot attached below that would be awesome, otherwise an URL for some sort of documentation would be welcome.. </p><p>Basically all the setting i want to change exists and can be manually edited using the firefox settings, but theoretically could be easily pre-configured with the firefox.cfg. </p><p>All i need are setting-names/ids. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1490969;1491030;1491097;,Firefox_Beginner

(i.e. DISABLED)  I slide the toggle to OFF, and in roughly 10 seconds it toggles itself back on.  So, Short of closing the multiple tabs I have open and or clearing my caches and shutting down my browser and restarting it, is there a way to DISABLE extension(s) that WILL NOT remain DISABLED by making some change in the ""INSPECT"" menu or in the ""about:config"" menu?  This is REALLY ANNOYING! </p><p>This has been happening for about two / three years.  I'm just now inquiring for help with this issue.  I'd be surprised there isn't some way to disable browser extensions that WILL NOT remain disabled, using advanced methods, i.e., something a intermediate PC user that can tweak / change. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;needsinfo;firefox-980;firefox-9801;,firefox,other,en-US,1490945;1490947;,ml44012

If the download and save routines are activated then, if the settings are set to 'ask' - it should [profanity] ASK. </p><p><em>Zero tolerance for profanity even if censored.
