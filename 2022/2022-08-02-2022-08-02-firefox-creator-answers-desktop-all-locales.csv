Fino a qualche giorno fa, quando premevo su un link che porta a un PDF, veniva aperto con il lettore di Firefox senza essere scaricato. Da qualche giorno invece il PDF viene scaricato nella cartella di download e successivamente aperto con Firefox. Infatti nella barra di indirizzo non c'è il link, ma la directory del file sul mio pc.  Non so se sia un problema di un nuovo aggiornamento oppure io abbia inavvertitamente cambiato un'impostazione, in ogni caso vorrei risolvere perchè è fastidioso ritrovarsi pieni di file scaricati nella cartella download.
