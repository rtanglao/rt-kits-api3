Simplesmente não funciona, você abre, ele trava, não aceita nenhum clique, não aceita nenhum comando, nada. Estou utilizando o Google Chrome com a página do suporte do Mozilla salva para conseguir relatar esta merda! Não é possível que toda atualização seja para piorar o desempenho do próprio navegador, é um tiro no pé, porra!!!! A falta de noção é absurda, eu não consigo utilizar o Mozilla para MERDA NENHUMA e agora ele resolve PARAR DE FUNCIONAR APÓS UMA ATUALIZAÇÃO.  Vejam bem, vocês foram de atualizações que pioravam o rendimento do navegador até chegar num navegador que gasta mais de 80% da memória do meu computador e agora resolveram simplesmente NÃO FUNCIONAR EM NADA APÓS UMA ATUALIZAÇÃO.  Ou seja, começaram piorando, resolveram piorar, pioraram, tiveram sucesso total na piora e agora simplesmente NÃO FUNCIONA NADA! NENHUM CLIQUE NO NAVEGADOR FUNCIONA. Sem salvar cookies, sem histórico, sem nada, como sempre! Sem extensões, sem downloads, sem nada. O fato de ATUALIZAR O NAVEGADOR MOZILLA e tentar utilizá-lo é o motivo central dele não funcionar.  Como qualquer outro navegador, como o Google Chrome de onde escrevo esta reclamação, funciona a milhão, consumindo menos de 20% de memória e vocês além de consumirem mais de 80% pra não abrirem SE QUER UM SITE, agora resolveram APÓS MAIS UMA ATUALIZAÇÃO QUE NÃO SERVIU DE PORCARIA NENHUMA PRA NADA, não funcionar absolutamente em NADA, NENHUM CLIQUE!!! Eu tenho um ódio TOTALMENTE MORTAL A RESPEITO DE CADA DESENVOLVEDOR, PROGRAMADOR, EMPRESÁRIO, PUBLICITÁRIO E COMUNICADOR envolvido com este navegador MOZILLA!

E QUE A MORTE NÃO SEJA O PIOR, VOCÊS TEM QUE SOFRER O MÁXIMO NECESSÁRIO PARA SE FODEREM O RESTO DA VIDA, CAMBADA DE FILHO DA PUTA!!! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,pt-BR,"",hugocarvalho.cs
