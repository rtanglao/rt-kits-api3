Once in a great while I'll fiddle with it trying again and again and it opens. In order to keep using it I have to clear the start up cache before shutting it down. This last time I came to you via Safari. Had to reset my password and the email link you sent opened Firefox when it wouldn't open before. Odd. Before I force-quit to try again it shows/reads Firefox not responding and I force quit. And yes, I always keep up with the updates. I started using Mozilla products on my first Mac back in 2000. I am a dyed in the wool Lizard fan but ... I have downloaded a fresh copy of Firefox using Safari. I don't want to have to use it again.

Mozilla support pages load fine, I'm sending this post through the affected Firefox. But every other page I try to load hangs endlessly. Youtube, FB, DuckDuckGo, reddit, just standalone images, literally nothing else seems to load. </p><p>I'd installed a mod loader for a game earlier that gave BitDefender a conniption fit I guess because of the way the loader injected code, and BD insisted on doing a ""malware clean"" on reboot after I told it not to. I suspect BD must have deleted something or changed permissions, but I can't find anything in its app that would undo or provide exceptions etc. </p><p>Is there any way to refresh/troubleshoot without having do a full reinstall? (or else an easier way to do a reinstall that's less of a hassle?) I've already rebooted my PC, restarted Firefox a couple times, emptied the cache and cookies, and tried to connect with no proxy, none so far have worked. </p><p>(Windows 10, Firefox v 103.0.2) </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1527980;,midas_touch

Even on a brand new laptop I bought I tried to load Metro site through Desktop Firefox and it always comes back with this issue. I've tried disabling everything that is recommended on the forum, but nothing helps, but as I stated, ""Brand New Laptop."" Which has a clean install of Windows with a clean install of Firefox in Incognito, no sign in, no extension, and still this is the only site that refuses to load for me. I've tried friends and family members Desktop to Laptops as well and same error. </p><p>So either Mozilla Firefox has an issue on all Desktops or I am seriously mission something. If it was a software conflict or something a clean Windows install shouldn't have this issue, but it does. I'm putting this out there to Mozilla to look into as to find out if it's an issue on my side, their side, or Metro PCS's side. Funny enough it works fine on the Mozilla Firefox App. I can run the app through Bluestacks and that loads fine on my desktop through an android emulator. It just seems to be Firefox on the Desktop side.   </p><p>If I click on the little (i) Icon in the address bar it says, ""Connection Failure."" Clicking on that, ""You are not securely connected to this site."" If I clear the cookies I get a secure connection, but the just loads blank, no text or anything. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1527965;1527979;1527982;1527985;1527992;,wristan
