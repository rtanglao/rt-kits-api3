Luckily I am one of these persons that ignores advice to regularly change a password and have managed to restore most of these from memory. However, that still leaves a gmail account and reddit that I cannot log into, nor have the passwords written down. </p><p>Nothing else has been affected. Bookmarks, recent history are all there. I was even able to do a Session Restore on the pages I had open. All that is missing is about four years of saved passwords. Even the predictive text that pops the user name into the prompt for a login has gone. </p><p>Is there any way that all the passwords that should be there can be restored? Are they sitting somewhere on the computer? I don't mind manually restoring them if need be but I would like to get into these accounts. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Lover_of_Goats
