Vou tentar resumir. </p><p>Por vezes, a configuração típica de uma determinada página contém a visualização do arquivo .pdf em si mesma (embutida). Como se fosse uma configuração nativa. São os casos, a título de exemplo, dos sistemas e sites do Poder Judiciário, como o PJe, e os sites do STF e do STJ. </p><p>A partir da atualização para a versão 98, a abertura do arquivo na própria página (embutida) só funciona se a configuração do aplicativo no navegador estiver em ""Abrir no Firefox"". Antes da atualização, mesmo se a sua configuração fosse ""Sempre Perguntar"", aquelas páginas que continham a visualização do .pdf em si mesmas funcionavam perfeitamente, ou seja, abriam automaticamente sem perguntar, era uma configuração nativa. </p><p>Só que essa preferência do aplicativo (Abrir no Firefox), a partir da atualização, trouxe problemas com o uso de abas. Se estou navegando em uma página e que consta um link para um pdf, ao clicar nele o arquivo é aberto na própria aba e não em uma nova. É o caso, por exemplo, do Whatsapp web, que já vi vários relatos aqui no site. Antes, ao clicar em um arquivo .pdf encaminhado em uma conversa, ele era aberto em outra aba, o que facilitava o uso. Da forma como está configurado hoje, ao abrir o .pdf, evidentemente, a página do WhatsApp web é substituída pelo .pdf e gera dificuldade no uso. </p><p>A saída que encontrei para esse segundo problema é usar a preferência do aplicativo como ""Sempre Perguntar"", só que ela não soluciona o primeiro, visto que as páginas com visualização nativa do .pdf passaram então a não exibi-los automaticamente, o que também gera dificuldade de uso. E cito um exemplo prático, especificamente com páginas do PJe: ao olhar um processo judicial, os arquivos em .pdf que eram para abrir automaticamente embutidos na própria página, agora são baixados um a um e abertos individualmente (seja em novas abas ou no programa padrão do Windows), ou seja, o que era para facilitar, acabou atrapalhando. </p><p>Então aqui, aparentemente, eu tenho três opções: </p><p>1 - quando for navegar em páginas com visualização do .pdf nativa (embutida), mudo a configuração do aplicativo de ""Sempre Perguntar"" para ""Abrir no Firefox"" e depois de usar reverto a configuração; </p><p>2 - uso outro navegador para abrir páginas com visualização do .pdf nativa (embutida); </p><p>3 - substituo o navegador integralmente. </p><p>Portanto, tendo em vista que as mudanças aparentemente trouxeram mais dificuldades do que facilidades, gostaria de sugerir, então, que a forma de visualização de arquivos .pdf nas versões anteriores à 98 fosse restabelecida. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,customize,pt-BR,"",jlsimon2

Luckily I am one of these persons that ignores advice to regularly change a password and have managed to restore most of these from memory. However, that still leaves a gmail account and reddit that I cannot log into, nor have the passwords written down. </p><p>Nothing else has been affected. Bookmarks, recent history are all there. I was even able to do a Session Restore on the pages I had open. All that is missing is about four years of saved passwords. Even the predictive text that pops the user name into the prompt for a login has gone. </p><p>Is there any way that all the passwords that should be there can be restored? Are they sitting somewhere on the computer? I don't mind manually restoring them if need be but I would like to get into these accounts. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1499258;,Lover_of_Goats
