After about 30 minutes the sidebar hides itself and the Tree Style Tabs item disappears from the View &gt; Sidebar menu. I have to restart Firefox to re-enable the Tree Style Tabs via the menu. </p><p>Issue 2: I have 'Open previous session and tabs' enabled in Preferences, and usually this feature works well. However, once the previous issue occurs (my Tree Style Tabs disappears) and I restart Firefox, it always reverts to the same tabs that I had open on the date of migration several weeks ago. </p><p>I am on MacOs 12.0.1 and FireFox and extensions are all up-to-date </p><p>Can anyone offer any suggestions as to why these might be occurring? </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-960;,firefox,other,en-US,"",firefox300

No bookmarks, History, or add ons, everything is gone!  How do we get everything back?   I have a recent backup using Acronis on an external drive and even copies of old profiles from 2016.  If the data can't be retrieved I'm thinking the only option is to remove Firefox and attempt restoring it from the Acronis backup.     Sincerely, Robert. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-960;firefox-9603;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1479103;,ddbob

So out of frustration, I uninstalled firefox all together.  I then went to the mozilla site (on Edge) and downloaded the app.  It completed the installation but when the browser opens it doesn't do anything.  I can't move around or open any sites.  It's just frozen on New Tab and nothing works.  I can't even sign in - I can click on the sign in button but it doesn't do anything. </p><p>When I tried downloading the app from chrome, I got the attached text box and the same general result.  Firefox opened but didn't work. </p><p>I've spent hours today trying to just get the regular browser working (forget about the VPN) and I'm frustrated.  I have yet to find a way to call a support desk who can help me in ""real time"".   </p><p>Thank you to anyone who can solve this for me and get me back to working in Firefox again (and able to print).
