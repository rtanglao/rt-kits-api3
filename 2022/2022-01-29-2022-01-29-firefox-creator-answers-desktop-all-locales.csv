My bookmarks have subfolders, for example specific events within an Events folder, etc. When attempting to save a new bookmark though, I can only see the main Events folder, but I cannot see/have the option to save directly into the subfolders, ie one specific event. (I can see the subfolders if I attempt to create a new folder, but am then left with a New folder in every folder that I will ever try to save things to; this is not a practical solution. This also shows that the subfolders were imported correctly and are actually saved somewhere). I have tried to read online what the resolution is for this and am getting the impression there is none. Like others who have asked similar questions, I have a well-organized filing system that I put a lot of time into, and that saves me time when I am looking for something. If there is no workaround I will unfortunately have to move everything to Chrome or Edge as it removes the other benefits of why I would like to support Firefox. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1479220;,julia2021+firefox

After about 30 minutes the sidebar hides itself and the Tree Style Tabs item disappears from the View &gt; Sidebar menu. I have to restart Firefox to re-enable the Tree Style Tabs via the menu. </p><p>Issue 2: I have 'Open previous session and tabs' enabled in Preferences, and usually this feature works well. However, once the previous issue occurs (my Tree Style Tabs disappears) and I restart Firefox, it always reverts to the same tabs that I had open on the date of migration several weeks ago. </p><p>I am on MacOs 12.0.1 and FireFox and extensions are all up-to-date </p><p>Can anyone offer any suggestions as to why these might be occurring? </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-960;,firefox,other,en-US,1479123;1479128;1479134;,firefox300

No bookmarks, History, or add ons, everything is gone!  How do we get everything back?   I have a recent backup using Acronis on an external drive and even copies of old profiles from 2016.  If the data can't be retrieved I'm thinking the only option is to remove Firefox and attempt restoring it from the Acronis backup.

So out of frustration, I uninstalled firefox all together.  I then went to the mozilla site (on Edge) and downloaded the app.  It completed the installation but when the browser opens it doesn't do anything.  I can't move around or open any sites.  It's just frozen on New Tab and nothing works.  I can't even sign in - I can click on the sign in button but it doesn't do anything. </p><p>When I tried downloading the app from chrome, I got the attached text box and the same general result.  Firefox opened but didn't work. </p><p>I've spent hours today trying to just get the regular browser working (forget about the VPN) and I'm frustrated.  I have yet to find a way to call a support desk who can help me in ""real time"".   </p><p>Thank you to anyone who can solve this for me and get me back to working in Firefox again (and able to print).
