So out of frustration, I uninstalled firefox all together.  I then went to the mozilla site (on Edge) and downloaded the app.  It completed the installation but when the browser opens it doesn't do anything.  I can't move around or open any sites.  It's just frozen on New Tab and nothing works.  I can't even sign in - I can click on the sign in button but it doesn't do anything. </p><p>When I tried downloading the app from chrome, I got the attached text box and the same general result.  Firefox opened but didn't work. </p><p>I've spent hours today trying to just get the regular browser working (forget about the VPN) and I'm frustrated.  I have yet to find a way to call a support desk who can help me in ""real time"".   </p><p>Thank you to anyone who can solve this for me and get me back to working in Firefox again (and able to print).
