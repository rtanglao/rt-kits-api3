However, several weeks ago Firefox started blocking the download of my morning newspaper. Now I have to copy the link from my morning newspaper email and paste it into Chrome to get access to my newspaper rather than simply clicking the link in the email. While I found this very annoying, when I couldn't find a workaround, I just continued to copy/paste into Chrome. Today I tried to download my IRA quarterly statement and found Firefox is blocking this pdf download also. Note that in neither case does Firefox tell me that they are blocking the downloads and they just do not download and some pdfs do download. So this is now getting beyond just annoying. Is there a workaround for this new Firefox problem or is my only alternative to define Chrome or Edge as my default browser and give up Firefox? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,other,en-US,1514090;,rick146

Hopefully it was sent but I haven’t heard a response yet so I’m assuming the message went into lala-land. Are you saying that your previous session isn't restored [Yes, none of the tabs were restored.  Also, under the history tab, the “recently closed tabs” were grayed out so that menu command was useless.] or are you looking for the menu command to restore the previous session? Also, every time I reboot FF or my Computer, none of the previous tabs are restored. If the former, are you exiting before restarting your computer or shutting down? You should do that and you should use the exit command (either in the menu or the keyboard shortcut). I suggest you also allow enough time for the process to finish before restarting the computer or shutting down.  Can you help me with this?

(see screenshot) When I use the phone to enter Accept and my Authenticator PIN, then the browser extension is logged on as I would expect. </p><p>If I leave Firefox open and log out of my LP account then click the browser LP icon to log back in, I get the Use Authenticator button.  When I select it, the Authenticator app on the phone pops up and log in is smooth, as I would expect. </p><p>However, when I click on the LP icon on the Firefox browser, I get (another) notice that I can activate Passwordless (see screenshot).  When I accept that, I have to provide my master password again.  Even though I have turned on the Passwordless feature several times, If I close Firefox and re-open it, and then click on the LP icon, it does not invoke the Authenticator.  Instead, I have to repeat everything.  It seems like closing Firefox does something to delete the Authenticator option saved in LP/Firefox. </p><p>In both Chrome and Edge, I have settings to delete browser history when they are closed.  This does not seem to affect the Authenticator behavior. However, I have set the same settings in Firefox to delete browser history on close, but the Authenticator behavior is not as expected. </p><p>What setting in LP or Firefox can be used to have the Authenticator setting survive the browser being closed? Also, how do I avoid having to go through the Permissions prompt every time I launch Firefox and try to open the LP extension? </p><p>Thanks, Dave Hejde (970) 219-8843 </p><p><br> Hmmmm.
