Completely done, .part was gone but would not finish. I could not pause it either. Left in the downloads as ""unknown time left"". Downloading it again finished with no problem but was left with a file I could not delete. I tried downloading a couple other things and they too got stuck. I used an addon download manager that removed them from Firefox's download progress but could not delete them. I tried using cmd to delete them and had no luck being able to delete them that way. So I am stuck with 1 at ""unknown time"", 1 file at .98 gb, 2 files with 0 bytes and 3 .part that I cannot remove. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",rodneymullencmc

It keeps showing several entries I made in the past every time I log in. How do I get rid of these entries? I searched the subject and all the suggestions of deleting it in the dropdown box with SHIFT+DELETE or CTRL+DELETE don't work. </p><p>I also use Vivaldi browser and I have the same issue when logging in to webmail. The list of usernames is different from Firefox so I know the lists are tied to the particular browser. I was able to delete the entire list with Vivaldi and I logged in to webmail and auto-fill list is gone. Can't do the same in Firefox.
