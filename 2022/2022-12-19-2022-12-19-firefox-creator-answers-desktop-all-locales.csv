And I have contributed what I could periodically to support such a useful App. Dragging and dropping Tabs into bookmark folders in a ""Library"" window and rearranging the order of bookmarks in and between folders in the ""Library"" window, also by dragging and dropping, were one of Firefox's most useful features. UP UNTIL VERSION 108.  What have you done to the library??!!  I have a research library of over 4MB of links in the library which took over a decade to accumulate and organize.  With this version (108.0.1) NO LINKS CAN BE ADDED, REMOVED OR REORGANIZED BY DRAGGING &amp; DROPPING.  If someone at Mozilla thinks this is a good idea, then I'll have to abandon Firefox permanently.  THIS IS NO LONGER A USABLE BROWSER WITHOUT A FUNCTIONING LIBRARY. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",edmooresjs
