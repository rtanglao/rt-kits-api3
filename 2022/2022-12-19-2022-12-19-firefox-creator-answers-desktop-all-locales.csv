I have looked to support documents for what the process is to log in and the instructions make no sense... it basically says that data will be lost no matter what you do ... and it is so. I would like to see a demo on youtube as what mozzilla was trying to accomplish ... its not like any login I have ever come across. Its really bizzar. After 2 days I was able to only get 2 of three devices configured ... it brakes really easy. If I get one device synced,  the other sync with good device breaks. </p><p>Its too broken to grab images.
