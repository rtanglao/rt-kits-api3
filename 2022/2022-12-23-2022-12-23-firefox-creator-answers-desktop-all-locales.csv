But I wasn't trying to access my account so I clicked on the link that said 'what to do if you didn't request this.' However that link took me to the Disney+ general help page. I searched their help section but couldn't find anything relevant. So I assumed everything was ok and went back to work.  </p><p>Later I noticed that all of our Disney+ profiles had been removed and replaced by new ones. I immediately changed the password to my Disney+ account and to my email account. I deleted the profiles created by the hacker and created new ones. I logged out all devices from Disney+. Thought I was good at this point.  </p><p>Days later I noticed that someone had created another new Disney+ profile which suggests that someone still has access to my account. How could that be? I've tried communicating with Disney+ support staff. This was not helpful. They just say to change the password again. But that didn't solve the problem.  </p><p>I was about to try contacting Disney+ support again so I went to fill out the information to start the chat session. I noticed 1 bogus email saved in the autofill of the email address field. This would seem to imply that someone has access to my computer and has been chatting directly with Disney+. I downloaded Virus Barrier virus scan but it didn't find anything. Then I went back to the Disney+ chat screen and there were already 2 more bogus emails saved in the autofill. So... is someone using even more email addresses to communicate with Disney+ in the 15 minutes since I detected this?  </p><p>I went back to the Disney+ email I received and realized that the link I clicked on was suspicious. So I'm suspecting that it did something, then redirected to Disney+ support so I wouldn't suspect anything. Now I'm concerned that someone may have gained access to my computer. But I have no idea how to determine that. I've been on with Apple support for over an hour and they keep insisting that its not possible. And b/c the problem appeared in Firefox that they can't help me.  </p><p>Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated.
