I have to quit Firefox and restart and then it will play. If i happen to pause it (say for dinner) and come back an hour later, I have to once again Quit and restart even though not even used my laptop (Macbook Air version 10.15.7) Very frustrating, especially if other tabs open. Please advise. I have done the most recent Firefox update. Thank you </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1555351;,LYDESIGNS

I am experiencing for a while now random crashing while watching videos. The playback crashing is random, so I could be watching 5 videos one after another with no crashing and then one video will cause it to crash. The video causing is site agnostic, so it could crash from any site, not just YouTube. I saw in bugzilla something that I thought was related to the crashing (<a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1779558"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1779558</a>) but it got resolved and it still keeps happening to me. </p><p>It's getting tiresome, please.
