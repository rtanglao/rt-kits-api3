For instance, if I start typing ""www.itau"", firefox doesn't fill with a known webpage (<a href=""http://www.itau.cl"" rel=""nofollow"">www.itau.cl</a>). This behaviour is different for, say, typing ""<a href=""http://www.sa"" rel=""nofollow"">www.sa</a>"", in wich case firefox fills the missing letters to (<a href=""http://www.santander.cl"" rel=""nofollow"">www.santander.cl</a>). </p><p>I've tryed to delete the suggestion ""www.itau"" from the address bar with shift + delete,  but this isn't a webpage suggestion, so it does nothing. </p><p>I'm leaving two screenshots to show. </p><p>Sorry for any spelling error, english ain't my main language. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,other,en-US,"",faeterov
