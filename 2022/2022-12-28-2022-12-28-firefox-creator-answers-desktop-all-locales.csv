I get the standard where typing a letter or two of a page I go to all the time makes that the first suggestion: If I type r, I get Raw Story, for instance; s takes me to Slate and c takes me to CNN. I also go to Wonkette and Daily Kos all the time, but when I type w, Firefox gives me <a href=""http://www.rawstory.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.rawstory.com</a> instead of <a href=""http://wonkette.com"" rel=""nofollow"">wonkette.com</a>, and when I type d, I get <a href=""http://duckduckgo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">duckduckgo.com</a>. These are the only two that are giving me fits of the several pages I visit often. How can I make this stop? I've literally never typed in <a href=""http://www.rawstory.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.rawstory.com</a>; it's making me crazy that Firefox is forcing its suggestions on me even though they don't match my clearly established reality. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,other,en-US,"",nandibrown
