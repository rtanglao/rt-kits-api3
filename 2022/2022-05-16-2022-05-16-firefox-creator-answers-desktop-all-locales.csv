The web proxy is a ""squid"" web proxy with enabled user authentication. </p><p>With Firefox 91 (I have not determined since which version exactly the behavior was changed, we ""jumped"" from Firefox 78 to 91) the web proxy asks for the login credentials and the authentication itself is working, but Firefox 78 would prompt the question, whether the user wants to store the credentials. This prompt will not be shown in Firefox 91. Additionally I have tested Firefox 98 and 101, there the prompt will be shown and the credentials will be stored (I can look the credentials up in the Firefox Password Manager), but they will not be ""auto-filled"" when accessing the web proxy again, after closing the Firefox. </p><p>My questions regarding this issue: Does someone know patch notes, where this behavior is mentioned? Does someone know, if this is on any ""Mozilla Buglist/Featurelist""? -&gt; before the hint will be given ""use the search"" -&gt; Does someone know, what the underlying mechanism is, so that I am able to look it up? </p><p>Thanks, I appreciate any hint or suggestion (like raising it as bug/feature or possible workarounds). </p><p>BR </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",jjkt

I'm Using Firefox version 100.0 now and I have discoverd a problem with version 100.0 . From Firefox version 99.01 and downwards, this problem never existed before. The refresh button in Firefox 100.0 ( Ctrl+R ) no longer works good anymore! Sometimes it works good, the other time it's not working correct anymore, you will not see the latest uploaded webpage on the internet. The only solution to this problem is bij closing Firefox and restarting it. Only then you will see the latest uploaded webpage on the internet. Please have a serious look at this annoying problem in version 100.0. This problem can only be discoverd by people who are uploading new webpages to the internet, not bij the regular internet-users/visitors. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1000;,firefox,other,en-US,"",webmaster101
