For one reason or another Google services (Gmail, search, etc) do not seem to always work.  They have moments where they will search or load emails, but most of the time they spin, give an error in gmail, or just won't try searching at all (hit search and just dead and blank screen).   </p><p>[Oops... the system encountered a problem (#001) - Retrying..] - one of the errors commonly seen in gmail. </p><p>All I run is Ublock Origin, Keepa (amazon price tracking) and LastPass.   </p><p>I've tried a total uninstall using Reva Uninstaller so it deletes remaining files.  Chrome does work just fine, so it doesn't seem to be any sort of firewall or anything blocking it.  I've tried going into about:serviceworkers as I saw there was an old bug having to clear out google services in there.  It does maybe help at first, but they come back and it doesn't always fix it anyway.   </p><p>Is there anything else I'm missing? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",scottwreist

I'm experimenting with the Window Titler add-on.,"<p>The instructions for the Window Titler icon suggest to turn on the Title Bar (with the Firefox icon, usually shows title of active tab, but would presumably show the Window Title if one was assigned).  I can't find how to turn it on in version 99.0.1.  It's not where the instructions for Window Titler said to look (managing the Menu bar or the Bookmarks bar).  Any suggestions? </p><p>Would love for this feature (named windows) to become a normal part of Firefox.  I wouldn't mind having the Title Bar anyway; at the cost of a few pixels, I would have something to grab onto when moving windows around that wouldn't accidentally do something to a tab. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,customize,en-US,1502138;,lake44me

This does not occur when viewing Outlook emails on Chrome or Edge.  I thought it might be because of my adblocker (Ublock Origin) so I turned it off, but the black rectangle still covers part of my messages (and I have Ublock on Chrome, too, with no problem viewing Outlook). </p><p>The rectangle covers only a portion of the messages.  When I scroll the message, the black rectangle remains stationary and the message scrolls behind it, thus revealing the portion previously covered by the black rectangle (a different portion of the message becomes covered). </p><p>I tried to take a screenshot to show the black rectangle covering part of the message.  Amazingly, even though the black rectangle is there when I take the screenshot, the screenshot itself does not display the black rectangle....instead the message appears in the screenshot without being partially covered by the black rectangle. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",reiter2000
