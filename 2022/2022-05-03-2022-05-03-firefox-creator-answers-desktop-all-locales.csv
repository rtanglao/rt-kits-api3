What I discovered is that when I'm on a webpage and right-click and click on ""select all"" to copy all of the text, the text does not get copied. I have found this on websites and especially in blogger. I'm wondering if there's some setting I'm not aware of, or if Mozilla just completely did away with that ability. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-9901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1502071;1502076;,soofeenee2

Is this intended behavior? There's the globe icon for bookmarks without favicons, couldn't that be used if a website doesn't have one? I think that would contribute to some visual consistency :)  </p><p>I have looked across various support forums for information on this, I only see posts regarding favicons and bookmarks, not the tab itself, so apologies if this has been asked and answered already! </p>",desktop;tabs;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1502064;,pcannon424

We cleared cache/cookies, uninstalled/reinstalled, and updated both Dell and Windows. The error message states ""reconnecting in 10s"" but never reconnects. At first glance, it appears the users are having network issues. However, Gmail in Chrome doesn't present this issue. Please advise. Thank you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-990;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",penwhitehatethicalhacker

This has gone on for weeks. I've had no problem with any other website. </p>",desktop;websites;mac-os-x-1011;firefox-7815;firefox-78150;,firefox,websites,en-US,1502068;,cd.kje
