I have Windows accounts on my computer, 3 users and an admin.  2 users and the Admin can run FF, but the 1 user account cannot.  I have tried some of the troubleshooting steps to create a new profile and have uninstalled the whole mozilla app.  I really like the browser and am not having any luck getting FF to work on the one account. I have since uninstalled Avast and have UN and Re installed FF along with trying to create a new profile for my afflicted user account.  No luck.  When I click the FF app to start it, I get a white flash box, but too quick to read.  Also, When I perform a run search for firefox.exe, Windows cannot find it, even though it is on my pc.  Please help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",guentzelnd
