I have two PC,s, a main desktop PC and a laptop, which I don't use often and where the Firefox has an outdated bookmarks on it.  Now somehow my PC removed my actual bookmarks and replace it with the one old one from my laptop, (which I just used for the last two days). This is a huge problem! You need to offer a setting where you set a main PC and the other one to sync upon the main PC settings and not opposite!  All my important and up to date bookmarks are now gone! and I am stuck with years old bookmarks on the main PC! Is there maybe a way to restore the bookmarks on the main PC and why does Firefox even overwrite new with old in the first place!?? </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",taisanica

In this initial state I can select with my mouse content. However, I cannot input or modify existing content. Right click &gt; Select All has not effect. Copy does not work. I checked using document.elementsFromPoint() and is the top most element. I checked and in javascript it reports that it does not have readonly or disabled attribute. Trying to use the developer tools does not help because as soon as I activate that window, the control starts behaving as expected. This Windows 11, Firefox 96.0.3 (64-bit). Could you please tell me how can I investigate this any further? </p><p>Thank you, Bogdan </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-960;firefox-9603;,firefox,other,en-US,"",bogdan_mabo

Think I have that remedied, now.  However, I am tired of it telling me that Facebook is slowing down the server...   If I go to upload images to my facebook, or even tonight it was just trying to go to marketplace; it shot me the little message that it was slowing down the process..  Ridiculous.  Maybe they should have made the system more user friendly, than unfriendly </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,websites,en-US,1480440;,arthammond2020

I have Windows accounts on my computer, 3 users and an admin.  2 users and the Admin can run FF, but the 1 user account cannot.  I have tried some of the troubleshooting steps to create a new profile and have uninstalled the whole mozilla app.  I really like the browser and am not having any luck getting FF to work on the one account. I have since uninstalled Avast and have UN and Re installed FF along with trying to create a new profile for my afflicted user account.  No luck.  When I click the FF app to start it, I get a white flash box, but too quick to read.  Also, When I perform a run search for firefox.exe, Windows cannot find it, even though it is on my pc.  Please help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1480420;,guentzelnd
