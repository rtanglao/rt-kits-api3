We are not seeing the control in our Firefox settings any more.  This has become quite important these days since websites like DAA will illustrate the importance of having control over our Third Party cookies. Instead, Firefox has obfuscated the issue behind a shroud of competing procedures and discussion on a blog that is not helping.   Meanwhile, we can't even find Third Party Cookies on our standard menu anymore.  People NEED to control Third Party Cookies easily and quickly and with the least amount of time spent as possible because we are busy.   Thank you in advance for respecting that, Firefox.    It is your responsibility, not ours, to make your settings menu serviceable.   I do not want to be led into nightmarish web trails looking for something that is normally a part of the software that we use.   Firefox needs to put Third Party Cookies back on the main menu of the browser settings and stop wasting our time. Thank you. </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,cookies,en-US,1480628;,distance8

And if I kill the &lt;explorer.exe&gt; process, and then run ""Frefox.exe"" <strong>-without changing its name-</strong>, it will also function properly. </p><p>Before yesterday, I bought a new computer, installed Firefox, and it was working smoothly. However, today, I installed Office 2021 Pro Plus, logged into my Microsoft account <strong>from Word</strong> and &lt;Firefox.exe&gt; process is being terminated upon lunching it again. </p><p>I formatted the system, made a restore point, downloaded another version of office (2019 Pro Plus), logged into my Microsoft account, and the same has happened again. I tried different scenarios; the result is always the same. </p> <ul><li> Same problem is happening with Chrome.

It's extremely convenient and useful, lots of people need this. I've been using Firefox for more than 10 years and I hate your stupid ""Firefox Home"" page (sorry) on desktop and Android with icons that add automatically and I can't change and locate. It's inconvenient and completely useless. It would be great if you create something like Opera 12.17 or 12.18 had. In addition, please remove the ""close"" button in the last tab. I know that I can do it via the ""config mode"" (browser.tabs.closeWindowWithLastTab), but it's not user-friendly. It's inconvenient when you close the tab just to return home, but the whole browser closes. It makes me nervous. Thank you in advance!
