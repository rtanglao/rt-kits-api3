If the list of downloaded files (history in download dialog) is not empty, it pops up and stays. If the list of downloaded files is empty, it also pops up randomly and immediately disappears again. </p><p>I searched for this issue and found out that the automatically popping up download dialog can be disabled with `browser.download.alwaysOpenPanel=false`. Unfortunately, this is not what I want because the dialog should pop up when a download has been completed - but not randomly. </p><p>I would like to find out why this happens because I am a bit afraid that this may be malicious behavior (e.g., triggered by an extension). Do you have any idea where this behavior comes from or how to figure this out? Are there appropriate logs to take a look at? Can I see somehow which Firefox components are active at which point in time? </p><p>Edit: Just found other users with the same issue (but no solution, yet): - <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1370262#answer-1492291"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1370262#answer-1492291</a> - <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1370262#answer-1495496"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1370262#answer-1495496</a> </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ortaly
