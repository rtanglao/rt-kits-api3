The same happens when trying to launch firefox from the command line with the ""-safe-mode"" switch.  Interestingly, this behaviour is for a certain user on the machine only. Another user can launch it normally.  Tried deleting the profile, re-installing firefox.  In the CrashReports folder, there is only a ""InstallTime20220519220738"" file with 10 bytes size (and an empty ""events"" folder. The content of the file is just the string ""1653942123"".

For the past 2-3 days, when I click on the Firefox icon nothing opens for as much as 2 mins. All I get is the link in the top bar. It also happens when I try to change accounts, both using Firefox. I have absolutely no problem using Chrome to access my two accounts. If I close Firefox using the small X on the top line, next time I click on the icon what comes up is a blank page with previous sites used. When I click on one, same thing - takes forever to load/open. I uninstalled/reinstalled yesterday, no help.

Somewhere on the net I found that the following address does it: <a href=""https://www.google.com/webhp?cr=countryAT"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/webhp?cr=countryAT</a>|countryBE|countryBG|countryHR|countryCY|countryCZ|countryDK|countryEE|countryFI|countryFR|countryDE|countryGR|countryHU|countryIE|countryIT|countryLV|countryLT|countryLU|countryMT|countryNL|countryPL|countryPT|countryRO|countrySK|countrySI|countryES|countrySE </p><p>However, when I am trying to use it in firefox as my Start Page, it opens all of these in separate tabs and it does not work. Also as far as I understand using the link is not possible for new tabs. </p><p>The reason is simple. For example, when looking for cooking recipes, pages from the USA use strange units that cannot be understood and there is no point in translating each of these manually as all recipes are available in million of versions - it is just a matter of clicks. But I don't want to waste time each time on checking the websites one by one; if the cooking website is from Europe, the units will be of a standard and I don't have to worry. It is the same in relation to many products of any kind. European and American markets are completely different and reading description of something only to find out at the end that it is only available in the USA is waste of time. </p><p>- it should be possible in firefox to block some websites or portals by some button. I know that there is an add-on for this but it is only for 10 pages or so, so in reality it is not very useful. It also only works in the way that the page won't open when clicked on. However, it would be much better if unwanted portals or websites were simply removed from search results. </p><p>There are too many fake websites nowadays providing incorrect or misleading information. If it happens that I come across one of these, I want to be doing that only once - and block them forever. </p>",desktop;tips;windows-11;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,tips,en-US,1508962;1508978;1508982;,malecek1
