It used to was possible to clear cookies for a specific website but now it's gone! and I can't figure out how can I delete/clear cookies for a specific website! I think even if there is a way to do this, you've made it so complicated! it was easy, just click on setting icon next to website address in address bar and clear cookies! once I tried this and it took me to other pages and ended up to clearing all my cookies in entire Firefox! and this made difficulties for me to find all my username and passwords and enter them one by one... </p><p>Please make it simple as before. Thanks. </p>",windows-7;desktop;cookies;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,cookies,en-US,"",huios1
