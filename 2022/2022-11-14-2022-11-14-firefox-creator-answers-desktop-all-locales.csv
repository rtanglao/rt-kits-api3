This application has a Java backend that uses a JSESSIONID cookie to track user sessions. One instance of the application can be accessed anonymously here: <a href=""https://sextant.ifremer.fr/Donnees/Catalogue"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sextant.ifremer.fr/Donnees/Catalogue</a> </p><p>The session cookie is set on the first request to the backend with the following parameters: </p><p>Domain: ""<a href=""http://sextant.ifremer.fr"" rel=""nofollow"">sextant.ifremer.fr</a>"" expirationDate: ""Session"" HostOnly: true HttpOnly: true SameSite: ""None"" Secure: true </p><p>This application theoretically allows login in from a different origin. For example from <a href=""https://www.milieumarinfrance.fr/Acces-aux-donnees/Catalogue"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.milieumarinfrance.fr/Acces-aux-donnees/Catalogue</a>, which under the hood points to the same backend. We noticed recently that when accessing the application from a different origin in Firefox, the network requests aimed at the ""<a href=""http://sextant.ifremer.fr"" rel=""nofollow"">sextant.ifremer.fr</a>"" host *do not carry any existing session cookie*, thus rendering authenticated access impossible. </p><p>The existing session cookie is correctly used when I add an ""allow"" exception for the <a href=""http://sextant.ifremer.fr"" rel=""nofollow"">sextant.ifremer.fr</a> origin in the cookies settings of Firefox (see attached screenshot in French). So I figure that it's Firefox that decides not to use any existing cookie when on this origin. </p><p>Is there any way to indicate to Firefox that this cookie is legitimate and that it is needed for essential functionalities, without relying on the user allowing the cookie explicitly? </p><p>Thanks a lot in advance! </p>",linux;desktop;cookies;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,cookies,en-US,1547740;1547752;,guyot.o

How could this happen ? Doesn´t Firefox have any protection against backdoor sites ? I am a cautious user not using any password manager nor any financial CC information stored. My trust has now been shattered. I write this to warn others. A long story cut short. The hacker got entry via the site into my notebook and ransomed me to pay 400 euros upfront to an XBox account to recover the machine. That never materialized. In the ensuing choas I attempted to turn the machine off, and the power button didn´t work. The hacker had gotton into the power plan and messed the program up that immoblized the power off function so he/she had more time to crib my files. On previous generation machines it was easier to take the battery pack out. Now not the case. The situation made worse that a communal Lan router was on another floor and impractical to pull the plug out. In my case I put the notebook in a microwave oven and slammed the door to screen it from the WLAN. It worked but it is ridiculous there is no other way. I blame MS for such useless protection Defender/Firewall programs and Mozilla must take the share of the blame too for allowing the clone on the browser. Even with remote connection disabled, if Hackers find it so easy to enter via the backdoor, <strong>then high time these companies upped the ante in making systems far more secure.</strong> Even with extra verification, it wouldn´t have worked. Now the next step is beyond home fiddling but have to take this to a IT specialist to root out any embedded 3rd party links. I welcome all comments....  one wonders all this stuff regarding privacy is really a rouse. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1060;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1547743;1547759;,richwalters

Is there a way I can back everything off of her version of Firefox that is not installed just present as a secondary drive, so all her bookmarks, and (im assuming no on this part but ill ask) her web cache and add them into a new install of Firefox?   Is this possible? If I just launch Firefox.exe form the D drive that was originally W7 not W10 would it fire up?  It just needs to be alive long enough to do the backup to an HTML file and copy the addresses for the open tabs. Can this be done?
