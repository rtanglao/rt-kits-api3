I do not experience the issue on any other browser.  </p><p>I first noticed it trying to log into one of my accounts. The login portal redirects the page to a success screen and then to the home page. With firefox after entering credentials it shows a blank page with a 500 error instead.More specifically I believe it has to do with an api for ""duosecure"" (checking for multi factor auth)   </p><p>another example is trying to download chrome remote desktop - normally you click their download link and pauses the current page while it triggers a popup to chrome's page to download the extension. It does this in any other browser I try except firefox.  </p><p>This is on a clean install of windows 10 and a clean install of firefox. I am on the latest version of firefox (tried 106 and updated to 107 via the beta options)  I have:  - cleared cookies and cache - restarted firefox - tried safe mode - tried with and without extensions/addons and have removed all - uninstalled firefox as well as deleted all appdata folders - tried unchecking hardware acceleration - setting dns to none and changing the dns server options - turned off any setting i could find regarding popups, blocking sites etc - manually turned off enhanced tracking  - gone through windows firewall and security settings to turn off everything that i could find that was ""on"" - rebooted computer - rebooted router - used the ""refresh"" firefox to set it back to defaults - tried connecting to the internet via ethernet and wifi options - windows updates Note: logging into other things such as gmail or facebook are fine on firefox but they don't seem to trigger redirects to outside sites. </p>",desktop;beta;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1070;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",sli4

There are 3 things i need to get at and I am not sure how, this is basically the same question for Firefox, Chrome and Opera (apparently some of her business stuff likes one browser and not another etc etc etc, I dont ask I just fix things). </p><p>So in firefox, i have the entire Firefox folder as the SSD it was all on seems to be alive and well and other back ups have been fine.  Is there a way I can back everything off of her version of Firefox that is not installed just present as a secondary drive, so all her bookmarks, and (im assuming no on this part but ill ask) her web cache and add them into a new install of Firefox?   Is this possible? If I just launch Firefox.exe form the D drive that was originally W7 not W10 would it fire up?  It just needs to be alive long enough to do the backup to an HTML file and copy the addresses for the open tabs. Can this be done? PLEASE any\all advice would be GREATLY appreciated. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1547655;,dmbiel
