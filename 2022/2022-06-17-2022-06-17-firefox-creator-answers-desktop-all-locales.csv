NOTE: I have followed all available posts including multiple uninstalls (complete), deleting Firefox folders, reinstalling, etc.  There have been no major (or known) changes to my Windows 10 Pro system.  I run Heimdal Thor and Kaspersky antivirus protection and there have been no conflicts running both at any time.  I also use Acronis Protection (I know it may seem like overkill but it works).  I have turned off each of the above and Firefox still does not open.  Firefox runs with no problems on my personal and work laptops.  I am CompTia A+ Certified so somewhat knowledgeable (a little knowledge is a dangerous thing!) and have run sfc /scannow  with no issues noted.  Plus, two Heimdal support reps have logged onto my system, attempted to find a solution, found no issues with my system (Omen 880 even though I don't game).  My wife is a dedicated Firefox user and wants it back.  </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1010;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ejnottingham

When I try to login to google using firefox, it reports 'Something went wrong'. I have tried: many things, which include: reinstalling firefox, running firefox from a new user, running firefox from a newly installed live iso (pop os), downgrading firefox. Google login works inside virtual machine (arch linux), and other non firefox based browsers. I guess that it has to do with some package that firefox requires, which has broken things. </p>",desktop;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",user210653629975245344501479585487943743178
