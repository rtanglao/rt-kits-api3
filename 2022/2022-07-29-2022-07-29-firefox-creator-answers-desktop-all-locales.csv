My browser is updated to the latest version. The best way to describe the issue is like this: every time I boot up the browser, everything will be working fine. Then, within 4-5 minutes, tabs will stop opening. Every time I want to open a new webpage in a new or already existing tab, it will get eternally stuck on the loading stage. However, if I have something like a youtube playlist running in one of the tabs, it will switch from video to video with no problem. If I close the browser and try to open in again, it won't open (although I've already figured out that the latest issue can be solved with an administrator mode). Other browsers are working fine and don't have such issue. </p><p>I have tried reloading the browser, reloading the computer, cleaning cache/history/cookies, running the browser without any addons, running the debug mode, reinstalling the browser (twice), running the antivirus check, creating a new firefox profile. Nothing helps. Also, the problem persists in the debug mode - when I open it, the pages load for 3-5 minutes and then the tabs stop opening as well.  </p><p>Please suggest what can I do to fix this issue. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1523397;,selinakyle

La colonna dei segnalibri mi scompare in basso mentre prima era completamente contenuta nella schermata. La risoluzione del monitor è HD 1920 e non è stata toccata. Sinceramente non sono soddisfatto di questo cambiamento e sto cercando di riportare le cose come prima, anche confidando nell'ottima personalizzazione che permette e ha sempre permesso questo browser. Ho effettuato il reset del browser ma non è cambiato nulla (solo la scocciatura di aver dovuto rimettere tutto a posto per niente). Vi chiedo se effettivamente il browser con l'ultimo aggiornamento 103.0 ha adottato un layout più ""gonfio"" (lo stesso di Opera!), oppure ci sia margine per riportare il layout precedente.

I read that it may be the Antivirus that might block it, but I can't really disable it as my current job requires me to browse safely. I have Bitdefender active with firewall off. But I don't think it's this. 2. I don't use VPN. I did use DoH built-in the Firefox, but disabling it didn't really solve it. 3. I read again that the browser profile might have corrupted syncing, but I didn't use Firefox on mobile, nor even create an account on Firefox (until my desperation to ask here) 4. It's impossible to see which site may have the ""corrupt page"", as it also happen to Google or even this site (I kept refreshing until I can get to this site). 5. I have relatively unstable internet, as I currently live in a not-so-developed country that don't have fast internet. 6. I really refrain to move to another browser as it's already my daily browser and migrating a lot of stuffs is a pain. 7.

Before using FF I'd set exceptions for cookies that I prefer to keep (like search engine preferences) but I understand that isn't possible in FF, so I ended up using a different approach. On Unix-based systems I'd ""quit"" FF by with `pkill -9 -f firefox` (or waterfox). Somehow that worked (e.g. when restarting after an update) despite the obvious loophole it created but it was a welcome way to restart the browser without having to log in. Recently it stopped working though, and I find myself logged off every site I was logged in to, including Google and e.g. Whatsapp's web interface. Extremely annoying now that so many sites use 2FA. </p><p>Can you confirm this impression that the loophole has been closed, and security+privacy-related data is now removed at startup (too)?  </p><p>Is there an way to quit/restart the browser without clearing this data, e.g. after an update or to release build-up RAM usage back to the system, while keeping the default ""clear everything""? Is there an option not to lose logins etc. after a crash? </p><p>FWIW, the other reason I used this approach is because the open windows+tabs restore tended to be more reliable after a crash than after a normal shutdown (which would often miss a few tabs that I would not always miss at once). </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-910;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",rjvbertin
