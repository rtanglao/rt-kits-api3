And bigs bugs :  all web pages became huge zoomed at around 150 - 160% ! </p><p>I managed to fix the huge zoom problem by installing this firefox extension : <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/zoom-page-we/?utm_content=addons-manager-reviews-link&amp;utm_medium=firefox-browser&amp;utm_source=firefox-browser"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/zoom-page-we/?utm_content=addons-manager-reviews-link&amp;utm_medium=firefox-browser&amp;utm_source=firefox-browser</a> </p><p>and setting all web pages to 90% zoom with it. But this is not a solution because firefox has to fix this bug since this update! :(  </p><p><br> And the toolbar has become much higher, which decreases my screen height, it was better before! :( See my screenshot where i circled in red the height of the toolbar which has become higher! :(  </p><p>even the tab bar has become higher! :(   i managed to reduce it a little in height thanks to a code that i inserted in the file userChrome.css ,but the result is not beautiful : the texts are too flush with the line ( see my screenshot where i circled in blue the tab bar that i reduced with code in userChrome.css ) </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1523334;,sykranx

Before using FF I'd set exceptions for cookies that I prefer to keep (like search engine preferences) but I understand that isn't possible in FF, so I ended up using a different approach. On Unix-based systems I'd ""quit"" FF by with `pkill -9 -f firefox` (or waterfox). Somehow that worked (e.g. when restarting after an update) despite the obvious loophole it created but it was a welcome way to restart the browser without having to log in. Recently it stopped working though, and I find myself logged off every site I was logged in to, including Google and e.g. Whatsapp's web interface. Extremely annoying now that so many sites use 2FA. </p><p>Can you confirm this impression that the loophole has been closed, and security+privacy-related data is now removed at startup (too)?  </p><p>Is there an way to quit/restart the browser without clearing this data, e.g. after an update or to release build-up RAM usage back to the system, while keeping the default ""clear everything""? Is there an option not to lose logins etc. after a crash? </p><p>FWIW, the other reason I used this approach is because the open windows+tabs restore tended to be more reliable after a crash than after a normal shutdown (which would often miss a few tabs that I would not always miss at once). </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-910;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",rjvbertin
