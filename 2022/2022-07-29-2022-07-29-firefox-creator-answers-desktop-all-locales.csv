But Firefox won't display as before. It now looks like the version of Firefox for my linked cell phones after trying multiple restore efforts. Did Firefox change so the desktop version looks like it was made for my phone? I linked my phone and it seems to have overwritten my desktop settings. Are they recoverable, as in older recent backups of my data still saved somewhere on your server?

It's unfortunately right above 'remove from history' and easy to mis-click.  It has no confirmation and permanently deletes the file(s) without sending to the recycle bin which is quite annoying - especially as I'm not sure why you'd want to use this menu to delete something you just downloaded. </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,customize,en-US,1523293;,lemming3k
