I would rather that than have organizations like google tracking my every move so I am OK with the slowdowns.  What I am NOT OK with is CONSTANT messages from my browser telling me about the slowdowns.  Can the Messages be acknowledged then stopped? The constant interruption of my browsing by these messages is far more annoying than the slowdowns themselves.
