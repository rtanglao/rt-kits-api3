My issue is that while Firefox sync is signed in (and working) on 2 computers, as well as my iPhone and iPad, I have lost the password to the account and am not able to recover it from any of these devices.  It seems the password saved in my ""Passwords"" is incorrect, and that seems to be the only place it was saved.  I didn't write the password down anywhere, setup a recovery key, secondary email or two setup authentication.   </p><p>I DO have access to the primary email account, but don't see any way to use that to recover the password either.  As I am already signed in to sync, I AM able to add new devices using the QR code, but that doesn't seem to work for new computers (like the laptop I just bought).  I have already extracted the saved passwords and bookmarks, and transferred them to a new account (the account I am signed in with right now).   </p><p>However, I would rather use my original account instead of having two, nearly identical ones.  I would also rather not fully reset my account as there might be something else I forgot to record that is buried in there somewhere.  Is there some way to recover or extract my Firefox account password from one of the devices I am signed into? or is totally resetting the account the only option available?  </p><p>Thanks </p><p>-Bryan </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",isabrick
