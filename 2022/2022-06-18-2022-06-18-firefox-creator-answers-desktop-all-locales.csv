I just noticed that your system showed that my question was coming from Chrome Windows 10 and from an IP address that matches my Ipad and NOT my laptop. </p><p><strong>How is that possible? </strong>I didn't send my question from my ipad. I sent it from my laptop which uses Windows 10 but Firefox; and I don't have Chrome on my laptop or my ipad. So how could your system pickup Chrome when it's not in my home anywhere, and why would it detect my Ipad's IP address instead of my laptop/regular home IP address?  (I have no sync between my Ipad and my laptop). </p><p>Please clear up this mystery. </p><p>Regards, Steve </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,other,en-US,"",curious2016

It no longer does this - you have to to it manually. (Win 10) 2) Same problem with the password. 3) Same problem with the Personal Access Number (PAN). 4) Once I am IN my account, only a part of the links do work. Opening 'recent transactions' does NOT. 5) If I try to log out, instead of the usual confirmation I get a blank screen with the PTSB logo on top. </p> <ul><li>Using another browser (in this case Edge) does NOT cause ANY problem!* </li></ul> <p>So, I have to assume, this problem is version related.
