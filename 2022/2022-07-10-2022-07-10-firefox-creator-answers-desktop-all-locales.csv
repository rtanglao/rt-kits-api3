(I love the ""I don't care about cookies"" extension, by the way. It shuts up that completely asinine annoyance.) </p><p>As a test of sorts I would like toggle the blocking of DOM cookies on a regular basis by toggling dom.storage.enabled. Rather than going back and forth and toggling the value manually using the about:config editor I would like to automate the process, possibly with a Windows batch file or a script. Also, possibly, (just for fun) I would like to take this concept of the automating the changing of certain preference values into building an extension. If I ever learn how to properly code one, that is. </p><p>So, my question is --  Where is the dom.storage.enabled value stored?

Since it's the font that's the issue, and not an actual zoom option, trying command/control -/+/0 doesn't work either. I can't make the page wider, longer or pull it to the side to attempt to see other parts of the page, and I can't scroll down, up, sideways, anything.
