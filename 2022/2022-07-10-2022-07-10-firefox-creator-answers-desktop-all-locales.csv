Every time i open it shows an error and says that the error is from YOUTUBE and FIREFOX or I can do nothing about it. But the funny part is its working on other browsers like chrome. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",sharma99karambir

Also, my Gmail account is working normally.   With my Firefox account, it is working normally on my cellphone, but on my laptop, only the last 10 hours of messages are accessible, none of the essential tools (delete messages, etc.) on the toolbar are working, and I cannot attach files to messages I create. One more thing,  the internet provider for my cellphone is not Rogers Telecomm, but is Virgin Plus. Is this a problem with Firefox, or is it caused by the problems that Rogers Telecomm is having getting their system back in operation? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",alaucis
