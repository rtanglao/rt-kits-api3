Now the screen is so zoomed in that I can't use the browser at all. It's so close-up that the only thing it's able to display is the corner of the menu bar. If I try to access troubleshooting mode, I obviously can't, since it still will only show the corner of the page. Since it's the font that's the issue, and not an actual zoom option, trying command/control -/+/0 doesn't work either. I can't make the page wider, longer or pull it to the side to attempt to see other parts of the page, and I can't scroll down, up, sideways, anything. I feel like I've tried everything, and at this point I'm worried I'm going to have to make an entirely new Firefox account or something just because I mistyped one number, which I really don't want to have to do. </p><p>Feeling like a real idiot, please help me.

With my Firefox account, it is working normally on my cellphone, but on my laptop, only the last 10 hours of messages are accessible, none of the essential tools (delete messages, etc.) on the toolbar are working, and I cannot attach files to messages I create. One more thing,  the internet provider for my cellphone is not Rogers Telecomm, but is Virgin Plus. Is this a problem with Firefox, or is it caused by the problems that Rogers Telecomm is having getting their system back in operation? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1518552;1518554;,alaucis
