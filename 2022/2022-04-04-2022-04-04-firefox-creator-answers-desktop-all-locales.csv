Bartender Total Security  v26.0.14.63 is the default security application. </p><p>The hyperlinks worked once upon a time but now they do not. This occurred after i had problems with Opera which I uninstalled and cleaned out the registry deleting any Opera entries. When wanting to load a ""If there are problems with how this message is displayed, click here to view it in a web browser."" with View in Browser, it defaults to Internet Explorer v11.0.9600.20296 update v 11.0.265. Obviously Firefox is set as the default browser and I have tried set IE as the default and then changing it back to Firefox rebooting each time, however it makes no difference and IE still loads. </p><p>So does anyone have any solutions for this issue please. </p><p>Please reply ASAP  </p><p>Regards Roger H. / PC-Bug Fixer now in Tanilba Bay NSW 2319 Australia </p>",desktop;customize;windows-81;firefox-980;,firefox,customize,en-US,1494951;,pcbugfixer0
