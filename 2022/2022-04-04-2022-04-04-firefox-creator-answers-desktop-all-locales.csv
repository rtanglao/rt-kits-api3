I assume it's because I have an exorbitant amount of tabs open, but I'm not 100% sure. I tried refreshing Firefox, but the problem is that attempting to refresh loses all my tabs with no way of getting them back. I've tried refreshing previously, and afterwards I would get the option to choose which tabs/windows I would like to restore, but now I'm not getting that option so I'm forced to see if there's any other solutions. I haven't lost any of my previous data after trying to refresh once, since it's saved in the profile in the ""Old Firefox Data"" folder, but I just want to see if there's any solution that won't require me to start fresh. </p><p>I've submitted a crash report through Firefox, the report ID is:  bp-dd3d8911-2bc3-4471-a0b3-1f1a60220404 </p><p>Please let me know if you can help or if there's any other information you need.

Since the most recent firefox update, my settings and extensions have been inaccessible to me due to my firefox account profile being ""old.""

I really need access to some of these things, so it would be great if someone can help me to recover it. I tried to troubleshoot by finding my extensions local folder from my old profile, and I copied it to a new profile, but it didn't work. I am also wondering, if I do copy the extensions successfully, how can I also copy the settings preferences?

If ODD and EVEN options must be retained, then retain the Custom drop down, but put the box for selected pages just to the right of ALL for immediate entry of chosen page numbers.

Hoy cuando he abierto Firefox, no podía ver marcadores ni las cuentas/contraseñas guardadas. Posteriormente he sincronizado con el teléfono móvil android y ya he podido ver todos los marcadores. El problema que tengo ahora, es que no están activas las CUENTAS/ CONTRASEÑAS GUARDADAS, no se muestras. Además si guardo una nueva contraseña de cualquier página, no se guarda, o por lo menos yo no puedo verlo, en cambio en el teléfono movil, android, si que están activas, es como si no se sincronizaran del android al PC. He probado divesas cosas, e incluso reiniciar el ordenador, limpiarlo, etc. pero no da resultado. me ha parecido ver que me solicitaba una contraseña maestra, pero yo nunca he puesto una contraseña maestra en Firefox. Por favor necesito ayuda para poder resolverlo. He pensado en desinstalar Firefox y después instalarlo de nuevo, pero antes he querido preguntarles a ustedes por si me pueden ayudar, porque tengo muchas contraseñas guardadas y casi todas son diferentes. </p><p>Muchas gracias por la atención. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,privacy-and-security,es,"",martin.jordan

I now want to delete this alias as I am now getting spam emails into my normal account.     However I forgot my password and had to do a password reset.  Now when I enter Relay it does not give me the option to delete the original created alias address.  It only gives me the option to create more alias addresses.  How do I find and delete the original alias address so I can stop the spam arriving in my normal mail.   Or when you reset the relay account does it automatically delete any create alias addresses. </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,other,en-US,1494967;,malenibo
