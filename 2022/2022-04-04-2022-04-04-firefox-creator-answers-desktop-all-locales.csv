For a holiday in USA in July, I am entering the schedule into a New calendar in my Google calendar.  Being a NERD, I am applying the correct timezone, rather than just using the default SydneyAustralia.  That means the flight leaving Las Vegas at 8:50 shows up as the time in Australia on the visual (and reported) schedule. Which is a bit like I want, as for my family, those are the local times that I will be flying.  But for ME, with the printout in my pocket, I want it to show 8:50 so I know to catch the flight. Is it possible to change Windows/Thunderbird settings so it ""looks"" like I'm in a different timezone and the report will show as that timezone? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Hicksi53
