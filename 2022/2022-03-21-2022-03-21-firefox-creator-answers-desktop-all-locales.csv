Hope you are well and can help me?!!! </p><p>I guess my first problem was buying a refurbished laptop from Best Buy.  Anyway, after having to return it the day I received it, because it wouldn't even boot up, it was repaired and returned back to me.  I then got it all setup like I wanted, but if it ever hung up, or I needed to reboot because of a software update, or for any reason, it sometimes took several tries because of the hard drive not being found to boot from.  Well, after about a year of it doing this(still under warranty), it finally would not boot up at all and I was forced to return it to be repaired.  They had to replace the hard drive and did send me the bad one back, so I thought I wouldn't have ""anything"" since they had to install a new hard drive.  Well, I first look to see if any of my old data was there and I was flabbergasted that it was - from what I could tell, everything!!!  I don't know if this was from the One drive or like on another browser(Google Chrome) I use, all my bookmarks were there, along with passwords, everything!!!  Well, I also use Firefox Mozilla, so after installing it, I was not so happy when it appears that my bookmarks were not retained.  Before, I didn't have an account on your browser and I am assuming that is why nothing was retained.  I only signed up for an account on your browser today, obviously to send you this help question - hope of finding my old bookmarks and the passwords I had on them.  Needless to say, I can recreate them and get new passwords established again, but I sure hope they are still on my laptop ""somewhere"" that you can help me find them and restore them to your browser.  I searched the hard drive for bookmarks and did find a Firefox Mozilla file that looks like a backup file, but even if it is, I don't know how to restore it - but maybe it is just a file I created today only - I just don't know.  With this long winded question here, can you Please help me???  Much Thanks in advance!!!  Walt Wise </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",waltwise
