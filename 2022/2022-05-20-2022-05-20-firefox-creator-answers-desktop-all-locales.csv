Prior to re-installing I had an older theme from older versions of Firefox installed.  It was the pink one of the themes you could choose from the ""Application menu"" (literal translation from German, the system language I'm using). With the new version installed, I somehow cannot find the old themes anymore. I was wondering if there could be any way of using the old themes in the new version?

I've tried ""Refresh Firefox"" and the issue temporarily goes away, and access is successful through the link I have described, but, only immediately after the refresh. Later, it will again no longer connect again...unless I again Refresh Firefox. The issue appears (to me) to be a broken address stream when the problem occurs, but, again, this only occurs under the conditions I have described. It has worked fine for many years and just within the last four days suddenly became a problem. Yes, I have other options to access OneDrive, but the app for OneDrive while on <a href=""http://Outlook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outlook.com</a> emails is the most convenient since I am often communicating with a recipient of a link to a file stored in a file on the online OneDrive.

The problem occurs on my laptop as well on my desktop (both on latest stable Firefox[Build ID: 20220513165813] and Windows 11). The workaround is to kill the Firefox subprocess which is using most of the CPU and RAM. Then everything is back to normal for some time, until Firefox starts messing with me again. </p><p>While trying to pinpoint the problem I'm stuck. I can't find a culprit other than the fact it has something to do with Firefox. Clean reinstalling did not help. The Firefox Task Manager doesn't know anything about huge amounts of RAM being taken.

But I've exhausted the steps there (Except for upgrading the PC / RAM). </p><p>Especially on the go this Firefox-RAM-Party takes quite some battery and right now while writing this Firefox has &gt;100GB virtual RAM reserved for some IPC messages, I personally think this is too much. So I'd like to file a report, but without steps to reproduce I'm afraid the developers are going to say 'well, that's something we are not able to diagnose', because I am unable to explain how to reproduce it.

All I want the browser to do is search for an image, not hand over all my personal information to you.  You can't find an image without checking where I am, what else I've been doing, modifying my privacy and browser proxy settings, storing unlimited data, reading everything on my open and recently closed tabs?  Is this to be used for commercial purposes? What's going on here? I think it's time to find a new browser.
