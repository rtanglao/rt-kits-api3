Something inside Firefox is eating up my RAM and CPU. Usually I recognize the problem happening because my laptop fans ramp up. The problem occurs on my laptop as well on my desktop (both on latest stable Firefox[Build ID: 20220513165813] and Windows 11). The workaround is to kill the Firefox subprocess which is using most of the CPU and RAM. Then everything is back to normal for some time, until Firefox starts messing with me again. </p><p>While trying to pinpoint the problem I'm stuck. I can't find a culprit other than the fact it has something to do with Firefox. Clean reinstalling did not help. The Firefox Task Manager doesn't know anything about huge amounts of RAM being taken. I searched for solutions on the net and the about:memory indicates the problem is some IPC related stuff: </p><pre> {   ""process"": ""Main Process (pid 12648)"",   ""path"": ""queued-ipc-messages/content-parent(Browser, pid=9612, open channel, 0x22e4b33fc30, refcnt=38)"",   ""kind"": 2,   ""units"": 1,   ""amount"": 0,   ""description"": ""The number of unset IPC messages held in this ContentParent's channel.  A large value here might indicate that we're leaking messages.  Similarly, a ContentParent object for a process that's no longer running could indicate that we're leaking ContentParents.""  } </pre> <p>The bug reporting guidelines(<a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html</a>) are encouraging me to attach steps to reproduce and try the steps listed on <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-uses-too-much-memory-or-cpu-resources"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-uses-too-much-memory-or-cpu-resources</a> . But I've exhausted the steps there (Except for upgrading the PC / RAM). </p><p>Especially on the go this Firefox-RAM-Party takes quite some battery and right now while writing this Firefox has &gt;100GB virtual RAM reserved for some IPC messages, I personally think this is too much. So I'd like to file a report, but without steps to reproduce I'm afraid the developers are going to say 'well, that's something we are not able to diagnose', because I am unable to explain how to reproduce it. It just happens from time to time.  </p><p>The anonymized about:memory report: <a href=""https://bin.disroot.org/?2ba01ef78154cce4#8PLVqLTd9qgaRn2QVX2P17hkbHQyrTDuVAwoykj2cBxg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bin.disroot.org/?2ba01ef78154cce4#8PLVqLTd9qgaRn2QVX2P17hkbHQyrTDuVAwoykj2cBxg</a> </p><p>I left Firefox running like this for about half an hour and at 138GB reserved RAM Windows slaughtered my Firefox.
