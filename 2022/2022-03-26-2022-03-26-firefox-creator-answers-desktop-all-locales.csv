If I click the arrow the menu pops up &amp; immediately disappears.  I cannot choose any of the things listed in the menu.  I have to try a 1st letter or number to see if that matches any of the items on the menu. Also, every time I use the CTRL button, the screen resizes!  Every copy &amp; paste makes the screen get larger, and I have to manually size back down to normal. I have tried the Firefox refresh, and it made no difference. Is there an update I can take off, or a new one that will fix these issues? Thank you Christine </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,other,en-US,"",a996ontrak

Basically, whenever my BT connection goes offline, Firefox decides to take it upon itself to open up just to tell me it can't connect/that the web is offline etc. It's seriously annoying. I know it's offline as the hub light will change from blue to green/orange etc. It's even worse if I'm doing something else, such as playing on a game, and it's interrupted by the web browser opening itself.Â :-\ </p><p>Any suggestions? Thanks. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",DustyShinigami
