My Macbook Air crashed for reasons unknown, and upon rebooting it, I attempted to open Firefox, but was met with the message ""A copy of firefox is already open"". I found some old guide on using Terminal to discover two different profiles for Firefox. After restarting my computer, I accessed my Firefox tabs from before, but now when I open links from my email account, they default to opening up a new Firefox window, one where it seems my bookmarks don't exist. How do I remove the second profile without losing my bookmarks? </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,other,en-US,"",alxpaz8

So here's a shorter version of what I put into the forum: </p><p>Mozilla, this problem has bedeviled many users for at least two years, just from the help forum posts.  ... Is there a new fix? </p><p>Maybe Firefox will have to be an app that cannot be entirely the same for Mac, Unix, and Windoze. Puhleeze fix the Mac version, somehow. ... I love it -- as I did earlier apps such as Netscape and long-ago Firefox -- except for this. </p><p>To re-state the problem: With any variation of the print command, the Firefox printer interface comes up and the preview window has the infamous spinner.  A 30-second delay to show the image.  regardless of web source or file size....  1-2 secs with all other apps, for files below ~100+mb. 30 to refresh after a change, such as custom # of pages.  1-2 secs with all other apps and just several pages. 30-45 secs of fast wi-fi for the printer to start clicking. It is 1 to about 15 secs with other apps,  That's 90-105 seconds for things that normally take 5 to 20. And they release the app almost instantly; this app clings and lags. </p><p>The ""...system dialog..."" link is a welcome but weak alternative: It's an extra step, it skips the preview that we often need, and there's no handy tool to make it the default. </p><p>I saw helpful but complex volunteer tips to fix configs. I did that sort of ...stuff... decades ago in Unix and DOS and early Windoze. NO MORE. All systems are quirky, but _this_ bug is destroying Firefox's sterling reputation. </p><p>There's a fundamental problem and it needs a fundamental fix. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1012;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",john.r.mcclelland

I have completely uninstalled  and reinstalled the add-ons, from the Mozilla site, to no real avail.  </p><p>It is not only annoying but very frustrating and I am about to give up, on the browser altogether.

At seemingly random times if Firefox is open and the visible tab has text, as in is not a full tab video stream, all of the text and images will shrink in size and spacing.  This is independent of the zoom function as it remains at 100.  Zooming to make text larger again looks weird and bulky, refreshing the page however will restore it.  This glitch happens even if another application has focus, even if it is fullscreen exclusive.  I haven't been able to figure out what kind of shortcut, command, or addon might possibly be able to do this. </p><p>The drop-down mystery happens when the visible tab is a full tab stream.  Again even if another application has focus, the download drop-down appears and stays until I click somewhere.  I've only seen it appear once and it does not look like when I choose to click the drop-down button.  The size of the drop-down changed a couple to several times, and I believe the first download item appeared to be highlighted in dark blue, something I can't reproduce with my mouse or keyboard, it only highlights a different color grey.  This one makes me nervous as it could possibly be something activating a download and then immediately deleting it from history?  I only just recently learned the the menu will appear automatically when downloading something. </p><p>I've tried reinstalling Firefox.  I don't notice this on edge, though I only have to use it a fraction of the time.  I've never noticed any extra commands or text appear that I didn't type or direct in other applications.  This somehow shows up after a fresh windows 10 install, and have since replaced keyboard &amp; mouse.  I've tried leaving a keylogger over long periods and it never shows anything.
