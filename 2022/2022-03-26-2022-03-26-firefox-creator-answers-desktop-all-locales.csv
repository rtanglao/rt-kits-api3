So my question is: what data is saved when syncing with Firefox sync? And I dont mean the different types you can choose between ,no I mean: when I change one thing on onea logged in firefox on one machine doesnt that change the status of, and in my example the bookmarks on the other machines? Or is it the other way around, namely: will the second machine with all the duplicate bookmarks change the sync-""base"" so they will be back on all other machines again? Very confusing especially if youre logged into moire machine then one at the same time. Please answer me, I really need to clean up my firefox's accumulated duplicates pretty quick. Sincerely Wal </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",vatch23

This causes severe problems as some people may use Firefox for work and it may be quite a f__k up when you're discussing something with your client and out of a sudden you need to tell them that all you've been building up for the last 20minutes needs to be done again and you're short of time because the meeting ends in, let's say, 10 minutes. </p><p>That means Firefox is not useful for professional use like business, science(reported by someone else <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1314749"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1314749</a> ) and probably other fields. </p><p>How about telling the user that Firefox is going to update when restarted but not forcing the user to restart it NOW and to destroy user's work at random points in time? </p><p>Besides the above Firefox dosen't restore the tabs when forcefully quits to do the update which not only makes me lose the content of a form that was being filled but also varius tabs that were opened at that time. </p><p>I'm aware that I can disable automatic updates by setting one of the parameters to false in about:config but I'm not sure whether I'll be informed about updates in this case and what's more this doesn't make Firefox suitable for a regular user that may not have this knowledge. Chrome is more friendly to regular users in this case.  </p><p>The issue happend: when upgrading to Firefox 98.0.2 (64bit) and a few earlier versions in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1492546;,anjs

At seemingly random times if Firefox is open and the visible tab has text, as in is not a full tab video stream, all of the text and images will shrink in size and spacing.  This is independent of the zoom function as it remains at 100.  Zooming to make text larger again looks weird and bulky, refreshing the page however will restore it.  This glitch happens even if another application has focus, even if it is fullscreen exclusive.  I haven't been able to figure out what kind of shortcut, command, or addon might possibly be able to do this. </p><p>The drop-down mystery happens when the visible tab is a full tab stream.  Again even if another application has focus, the download drop-down appears and stays until I click somewhere.  I've only seen it appear once and it does not look like when I choose to click the drop-down button.  The size of the drop-down changed a couple to several times, and I believe the first download item appeared to be highlighted in dark blue, something I can't reproduce with my mouse or keyboard, it only highlights a different color grey.  This one makes me nervous as it could possibly be something activating a download and then immediately deleting it from history?  I only just recently learned the the menu will appear automatically when downloading something. </p><p>I've tried reinstalling Firefox.  I don't notice this on edge, though I only have to use it a fraction of the time.  I've never noticed any extra commands or text appear that I didn't type or direct in other applications.  This somehow shows up after a fresh windows 10 install, and have since replaced keyboard &amp; mouse.  I've tried leaving a keylogger over long periods and it never shows anything.  I refuse to leave Mozilla, any help is greatly appreciated.  Thank you for reading this far :) </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1492542;,GentlerGiant
