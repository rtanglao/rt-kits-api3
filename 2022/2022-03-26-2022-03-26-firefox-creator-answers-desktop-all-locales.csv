At seemingly random times if Firefox is open and the visible tab has text, as in is not a full tab video stream, all of the text and images will shrink in size and spacing.  This is independent of the zoom function as it remains at 100.  Zooming to make text larger again looks weird and bulky, refreshing the page however will restore it.  This glitch happens even if another application has focus, even if it is fullscreen exclusive.  I haven't been able to figure out what kind of shortcut, command, or addon might possibly be able to do this. </p><p>The drop-down mystery happens when the visible tab is a full tab stream.  Again even if another application has focus, the download drop-down appears and stays until I click somewhere.  I've only seen it appear once and it does not look like when I choose to click the drop-down button.  The size of the drop-down changed a couple to several times, and I believe the first download item appeared to be highlighted in dark blue, something I can't reproduce with my mouse or keyboard, it only highlights a different color grey.  This one makes me nervous as it could possibly be something activating a download and then immediately deleting it from history?  I only just recently learned the the menu will appear automatically when downloading something. </p><p>I've tried reinstalling Firefox.  I don't notice this on edge, though I only have to use it a fraction of the time.  I've never noticed any extra commands or text appear that I didn't type or direct in other applications.  This somehow shows up after a fresh windows 10 install, and have since replaced keyboard &amp; mouse.  I've tried leaving a keylogger over long periods and it never shows anything.

Any time I go to use the default Amazon search included with the browser now, it defaults to <a href=""http://Amazon.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon.ca</a> rather than <a href=""http://Amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon.com</a>.  I've tried going to <a href=""http://Amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon.com</a> directly and manually adding the search, but that just gives me an error message.  I don't have anything set to Canada at all anymore.  How do I get my Amazon search to go back to normal?  Is there something on the back-end I can edit to fix it? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,other,en-US,1492517;1492658;,gvmanx

Every copy &amp; paste makes the screen get larger, and I have to manually size back down to normal. I have tried the Firefox refresh, and it made no difference. Is there an update I can take off, or a new one that will fix these issues? Thank you Christine </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,other,en-US,1492529;,a996ontrak

Basically, whenever my BT connection goes offline, Firefox decides to take it upon itself to open up just to tell me it can't connect/that the web is offline etc. It's seriously annoying. I know it's offline as the hub light will change from blue to green/orange etc. It's even worse if I'm doing something else, such as playing on a game, and it's interrupted by the web browser opening itself. :-\ </p><p>Any suggestions?
