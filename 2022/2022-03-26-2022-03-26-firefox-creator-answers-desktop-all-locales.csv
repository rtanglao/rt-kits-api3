These graphical errors are confined to the window the video the PIP was playing, and stop once the window is closed. </p><p>I haven't seen graphical errors anywhere else on my system, so I don't think that's the problem. I haven't installed any new extensions in a while. So... yeah, a bit confused. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",corruptlully

Bring back option for the default to system print dialog","<p>Please bring back the option to let the system print dialog be the default. There's no need to fix what's not broken. I dislike the new FireFox dialog. I like and am used to the system print dialog, it works, does what I want, and it should be brought back for consistency with other applications. </p><p>I could previously fix this in about:config, but that option is now ignored. </p><p>I understand the desire to try something new, but it makes no sense to improve on what already works. And, to remove the about:config option means your imposing your will on me. FireFox never felt like an imposition before, this is like something I'd expect from Apple, not Mozilla. </p><p>Please bring back my choice and make it an easy configuration checkbox, no about:config voodoo. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1013;firefox-980;firefox-9801;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",DavidOrDave

Any time I go to use the default Amazon search included with the browser now, it defaults to <a href=""http://Amazon.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon.ca</a> rather than <a href=""http://Amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon.com</a>.  I've tried going to <a href=""http://Amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon.com</a> directly and manually adding the search, but that just gives me an error message.  I don't have anything set to Canada at all anymore.  How do I get my Amazon search to go back to normal?  Is there something on the back-end I can edit to fix it? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,other,en-US,1492517;,gvmanx

If I click the arrow the menu pops up &amp; immediately disappears.  I cannot choose any of the things listed in the menu.  I have to try a 1st letter or number to see if that matches any of the items on the menu. Also, every time I use the CTRL button, the screen resizes!  Every copy &amp; paste makes the screen get larger, and I have to manually size back down to normal. I have tried the Firefox refresh, and it made no difference. Is there an update I can take off, or a new one that will fix these issues? Thank you Christine </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,other,en-US,1492529;,a996ontrak

Basically, whenever my BT connection goes offline, Firefox decides to take it upon itself to open up just to tell me it can't connect/that the web is offline etc. It's seriously annoying. I know it's offline as the hub light will change from blue to green/orange etc. It's even worse if I'm doing something else, such as playing on a game, and it's interrupted by the web browser opening itself.Â :-\ </p><p>Any suggestions?
