I log in to my account using Firefox 95.0.2 and everything is currently updated  windows  included but every time I finish writing and attaching the files requested I get the attached error message below . All my browser settings are set as they are supposed to be and this is maddening. I really would  appreciate any help because it makes no sense to me I'm online and this is the only issue I'm having I just sent 2 email's earlier. Also I am the administrator of my laptop so I'm really confused. Remember be nice to your elders we didn't grow up in this tech world like you young people . LOL Thanks I hope some of you are getting a good laugh . Laughing is healthy and hey I'm laughing at me too. Have a great day Sincerely </p>,desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",1ARICHARDhead

I did a new install of Windows 10 on my desktop and used Firefox 95.0.2 and the problem went away, but on my laptop using Firefox 96 it still does it. I have tried Internet Explorer (but not any other browsers) and have no problem signing in. I see that others have this problem too and I tried the solutions that others have posted but none work. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,websites,en-US,1473992;1473994;,dj5300

This was on several profiles. If I closed FF and restarted it usually said FF was already running. I closed FF in Task Manager but that made no difference. Rebooted the PC but to no avail. Did these several times but made no difference. However Windows 10 Edge worked. </p><p>I restored Windows 10 back a few days &amp; then FF worked. I then updated FF from vers 94 to vers 96. Even after FF indicated it was now vers 96 it still kept checking for updates for probably 10 minutes.  </p><p>Today I did a few Ookla Speedtests. After clicking “GO” it takes about 30 seconds for the test to start, which does indicate a ping of 10 ms. Ping varies a bit with every test.  </p><p>If I use the Edge browser it takes only a second or two for the test to start with approx the same ping.  </p><p>This almost 30 second difference is repeatable. I never noticed such a big difference between the two browsers before. </p><p>Why does FF take so long to start the speedtest after clicking ""GO""? Does this have something to do with FF vers 96? Or is there something wrong with my FF installation? </p><p>Thanks for any suggestions. Thanks </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1473979;,Mike109
