However, as of two months ago, I needed to re-install my Ubuntu OS on my laptop and of course Firefox as well. I enabled 2FA as I did before and it was a breeze. However, when I started using it (Account log-in/log-out) I keep getting asked to have the confirmation via my email and NOT via the 2FA app generated code I registered with it. At first, I still have the patience for it. But after several months, I am already pissed off. It's such an unbearable nuisance already, when I always have my 2FA app that I can always refer to in a snap. I really hate what's happening now. Can anybody please tell me what went wrong with Firefox 2FA account and why it keeps bugging me for email confirmation and not use the 2FA generated code? Makes me think all my efforts in setting the 2FA app useless and I've had enough already. </p><p>Thank you everyone for your help. </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",myzeroconf
