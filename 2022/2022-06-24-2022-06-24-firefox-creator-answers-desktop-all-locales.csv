I frequently transfer funds. For the first time, this month when I tried to transfer payment to my new Wells Fargo credit card, none of the  menu items on the Transfer Page would open.  I had to call the bank to do the transaction. Today I attempted to do another transfer of funds, using firefox and when I landed on the page, again the page was dead~ as in none of the items would open or appear that allow the transfer of funds.  I called the bank to report the problem, and was asked to attempt to log in to my account from Chrome. I did this, and there was NO PROBLEM. ALL pages opened as they normally should, and I made my transfer of funds. </p><p>I use Firefox because I HATE GOOGLE. So to be directed there because firefox  now has a BUG that prevents the smooth BANKING transactions I need, means that YOUR BROWSER IS NO GOOD TO ME. I see that you've had problems like this reported for a while. PLEASE FIX THIS.
