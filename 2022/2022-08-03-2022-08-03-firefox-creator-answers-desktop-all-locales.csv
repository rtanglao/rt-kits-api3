It isn't a constant thing, but it has happened more than once, so I doubt it's a coincidence. I have no clue what the latter site is. Luckily I have Noscript running so it prevents the site from doing anything, but I have no clue why <a href=""http://Paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Paypal.com</a> would even be doing that in the first place. I have no idea if this is something anyone else is running into either.  </p><p>I have not loaded any new apps or web extensions for that matter, and as such I doubt it's on my end, as my machine checks out fine on my antivirus and antimalware programs. I also haven't seen this kind of behavior anywhere else either, so I don't understand what's going on. Can anyone explain this and help prevent it from reoccurring?  </p><p>Thanks in advance </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Marc7

The mouse cursor can be used to resize the window, but is otherwise unresponsive, except to to minimize, maximize or close the window. If I click minimize and then restore the window, Firefox will have executed the last mouse-click before minimizing.  This happens after five minutes or so after starting Firefox, whether I have only 4 or 5 tabs open, or a whole pile of tabs. All I can do is click X in top RHS, and then restart Firefox.  Then click the ""recently closed tabs"" to get back to where I was. I have tried clearing the cache and (most of) the cookies.  As well I did a <strong>complete refresh of Firefox, and disabled all the add-ons</strong>, but the problem is still there  Running on a (old) Lenovo Thinkpad E545 with 16GB,   Ubuntu in a SSD  using a 50 GB partn with 30GB free.
