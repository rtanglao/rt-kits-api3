I've tried using gfx.color_management.mode 1 (my typical setting) and 2 (the default), and neither seems to fix the issue. The same issue exists in a fresh profile. I'd roll back to test an earlier version of FF, but it seems that's no longer easily possible. Edge is displaying colors properly. </p><p>Any ideas or known bugs? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1070;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1548771;,nrbelex
