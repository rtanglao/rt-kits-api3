I've tried using gfx.color_management.mode 1 (my typical setting) and 2 (the default), and neither seems to fix the issue. The same issue exists in a fresh profile. I'd roll back to test an earlier version of FF, but it seems that's no longer easily possible. Edge is displaying colors properly. </p><p>Any ideas or known bugs? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1070;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1548771;,nrbelex

However, I opened it on the task bar and used it as my browser window and it has deleted ALL my sign in's that I leave signed in to the site.  How do I get rid of this page all together? I have it on my task bar, I don't want to use it. I didn't see it in Programs in the Control panel so how do I delete this feature of Mozilla's? The window I want to delete says : ""Private window: Firefox clears your search and browsing history when you close all private windows.
