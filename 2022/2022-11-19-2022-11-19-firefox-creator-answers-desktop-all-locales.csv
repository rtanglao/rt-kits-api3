If I download the file with Safari it works on both my internal and external harddrive. </p><p>To summarize, the exact combination that causes this error is Swedish letters, Firefox and exfat.

I've tried using gfx.color_management.mode 1 (my typical setting) and 2 (the default), and neither seems to fix the issue. The same issue exists in a fresh profile. I'd roll back to test an earlier version of FF, but it seems that's no longer easily possible. Edge is displaying colors properly. </p><p>Any ideas or known bugs? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1070;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1548771;,nrbelex

I have it on my task bar, I don't want to use it. I didn't see it in Programs in the Control panel so how do I delete this feature of Mozilla's?
