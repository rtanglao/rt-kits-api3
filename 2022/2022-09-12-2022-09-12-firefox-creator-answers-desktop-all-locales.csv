So I was looking for a way to remove saved ""logins"",  basically like when you go to a site and then you click in the email box and a bunch of emails show up..   I wanted to remove this,   someone mentioned removing logins SO i ended deleting all my logins!!    I was able to restore an old ""logins.json"" file which has all my passwords (thankfully) however when I go back to opening firefox,  there are no passwords/    I can see that firefox automatically creates a new ""logins"" and ""logins backup"" file but will not read from the restored one.   I have tried deleting the new ""logins"" file and renaming the old one,  nothing works.

So far, each site with problems loads fine with Chromium.   I have attached 2 screenshots to show one specific problem - a Kaiser sign in page.   with firefox, I have double braces, double colons and seemingly variable names filling an unresponsive page.  While with Chromium, Sign In works normally.    </p><p>on another specific site, the FireFox sign in is successful, but the welcome page stays completely blank, so no navigation is possible.  In other sites, the gray revolving circle goes on forever.  And  for most sites everything is fine.   I am starting here as the problem is manifesting in FireFox, but may be the OSÂ ? my version of FireFox is 104.0.2 (64-bit) [Sep. 6th, 2022Â ?] </p><p>So, How to triage whether this is an OS problem or a FireFox issueÂ ?    What info do I need to collectÂ ? </p><p>thank you for your help on this. </p>",linux;desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1533492;,kanka66

But, I'm trying to create more than one outlook email account. When I try and create another outlook account I find the instructions for it, but those instructions don't seem to relate to my Firefox browser? The instructions ask for me to click on the file tab to create another outlook account, which I can see on the screen shot provided. But, the Firefox file tab has not link that provides that to happen. So, I'm wondering if I need another browser, a different browser to create another outlook account? Sounds rather confusing to me? But, when it's all said and done, can I create a second or more outlook account with Firefox? It seems difficult for me to do so with Firefox? Can someone please help and explain if I can create another new outlook account with Firefox, and I can, how do I do that?
