I still use Win7 but have it locked down pretty tightly and get security updates through the ESU program.  </p><p>If I open Firefox with six pinned news and weather tabs (as I have been doing for years), 0.8-1 GB of data are downloaded within a matter of minutes. Opening a new webpage (e.g., <a href=""http://CNN.com"" rel=""nofollow"">CNN.com</a>, but it doesn't seem to matter what webpage I open) will immediately download another 0.1-0.25 GB of data. As far as I can tell there is no end to this behavior. Each new webpage causes a large download.  </p><p>Opening a new Firefox session without pinned or open tabs is better, but still downloads around 0.1 GB of data at the outset. Each opened webpage prompts the same 0.1-0.25 GB download outlined above.   </p><p>I have a network monitor on my desktop so I am confident that this behavior wasn't happening until a couple days ago. Previously my total daily download would be 1-2 GB, which included work-at-home activities, 30-60 minutes of watching Youtube videos (480p), and often a couple hours of listening to classical music (144p) on Youtube.  </p><p>Yesterday I did a full virus and malware scan of my computer and nothing was found. Outside of Firefox my computer seems to be operating normally. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1533393;,andrew.wiewel

Changing the page settings helps but does nothing to change the header size. Furthermore, when I close FF and reopen, all the previous changes are lost and the page displays wrong again. The only fix I found so far is to restore windows and don't allow FF to update. I forgot why I wasn't updating. Yesterday I allowed FF to update and now back to a messed up browser display.
