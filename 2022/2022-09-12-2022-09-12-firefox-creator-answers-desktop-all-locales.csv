On certain websites the font-families/styles look broken. I tried troubleshooting the issue by myself without any luck. What I did so far was reset my Windows fonts to default, reinstall Firefox and look what font-families are loaded through the Inspect tool. If I opened the same web page in Chrome the font looks OK. Two websites the issue is most visible at - <a href=""http://support.fiverr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">support.fiverr.com</a> and <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a> when someone replies to my e-mail. </p><p>Please find below a screenshot of what I mean </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1533345;,nicolay.vladimirov

Now firefox is using its own mouse pointer style (smaller pointer, ""hand with cuff pointing left"" instead of ""hand pointing up"" over links). I can edit the system style of my mouse pointer, but that does not change the mouse pointer while in Firefox.

So far, each site with problems loads fine with Chromium.   I have attached 2 screenshots to show one specific problem - a Kaiser sign in page.   with firefox, I have double braces, double colons and seemingly variable names filling an unresponsive page.  While with Chromium, Sign In works normally.    </p><p>on another specific site, the FireFox sign in is successful, but the welcome page stays completely blank, so no navigation is possible.  In other sites, the gray revolving circle goes on forever.  And  for most sites everything is fine.   I am starting here as the problem is manifesting in FireFox, but may be the OS ? my version of FireFox is 104.0.2 (64-bit) [Sep. 6th, 2022 ?] </p><p>So, How to triage whether this is an OS problem or a FireFox issue ?    What info do I need to collect ? </p><p>thank you for your help on this. </p>",linux;desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",kanka66

But, I'm trying to create more than one outlook email account. When I try and create another outlook account I find the instructions for it, but those instructions don't seem to relate to my Firefox browser? The instructions ask for me to click on the file tab to create another outlook account, which I can see on the screen shot provided. But, the Firefox file tab has not link that provides that to happen. So, I'm wondering if I need another browser, a different browser to create another outlook account? Sounds rather confusing to me? But, when it's all said and done, can I create a second or more outlook account with Firefox? It seems difficult for me to do so with Firefox? Can someone please help and explain if I can create another new outlook account with Firefox, and I can, how do I do that?
