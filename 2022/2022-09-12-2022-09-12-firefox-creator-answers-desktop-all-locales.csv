Yeah I'll try to remember to do that.... NOT! </p><p>I have dom.webnotifications.enabled set to false but these annoying notifications still appear.  They require user intervention to close.  I don't fing want notifications about anything, much less that I screenshotted something.

1389024,2022-09-11 17:27:22 -0700,2022-09-11 17:27:22 -0700,creating a outlook email account,"<p>I'm hoping Firefox can help my problem? I have Outlook email account that I just started using. But, I'm trying to create more than one outlook email account. When I try and create another outlook account I find the instructions for it, but those instructions don't seem to relate to my Firefox browser? The instructions ask for me to click on the file tab to create another outlook account, which I can see on the screen shot provided. But, the Firefox file tab has not link that provides that to happen. So, I'm wondering if I need another browser, a different browser to create another outlook account? Sounds rather confusing to me? But, when it's all said and done, can I create a second or more outlook account with Firefox? It seems difficult for me to do so with Firefox? Can someone please help and explain if I can create another new outlook account with Firefox, and I can, how do I do that? Thank you. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1040;,firefox,other,en-US,"",sciencemagic
