Hopefully this can be solved. </p><p>PS: I did saw one of the older bug tracker forum 3 years ago did mention something like force video to run a different encoder that isn't AV01 in about:config , I did not attempt it as I found it uncomfortable to edit and potentially break my browser. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Shuroko
