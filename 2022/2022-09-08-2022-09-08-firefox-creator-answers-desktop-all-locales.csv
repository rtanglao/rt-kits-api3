I had 98 or something before. </p><p>When I am on any merchant site and I choose their pay by PayPal button, a PayPal pop-up window opens, saying I am recognized on this computer, but then it never finishes loading to the payment options.  Actually, I see the options there, but they are greyed out and very blurry, so I cannot make them out and select any of them does not work either.   </p><p>I have deleted cookies multiple times; ensured <a href=""http://paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">paypal.com</a> is allowed pop-ups as well as the merchant websites.  I upgraded Firefox.  I only have one add-on listed, Amazon Assistant, and I had this problem before I installed it.  I have tried every solution I can find on line, although all postings are at least a year old or older, but nothing has worked.   </p><p>I use to be able to get it to finish loading if I closed the pop-up and reopened it and refreshed the merchant page, but that is no longer working. </p><p>It worked on Edge.  I hate Edge. </p><p>Firefox, please help fix this! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10401;,firefox,other,en-US,"",CatherineHP

Já desinstalei e voltei a instalar o Firefox mas o problema persiste. Isto só se nota quando corro um vídeo de ruído constante, como o ""brown noise"". Com vídeos normais isso não se nota. Tirei que instalar uma versão mais antiga ou há solução para isto? Noutros browsers não tenho esse problema. </p><p>Cumprimentos Vitor </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,other,pt-BR,"",vhtas

I have OneTab and I LOVE it! I still have the OneTab icon/link on the top LEFT of my screen. Clicking that drops down a list of sites that I can load. But the identical icon/link that used to appear on the top RIGHT side of the screen is gone. I was able to click this when I was shutting down my system. Clicking it would close the open sites and put them in the list I can access on the left. (I told you I don't know the right names for things. Sorry!!!) I can't use OneTab without that right-side icon/link. I also lost the 1Password icon/link. How do I get these back? I still have the Pocket icon/link, the download arrow, the Firefox account icon, and the ""hamburger"" on the right, but I really want the OneTab and 1Password clickable icon/links. Simple instructions, please! Thank you! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",sajudy2

If I immediately try to open firefox again it tells me the old one is still running but not responding so I have to click close to open a new session. This has been happening for weeks now. </p><p>I considered that maybe there's some kind of interaction with the exit button since it is above the scroll bar and this only happens when I try to scroll up fast and far, but I've not been able to recreate this issue manually, releasing right click doesn't close the browser even if I hover over the x so I have no explanation on why this happens. </p><p>Please help, thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",vash854
