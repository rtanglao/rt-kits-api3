I have OneTab and I LOVE it! I still have the OneTab icon/link on the top LEFT of my screen. Clicking that drops down a list of sites that I can load. But the identical icon/link that used to appear on the top RIGHT side of the screen is gone. I was able to click this when I was shutting down my system. Clicking it would close the open sites and put them in the list I can access on the left. (I told you I don't know the right names for things. Sorry!!!) I can't use OneTab without that right-side icon/link. I also lost the 1Password icon/link. How do I get these back? I still have the Pocket icon/link, the download arrow, the Firefox account icon, and the ""hamburger"" on the right, but I really want the OneTab and 1Password clickable icon/links. Simple instructions, please! Thank you! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",sajudy2
