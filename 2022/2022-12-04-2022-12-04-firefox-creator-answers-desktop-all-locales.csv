I installed Mozilla Firefox on my freshly installed Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS. I tried installing it from Snap Store. However, when I tried saving an image from the web (or, truthfully, any other file chosen by the ""Save As..."" selection), nothing happened, again and again. I tried many things, including following relevant guides from the internet, but nothing changed. The Firefox version is the 107.0.1 (64-bit), a Mozilla Firefox Snap for Ubuntu canonical-002- 1.0. I, also, have to report some other things, as well. When tried installing the browser from the internet (I downloaded a compressed file, containing the executable), the same function seemed to work. I, now, use the executable to access Firefox. However, firstly, because other difficulties (not problems, but difficulties) arise and, secondly, because I'd really like ti use, mostly, snaps, I report this bug here requesting for help, as well. </p><p>Any helpful answer will be appreciated! </p><p>Thank you! </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;ubuntu;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1552059;,louismys

I have been streaming the video feed from a .tv site for several years (I like to chat and discuss episodes with other watchers). Last night, the feed wouldn't load; I thought this may have been some slowness in my internet connection, so I shut my Windows laptop down and went to bed. I got up this morning and logged in, and the feed was doing the same thing (loading bar; three dots cycling over and over).  I checked if there were any new updates for Firefox (there were not), and likewise any changes to the Windows codecs (all files are current). The rest of the browser (other open tabs) are working normally. Cleared the cache - same result. The feed was playing normally for the other site viewers, as I could see them commenting on the episodes that were currently playing. I then checked if I could access the .tv site via a different browser (MS Edge...ugh); and the site loaded and played normally. I checked it on my phone's browser; site played like it usually does. Hmmm... I then opened Firefox Private Browsing, typed in the site... and it's playing normally. Still nothing on my usual browser.

I have just updated my Firefox browser to 107.0.1 (64 Bit) and i now find i have this box Developer Tool Error at the bottom of the page just above the taskbar. I also have a transparent red film comes over the whole screen.  The screen also jumps when trying to do a search on the website. If i try this on Opera ,MS Explorer or Edge this does not happen. I have deleted the whole Fire Fox program and reinstalled it but no difference. Please understand i am a senior and my knowledge is limited so i hope this info is enough. Thank you in-advance.

THIS IS GOING TO DRIVE ME INSANE. I have to adjust my volume when unpausing something because it's too quiet, but then I have to adjust it AGAIN because after it unfades, it's too loud. I KNOW THIS IS PROBABLY A FEATURE, but I don't care. I only have this problem with Firefox, so if there's no solution I'll probably switch back to Google Chrome. I JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW TO DISABLE THIS, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE about:config, AND IT'S NOT IN SETTINGS. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1070;,firefox,other,en-US,1551924;1551934;,SomeGuyNamedPhoenix
