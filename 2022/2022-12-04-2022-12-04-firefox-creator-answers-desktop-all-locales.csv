THIS IS GOING TO DRIVE ME INSANE. I have to adjust my volume when unpausing something because it's too quiet, but then I have to adjust it AGAIN because after it unfades, it's too loud. I KNOW THIS IS PROBABLY A FEATURE, but I don't care. I only have this problem with Firefox, so if there's no solution I'll probably switch back to Google Chrome. I JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW TO DISABLE THIS, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE about:config, AND IT'S NOT IN SETTINGS. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1070;,firefox,other,en-US,"",SomeGuyNamedPhoenix

I am sire this is a Firefox problem - I have successfully watched videos using BING browser - same videos go black on Firefox.  I have refreshed Firefox, cleared cache, restarted Firefox - cleaned cookies.  Turned accelerator off then back on - because nothing changed.  Does not do this with all videos, just some - some You Tube videos play, others do not.
