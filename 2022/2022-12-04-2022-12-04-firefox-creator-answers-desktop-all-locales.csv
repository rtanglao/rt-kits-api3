I have just updated my Firefox browser to 107.0.1 (64 Bit) and i now find i have this box Developer Tool Error at the bottom of the page just above the taskbar. I also have a transparent red film comes over the whole screen.  The screen also jumps when trying to do a search on the website. If i try this on Opera ,MS Explorer or Edge this does not happen. I have deleted the whole Fire Fox program and reinstalled it but no difference. Please understand i am a senior and my knowledge is limited so i hope this info is enough. Thank you in-advance.

THIS IS GOING TO DRIVE ME INSANE. I have to adjust my volume when unpausing something because it's too quiet, but then I have to adjust it AGAIN because after it unfades, it's too loud. I KNOW THIS IS PROBABLY A FEATURE, but I don't care. I only have this problem with Firefox, so if there's no solution I'll probably switch back to Google Chrome. I JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW TO DISABLE THIS, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE about:config, AND IT'S NOT IN SETTINGS. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1070;,firefox,other,en-US,1551924;,SomeGuyNamedPhoenix
