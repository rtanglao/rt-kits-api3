I've tried several remedies suggested online after doing Google and Bing searches, but nothing that involved registry changes.  The one thing that helped, if only partially and temporarily, was clearing out recent history, cookies and cache. (BTW, a cache-clearing extension I've used for years appears to not be doing anything.)   Emails that arrived for two or three days after that displayed images. Then, no more. </p><pre>Side effects of all that clearing out was several days of having to go through two-factor authentication on many sites and being bombarded with warning emails that someone logged in with my credentials, was that really me?  And, that last part kept happening on different devices I use regularly. </pre> <p>I have no such problem with Hotmail email using MS Edge or the Chrome browser. I have no such problem using Firefox with Gmail or Yahoo mail. I've used Firefox for many years and want to go on using it, but more and more I'm using one of the other browsers so I can see images in emails.  It appears Firefox has a long history of this type of problem.  </p><p>Any help will be appreciated. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1520695;1520715;,s__anderson

If I copy text or images and attempt to paste them into any website using Firefox, the paste does not work. Text will look like it is pasting an image, but there is some shadowy text behind it.

The image pastes far too large and will disappear when clicking into the field where it is pasted. </p><p>This renders Firefox effectively non-functional for anything I need to do. I will have to use a different browser unless/until this is fixed. </p><p>I have rebooted. I have cleared cache and cookies.
