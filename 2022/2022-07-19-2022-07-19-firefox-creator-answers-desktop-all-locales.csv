If I copy text or images and attempt to paste them into any website using Firefox, the paste does not work. Text will look like it is pasting an image, but there is some shadowy text behind it. When I click into the field where I pasted, the text/image that was pasted will disappear. </p><p>Pasting images is similar. The image pastes far too large and will disappear when clicking into the field where it is pasted. </p><p>This renders Firefox effectively non-functional for anything I need to do. I will have to use a different browser unless/until this is fixed. </p><p>I have rebooted. I have cleared cache and cookies. I REALLY don't want to reset and have to set up extensions again since this includes password managers, etc. I attempted to set dom.event.clipboardevents.enabled with no change. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1520672;,sifuedition
