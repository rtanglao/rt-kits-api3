This does not happen with all bookmarks, but only with some (like 7/8, always those one) that keep spamming up indefatigably despite the fact that I have just deleted them: as far as i can tell it could be a synchronization problem, but i don't have the foggiest idea on where to start to solve it. It is a very annoying and frustrating bug! I kindly ask if anyone can help me, provided that I am no expert in informatics, so step-by-step instructions for the problem resolution would be much appreciated! &lt;3 Thanks a lot in advance, too bad for this annoying problem which is the only one I have ever encountered on Firefox. Otherwise, Firefox has always gone great and I have always been very comfortable with it. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1000;,firefox,bookmarks,it,"",alessandrocavazzuti

Questo non succede con tutti i segnalibri, ma solo con alcuni (tipo 5/6, sempre quelli) che si ripresentano comunque indefessi nonostante io li abbia appena eliminati: potrebbe essere un problema di sincronizzazione, ma piu di così non saprei spingermi. La cosa è parecchio seccante e frustrante, chiedo gentilmente se qualcuno può aiutarmi, premesso che non sono un gran esperto (anzi, non lo sono proprio!) di informatica, quindi sarebbero molto apprezzate istruzioni per la risoluzione passo a passo! &lt;3 Grazie mille in anticipo, peccato per questo fastidioso problema che è l'unico che abbia mai riscontrato su Firefox, che altrimenti è sempre andato alla grande e con cui mi sono trovato sempre molto bene. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1000;,firefox,bookmarks,it,1503942;,alessandrocavazzuti

Additionally the numbers have also suffered and are now not presented in a normal font anymore but instead seem bigger and grey instead of white or black. Both of these issues occurred at the same time and appear on the normal User Interface of Firefox (e.g. in the bookmarks or in Firefox's settings and preferences) as well as on some websites/search engines. However when copying the text and numbers from Firefox into a regular text editor everything seems normal and no appearance issues can be noticed. What I've already tried: I've restarted my system multiple times since the issue first occurred. I've removed all contents from /home/user/.mozilla/firefox. I've reinstalled Firefox. I've deleted my cache. I've changed my font preferences in Firefox back to Default(Roboto) after having used Inter before. None of my actions above have changed anything. However, when I log into a different user on my computer and open Firefox there everything seems to be normal, so it seems as if this is a user-specific problem. </p><p>Thanks in advance, Emma. </p><p>OS: opensuseTumbleweed 20220507 Firefox version: 100.0 (issue has occurred since version 98.0) </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1000;,firefox,other,en-US,"",emma.6.62607015e-34

Once I click on the login button it takes me to a page where it asks for my email. Here's where I hit the issue: FireFox Password Manager does not fill this in for me; not even the auto-fill works here. After I enter my email it then takes me to a page where my password is filled in (yay!). I'm glad that it at least fills in the password but I'd like to not have to fill in my email on the previous page. </p><p>I tried to create a new entry in Password Manager but it won't take the entire url; it shortens it. This url changes each time I go thru the process which complicates everything. I was hoping to take one of those urls (<a href=""https://secure-oldnavy.gap.com/my-account/sign-in?flowId=wJb1e"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure-oldnavy.gap.com/my-account/sign-in?flowId=wJb1e</a>) but it shortened it to just (<a href=""https://secure-oldnavy.gap.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure-oldnavy.gap.com</a>). I even tried creating a new entry without the last few characters (<a href=""https://secure-oldnavy.gap.com/my-account/sign-in?flowId="" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure-oldnavy.gap.com/my-account/sign-in?flowId=</a>) but again it shortened it. </p><p>Is there a way to get FF Password Manager to provide auto-fill of my email address? </p><p>Thanks,  Andre'a </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;hardquestion;passwordmanager;firefox-1000;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1503842;,DreaSpirit
