Once I click on the login button it takes me to a page where it asks for my email. Here's where I hit the issue: FireFox Password Manager does not fill this in for me; not even the auto-fill works here. After I enter my email it then takes me to a page where my password is filled in (yay!). I'm glad that it at least fills in the password but I'd like to not have to fill in my email on the previous page. </p><p>I tried to create a new entry in Password Manager but it won't take the entire url; it shortens it. This url changes each time I go thru the process which complicates everything. I was hoping to take one of those urls (<a href=""https://secure-oldnavy.gap.com/my-account/sign-in?flowId=wJb1e"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure-oldnavy.gap.com/my-account/sign-in?flowId=wJb1e</a>) but it shortened it to just (<a href=""https://secure-oldnavy.gap.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure-oldnavy.gap.com</a>). I even tried creating a new entry without the last few characters (<a href=""https://secure-oldnavy.gap.com/my-account/sign-in?flowId="" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure-oldnavy.gap.com/my-account/sign-in?flowId=</a>) but again it shortened it. </p><p>Is there a way to get FF Password Manager to provide auto-fill of my email address? </p><p>Thanks,  Andre'a </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1000;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",DreaSpirit
