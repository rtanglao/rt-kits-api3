So for example, if I found a newsource that I wanted to bookmark to my News folder I would click on Bookmarks, Bookmark Current Tab and a dialogue box popped up that allowed me to choose the folder to save the bookmark to. This dialogue box no longer opens when I click on Bookmark Current Tab. Instead, all bookmarks are automatically saved to my Other Bookmarks folder and I have to drag them to the folder I want. I'm not exactly sure if this change happened with a Firefox update, or if I did something to change the process. Is there a way that I can fix this and have the choose a folder dialogue box pop up when I save a folder? Thanks for your help, Jeff </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1000;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1503899;1503916;,jjcdennis
