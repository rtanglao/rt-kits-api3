There is no way to make the playback full screen or access any of the other play settings. Im on Windows 10 Home version 21H2. I tried using Chrome to access Prime, and the playback overlay works as normal, so the problem is not with Amazon,  but with Firefox. Please fix. </p><p>And I did try clearing the browser cache and logging out/in to Amazon - before anyone wastes time recommending those attempts to fix this. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1060;firefox-10601;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",darweb2

So as recommended, I tried to create a new account with another e-mail because of this mishap. However, that second e-mail address was apparently associated with the primary Mozilla account, because I receive a prompt that I must ""sign in using the primary account"" when I try to create the account using the second e-mail . Is there a way to disassociate the secondary e-mail from the primary account so I don't have to create a 3rd e-mail address for a new account? </p><p>Thank you </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1060;firefox-10601;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",4mnmnms

Whenever I try to click Recently Closed Windows in particular, it just does nothing. It has the grey highlighted bar that shows it wants to do something, but then does nothing. About 1 out of 100 times when i click Recently Closed Tabs, it WILL open to show my recently closed tabs, but generally does the same thing as Recently Closed Windows. I know I have recently closed tabs because I restored session and it is currently showing all my old tabs I had open prior to the update. I also tested to see if my recently closed had just reset by opening a new window and closing it, but it still just does nothing. I use the Recently Closed Windows quite a bit and it's quite irritating that it appears to be broken. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1543596;1543601;,illyasviel101
