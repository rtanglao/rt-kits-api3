When I launch a course in Litmos in the Firefox browser and then exit the course before it is completed, the course is being marked as completed. When I launch the course again it does not pick up where it left off, the course starts over. I am wanting to convert back to an older version of Firefox to see if this resolves my issue, but I am not able to figure out how to do this.  </p><p>Will you please tell me if this is a possibility or if there was something in the recent Firefox updates that would be causing this reporting issue within my course.
