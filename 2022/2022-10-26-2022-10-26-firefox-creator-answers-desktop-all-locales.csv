After a couple crashes I was given an option to 'refresh' firefox after sending some data to mozilla, which I took. I did not, however, realize that this would completely wipe any and all records of my session at the time, and now do need said session back quite badly. I have already tried going to about:sessionrestore and looking for a sessionrestore.json file to no avail. Is there any way I can recover my tabs (whether from a folder in my firefox profile, a possible automatic backup upon refresh, or, while unlikely, the data I sent to mozilla)? </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10601;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",adishpan
