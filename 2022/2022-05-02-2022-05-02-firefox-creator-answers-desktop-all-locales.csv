I am attaching an image of a page containing a file named ""Abadia"" (first one on the left, just under ""A"") which is unused.   I also am attaching an empty ""Creating Abadia"" which is the result of clicking on ""Abadia"". </p><p>Please tell me how to change the image of an unused, empty file.   I recall that there were two different choices SOMEWHERE in the system, ""Always"" and ""Never"" I think:  One of them forces a system-level color pattern which includes reddish unused items; the other allows the used to program arbitrary displays such as the above (typical example from the dconf editor is 'bg_color: #f0f1f2; selected_bg_color: #023C88', but this editor does not change the appearance of a file instance. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-980;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",jwill1000000

I use McAfee anti-virus with their firewall. McAfee whitelists Firefox but I removed it from the whitelist and then put it back. I've tried uninstalling and re-installing with no change.

Also I have tried to open my Citibank account (<a href=""http://Citibank.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">Citibank.com.au</a>) but it comes up with an error and wont open, yet it does with Chrome.  I would rather not use Chrome, but I  may not have a choice if this problem is not addressed. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,websites,en-US,1501735;,edmundr1
