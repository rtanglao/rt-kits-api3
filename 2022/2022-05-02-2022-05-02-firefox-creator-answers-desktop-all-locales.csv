Il problema si manifesta solo con Firefox per Windows (no con altri browser o con Firefox per Android). Non ho rilevato la presenza di virus e/o malware: puo' dipendere da qualche aggiornamento recente di Windows o qualche impostazione di Firefox da cambiare ? Grazie, Stefano </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,websites,it,"",polonio2021

Then if I click again, a bit higher, I can type into the actual field.  </p><p>I have never seen this before but it happens on ALL websites. It is a bit frustrating having to re-click all the time.

For some reason, I am unable to upload or attach files on any website. This includes things like adding attachments to Gmail messages, uploading photos to Facebook, or uploading media to my Wordpress site. There is no error message or pop-up box -- when I click ""attach"" or ""upload"" absolutely nothing happens. </p><p>The same files upload without issue via Safari or by using Firefox on my older Macbook, so it's not a file-specific or website-specific issue. </p><p>How can I correct this? I like using Firefox as my default browser, and it's annoying to have to switch over to Safari every time I want to upload a file. I've searched older posts here, but the suggested fixes (restarting your computer, making sure location services are enabled) do not do anything. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-990;,firefox,other,en-US,"",rebeccadfrey
