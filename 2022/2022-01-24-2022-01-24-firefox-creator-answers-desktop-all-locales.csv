I followed instructions in Mozilla support forums to customize the tool bar settings and reset default settings as instructed and even said ""Abbra cadabra"" and just like a bad magic trick nothing changed. I have uninstalled them and reinstalled them after rebooting except for AVD which FireFox no longer offers as an Addon extension ??? I read an article written by a volunteer to another person asking for help with these exact problems that started exactly after the version96.0 update , the person asked where to get the older version 95.0 back because all these features work in that version and the volunteer made a complete fool and liar out of himself saying that going back to older versions rarely solved the issues and that the new update had absolutely nothing to do with causing these issues. So either I also am mentally ill and imagining all these issues or that volunteer needs to apologize to the lady and print a retraction. The only thing that changed on my system was from version 95.0 to 96.0 nothing else and I checked with HP support assistant that came factory installed when I bought this laptop from HP direct 8 months ago as well as Microsoft and McAfee my antivirus protection and was given a clean bill of health from all 3. I uninstalled 96.0 and reinstalled 94.0 and can once again right click copy &amp; paste and reinstalled all those apps direct from FireFox Addons browser page and they all show to be on and working but they are not working and I cannot get them back on the tool bar. Is there anyone that can help me solve this issue? I'm a carpenter and have zero tech skills like you people and have asked at least 100 people over the last 3 or 4 years if there is a computer training class or something I can take to try to learn things like you people know and not one person has ever told me how or where I could get the training? So I guess I have 2 questions and please someone help me fix the issues and tell me where I can get the education to hopefully never be a pain in your you know where again? Thank you very much have a wonderful week &amp; blessings to you and all you love Sincerely  PS. I am not technologically able to do the troubleshooting process to send the data I have spent 30 minutes trying to understand all this sorry </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-940;firefox-9402;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",1ARICHARDhead

When I paste what I've written in my word processor (LibreOffice)  the text I paste will not change to  the text style I have preset in the text field for my eBay listing. If I were doing this in another word processor I would be able to use a Paste Special command so that the text I'm pasting would automatically change to fit the text style already in use in the document.  </p><p>Does Firefox not support this ????

For the past 3 days, my browser has started to show in some websites a weird red window (kinda reminds me of the youtube logo with inverted colors!). I've already tried 4 antiviruses, 3 antimalware, and I've tried reinstalling the browser cleanly but the issue keeps happening.  The other browsers (Chrome, Opera, Edge) are working just fine.  The issue happens only on some websites and not at all of them.  What should I do now? Thank you! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1477448;,ligiaflg
