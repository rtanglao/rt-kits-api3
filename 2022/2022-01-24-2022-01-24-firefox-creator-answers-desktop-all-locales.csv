I have uninstalled them and reinstalled them after rebooting except for AVD which FireFox no longer offers as an Addon extension ??? I read an article written by a volunteer to another person asking for help with these exact problems that started exactly after the version96.0 update , the person asked where to get the older version 95.0 back because all these features work in that version and the volunteer made a complete fool and liar out of himself saying that going back to older versions rarely solved the issues and that the new update had absolutely nothing to do with causing these issues. So either I also am mentally ill and imagining all these issues or that volunteer needs to apologize to the lady and print a retraction. The only thing that changed on my system was from version 95.0 to 96.0 nothing else and I checked with HP support assistant that came factory installed when I bought this laptop from HP direct 8 months ago as well as Microsoft and McAfee my antivirus protection and was given a clean bill of health from all 3. I uninstalled 96.0 and reinstalled 94.0 and can once again right click copy &amp; paste and reinstalled all those apps direct from FireFox Addons browser page and they all show to be on and working but they are not working and I cannot get them back on the tool bar.

He intentado hacer lo que indican en una de las preguntas de la guìa; Ir a temas y desactivar automático y seleccionar claro, pero no me aparece en ninguna parte la opción de seleccionar tema!!! Solo hay opcion de habilitar o deshabilitar tema, no está la posibilidad de seleccionar tema claro, osucuro o automàtico!! Necesito ayuda por favor! No pude tomar una captura de pantalla, no me lo permite en la pantall Temas, pero mando una foto para que vean que no aparece la opciòn de elegir el tema. Desde ya muchas gracias! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,customize,es,1477484;1477610;,contactonodisponible
