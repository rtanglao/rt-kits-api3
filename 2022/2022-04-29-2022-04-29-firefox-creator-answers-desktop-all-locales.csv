However the problem now is, this whole feature is gone JUST for FIREFOX. I tried checking on Opera, Edge and Chrome, all works fine. Only on Firefox this is gone. So now I have to rely on my android device to attend this calls which is too much problematic as I mainly work on a PC. Can someone please find me a troubleshoot to this problem?

It seems that, even though I am already logged in on my old computer and have full access to my account (including saved passwords, bookmarks, and browsing history) I can't find a way to reset my password without deleting all of my synced data. From the ""Change Password"" menu, it requires my old password if I want to change it without deleting everything. Also, I have 2FA enabled, so why isn't there the option to authenticate my identity in a password reset using 2FA instead of my old password? I know a similar thing already exists for recovery keys, but I only have 2FA. Is there any way for me to reset my password where I don't lose everything?
