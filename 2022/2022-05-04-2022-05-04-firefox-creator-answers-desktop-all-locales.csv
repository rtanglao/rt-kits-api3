Thankfully, all my tabs and passwords are synced with Firefox Sync, but alas, I don't remember my password. So I pulled an old laptop I hadn't touched in a couple years, it was still logged in to Firefox Sync -- I could see all my tabs and passwords there. But the password for Firefox Sync itself? Out of date, turns out it's wrong (must've changed it at some point and not updated.) </p><p>So now I'm forced to, eventually, reset my password. What to do? Well, it says it will clear all my data (passwords, tabs, etc.) At the same time, since I'm *already logged in* and can view all the data, I'm hoping it would just stay here locally when it gets wiped server-side, and then I could re-sync my tabs and passwords in. Does this work this way? </p><p>tl;dr if I'm already logged into Firefox Sync, and reset the password, will I still lose everything? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-760;firefox-7601;,firefox,sync,en-US,1502278;,timeroot.alex

The problem seems to occur when an image is split between one page and the next.  I've attached two small images of the top of the page as displayed in Firefox and the print preview for that page.  The page has two buttons (""Map It"" and ""add to Apple Wallet"") that are forced off of page one but do not appear on page two.  Page two prints as shown -- blank with only header and footer lines -- and the information that should be on page two (including any text) is omitted.   I've had the same issue for several years. This includes several Firefox versions, several printer manufacturers (Cannon, Epsom, and HP), and a number of OS updates.  I am absurdly loyal to Firefox (dunno why) but I keep having to switch to Edge whenever I need to print a complex web page.
