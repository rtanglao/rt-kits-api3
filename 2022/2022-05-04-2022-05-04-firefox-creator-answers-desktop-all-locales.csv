In the last version of 99, it started working again (and I was very happy). My browser just updated to 100 and it stopped working again (and, of course, Firefox recommends not downgrading).  </p><p>This is getting very frustrating, as I use Firefox at work and it is actually a lot of time wasted, going in and attaching files without drag and drop. I am on the verge of abandoning Firefox as my browser, since these features work in both Safari and Chrome. However, I do like the usability and security of Firefox, so I am hoping you can fix this very soon. </p><p>-Chris </p>",desktop;beta;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1010;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",cmartell

Out of date, turns out it's wrong (must've changed it at some point and not updated.) </p><p>So now I'm forced to, eventually, reset my password. What to do? Well, it says it will clear all my data (passwords, tabs, etc.) At the same time, since I'm *already logged in* and can view all the data, I'm hoping it would just stay here locally when it gets wiped server-side, and then I could re-sync my tabs and passwords in.
