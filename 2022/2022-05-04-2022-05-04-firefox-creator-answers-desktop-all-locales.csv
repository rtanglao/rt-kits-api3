The problem seems to occur when an image is split between one page and the next.  I've attached two small images of the top of the page as displayed in Firefox and the print preview for that page.  The page has two buttons (""Map It"" and ""add to Apple Wallet"") that are forced off of page one but do not appear on page two.  Page two prints as shown -- blank with only header and footer lines -- and the information that should be on page two (including any text) is omitted.   I've had the same issue for several years. This includes several Firefox versions, several printer manufacturers (Cannon, Epsom, and HP), and a number of OS updates.  I am absurdly loyal to Firefox (dunno why) but I keep having to switch to Edge whenever I need to print a complex web page.  I keep hoping that the problem will be fixed. </p> <ul><li>Name 	Firefox </li></ul> <p>Version 	99.0.1 Build ID 	20220411174855 Running on Windows 10 print_printer	Canon G3060 series Update Channel 	release User Agent 	Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:99.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/99.0 OS 	Windows_NT 10.0 19043 </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1502265;,bigleehimself
