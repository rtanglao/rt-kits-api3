As long as I have had this computer, the same volume level has worked for music through Itunes, satellite radio and all videos that come through Firefox.  For example, 10 is the normal setting.  Recently, somehow the audio must be turned up to about 30 on all videos that come through Firefox from whatever source site.  The 10 setting stills works for all other audio sources.  I don't know how this happened, rebooting, turning system off, etc doesn't have any impact.  Is there some setting that either has changed or can be changed to restore the same volume levels for all input sources?
