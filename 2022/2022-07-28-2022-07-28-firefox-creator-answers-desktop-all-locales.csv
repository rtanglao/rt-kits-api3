I DO NOT want to see ""Firefox is installing updates"" splash screen when i try to launch the browser, i want this installed already hence what the background installer is suppose to be for. </p><p>When I launch Brave it NEVER asks me to update, nor do i see any screen that says installing updates, etc.. , yet it is always up to date. This is the behavior that I want in Firefox. I should not have to see a splash screen when i launch Firefox saying installing updates when I have it set to background updates which should be silent. So, Firefox will never be up to date unless someone opens it. </p><p>I have set install updates, when not running and use background service to install.  </p><p>I also changed the config IF needed for the following in about:config: user_pref(""app.update.langpack.enabled"", false); user_pref(""app.update.auto.migrated"", true); user_pref(""app.update.background.enabled"", true); </p><p>I completely installed nightly version for the first time to test out settings as it updates frequently and is using a new profile( FF profile that is). Yet this issue continues to happen where I see a splash screen, sometimes the browser launches, then closes, then that splash screen pops up saying that it is installing updates then the browser re-opens again. This is sloppy behavior and needs to be corrected  </p><p>What is the point of having a background installer if it does not work as a true background installer? </p><p>As I have stated This happens on three different machines and version versions of Firefox. I have not found anything for this as all my search results come up regarding installing Firefox silently from cmd, or enable auto updates. I want a completely silent update <em>similar</em> to how brave/chrome works. </p><p>Thank you for your time. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,other,en-US,1523120;,Carm

I tried to take ownership of that file but it didn't solve the issue I tried to disable my AV program, but it didn't do anything. On my laptop, I tried to refresh FF, no help. I tried to start FF in safe mode, same problem. I created new profile, same issue. Eventually, I totally uninstalled FF, removing program itself, removing Appdata folder and even registry entry. Installed fresh copy of FF, same problem exists. Then, I noticed one thing. When I tried to sync fresh FF installation on my laptop, it synced everything, EXCEPT for addons. So, something is preventing me doing anything regarding addons. Themes install just fine.

I tried importing the json file but it says it fails to read. Followed by some googling I found that the problem lies with the fact that session buddy files don't have several tags in current tabs in the json file so importing fails. Like mentioned here  <a href=""https://github.com/sienori/Tab-Session-Manager/issues/408#:~:text=Close%20Chrome%20and%20Open%20Firefox,%2C%20and%20click%20%22Open%22"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sienori/Tab-Session-Manager/issues/408#:~:text=Close%20Chrome%20and%20Open%20Firefox,%2C%20and%20click%20%22Open%22</a>.

Everything copies fine using Chrome, but Firefox is my default browser and I'd prefer not to have to switch for this problem.  The other weird thing about the copy is that the column names (listed above) do copy just fine--all four of them, but only the data for the last three columns gets copied for pasting into spreadsheet.
