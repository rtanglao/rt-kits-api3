Yet, FF autoloads the previous session, anyway, after about 45 to 60 seconds. </p><p>Put another way, FF does not follow my instructions for the item left clear in Settings. </p><p>In the typical FF startup, immediately after loading FF, the screen is empty of tabs provided by the application I normally use, named Tree Style Tabs. The screen should stay that way until I decide to load the previous session. On checking the FF top menu, I find Restore Previous Session is in BOLD, which means the previous session can be restored at my discretion. That is the way I prefer FF to operate. </p><p>Yet, 45-60 seconds later after FF startup, the FF screen flashes, and the previous session loads. When I check the top menu, the Load Previous Session item is no longer in boldface type.  </p><p>As a test, I cleared the stack of tabs by closing each tab except one, and restarted FF. As usual, the single tab auto-loaded 45-60 seconds after starting FF. Under Settings, the Load Previous Session item was no longer in boldface type (since it had loaded, already). </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-1030;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",alphaa10000

I have done this without any problems in the past so something has changed recently.  I did contact cybergrants and they say it's a browser problem and they can't help.  Everything copies fine using Chrome, but Firefox is my default browser and I'd prefer not to have to switch for this problem.  The other weird thing about the copy is that the column names (listed above) do copy just fine--all four of them, but only the data for the last three columns gets copied for pasting into spreadsheet.  Please let me know a solution to this--thanks! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,other,en-US,"",mhb725

Opened it up today and my Mozilla browser has changed and it's enlarged!  And each and every page I go on is enlarged.  NO matter how many times I have shut down and turned back on it's the same.  Even if I reduce the page by holding the - control to shrink the page it happens when I reopen that page again or another page.  What can I do???  WTF is goin' on???  And why the *uck isn't there a toll free # to call for technical support!!!!   + ALL my side extensions are gone off my task bar!!!!!

I have actually tried installing them on MS Edge and they work but when I add them to Firefox it fails. I have used Firefox for about twenty years but this seems to be an ongoing problem. I even looked at doing this manually but that looked daunting. Included is a screen shot showing two that have not worked and have been tried several times. </p>,desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",ed.lowrey
