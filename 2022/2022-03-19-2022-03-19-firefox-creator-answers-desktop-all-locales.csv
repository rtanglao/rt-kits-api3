Now upon clicking on a link that leads to a PDF file, Firefox prompts me to open it or save it. However, if I choose to open it, the file gets saved in the Downloads folder, rather than Temp folder like previously. The result is that the Downloads folder gets filled with files that I have opened but did not want to save and keep. </p><p>I created a new Firefox profile to see whether the previous list of content types would return.

This however has one major drawback: the accumulation of all the settings and changes over the years! I explain this below. </p><p>I have noticed that my browser is not performing as intended, i.e. a lot of browsing especially in pages like Google Maps is very slow, some images and videos are covered by some distorted image, other objects are not loading at all, and the list goes on. Now, I know that most of you will say that this may be because of add-ons. I really wish it was. </p><p>I performed the following tests: 1. I created a new profile from about:profiles and loaded it. It was just a bare Firefox with nothing else on it. I was blown away by how everything worked so fast and smoothly. Literally, even Google maps was smoother than it was on Chrome. 2. I started adding my add-ons, etc. Nothing changed, even when they were all added. Everything worked perfectly. 3. I went back to my ""broken"" Firefox and started changing everything in Settings to match the new profile: especially under Privacy &amp; Security. Still the same issues. 4. Once, on the new Profile, I logged in to sync with my Firefox account so I can pull in my bookmarks, etc. the new profile became ""broken"" too. </p><p>This leaves me with one conclusion. The broken part is deeper in the Firefox settings. Keep in mind that as a long time user of Firefox this is the accumulation of a lot of settings over all these years (including a few changed settings in the about:config page.) </p><p>My question now is, how do I reset my about:config changes and anything else related without having to lose my sync? (because if I do and then I re-sync then all those changes come back again.) </p><p>Ultimately that is what I think is the solution is: to reset the Settings and about:config settings (and any other related ones) without affecting anything else so that they will be pulled up to the sync server (hence why I need to remain logged into my account) and pushed onto my other Firefox browsers. </p><p>Correct me if I am wrong here or if you have any other solutions. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",gcyborg

These previously worked fine. I then used the same address on MS Edge and I get to the site and the the page I wish to be on. I have to admit that this did not happen prior to my installing MS Edge. Interstingly, the two websites I found this happening had to do with approaching Photo-Voltaic websites, one being FoxESS (Chinese Equipment Manufacturer's data logging facility) and the other being SMA (a German similar Manufacturer's data logging facility). I think this has nothing to do with the sector they represent but is a reaction of my Windows 10 system having another program from MS that wishes to dominate their opposition's performance. (Is this me being paranoid?).   </p><p>The first one to do this, was when I approached ""<a href=""https://www.foxesscloud.com/bus/device/inverter"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.foxesscloud.com/bus/device/inverter</a>"" and the second one was ""<a href=""https://www.sunnyportal.com/FixedPages/HoManEnergyRedesign.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sunnyportal.com/FixedPages/HoManEnergyRedesign.aspx</a>"" These require 'logins' when you get there. I would be happy to pass these on to you if it is necessary. </p><p>I have endeavoured to get away from MS from time to time, but it does not seem to be a simple exercise. So I tend to go with the flow that works.  </p><p>By the bye, I use system cleaning software regularly (Glary Utilities 5, MalwareBytes) and some others occasionally and all seem to say they get rid of 'trackers' and and 'malware'). I also use Kaspersky for internet protection and that seems to work well. So my system seems 'clean', but whether MS has buried something somewhere I cannot assess. As it is only affecting a couple of sites, I think I may be experiencing something quite different. Any ideas?  Thanks. </p><p>Mike Potter email: mikejpotter@mail.com </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9801;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",mikejpotter

Files are now automatically saved to 'Downloads' or can be saved to another folder. This enforced change has caused much grief to many Firefox users judging by comments already made in numerous forums. It appears some Firefox 'brainstormers' created this change to 'benefit' users and to prevent data loss etc. Well, this user and many others strongly disagree and hope that Firefox will reconsider their decision or at least offer some alternative or option to 'just open' a file without saving it. I have, for now, installed an old Firefox version (96.0) to recover the old option menu to open or save files. However, if Firefox persist with this change, without offering a 'open only' option, I and many other users will be forced to switch to other browsers, e.g. Microsoft Edge, which do offer that option. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-960;v98-download;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",kuya7447

I then used the version available on the Microsoft Store, which worked fine. Eventually, Firefox crashed and would not reopen. A message saying something along the lines of ""Are you sure you want to start Firefox in safe mode?"" would appear for a split second, and then close. I tried: </p><p>-Starting Firefox in safe mode, but nothing happened. -Restarting my computer. -Reinstalling Firefox. -Running as administrator. -Checking it is not blocked by antivirus. -Using the profile manager to create a new profile: The .zip file version opens but does not help, and the version opened by using the ""firefox.exe -P"" command in Run suffers from the same problem as the browser and opens for only a split second. -Attempting to boot my computer in safe mode with networking, however, the Microsoft Store listed Firefox as uninstalled, and the network menu would not display any networks so I could not reinstall it. -Searching for any Comodo iseguard.dll files, but I found none. </p><p>The only thing that worked was searching ""Mozilla"" in files and deleting everything except what my computer said was part of the system. After that, I was able to open Firefox, but after a short amount of time, the problem started all over. I have no clue what to do and looking all over for solutions is driving me nuts!
