I read online that this was because of a change in FireFox 98 from previous FireFox is this true and what do we users change in the config to get this working. I know that FireFox 97.0.2 when I reimaged the system file that this verison works for torrent files and redirects the correct torrent program to run and start the download process. So can anyone of the development or testing team explain why this change was made but not to inform users of FireFox of the reason behind this other then it's a security related. FireFox saving something or downloading from unsuspecting sites to user computer can be also a security issue.

This however has one major drawback: the accumulation of all the settings and changes over the years! I explain this below. </p><p>I have noticed that my browser is not performing as intended, i.e. a lot of browsing especially in pages like Google Maps is very slow, some images and videos are covered by some distorted image, other objects are not loading at all, and the list goes on. Now, I know that most of you will say that this may be because of add-ons. I really wish it was. </p><p>I performed the following tests: 1. I created a new profile from about:profiles and loaded it. It was just a bare Firefox with nothing else on it. I was blown away by how everything worked so fast and smoothly. Literally, even Google maps was smoother than it was on Chrome. 2. I started adding my add-ons, etc. Nothing changed, even when they were all added. Everything worked perfectly. 3. I went back to my ""broken"" Firefox and started changing everything in Settings to match the new profile: especially under Privacy &amp; Security. Still the same issues. 4. Once, on the new Profile, I logged in to sync with my Firefox account so I can pull in my bookmarks, etc. the new profile became ""broken"" too. </p><p>This leaves me with one conclusion. The broken part is deeper in the Firefox settings. Keep in mind that as a long time user of Firefox this is the accumulation of a lot of settings over all these years (including a few changed settings in the about:config page.) </p><p>My question now is, how do I reset my about:config changes and anything else related without having to lose my sync? (because if I do and then I re-sync then all those changes come back again.) </p><p>Ultimately that is what I think is the solution is: to reset the Settings and about:config settings (and any other related ones) without affecting anything else so that they will be pulled up to the sync server (hence why I need to remain logged into my account) and pushed onto my other Firefox browsers. </p><p>Correct me if I am wrong here or if you have any other solutions. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;,firefox,customize,en-US,1490789;,gcyborg

These previously worked fine. I then used the same address on MS Edge and I get to the site and the the page I wish to be on. I have to admit that this did not happen prior to my installing MS Edge. Interstingly, the two websites I found this happening had to do with approaching Photo-Voltaic websites, one being FoxESS (Chinese Equipment Manufacturer's data logging facility) and the other being SMA (a German similar Manufacturer's data logging facility). I think this has nothing to do with the sector they represent but is a reaction of my Windows 10 system having another program from MS that wishes to dominate their opposition's performance. (Is this me being paranoid?).   </p><p>The first one to do this, was when I approached ""<a href=""https://www.foxesscloud.com/bus/device/inverter"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.foxesscloud.com/bus/device/inverter</a>"" and the second one was ""<a href=""https://www.sunnyportal.com/FixedPages/HoManEnergyRedesign.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sunnyportal.com/FixedPages/HoManEnergyRedesign.aspx</a>"" These require 'logins' when you get there. I would be happy to pass these on to you if it is necessary. </p><p>I have endeavoured to get away from MS from time to time, but it does not seem to be a simple exercise. So I tend to go with the flow that works.  </p><p>By the bye, I use system cleaning software regularly (Glary Utilities 5, MalwareBytes) and some others occasionally and all seem to say they get rid of 'trackers' and and 'malware'). I also use Kaspersky for internet protection and that seems to work well. So my system seems 'clean', but whether MS has buried something somewhere I cannot assess. As it is only affecting a couple of sites, I think I may be experiencing something quite different. Any ideas?

I have, for now, installed an old Firefox version (96.0) to recover the old option menu to open or save files. However, if Firefox persist with this change, without offering a 'open only' option, I and many other users will be forced to switch to other browsers, e.g. Microsoft Edge, which do offer that option. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-960;v98-download;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",kuya7447
