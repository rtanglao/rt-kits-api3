Files are now automatically saved to 'Downloads' or can be saved to another folder. This enforced change has caused much grief to many Firefox users judging by comments already made in numerous forums. It appears some Firefox 'brainstormers' created this change to 'benefit' users and to prevent data loss etc. Well, this user and many others strongly disagree and hope that Firefox will reconsider their decision or at least offer some alternative or option to 'just open' a file without saving it. I have, for now, installed an old Firefox version (96.0) to recover the old option menu to open or save files. However, if Firefox persist with this change, without offering a 'open only' option, I and many other users will be forced to switch to other browsers, e.g. Microsoft Edge, which do offer that option. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",kuya7447
