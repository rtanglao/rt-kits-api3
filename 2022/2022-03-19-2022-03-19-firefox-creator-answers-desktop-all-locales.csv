On windows verything is working fine now, however as im getting into linux now, i want to customize Firefox there. </p><p>On windows basically what i had to do was searching for firefox.exe in the explorer then drag and drop my own custom firefox.cfg into that directory. Next step was to drag and drop the autoconfig.js into the prefs directory. </p><p>autoconfig.js C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\defaults\pref firefox.cfg C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox </p><p>After that i could simply start firefox with my own custom settings. </p><p>Now on Linux i am really struggling finding out what exactly i must do in order to use my own firefox cfg. To be honest, i was trying to find out what the equivalent to an exe from windows is in linux so that i could then navigate to the main firefox directory where the ""exe"" is located and do same as on windows, drag and drop my custom cfg there. </p><p>Im using a debian distribution of Linux (Kali) guessing firefox is installed here? /usr/lib/firefox-esr/firefox-esr </p><p>Anyways im lost, any help is welcome. </p><p>What directory or say what filetype instead of exe am i looking for? Do i drag and drop the firefox.cfg next to the main executable same as on windows or are the steps different from windows? And what about the autoconfig.js, where does it go? does it go anywhere? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Firefox_Beginner

At least I found the reason for my displeasure after reading about the new release of FF98. </p><p>Why did you change the protocol for saving files? Not having that dialog box pop up is very inconvenient. I haven't tried to play any files since FF 98 downloaded to my pc but I bet it's equally as annoying. Please go back to the old way in your next release. Some of us are in the camp of Who Moved My Cheese and we don't like this new change. It's bad enough that I have to deal with black background on menus etc due to the background I chose but this is nuts.

Quando eu clico em ""Ver Certificados..."" ele aparece certinho no Firefox... O problema está quando eu tento fazer o backup dele para o computador... Eu clico em ""Fazer backup de tudo..."", daí aparece aonde eu quero salvar, então eu dou um nome e clico em ""Salvar"" que me leva a uma janela pra eu criar uma senha pra esse arquivo... Acredito que seja uma senha qualquer, não aquela que eu criei na hora que comprei o certificado, então eu crio uma senha e dou ""OK""... Enfim aparece a mensagem: ""Falha ao criar o arquivo de backup PKCS #12 por motivos desconhecidos."" e não faz o backup. Alguém sabe o que é isso? Já passou por esse problema e sabe como resolver? </p><p>Obs¹: Eu possuo o anti-virus kaspersky, mas eu já tentei fazer o procedimento com ele desativado e mesmo assim não funcionou. Obs²: Eu já tentei executar o firefox como administrador e também não funcionou, mesmo com o Kaspersky desativado. Obs³: Eu também já tentei fazer pelo botão ""backup"" só do meu nome, sem ser o ""fazer backup de tudo..."" mas também não funcionou. </p><p>Obrigado! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9801;,firefox,privacy-and-security,pt-BR,"",c4amazon

I attempted to use the version downloaded from the internet, which I already had installed for a long time, but it would not open. I then used the version available on the Microsoft Store, which worked fine. Eventually, Firefox crashed and would not reopen.

I tried: </p><p>-Starting Firefox in safe mode, but nothing happened. -Restarting my computer. -Reinstalling Firefox. -Running as administrator. -Checking it is not blocked by antivirus. -Using the profile manager to create a new profile: The .zip file version opens but does not help, and the version opened by using the ""firefox.exe -P"" command in Run suffers from the same problem as the browser and opens for only a split second. -Attempting to boot my computer in safe mode with networking, however, the Microsoft Store listed Firefox as uninstalled, and the network menu would not display any networks so I could not reinstall it. -Searching for any Comodo iseguard.dll files, but I found none. </p><p>The only thing that worked was searching ""Mozilla"" in files and deleting everything except what my computer said was part of the system. After that, I was able to open Firefox, but after a short amount of time, the problem started all over. I have no clue what to do and looking all over for solutions is driving me nuts!
