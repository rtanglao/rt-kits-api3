At least I found the reason for my displeasure after reading about the new release of FF98. </p><p>Why did you change the protocol for saving files? Not having that dialog box pop up is very inconvenient. I haven't tried to play any files since FF 98 downloaded to my pc but I bet it's equally as annoying. Please go back to the old way in your next release. Some of us are in the camp of Who Moved My Cheese and we don't like this new change. It's bad enough that I have to deal with black background on menus etc due to the background I chose but this is nuts.

Quando eu clico em ""Ver Certificados..."" ele aparece certinho no Firefox... O problema está quando eu tento fazer o backup dele para o computador... Eu clico em ""Fazer backup de tudo..."", daí aparece aonde eu quero salvar, então eu dou um nome e clico em ""Salvar"" que me leva a uma janela pra eu criar uma senha pra esse arquivo... Acredito que seja uma senha qualquer, não aquela que eu criei na hora que comprei o certificado, então eu crio uma senha e dou ""OK""... Enfim aparece a mensagem: ""Falha ao criar o arquivo de backup PKCS #12 por motivos desconhecidos."" e não faz o backup. Alguém sabe o que é isso? Já passou por esse problema e sabe como resolver? </p><p>Obs¹: Eu possuo o anti-virus kaspersky, mas eu já tentei fazer o procedimento com ele desativado e mesmo assim não funcionou. Obs²: Eu já tentei executar o firefox como administrador e também não funcionou, mesmo com o Kaspersky desativado. Obs³: Eu também já tentei fazer pelo botão ""backup"" só do meu nome, sem ser o ""fazer backup de tudo..."" mas também não funcionou. </p><p>Obrigado! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9801;,firefox,privacy-and-security,pt-BR,"",c4amazon

However, once I click to log in and type my password the browser crashes and continues to do so after each attempt to restart it. </p><p>Curious as to why I have been launching the browser from the terminal and each time I see the same error messages when the browser crashes. </p><p>""Exiting due to channel error."" </p><p>Typically there are also GenerateDump messages as well. </p><p>The odd thing is I tried Firefox ESR (I believe the same version though I will double check that) on the normal Raspberry Pi OS and am not having the issue.

I attempted to use the version downloaded from the internet, which I already had installed for a long time, but it would not open. I then used the version available on the Microsoft Store, which worked fine. Eventually, Firefox crashed and would not reopen. A message saying something along the lines of ""Are you sure you want to start Firefox in safe mode?"" would appear for a split second, and then close. I tried: </p><p>-Starting Firefox in safe mode, but nothing happened. -Restarting my computer. -Reinstalling Firefox. -Running as administrator. -Checking it is not blocked by antivirus. -Using the profile manager to create a new profile: The .zip file version opens but does not help, and the version opened by using the ""firefox.exe -P"" command in Run suffers from the same problem as the browser and opens for only a split second. -Attempting to boot my computer in safe mode with networking, however, the Microsoft Store listed Firefox as uninstalled, and the network menu would not display any networks so I could not reinstall it. -Searching for any Comodo iseguard.dll files, but I found none. </p><p>The only thing that worked was searching ""Mozilla"" in files and deleting everything except what my computer said was part of the system. After that, I was able to open Firefox, but after a short amount of time, the problem started all over. I have no clue what to do and looking all over for solutions is driving me nuts!
