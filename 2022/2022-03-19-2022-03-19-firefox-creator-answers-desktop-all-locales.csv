I attempted to use the version downloaded from the internet, which I already had installed for a long time, but it would not open. I then used the version available on the Microsoft Store, which worked fine. Eventually, Firefox crashed and would not reopen. A message saying something along the lines of ""Are you sure you want to start Firefox in safe mode?"" would appear for a split second, and then close. I tried: </p><p>-Starting Firefox in safe mode, but nothing happened. -Restarting my computer. -Reinstalling Firefox. -Running as administrator. -Checking it is not blocked by antivirus. -Using the profile manager to create a new profile: The .zip file version opens but does not help, and the version opened by using the ""firefox.exe -P"" command in Run suffers from the same problem as the browser and opens for only a split second. -Attempting to boot my computer in safe mode with networking, however, the Microsoft Store listed Firefox as uninstalled, and the network menu would not display any networks so I could not reinstall it. -Searching for any Comodo iseguard.dll files, but I found none. </p><p>The only thing that worked was searching ""Mozilla"" in files and deleting everything except what my computer said was part of the system. After that, I was able to open Firefox, but after a short amount of time, the problem started all over. I have no clue what to do and looking all over for solutions is driving me nuts! Please help! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1490638;1490642;1490643;,jjbonehead
