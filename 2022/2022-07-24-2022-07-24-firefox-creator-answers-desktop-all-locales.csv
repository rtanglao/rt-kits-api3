Pár napja észleltem, hogy a firefox böngésző a a Facebook görgetése közben pár oldal gördítésekor beremeg, majd további gördítés esetén önállóan gördül a képernyő felfele. Vásároltam új egeret, azzal is. Kipróbáltam más böngészőt, ott nem tapasztaltam a jelenséget. Az önkényes gördülés csak a facebook HOME gomjának megnyomásakor szűnik meg, de pár perc után megint tapasztalom. HA billentyűzettel lapozok, akkor is ez a jelenség áll fenn.

Refreshing can sometimes fix it, making it that most dreaded of troubleshooting pains, an intermittent problem. Should be easier than most though, as this happens roughly about three times out of four, although sometimes I can have a bad run and refresh twenty times or more without being able to actually interact with anything as if I were logged in. And the occasional blog that the owner took advantage of advanced features to have a non-[user name].tumblr.com site, like for example <a href=""http://unpretty.space/"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a> simply refuse to see me as logged in at all. I PRESUME this is because the existing <a href=""http://tumblr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">tumblr.com</a> exceptions only cover some of the servers tumblr uses to authenticate logins, or something, but even when a blog is not letting me interact with stuff Firefox still says it detects 'no trackers known to Firefox'. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",foofmoonshot

The only way i can get firefox to run is if i use terminal to get into the firefox profile manager and then select the default profile and click start firefox.  Then it runs normally. However when i quit the application the only way i that i can reopen firefox is through the profile manager route.
