I do believe i have not changed any settings or downloaded any updates for anything. The only way i can get firefox to run is if i use terminal to get into the firefox profile manager and then select the default profile and click start firefox.  Then it runs normally. However when i quit the application the only way i that i can reopen firefox is through the profile manager route. Any ideas what i can do?? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",1957price
