Their updates seem to vary in effect. Most I use will not allow Firefox to enter the password. Some websites detect your browser and display the message that Firefox is not supported and some functions will not work. Other posts describe the functions that do not work for them. This is seemingly not unique as I was playing Wizard101 for four years with Wine under Linux and now I am unable to log into their game. I can log into their website, so my account is still active, but I do not have Windows or Mac operating systems to use even if I could figure out how to use a virtual machine. </p><p>The only solution I have is to use the Web 3.38.2 browser / WebKitGTK 2.36.4, but most other browsers should function properly. </p><p>Although I have been using Firefox as my favorite browser for more than two decades, it seems that Firefox is no longer supported. Even the <a href=""https://www.247freepoker.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.247freepoker.com/</a> game freezes after a few rounds. </p><p>There was a post that claimed a fix, but did not explain how to turn it on. I already checked my firewall settings and internet connectivity settings even though it did not seem to be the cause of the problem. </p>",linux;desktop;website-breakages;firefox-91120;firefox-9112;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",guest26118280

Never have a problem with Microsoft Edge.  If a fix cannot be made without jumping through a lot of hoops and steps, I will have to stop using Firefox.  Fix this mess.  This problem has been around now for some time.  Get it fix or accept other users switching to other browsers that seem to have no problem at all getting to and using YouTube.  Very Frustrating. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mike.keller517
