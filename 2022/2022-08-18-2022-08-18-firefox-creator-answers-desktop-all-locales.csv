Never have a problem with Microsoft Edge.  If a fix cannot be made without jumping through a lot of hoops and steps, I will have to stop using Firefox.  Fix this mess.  This problem has been around now for some time.  Get it fix or accept other users switching to other browsers that seem to have no problem at all getting to and using YouTube.  Very Frustrating. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mike.keller517

A dialog came up and before I could read it and choose to cancel, the installation began. Took at least 16 minutes. I had checked ""check for updates but let me choose to install"", but it didn't give me a chance to decline. According to the web, the suggestion is choose ""Never check for updates"", but that choice is not there. I don't want ANY kind of auto update or auto install. Please don't suggest I program anything, thanks. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,other,en-US,1527788;,larryfj2
