It would not work with my windows 7.  By the time I got it fixed I had lost ALL my bookmarks, history, etc.  Now you are offering the latest download, I believe it is July.  I am afraid to download it for fear I might lose all my bookmarks again.  Can I just ignore the download.  I DO NOT want to go to Windows 10 or 11.  I am 95 years old and I like to stick to what I know.  What is the situation with you and Windows 7 at this time?  Are you no longer offering it?  Thanks for your help.  You may e-mail me at memawplus@gmail.com  PS  Even though I supposedly had backed up my bookmarks they would not download to the newest Firefox.  I have had Firefox since Firefox 1.0 (October 2004).

About the desktops can then be distinguished, for example, in ""Office"" and ""Private"". </p><p>In total, I have actively set up 4 different desktops. </p><p>FF I have set up as the ""default app"" in the Windows settings. </p><p>Now it is the case that I have a Firefox window open in the ""private desktop"", for example. </p><p>But when I work in the ""office desktop"" and click on a URL, the office desktop automatically switches to the private desktop and opens the URL in the FF already opened there in a new tab! :-( </p><p>So I have to remember before to open a new Firefox window in the office desktop to display the desired page also on this desktop. </p><p>Unfortunately, this doesn't always work. </p><p>If I work in the meantime in another of the 4 active desktops and use Firefox there and return to the office desktop and want to open a URL there again, the desktop jumps back to where I last used the already opened FF. This is quite annoying in the long run. </p><p>That's why I ran a test today with Google Chrome and MS Edge and defined each of them as the default app for testing. </p><p>Stupidly, these two browsers work exactly as I want them to. If I have already opened one of these browsers in another desktop, the URL will still open in the current desktop and any additional URL as another tab will correctly open in the current desktop. </p><p>If I now switch to the private desktop and open a URL there, it will correctly open in a new tab in this desktop. </p><p>I hope I was able to illustrate my ""problem"" so far? </p><p>Now my question? How can I change the behavior in FF? This seems to be a standard of FF in contrast to both other browser programs. Disabling in the FF settings ""Open links in tabs instead of new windows"" seems to be only a rudimentary solution; </p><p>but then a new window is opened every time, which is also not useful. </p><p><br> Can something be adjusted in the ""deeper"" settings? </p><p>Many thanks in advance for your tips. </p><p>Best regards, Georg </p><p>[Translated with ""<a href=""http://DeepL.com"" rel=""nofollow"">DeepL.com</a>""] </p><p>Translated with <a href=""http://www.DeepL.com/Translator"" rel=""nofollow"">www.DeepL.com/Translator</a> (free version) </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",ge.brenn

Some websites detect your browser and display the message that Firefox is not supported and some functions will not work. Other posts describe the functions that do not work for them. This is seemingly not unique as I was playing Wizard101 for four years with Wine under Linux and now I am unable to log into their game. I can log into their website, so my account is still active, but I do not have Windows or Mac operating systems to use even if I could figure out how to use a virtual machine. </p><p>The only solution I have is to use the Web 3.38.2 browser / WebKitGTK 2.36.4, but most other browsers should function properly. </p><p>Although I have been using Firefox as my favorite browser for more than two decades, it seems that Firefox is no longer supported. Even the <a href=""https://www.247freepoker.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.247freepoker.com/</a> game freezes after a few rounds. </p><p>There was a post that claimed a fix, but did not explain how to turn it on. I already checked my firewall settings and internet connectivity settings even though it did not seem to be the cause of the problem. </p>",linux;desktop;website-breakages;firefox-91120;firefox-9112;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1527812;,guest26118280

This problem has been around now for some time.  Get it fix or accept other users switching to other browsers that seem to have no problem at all getting to and using YouTube.  Very Frustrating. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1527827;,mike.keller517
