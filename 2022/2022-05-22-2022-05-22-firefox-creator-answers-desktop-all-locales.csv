Now I have a bunch of ""suggested"" crap Firefox must be getting paid for along my recent activity bar. I've never visited these pages and selecting the menu trying to dismiss them doesn't work. How do I eliminate the sponsored sites and get what I want along the recent activity bar? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1000;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",michaelcrovella

I have replaced batteries in mouse thinking low voltage, not this issue, on-screen cursor will stop/n start or to me acts like too many other background apps running using all bandwidth or ram = low batt voltage =replace batt problem solved. scrolling issue does seem to happen more often in overnight hours, hard to say definitively, MS is no help, after reading 9 pg. of community scrolling issues mine is diff. no issues of randomly, this has been happening for awhile 2yrs maybe more. its the random part that confuses me, i gone threw all mouse settings on/off n firefox, windows, HP, no fix, no error, very odd, i have changed wireless mouses, i dont think i've tried a corded one, after this i will, just gotta find it. HP laptop; Gear Head MPT3200RED mouse;HDMI cord to 42"" Sanyo LED TV; ANKER USB w/4 xtra slots;  I never touch laptop lid is closed all time, multiple screen switch on. Its very annoying only one indention roll of wheel, one line selected in win settings, mouse receiver plugged into laptop which is approximately 6 ft. away max. there will be days works perfectly normal, n then this evening started again, probly been week maybe, i'm gonna start keeping track of every factor i can think off date, time, website, tabs active, extension s on/active eg. just now tubi going threw my list which is very long page, 6 dvd picture lines down boom takes off just caught it around line 20 outta 150 lines maybe, heres thot, internet access threw verizon hotspot using tether hi speed cable connected to Galaxy S9, if web page not fully loaded thats when action starts, once it starts doesnt matter then random part kicks in, i can restart cpu, or disconnect S9 for minute , sometimes that helps, but not always. oh. i also use onscreen keyboard to type...suks...this Q has taken over hour to type as i click one letter at a time to spell words, my hand n index finger cramping. any thots you can think of wud be most appreciated , i'll do my best at documenting incidents , thnx vic </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",oetkbtytr
