This ability is important for my work. </p><p>I customized the headers and footers in the about:config interface according to advice posted [<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1323433|here"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/que.../1323433|here</a>]. </p><p>Recently, these settings don't take effect when I print webpages to pdf. I've triple checked that the settings are correct, but every time I print, the header and footer remain in the Firefox default configuration. Inexplicably, my preferred settings do take effect if I set the destination to ""Fax."" All other destinations don't work. </p><p>Is there any way to make these settings work again? Sadly, this might be a dealbreaker for me if not. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,customize,en-US,1508139;,wkuelthau

However, with version 100.x, UPS stopped working. All is get is the error message, ""We are unable to complete your tracking request at this time. Please try again later."".
