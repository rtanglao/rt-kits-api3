However, with version 100.x, UPS stopped working. All is get is the error message, ""We are unable to complete your tracking request at this time. Please try again later."". I tried other older tracking numbers that I know are good, and the same error. However, UPS tracking using Chrome or Explorer/Edge works fine. </p><p>I could blame UPS, but both Chrome and Explorer/Edge does work. </p><p>Apparently, Firefox is sending a (buggy) request that UPS doesn't like. </p><p>Thanks, Bill </p>",desktop;windows-10;firefox-1000;website-breakages;firefox-10002;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",willy6560

It used to work all the time on her identity, (and does so w.o issue using her Safari), but I don't recall an update.   </p><pre>   It also is obnoxious as all the 'share' brings up is the stock Mac ""extensions' options, of which mail, messages are grey scaled out (as is iCloud), with no padlock or way to make them clickable/check or uncheck!   I have run safe mode, disabled extensions from the top bar, but have no idea how to make the ""share"" share!!!  It does work if we just highlight the page address and post it into macmail (14.0).  These permission things have no clear way to reset them for Firefox...i.e my calling up Mac support would probably be useless. </pre>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",Buggeroff
