I used to use Any Video Downloader, but as the Firefox people kept updating the browser that fell off, and doesn't work anymore. Then for about the last year or so, i had been using the Video Downloadhelper addon, but recently that no longer will work either because it is demanding that I upgrade the Companion app., except it will not allow me to install it because of Apple Macintosh security stupidity, so I cannot use that now. Other than those two addons, none of the others seem to find a video that they can download half the time. This includes all the recommendations I have found online including the '<strong>Video Downloader Pro'</strong>, which cannot find a suitable format for most online videos, and the '<strong>Video Downloader professional'</strong> which also cannot seem to even find videos on websites that clearly have a video playing.  I have tried many others as well, but none of them are reliable to work on any video I find, and I am sick to death of desperately trying to find a working downloader addon that will not be patched out by the <strong>Mozilla </strong>team next month, so that they can '<strong>keep with the times'</strong> or whatever. Can anyone suggest a useful addon to download videos from websites that will work for <strong>ANY</strong> videos I find anywhere please?? <strong>Thanks in advance!!</strong> </p><p>PS. I think I got it to work by going to <strong>about:config</strong>, and changing the '<strong>media.play-stand-alone'</strong> to False, but that still leaves only the ability to download the videos in <strong>HUGE</strong> files, like at least 300mb or more, which is also not a good solution. </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-970;firefox-9701;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",zlloyd2

Which is the opposite of my chosen options. I don't understand. </p><p>Also the file explorer on Windows, and for example Paint-program has now black background on some parts.
