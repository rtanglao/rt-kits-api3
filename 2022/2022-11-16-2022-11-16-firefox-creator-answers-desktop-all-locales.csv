I tried chatting with Century Link and they keep referring me to Firefox so here is the issue. In October I was able to log in to Century Link and view/download my current bill. This month when I try to view the bill all I get is a grey screen and no data. I have been forced to use Microsoft Edge which DOES allow me to view/download the bill. Also, the Chat feature on Century Link via Firefox does not work. It does work in Microsoft Edge. Something in Firefox changed in the past month and I haven't a clue what it is. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1070;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",Rosaliy-Lynne

I go to my Firefox browser like I always have in the past. It opens and does an update. It comes back and I notice that my bookmarks bar is gone. I go to the bookmarks tab and all of my bookmarks are gone. I have never had a ""Firefox Profile"" before until now. I had to create one to try to get help. How can I get those bookmarks back? I tried to use the troubleshooting option that is listed and it did not work for me. I have a very important account that was in my bookmarks that I need access to. Someone HELP?! </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1548108;1548109;,stormsdroid

Before it installed, my computer crashed. After restarting my computer, Firefox will not fully load. I get only a grey screen and a search textbox. If I reinstall Firefox, will that help?

I was attempting to change a password on a duplicate account for a website, and I ultimately decided to change both the password for my alternative account and main account for this website. </p><p>The website allowed for me to supply my old password in order to specify a new password within my account. For both accounts, I was allowed to change my password using the ""Use a Securely Generated Password"" feature. However, the password generated was the same password for both accounts. These accounts have little or no relationship. Is this a limitation of the software or a bug? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,other,en-US,1548118;,jgary4151
