Problem opiera się o zakładkę aplikację w ustawieniach ogólnych przeglądarki.  W organizacji posiadamy pewną wtyczkę (EZD Addin) i przeglądarka w pierwszej chwili działa z nią prawidłowo wskazując jej lokalizację. Problem pojawia się po jakimś czasie, kiedy wtyczka przestaje działać a rozwiązaniem okazuje się ponowne wskazanie ścieżki do aplikacji.  </p><p>Chciałbym zatem dowiedzieć się, czy problem nie jest przypadkiem po Państwa stronie i przeglądarka FF po jakimś czasie niejako wpływa na ustawienia w sekcji Aplikacji z ustawień ogólnych przeglądarki. Czy może wysyłają Państwo jakieś dodatkowe pakiety modernizujące przeglądarkę a jednocześnie wpływa to na ustawienia tej sekcji.  </p><p>Odgórnie chciałbym zaznaczyć, że wykluczono z opcji błędów poprawki systemu Windows (nie pojawiały się w tym czasie), błędy wtyczki - wszędzie działa prawidłowo z wyjątkiem sytuacji opisanymi tutaj (było ich kilka na różnych stanowiskach).  </p><p>Pozdrawiam Dominik Buksiński Gdańskie Centrum Informatyczne Proszę o rzetelne rozpatrzenie naszego zgłoszenia </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1050;firefox-10503;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1542440;,dominik.buksinski
