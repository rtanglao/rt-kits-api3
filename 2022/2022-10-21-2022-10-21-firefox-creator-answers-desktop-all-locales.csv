This week - opened Google Maps - and all by itself there is an account of a person (not me) in Thai.  I don't speak or understand Thai so I can't even try to get out of this persons account or eliminate it (not to mention - why is it there in the first place???  It just magically appeared???)  By chance - I tried Google Maps in Safari (which I never use) - the account came up - NOT under this alien persons name - just regular Google Maps in English.  I was able to utilize it - no problem. </p><p>This is extremely bizarre - I don't want to use Safari - but apparently Firefox has screwed up here (on it's own it has put this account into my machine - why?) - or possibly it's Google who screwed up which wouldn't be surprising.  A person cannot contact Google - they are so arrogant they just have the attitude - we are Google - use our stuff - and the hell with you - nice!!!  However - if Safari is just getting the regular Google Maps site - why is Firefox opening Google Maps in an alien account - like mentioned - I just went in like regularly and this alien account appeared. </p><p>I never use any of Googles services - I do have an OLD account there - but don’t even remember the user name or log-in.  I don’t like their company - they are overbearing - dictatorial - and intrusive - so why bother with them.  But no clue why this alien account would have been attached to my computer - not there one week - and then there the next out of the blue??? </p><p>At any rate - is there any way to get rid of this alien account in my Firefox browser - I am not a computer wiz - but can follow instructions on how to do things easily.  Maybe the Firefox cache needs to be cleared - I don’t know (?) - nor do I really know how to do that.  Or why the cache would be storing information that shouldn’t be on my machine in the first place???

Problem opiera się o zakładkę aplikację w ustawieniach ogólnych przeglądarki.  W organizacji posiadamy pewną wtyczkę (EZD Addin) i przeglądarka w pierwszej chwili działa z nią prawidłowo wskazując jej lokalizację. Problem pojawia się po jakimś czasie, kiedy wtyczka przestaje działać a rozwiązaniem okazuje się ponowne wskazanie ścieżki do aplikacji.  </p><p>Chciałbym zatem dowiedzieć się, czy problem nie jest przypadkiem po Państwa stronie i przeglądarka FF po jakimś czasie niejako wpływa na ustawienia w sekcji Aplikacji z ustawień ogólnych przeglądarki. Czy może wysyłają Państwo jakieś dodatkowe pakiety modernizujące przeglądarkę a jednocześnie wpływa to na ustawienia tej sekcji.  </p><p>Odgórnie chciałbym zaznaczyć, że wykluczono z opcji błędów poprawki systemu Windows (nie pojawiały się w tym czasie), błędy wtyczki - wszędzie działa prawidłowo z wyjątkiem sytuacji opisanymi tutaj (było ich kilka na różnych stanowiskach).  </p><p>Pozdrawiam Dominik Buksiński Gdańskie Centrum Informatyczne Proszę o rzetelne rozpatrzenie naszego zgłoszenia </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1050;firefox-10503;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1542440;,dominik.buksinski
