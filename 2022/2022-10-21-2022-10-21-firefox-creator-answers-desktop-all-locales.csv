For example if I type ""firefox update broke search bar"" into the search bar and perform a search, I am unable to revise the search terms by clicking into the search box and editing some of the text. It selects all text, and I can not make a partial selection or add text to perform a revised search. Instead, I must now input all the text from scratch for each search iteration. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",tparrott

Everything I had in there is empty, and all of my search parties from the settings are gone.

The right click menu is also displaying every option possible making to top to bottom on a 4k screen and then some. When typing in the address bar, it will usually autocomplete and that is also not functioning. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",biggestmexi
