Mou spokojenost však ukončila jedna z aktualizací, ke které došlo ca před půl rokem. Stránky se mi od této doby zobrazují příliš velké. Běžnými způsoby (kupříkladu stiskem CTRL a -, či +)  je  odálit či přiblížit nelze. U většiny stránek se mění pouze velikost písma, velikost celé stránky však nikoliv.  Pouze u některých stránek, kupříkladu <a href=""http://Seznam.cz"" rel=""nofollow"">Seznam.cz</a>, lze tuto funkci využít zcela normálně. Též lišta záložek a lišta otevřených oken se po oné aktualizaci dosti zvětšily.

The office software is Microsoft Office 2010, from which I use Outlook 2010 to send and receive emails.  2. The only browser that I use is Firefox.  3. With Express VPN to mask my IP address (Firefox browser extension for expressVPN enabled) 4. And my internet package provided by Avast Premium Security. Up until about a month ago, these 4 packages ran sweetly in the background protecting my computer from all devious activity.  Then on return from a short break, I noticed that every time I switched on my computer and activated expressVPN, I could not access the internet or send/ receive any emails.  I pay a yearly subscription to Avast Premium Care which offers a superb 24/7 service, where they can remotely connect to my computer and repair it whilst talking with me on the phone. Using their help, I quickly discovered that when Avast software was enabled when Firefox was running, I could access the internet and send emails. But when expressVPN was also running, I could not get internet access or send/ receive emails. Then it was by a process of elimination I proceeded to try and discover which package might be the culprit. With both Avast and expressVPN disconnected, Firefox works perfectly! But with Avast still disconnected, I switched on my VPN and instantaneously, the internet was cut off! It was then that I contacted expressVPN technical support for help. We changed every single expressVPN setting possible, to no avail! And considering that all the VPN in essence does is mask my computer's IP address, he concluded that the issue had to lie with a Firefox setting! I then proceeded to check I was running Firefox latest software, deleted all browser history and cache and changed the network settings to no proxy - to no avail! In desperation, I turn to your technical team to resolve this issue for me, as I have no idea what has happened!!! This system has worked for years without a hiccup. Now I'm at my wit's end and need my computer running flawlessly to continue my business work as a matter of the utmost urgency! </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1060;firefox-10601;,firefox,other,en-US,"",nbloch

This week - opened Google Maps - and all by itself there is an account of a person (not me) in Thai.  I don't speak or understand Thai so I can't even try to get out of this persons account or eliminate it (not to mention - why is it there in the first place???  It just magically appeared???)  By chance - I tried Google Maps in Safari (which I never use) - the account came up - NOT under this alien persons name - just regular Google Maps in English.  I was able to utilize it - no problem. </p><p>This is extremely bizarre - I don't want to use Safari - but apparently Firefox has screwed up here (on it's own it has put this account into my machine - why?) - or possibly it's Google who screwed up which wouldn't be surprising.  A person cannot contact Google - they are so arrogant they just have the attitude - we are Google - use our stuff - and the hell with you - nice!!!  However - if Safari is just getting the regular Google Maps site - why is Firefox opening Google Maps in an alien account - like mentioned - I just went in like regularly and this alien account appeared. </p><p>I never use any of Googles services - I do have an OLD account there - but don’t even remember the user name or log-in.  I don’t like their company - they are overbearing - dictatorial - and intrusive - so why bother with them.  But no clue why this alien account would have been attached to my computer - not there one week - and then there the next out of the blue??? </p><p>At any rate - is there any way to get rid of this alien account in my Firefox browser - I am not a computer wiz - but can follow instructions on how to do things easily.  Maybe the Firefox cache needs to be cleared - I don’t know (?) - nor do I really know how to do that.  Or why the cache would be storing information that shouldn’t be on my machine in the first place???

Problem opiera się o zakładkę aplikację w ustawieniach ogólnych przeglądarki.  W organizacji posiadamy pewną wtyczkę (EZD Addin) i przeglądarka w pierwszej chwili działa z nią prawidłowo wskazując jej lokalizację. Problem pojawia się po jakimś czasie, kiedy wtyczka przestaje działać a rozwiązaniem okazuje się ponowne wskazanie ścieżki do aplikacji.  </p><p>Chciałbym zatem dowiedzieć się, czy problem nie jest przypadkiem po Państwa stronie i przeglądarka FF po jakimś czasie niejako wpływa na ustawienia w sekcji Aplikacji z ustawień ogólnych przeglądarki. Czy może wysyłają Państwo jakieś dodatkowe pakiety modernizujące przeglądarkę a jednocześnie wpływa to na ustawienia tej sekcji.  </p><p>Odgórnie chciałbym zaznaczyć, że wykluczono z opcji błędów poprawki systemu Windows (nie pojawiały się w tym czasie), błędy wtyczki - wszędzie działa prawidłowo z wyjątkiem sytuacji opisanymi tutaj (było ich kilka na różnych stanowiskach).  </p><p>Pozdrawiam Dominik Buksiński Gdańskie Centrum Informatyczne Proszę o rzetelne rozpatrzenie naszego zgłoszenia </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1050;firefox-10503;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1542440;,dominik.buksinski
