Unfortunately many times the ""X"" in the upper right of the sidebar is accidentally clicked which results in a phone call or remote login session to recover. It would be helpful if there was an option to ""lock"" the sidebar so it cannot be closed by an unsavvy user. In addition, it would be valuable if the sidebar lock prevented the user from collapsing/expanding (changing) the bookmark lists in the sidebar. Once they are ""locked"" (by a computer proficient person), no changes are allowed to the sidebar by a careless user. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",outback20
