However, recently, for a reason I cannot explain, I have been getting error messages on my school's online learning system that blocks me from watching any videos in the course. The error message reads as followed-  ""It seems your browser is blocking 3rd party session cookies which are required for the Kaltura application. To resolve this issue, please update your settings to allow 3rd party cookies."" ( For reference i guess, I go to IU which uses Canvas as an online learning platform. I haven't heard of anyone else having this issue) </p><p>I was very confused seeing this, because I hadn't recently changed or messed with any settings, I haven't downloaded any new security plug ins, but I went into my settings anyway to try and unblock all cookies using a custom settings option, under ""Enhanced Tracking Protection"" in settings. Reload my pages, restarted my browser, and no luck either time. I'm very confused as to why I'm seeing this error message, and it is getting in the way of my schoolwork at this point. I would LOVE to not have to download Chrome, so please help me thank you </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,cookies,en-US,1475433;1475444;,alij.sippel14

Unfortunately many times the ""X"" in the upper right of the sidebar is accidentally clicked which results in a phone call or remote login session to recover. It would be helpful if there was an option to ""lock"" the sidebar so it cannot be closed by an unsavvy user. In addition, it would be valuable if the sidebar lock prevented the user from collapsing/expanding (changing) the bookmark lists in the sidebar. Once they are ""locked"" (by a computer proficient person), no changes are allowed to the sidebar by a careless user. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1475443;,outback20
