The young man I spoke to did try several things to make it work but it always failed. So here I am! Please help me! I really don't want to have to have IE 11 running on my computer! I haven't allowed a Microsoft browser on my computer in 15+ years! And Google should be charged with treason against the USA (in my honest opinion!) I won't allow Chrome on my computer either! Please help me get this working so I can enjoy Fantasy Football this year! Last year I was in a Yahoo league and had no problems. I rarely run across problems using Firefox, lets not start now?
