Well once it opened, I then opened my second GMAIL account, and noticed that the two were different. Which forced me to check the URL of my main account and I noticed that they were different. ""?zx=s0wp4i3jcokr"" was sandwhiched between the number zero and the word ""inbox"" in the URL. Was I spoofed, and if so, what course of action should I take? </p> <ul><li>NOTE* </li></ul> <p>Prior to noticing the strange URL my key had been malfunctioning intermittently. Went into inspector to check code, and every word was just random letters. Is this related? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1030;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",panthero-zarminium

Happens about 99% of the time.,"<p>I am running Apple OS High Sierra, 10.13.6 on an older iMac Mid 2011. My Preferences have always been set, or checked, General_Tabs ""Open links in Tabs instead of NEW Window."" </p><p>The result is a Firefox screen full of Single Windows with Single Tabs. Some Windows I may continue to add Tabs to but most of the time I copy the link from the NEW Window and paste the link on the older Window. If I am in a hurry the result will be many many Opened NEW Windows with one or two NEW Tabs. See attachments. This has been going on for at least 6 months now. </p><p>Note your checkbox titled ""Email me when someone answers the thread"" does not work but please email me at ""AndyHutch1947@Gmail.com"". </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p><p>Andy </p>",desktop;tabs;mac-os-x-1013;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",andyhutch1947
