I use it mostly for email, to play simple computer games, such as solitaire and word search, and now and then to look up an address or website.   I do not know anymore about computers.    Everytime I got an update, something would change and I would have to go and find someone, and PAY them to tell me what happened, and fix it, and put it back the way it was.   For a very long time now I have not downloaded any updates, and just press the dismiss, or not now button. </p><p>Why do you need to change things the whole time, when it is all running fine.   I am now too scared to download anything in case it alters something from the way I am used to.   I do not use facebook or twitter or any of those things people are always talking about.   I just use it for email, to keep in touch with others, since I cannot hear on a phone. </p><p>I am a technologically challenged octogenarian, who did not have a chance to finnish school in the 50's.   Will I eventually not be able to use my computer?   Or will you keep it running? </p><p>Lucy - Lifemagician </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-990;,firefox,other,en-US,"",lifemagician

I hate IE, Chrome and most others. I use 64 bit version of Firefox and it is updated daily. The problem started when I joined a league for EXPN Fantasy Football using Firefox on my phone, which works fine. But it is a small screen and I would prefer to use my computer for many of the functions involved in Fantasy Football. </p><p>Problem is when I try to access ESPN's Fantasy Football using my computer I get an error message saying </p><p>You do not have permission to view this page. Go to the Fantasy Football Homepage. The Fantasy Football homepage loads just fine it's only when I try to access the league &amp; my team info that I get this message? I called ESPN since it worked on my phone through Firefox and they say, of course, that it's a browser issue and there was nothing they could do. The young man I spoke to did try several things to make it work but it always failed. So here I am! Please help me! I really don't want to have to have IE 11 running on my computer! I haven't allowed a Microsoft browser on my computer in 15+ years! And Google should be charged with treason against the USA (in my honest opinion!) I won't allow Chrome on my computer either! Please help me get this working so I can enjoy Fantasy Football this year! Last year I was in a Yahoo league and had no problems. I rarely run across problems using Firefox, lets not start now?

Well once it opened, I then opened my second GMAIL account, and noticed that the two were different. Which forced me to check the URL of my main account and I noticed that they were different. ""?zx=s0wp4i3jcokr"" was sandwhiched between the number zero and the word ""inbox"" in the URL. Was I spoofed, and if so, what course of action should I take? </p> <ul><li>NOTE* </li></ul> <p>Prior to noticing the strange URL my key had been malfunctioning intermittently. Went into inspector to check code, and every word was just random letters. Is this related? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1030;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1523782;,panthero-zarminium
