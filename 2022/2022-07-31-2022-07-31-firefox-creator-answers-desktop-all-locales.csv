I hate IE, Chrome and most others. I use 64 bit version of Firefox and it is updated daily. The problem started when I joined a league for EXPN Fantasy Football using Firefox on my phone, which works fine. But it is a small screen and I would prefer to use my computer for many of the functions involved in Fantasy Football. </p><p>Problem is when I try to access ESPN's Fantasy Football using my computer I get an error message saying </p><p>You do not have permission to view this page. Go to the Fantasy Football Homepage. The Fantasy Football homepage loads just fine it's only when I try to access the league &amp; my team info that I get this message? I called ESPN since it worked on my phone through Firefox and they say, of course, that it's a browser issue and there was nothing they could do. The young man I spoke to did try several things to make it work but it always failed. So here I am! Please help me! I really don't want to have to have IE 11 running on my computer! I haven't allowed a Microsoft browser on my computer in 15+ years! And Google should be charged with treason against the USA (in my honest opinion!) I won't allow Chrome on my computer either! Please help me get this working so I can enjoy Fantasy Football this year! Last year I was in a Yahoo league and had no problems. I rarely run across problems using Firefox, lets not start now?

Well once it opened, I then opened my second GMAIL account, and noticed that the two were different. Which forced me to check the URL of my main account and I noticed that they were different. ""?zx=s0wp4i3jcokr"" was sandwhiched between the number zero and the word ""inbox"" in the URL. Was I spoofed, and if so, what course of action should I take? </p> <ul><li>NOTE* </li></ul> <p>Prior to noticing the strange URL my key had been malfunctioning intermittently. Went into inspector to check code, and every word was just random letters. Is this related? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1030;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",panthero-zarminium

Some Windows I may continue to add Tabs to but most of the time I copy the link from the NEW Window and paste the link on the older Window.
