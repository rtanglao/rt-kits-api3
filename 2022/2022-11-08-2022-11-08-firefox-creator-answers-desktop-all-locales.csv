The only browsers installed in it is Firefox. Since last couple of days, i observed that when i am using an editor on the browser, be it a mail compose box or a custom web app editor, the moment i hit alt+tab it freezes for a couple of seconds. I tried all the methods that are available on the internet. But no luck.  The system is clean on malware and adware and i am not getting any option to disable hardware acceleration in the o/s.  If anyone can help it would be an immense help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",a.sayantan

When I try to run Firefox 77.0 on my linux system, I receive:  ""XPCOMGlueLoad error for file /media/34GB/firefox/<a href=""http://libxul.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libxul.so</a>: /media/34GB/firefox/<a href=""http://libxul.so"" rel=""nofollow"">libxul.so</a>: undefined symbol: FT_Library_SetLcdFilter Couldn't load XPCOM"" </p><p>I am not exactly calling firefox executable according to the traditional ./firefox, but rather using:  ""LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/media/34GB/Arquivos-de-Programas-Linux/Gtk+-3.4.0/lib/:/media/34GB/Arquivos-de-Programas-Linux/xorg/X11-1.4.4/lib/:/media/34GB/Arquivos-de-Programas-Linux/xorg/Xcb-1.4/lib/ ./firefox"", as my system doesn't have libgtk-3.so.0,libX11-xcb.so.1 or libxcb-shm.so.0. </p><p>Nonetheless, it does have libfreetype available. And a quick with: ""nm -D /usr/lib/libfreetype.so.6.3.22 | grep FT_Library_SetLcdFilter"" </p><p>shows that the function is present: </p><p>""0000000000017ff0 T FT_Library_SetLcdFilter""  </p><p>So, I had no idea why the problem is happening. Yet, I had a small epiphany. While my system's Freetype does support the required function, the freetype version that I used while building gtk3 does not, as nm showed me. Hence, firefox (or libxul) might be looking for the function in the ""wrong"" freetype library that is linked to libgtk3, instead of the system default libfreetype. </p><p>If that's the case, perhaps recompiling gtk 3, pointing to a newer libfreetype with support to the required function would rectify this little issue. However, rebuilding gtk 3  takes some work and time, especially if I also rebuild Pango &amp; Cairo using this newer Freetype, to avoid some possible future conflicts. And I am not sure this will work. </p><p>So, that's the recommended course of action or the cause might be other? </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ale.schenberg
