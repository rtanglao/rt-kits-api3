This happens AT LEAST once a week and is known to happen multiple times in one day.  I feel that I have some authority on this issue since I was an Assistant Vice President in charge of Management Information Systems for eight (8) years for an insurance brokerage firm and also became an Assistant Vice President in Information Technology when that company was bought by one of the largest insurance holding firms in the nation.  Additionally, I have a degree in Management Information Systems from the University of Houston with a 3.96/4.00 GPA.  So I think I know a little bit about what I'm talking about.  If I had upgraded a system or subsystem in either of these companies with the frequency that Firefox is updated, I would have been fired within ninety (90) days at the most -- and I would have deserved such.  I think Apple upgrades are frequent but they are with the frequency of a blue moon compared the the frequency of Firefox updates.  Respectfully, updates with the frequency of Firefox updates indicate one thing and one thing only -- incompetency in design, programming, testing, or, worst possible case, all three. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,other,en-US,"",PoliticalPopulist

Firefox is my main browser and I use it also on my business corporate laptop under Win64bit. Only recently each time Firefox needs to install an update, a window pops up asking for permission of the admin (and I am not the admin), so I have to call the IT dpt and ask an admin to log in and give its authorization. The IT team told me that it's not a problem of the corporate firewall and it's up to Mozilla to set the update process so as to avoid asking a high level authorization. This problem is becoming very annoying, as the Firefox updates are usually very frequent. Can you do something to fix it?

Yet, I had a small epiphany. While my system's Freetype does support the required function, the freetype version that I used while building gtk3 does not, as nm showed me. Hence, firefox (or libxul) might be looking for the function in the ""wrong"" freetype library that is linked to libgtk3, instead of the system default libfreetype. </p><p>If that's the case, perhaps recompiling gtk 3, pointing to a newer libfreetype with support to the required function would rectify this little issue. However, rebuilding gtk 3  takes some work and time, especially if I also rebuild Pango &amp; Cairo using this newer Freetype, to avoid some possible future conflicts. And I am not sure this will work. </p><p>So, that's the recommended course of action or the cause might be other? </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ale.schenberg
