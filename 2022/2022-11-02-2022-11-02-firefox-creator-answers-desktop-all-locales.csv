Since the update a few days ago, my Firefox browser keeps freezing permanently. It seems to happen mostly when I interact with Google Search (sometimes just loading Google will cause it) but it does happen occasionally on other sites. When it freezes this way, the only fix is to End Task and reload. It will successfully reload to the state it was in just a few seconds before freezing. I'm on Windows 10. I keep everything (OS, browsers, etc.) up to date, so I doubt that would be a factor. I wonder if there could there be an issue with a Google-based script (hence it occurring on other sites)? I don't know how I'd test for that. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10603;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1545214;,jariesuicune

The ""hang"" lasts 4-6 seconds or so and during that time Firefox is completely unresponsive.  You cannot scroll a page, switch to another tab, etc. It does not matter what page/website you attempt to save an image from.  They are all experiencing the same hanging delay. I have tried both restarting Firefox and restarting my PC.  Neither seems to alleviate this issue. Not sure how to proceed from here. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10603;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1545212;,drose25
1395453,2022-11-01 18:34:47 -0700,2022-11-01 18:50:25 -0700,Gray Screen,"<p>Today I downloaded the latest Firefox upgrade and got a flaming orange toolbar which is difficult to read.  Troubleshooting the issue by browsing the internet, I tried several things I don't remember, and also clicked on the DuckDuckGo privacy tab when that option came up.  I was unable to change the color of the tab but then suddenly got a gray screen with all gray tabs.  There is no color.   </p><p>It is not a Microsoft issue, as I have tried rebooting several times and always get a color screen at the reboot.  But when the page starts loading, all the icons are gray.  I tried a system restore but after a long reboot got a message that the restore was unsuccessful because apparently blocked by my security software (Webroot).  The advice was to temporarily disable Webroot but when I go into my apps, the only option is to uninstall and I am hesitant to do that because I don't know if I can quickly reinstall it without having to call Webroot customer service.   </p><p>At this point I can't figure out what to do.  Can you help without my having to reset everything?  I always keep a lot of windows open which is one feature I like about Firefox, and really don't want to have to reconstruct all those pages.     </p><p>I will appreciate your help in solving this problem, which I think is a software issue and possibly related to some things I might have clicked while trying to change the toolbar color. </p>",desktop;other;windows-8;firefox-1060;firefox-10603;,firefox,other,en-US,1545192;,rz4odessa

These have disappeared but I'm not sure exactly when it happened. </p><p>'Restore the previous session' does not help as it only restores a single window. I need to go back in history (I have backups so can refer to older files if needed). I have checked 'session-store.backups' and have several .jsonlz4 files, ranging from early October to late October. The older versions are much larger. </p><p>Do these files contain my older session data? If yes, how do I load them to get the relevant session windows? I am not worried about losing any data since that time. </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1060;firefox-10603;,firefox,other,en-US,1545190;1545201;,janes1001
