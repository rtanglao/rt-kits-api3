In every other browser, this is no problem. In Firefox, my formatting (mostly italics) is lost when I paste. I've tried messing with the paste commands and had no luck at all. I tried copying from Microsoft Word to see if the problem was on the Scrivener end, but the same problem occurs. I need to open Chrome to paste my text into Google Docs, which keeps the formatting, in order to work around this problem. Does anyone know why this is? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1060;firefox-10603;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",amandabcook

Since the update a few days ago, my Firefox browser keeps freezing permanently. It seems to happen mostly when I interact with Google Search (sometimes just loading Google will cause it) but it does happen occasionally on other sites. When it freezes this way, the only fix is to End Task and reload. It will successfully reload to the state it was in just a few seconds before freezing. I'm on Windows 10. I keep everything (OS, browsers, etc.) up to date, so I doubt that would be a factor. I wonder if there could there be an issue with a Google-based script (hence it occurring on other sites)? I don't know how I'd test for that. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10603;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1545214;,jariesuicune

You cannot scroll a page, switch to another tab, etc. It does not matter what page/website you attempt to save an image from.  They are all experiencing the same hanging delay. I have tried both restarting Firefox and restarting my PC.  Neither seems to alleviate this issue.

Troubleshooting the issue by browsing the internet, I tried several things I don't remember, and also clicked on the DuckDuckGo privacy tab when that option came up.  I was unable to change the color of the tab but then suddenly got a gray screen with all gray tabs.  There is no color.   </p><p>It is not a Microsoft issue, as I have tried rebooting several times and always get a color screen at the reboot.  But when the page starts loading, all the icons are gray.  I tried a system restore but after a long reboot got a message that the restore was unsuccessful because apparently blocked by my security software (Webroot).  The advice was to temporarily disable Webroot but when I go into my apps, the only option is to uninstall and I am hesitant to do that because I don't know if I can quickly reinstall it without having to call Webroot customer service.   </p><p>At this point I can't figure out what to do.  Can you help without my having to reset everything?  I always keep a lot of windows open which is one feature I like about Firefox, and really don't want to have to reconstruct all those pages.     </p><p>I will appreciate your help in solving this problem, which I think is a software issue and possibly related to some things I might have clicked while trying to change the toolbar color. </p>",desktop;other;windows-8;firefox-1060;firefox-10603;,firefox,other,en-US,1545192;,rz4odessa
