This is a popular chess playing site that hosts online chess games between logged in players. When a game challenge is accepted, it presents a chess board and a clock that should start immediately counting down white's remaining time. Instead, with Foxfire, the clock starts when the first move is made by white. </p><p>The above behavior only occurs on Foxfire. On Edge, Google Chromium, and Opera, it works correctly. This is of little significance to most players, but I have observed it for a long time on Foxfire--maybe as long a two years. I have not reported it before because I can easily work around the problem. The workaround is obviously to switch away from Foxfire when playing chess on <a href=""http://lichess.com"" rel=""nofollow"">lichess.com</a>. </p><p>Just thought someone there ought to know about this Foxfire abnormality. </p>",desktop;other;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,other,en-US,"",gjeilers1

I then noticed the address bar performing search which is annoying as hell and actually and interferes with productivity as I use search. Basically, I have to redo searches after the address bar. It is problematic. The one off search from address bar according to last survey only 26% of users like it. rest want it gone.  </p><p>As for me, I have tried the solution of Keyword set to false and the browser url oneoff also set to false.  </p><p>I saw another suggested item of turn off keyword search. However, that item does not have an off button or switch within Windows 11. Just check marks of the suggested keywords that developers installed into the field when downloaded. I unchecked all the items as that was the only change I could do. So, there is no keyword selected. I closed all browser windows and restarted Firefox.  </p><p>The address bar search still occurs. This make the previous question and answer solution invalid as of August 12, 2022.  </p><p>I consider this a BUG and a major development of Firefox browser failure. When I search, I am looking for generally wide range of results and alternative search options are better than specific one off search.  Best example; What is difference between Clementines and Mandarins? As a one off search you get one set of results. When you use the proper search box of a search engine, you get totally different results that are more useful and less time consuming to know the full range of answers, history, physical traits as well as other items not considered in the address bar search.  In the search engine box, you do get the address bar search items.  However, they always are 6 to 20 down the list of preferred or most useful. However, the address bar search results do not have all the top 5 items from the search engine search. It is a matter of how the address bar does the search that is at issue. For whatever reason, the results are not as good as direct input.  You will have to determine through investigation why that is. However, that is a year's worth of investigation if anyone would do it. In the mean time, this address bar search needs a simple button that does all the changes necessary to make it stop! </p><p>Additionally, I find multiple related search options that are given by search engines extremely helpful when looking for related type of searches. This is something that the address bar search can not do and was never designed or allowed to do. Thus, it causes loss of productivity.   </p><p>As such and because it does cause loss of productivity, it is a BUG and by law, Mozilla must remove items or provide easy solution to stop productivity failure.  </p><p>The current solution does not work. That means Mozilla must provide an update immediately to make this feature go away for those who find it annoying, useless or interference with productivity! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,customize,en-US,1526610;,pmadison1
