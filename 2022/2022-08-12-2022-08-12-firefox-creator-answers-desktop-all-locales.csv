As an example the message I receive is ""You don't have permission to access ""<a href=""http://booking.jetstar.com/au/en/booking/select-flights"" rel=""nofollow"">http://booking.jetstar.com/au/en/booking/select-flights</a>"" on this server"". </p><p>Reference #18.62052017.1660274157.1f6107dd  Other sites like my banking site I can access freely on Edge but cannot on Firefox. No error message in that case, just says error try again. All this started after I loaded Norton. I have had them look at the system, and they have, but also point out that it is not them as I can access the site from Edge. I have looked at the help page and their are thousands of people with the same query but no fixes! As a long term supporter of Firefox I am disappointed that I now have to use Edge to do most of my business.

I need to know what the fix is to this because I will download other browsers instead if using Firefox from this point forward. Please advise what the solution is.
