I need to know what the fix is to this because I will download other browsers instead if using Firefox from this point forward. Please advise what the solution is.

You'd think you could just open them, at least in text form.  Wasn't that possible before?  I can in Notepad if I want to look at hundreds of pages of gibberish that would take days to copy and paste over.   In my updated Firefox it offers a Restore function but to do that I have to wipe out all my existing Bookmarks.  Who dreams of this stuff?  Why would anyone sane want to do that? </p>",windows-7;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1526479;,moz2u
