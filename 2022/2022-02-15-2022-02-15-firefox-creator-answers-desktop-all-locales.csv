I've been looking for a solution and I did every troubleshooting step but it still the same even in troubleshooting mode I have got crashes. Windows is up to date, firefox and drivers too, I have Kaspersky internet security and I don't have any virus, I haven't install any program recently.  I know this is not the forum, but I've had crashes with warzone and halo infinite too, they just stop responding. Additionally I've run memory and HDD test and everything is ok, I've reintalled windows 11 (keeping apps and files), I've reinstalled firefox, warzone and halo but nothing works, I don't know what else to do, does anyone have some idea? maybe I need to wait for the next windows and firefox update?  </p><p>here is my latest crash report ID: bp-b4c1f3b4-b6a8-4201-b6b4-dfc100220215 </p><p>Thanks for your comments! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",kamusgallagher
