For example, when I open Firefox and visit <a href=""http://youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com</a>, it gets stuck on a blank continuously loading white page. When I close and attempt to re-open Firefox, it doesn't open until I task kill firefox.exe. Interestingly, there are multiple instances of firefox.exe open when I task kill. </p><p>Here are all the basic fixes I tried but to no avail:  </p><p>- Ensured all drivers and Windows Updates are up-to-date - Started Firefox in Safe Mode and disabled all add-ons - Uninstall Firefox then reinstall - Rename all the Mozilla folders in %appdata% to Mozilla.old  - Delete the residual Mozilla folder in Program Files - Delete all Mozilla keys in the registry (HKLM\SOFTWARE\Mozilla, HKCU\SOFTWARE\Mozilla) - Ran sfc /scannow, dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth, chkdsk c: /f - Checked c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts file to ensure no odd entries - Checked network and DNS settings for anything out of the ordinary </p><p>Here is my system information: </p><p>Windows 10 Pro 10.0.19044 N/A Build 19044 Intel i7-4790 8 Gbs memory 512 SSD </p><p>This issue has left me stumped, and I think it may have something to do with v97 (even though it works fine on my other PC). Does anyone have any suggestions on fixing this issue (other than wiping the PC)? Please note that different browsers such as Edge and Chrome work perfectly fine. Let me know if you could use more information. Thanks in advance! </p><p>Regards, Adrian </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",adrian.gaviola

I've been looking for a solution and I did every troubleshooting step but it still the same even in troubleshooting mode I have got crashes. Windows is up to date, firefox and drivers too, I have Kaspersky internet security and I don't have any virus, I haven't install any program recently.  I know this is not the forum, but I've had crashes with warzone and halo infinite too, they just stop responding. Additionally I've run memory and HDD test and everything is ok, I've reintalled windows 11 (keeping apps and files), I've reinstalled firefox, warzone and halo but nothing works, I don't know what else to do, does anyone have some idea? maybe I need to wait for the next windows and firefox update?  </p><p>here is my latest crash report ID: bp-b4c1f3b4-b6a8-4201-b6b4-dfc100220215 </p><p>Thanks for your comments! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",kamusgallagher

Yes, ""largely.""   Then I bookmarked ""that page""   And then pinned/locked that 'bookmark' as a tab in my Default Session.

Mozilla Support.        Which it does. </p><pre>   Bingo.     Standard browser window.   Separate Window with All folders and All bookmarks in a ONE PANE in its own window, so any and all bookmarks are visible concurrently.    The Browser and Bookmarks show on Taskbar as two icons for toggling (""never combine"")  and the critical functionality from ancient FF 3.26 (not the portable) and later via AiOS or ""Good 'Ol Sidebar"" is back in business.      Took me awhile for the opportunity to investigate this, but I appreciate your experience and patience.    Cheers! </pre>",desktop;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",pietertvl1
