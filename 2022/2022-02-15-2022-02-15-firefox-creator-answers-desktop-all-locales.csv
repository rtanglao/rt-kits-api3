You suggested    ""If you paste the following address to the address bar of a new window and press Enter to load it, you have largely the same functionality:"" </pre> <p>chrome://browser/content/places/bookmarksSidebar.xhtml  </p><pre>   Good idea.   Yes, ""largely.""   Then I bookmarked ""that page""   And then pinned/locked that 'bookmark' as a tab in my Default Session.         Then ... </pre> <p>""You can hold the Shift key and left-click the bookmark to open the bookmark (link) in a new window. This should always work to open a link in a new window.""    Mozilla Support.        Which it does. </p><pre>   Bingo.     Standard browser window.   Separate Window with All folders and All bookmarks in a ONE PANE in its own window, so any and all bookmarks are visible concurrently.    The Browser and Bookmarks show on Taskbar as two icons for toggling (""never combine"")  and the critical functionality from ancient FF 3.26 (not the portable) and later via AiOS or ""Good 'Ol Sidebar"" is back in business.      Took me awhile for the opportunity to investigate this, but I appreciate your experience and patience.    Cheers! </pre>",desktop;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",pietertvl1
