There is a feature in ""multi-container plugin"" which can move all the tabs belonging to a container to a separate window. if we add a feature, in this plugin or Firefox core, to bind a particular window to just one container then it can bring all the goodness of ""profiles"" and we can still use all the features of ""containers"". </p><p>1.
