I have the latest version of Firefox, and I used to be able to log in just fine, but I recently reset my browser and I seem to have lost some settings. I have tried adding an exception for this site's cookies in Settings, and I've also tried turning off enhanced tracker, but the site still doesn't work. Is there a way to tell what is broken and then fix it? Thank you. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1526034;,MikeN23
