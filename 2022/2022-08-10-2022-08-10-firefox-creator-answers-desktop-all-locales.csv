Hence selected ""Other"". </p><p>Containers are one of those features that I use almost in every Firefox session. It clearly segregates my office and personal work. I am asking for a feature, that could already be there somewhere in the advanced configuration (about:config). </p><p>Before asking let me set the context. Before containers, I used profiles to separate my work. But the disadvantage of profiles is that the cache, auto-fill, history all those convenient features are not the same everywhere. But the advantage of profiles is that every shortcut key, clicking of link would open in the same work area profile. I don't have to open context menu and select a profile each time. </p><p>""Container Windows"" could be such a feature which is best of both worlds. I am not aware if this is already there. At least the feature is not obviously visible. There is a feature in ""multi-container plugin"" which can move all the tabs belonging to a container to a separate window. if we add a feature, in this plugin or Firefox core, to bind a particular window to just one container then it can bring all the goodness of ""profiles"" and we can still use all the features of ""containers"". </p><p>1. Clicking a link in other application would open the default container (no-container) window 2. Control+Click, by default, opens tab in a bound container window, and hence in the same container 3. Context menu in all windows (bound and unbound) still gives an option to open tab in any container </p><p>Please let me know how to do this, if this is already implemented. Or tell me where to raise this feature request. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-91120;firefox-9112;,firefox,other,en-US,"",pankaj.jangid
