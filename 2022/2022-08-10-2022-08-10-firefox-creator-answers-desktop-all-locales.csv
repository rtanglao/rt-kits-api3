Before containers, I used profiles to separate my work. But the disadvantage of profiles is that the cache, auto-fill, history all those convenient features are not the same everywhere. But the advantage of profiles is that every shortcut key, clicking of link would open in the same work area profile. I don't have to open context menu and select a profile each time. </p><p>""Container Windows"" could be such a feature which is best of both worlds. I am not aware if this is already there. At least the feature is not obviously visible. There is a feature in ""multi-container plugin"" which can move all the tabs belonging to a container to a separate window. if we add a feature, in this plugin or Firefox core, to bind a particular window to just one container then it can bring all the goodness of ""profiles"" and we can still use all the features of ""containers"". </p><p>1.
