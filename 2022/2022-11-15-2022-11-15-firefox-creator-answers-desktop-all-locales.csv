(If this is relevant:) My first ever screenshotted BSOD, of when it started happening like basically every month, was on September 18, with stop code: ""ATTEMPTED_WRITE_TO_READONLY_MEMORY, what failed: dxgmms2.sys"".

Upon the user is closing the program, UE-V see that process is closed and uploaded profile to the server. </p><p>Of course, the problem is that the process opens and immediately closes, thereby preventing the ue-v service from working normally.

I also have a problem viewing the pdfs I have placed on a copyright protection site. These show up as blanks now when viewed in Firefox. They are perfect when viewed using Safari.

The state of the process is represented by an instance of Object with a heavy nested structure (usually of 4 to 5 layers: some properties of the object instance were arrays of other objects who has more arrays within). The process is being stored in its own ObjectStore with a key path linked to a property of the first layer of the object instance (an uid) and I'm using a put request to update the stored object as the process advances. The problem is that, when the process starts I can store it without any problem and even I can update it as it grows, but when it becomes big enough something goes worng. The put request still is being completed without error events and even the success event is fired but the API stores not an instance of Object but instead of Array (more precisely an array of strings that joined are some kind serialization of the object instance) and with that I can not access to the data of my process reliably. </p><p>More important than my description of what is happening in firefox is the observation that in the chromium based browsers this is not happening and my code works as expected and I could maintain the process state as my app runs. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1547865;1547880;,oterojuanpablo94
