Previously, I had no problems with GMail on Firefox.  With the new FIOS  I cannot use GMail on Firefox at all.  It opens, but I cannot delete or close emails after they are opened.  Eventually, it just goes dead and I cannot access emails.  Verizon's only suggestion was to use a different browser. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jmt.email.21c

First I have tabs that are popping up and they are ads or just a black screen. Some of the pop ups are on the page that I am looking at. How do I get them to stop? Also in my Firefox search bar it has changed from google to microsoft search engine but when I hit the search arrow it has a box that says- a browser seach and then goes to microsoft bing.  Can you help me figure out how to get my mozilla back to normal.  I love using this and dont want to let it go.

The state of the process is represented by an instance of Object with a heavy nested structure (usually of 4 to 5 layers: some properties of the object instance were arrays of other objects who has more arrays within). The process is being stored in its own ObjectStore with a key path linked to a property of the first layer of the object instance (an uid) and I'm using a put request to update the stored object as the process advances. The problem is that, when the process starts I can store it without any problem and even I can update it as it grows, but when it becomes big enough something goes worng. The put request still is being completed without error events and even the success event is fired but the API stores not an instance of Object but instead of Array (more precisely an array of strings that joined are some kind serialization of the object instance) and with that I can not access to the data of my process reliably. </p><p>More important than my description of what is happening in firefox is the observation that in the chromium based browsers this is not happening and my code works as expected and I could maintain the process state as my app runs. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1547865;,oterojuanpablo94
