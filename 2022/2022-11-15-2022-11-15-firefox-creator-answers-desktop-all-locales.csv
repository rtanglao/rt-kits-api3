So I bring up Google Chrome and it always brings up the article. SEE THE PICTURES. I use only Fire Fox as my browser, I keep Chrome around for when Fire Fox doesnt want to work properly. As you will see in the pictures the same website for both browsers. Fire Fox wont show the article no matter how many times I refresh the page or shut FF down, or reboot my MBP, but Chrome works perfectly every damned time. Why cant Fire Fox open the article but Chrome can? I need your help, any advice is greatly appreciated.

Suddenly it stopped working yesterday. With Firefox (78.15.0) I can enter the service but no folders are available. With Safari (10.1.2.) I can open individual files but can't work on them. Browser gets stuck. Similar problems occured earlier but at that time they happened with my newer laptop which has OS monterey (12.3.1.). Is there anything I could do to fix it? Upgrading OS is not an option due to the age of my hardware. Thanks in advance! </p>,desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1010;,firefox,fix-problems,fi,"",mika.railo

The state of the process is represented by an instance of Object with a heavy nested structure (usually of 4 to 5 layers: some properties of the object instance were arrays of other objects who has more arrays within). The process is being stored in its own ObjectStore with a key path linked to a property of the first layer of the object instance (an uid) and I'm using a put request to update the stored object as the process advances. The problem is that, when the process starts I can store it without any problem and even I can update it as it grows, but when it becomes big enough something goes worng. The put request still is being completed without error events and even the success event is fired but the API stores not an instance of Object but instead of Array (more precisely an array of strings that joined are some kind serialization of the object instance) and with that I can not access to the data of my process reliably. </p><p>More important than my description of what is happening in firefox is the observation that in the chromium based browsers this is not happening and my code works as expected and I could maintain the process state as my app runs. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1547865;1547880;,oterojuanpablo94
