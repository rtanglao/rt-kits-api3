Then 0002 and 0003 appear, and so on, after which the Firefox window is displayed. But process 0001 closes. </p><p>The problem is that a system service like UE-V monitors the process and binds to it. This service synchronizes user directories. By intercepting the process, UE-V pauses it, copies the profile from the server, then lets the process run. Upon the user is closing the program, UE-V see that process is closed and uploaded profile to the server. </p><p>Of course, the problem is that the process opens and immediately closes, thereby preventing the ue-v service from working normally. UE-V thinks that process was closed and do not see other Firefox processes. </p><p>All I could do was write a C# program that runs, launches Firefox, and watches for processes, once they've finished (all) this program exits as well. I replaced the original firefox.exe file with this program. It turns out something like a launcher. </p><p>But I would like to get away from this method (although it has been working for like 2-3 years). </p><p>How can I force Firefox not to close the first process? </p><p>Tank you. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",den.pasternak

The state of the process is represented by an instance of Object with a heavy nested structure (usually of 4 to 5 layers: some properties of the object instance were arrays of other objects who has more arrays within). The process is being stored in its own ObjectStore with a key path linked to a property of the first layer of the object instance (an uid) and I'm using a put request to update the stored object as the process advances. The problem is that, when the process starts I can store it without any problem and even I can update it as it grows, but when it becomes big enough something goes worng. The put request still is being completed without error events and even the success event is fired but the API stores not an instance of Object but instead of Array (more precisely an array of strings that joined are some kind serialization of the object instance) and with that I can not access to the data of my process reliably. </p><p>More important than my description of what is happening in firefox is the observation that in the chromium based browsers this is not happening and my code works as expected and I could maintain the process state as my app runs. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1547865;1547880;,oterojuanpablo94
