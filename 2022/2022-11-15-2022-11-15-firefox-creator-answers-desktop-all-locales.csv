What I noticed today is that when I was watching a YouTube video, my monitor screen went black for a second and then came back again, but it turned into green screen of pixels, instead of the actual video. I do not know if this has to do with my GPU (hardware side).  </p><p>I have had several BSOD with all different stop codes in the past as well, like BAD_POOL_CALLER (most recent) and SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION.  </p><p>Furthermore, I've also had ""SYSTEM THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED what failed:nvlddmkm.sys"", ""EXCEPTION_ON_INVALID STACK"" and ""CACHE_MANAGER"" stop codes before, but I haven't seen those anymore after formatting my SSD (went back to W10 after so big issue with W11 which caused me to format my SSD, long story).  </p><p>I used the WhoCrashed program to determine what the stop codes meant, with further detail (dumps are in the attachment). (If this is relevant:) My first ever screenshotted BSOD, of when it started happening like basically every month, was on September 18, with stop code: ""ATTEMPTED_WRITE_TO_READONLY_MEMORY, what failed: dxgmms2.sys"". I've also checked the Windows\\System32\\DriverStore\\FileRepository for any weird, duplicate or suspicious folders whatsoever. </p><p>I have: - Ran MemTest86 (4 passes) - Ran Windows Memory Diagnostics Tool (no issues found) - Ran GPU test (Heaven benchmark 4.0) (GPU temp below 80 degrees (around 60-70C at 21C room temp) (no error codes in device manager &gt; GPU &gt; properties) - Reset this PC (had to cuz W11 just messed everything up and I had to format the SSD, and went to W10 Pro). I was really hoping for this to fix everything, since it removes like literally everything. </p><p>My specs: - CPU: R5 2600X - GPU: Gigabyte GTX 1660ti OC - RAM: 2x 2x8gb ram Corsair Vengeance LPX Black 16GB DDR4-3000 CL15 kit - PSU: BitFenix Formula 550 W ATX </p><p>Crash reports: bp-764602db-eac3-4a23-98ec-a1b1d0221115 	15/11/2022, 13:37 bp-134f610d-d1d1-476e-b7ae-6c8620221110 	        10/11/2022, 22:56 </p><p>As you can see, I've done a lot to solve it myself, but the fact I have come this far to get help from this forum tells me that this is something else. Even (third party) anti-malware programs (malwarebytes, adwcleaner, windows defender) haven't found any viruses.

Then 0002 and 0003 appear, and so on, after which the Firefox window is displayed. But process 0001 closes. </p><p>The problem is that a system service like UE-V monitors the process and binds to it. This service synchronizes user directories. By intercepting the process, UE-V pauses it, copies the profile from the server, then lets the process run. Upon the user is closing the program, UE-V see that process is closed and uploaded profile to the server. </p><p>Of course, the problem is that the process opens and immediately closes, thereby preventing the ue-v service from working normally. UE-V thinks that process was closed and do not see other Firefox processes. </p><p>All I could do was write a C# program that runs, launches Firefox, and watches for processes, once they've finished (all) this program exits as well. I replaced the original firefox.exe file with this program. It turns out something like a launcher. </p><p>But I would like to get away from this method (although it has been working for like 2-3 years). </p><p>How can I force Firefox not to close the first process? </p><p>Tank you. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",den.pasternak

The state of the process is represented by an instance of Object with a heavy nested structure (usually of 4 to 5 layers: some properties of the object instance were arrays of other objects who has more arrays within). The process is being stored in its own ObjectStore with a key path linked to a property of the first layer of the object instance (an uid) and I'm using a put request to update the stored object as the process advances. The problem is that, when the process starts I can store it without any problem and even I can update it as it grows, but when it becomes big enough something goes worng. The put request still is being completed without error events and even the success event is fired but the API stores not an instance of Object but instead of Array (more precisely an array of strings that joined are some kind serialization of the object instance) and with that I can not access to the data of my process reliably. </p><p>More important than my description of what is happening in firefox is the observation that in the chromium based browsers this is not happening and my code works as expected and I could maintain the process state as my app runs. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1547865;1547880;,oterojuanpablo94
