I noticed that there are instances that when a website opens up in Firefox, it may open up in a 'general' tab that has not been assigned a container. Let's say that this website installs cookies, will they be carried on into the new container when right clicking the tab to choose 'Open in New Container Tab'? </p><p>My concern is that one would otherwise create a pool of cookies that are not carried along into the new container(s), and that are potentially accessible by cross-site tracking cookies that made or make their way into that same pool. </p><p>Looking forward to insights! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1040;firefox-10401;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",AmsterDan
