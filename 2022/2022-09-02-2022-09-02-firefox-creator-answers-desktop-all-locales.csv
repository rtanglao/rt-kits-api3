Called the school to confirm the address.  They had no problem, must be me.  Ran system mechanic full system scan, and found three trojans in fire fox.  Everything worked okay after they were deleted.  Decided to refresh fire fox to make sure no damage was done to my copy on disk.  Ran system mechanic again after refresh.  They were back!  Deleted them again and holding my breath. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1040;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1531124;,jesusislord111

It's inconsistent though, it affects some websites but others not, a website may be affected today but not tomorrow, hitting ctrl+f5 several times or closing and reopening the browser a couple times, sometimes fix it, sometimes not. </p><p>Looking at the font inspector, I couldn't find a specific font family that causes it, seems to be random too. Font settings are at the default. The source of the font file seems not to matter as well, it can be Google fonts, local fonts, the website server itself, even when developing locally... it's the same. </p><p>Now in Firefox 103 none of the ""tricks"" I mentioned before are capable of fixing the problem when it happens to a particular website. I've seen a lot of questions in this forum about the same problem but nothing helps. </p><p>In the attached screenshots you can see the difference between how it looks with and without the issue. </p>",desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",faelv

Normally, a tiny finder/browser window would open where I select the file and attach it.  That will not occur. No window comes up for me to do that until I close Firefox completely and restart it. </p><p>Similarly, if I were on Facebook and wanted to upload a picture to my feed, I would click 'post' followed by 'add photo/video.'  Normally at this time a window would pop up for me to select something from my computer, but nay, Firefox will not do so unless I completely shut down the program and restart it. </p><p>Once I restart it, either by closing all of my tabs and closing the program completely (using latest Mac OS), or 'force quitting' Firefox, the programs work find and selection windows appear. </p><p>That said, it's incredibly frustrating when you're working on something or have a bunch of tabs open for whatever reason. </p><p>I have made sure that my OS and Firefox are both up to date.  It doesn't stop the problem.  The only help files I've found suggest this is a recurring problem that bug fixes have been put out in the past, but can't find a permanent solution. </p><p>Please help! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",bkulbacki
