Background tasks cannot update addons such as langpacks, because they are installed into a profile, and langpacks that are not precisely matched with the version of Firefox that is installed can cause YSOD failures (see bug 1647443), so background updating in the presence of langpacks is too risky.</em> </p><p>Is this documentation still valid for branch 102 or now is possible to use it? If not, will it be possible in a future release to use auto-update with language packs? </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1531093;,rodolfo.ambrosio

I noticed that there are instances that when a website opens up in Firefox, it may open up in a 'general' tab that has not been assigned a container. Let's say that this website installs cookies, will they be carried on into the new container when right clicking the tab to choose 'Open in New Container Tab'? </p><p>My concern is that one would otherwise create a pool of cookies that are not carried along into the new container(s), and that are potentially accessible by cross-site tracking cookies that made or make their way into that same pool. </p><p>Looking forward to insights! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1040;firefox-10401;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",AmsterDan
