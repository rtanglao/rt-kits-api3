It goes something like this: I will open firefox fresh. Meaning, i start it with no firefox windows already open. I will open debugger on a site, or two, or three, or ten, and they all work fine. However, at some point the debugger window will ""open"" but never load anything, it is just a blank window. Then, I will close the window and try to open the debugger again (for any active tab, or the same tab, it doesn't seem to matter,) and nothing will happen at all. Not even the blank window, just nothing. The only remedy seems to be closing all open firefox windows and starting from scratch. </p><p>This does no effect browser windows/tabs, and firefox does not display any errors. </p><p>This does not seem to be an issue with an unresponsive script because it will happen randomly on any site i try to ""inspect"" at random times. </p><p>Since nothing ""crashes,"" no crash reports are generated. </p><p>I have not been able to recreate this issue on demand yet, but it is happening frequently enough to make me post this. </p><p>I (inconveniently) tried ""refreshing"" my firefox profile.

I'm using Firefox 106.0.1 (64-bit). Since the OS upgrade, Firefox behavior is not the same. Using the mouse scroll wheel works as expected. But the problem is that I like to hold and drag the scroll bar on the side of the screen since it gives me better control than the scroll wheel. Unfortunately, when I click and hold on the scroll bar, the scroll bar does not move with vertical mouse movements like it should. Instead, if I click and hold on the scroll bar and move the mouse vertically, when I release the left mouse button, the browser jumps to a random part of the web page. What setting can I change to control the ability of the scroll bar so it navigates the page while I hold the scroll bar with the mouse?

Upfront: I have `/etc/host` files on all pi's and the Ubuntu machine.   Not sure that is good or bad, but it may be important.  It is (for now) only computer names, not any other IOT devices. </p><p>PIHOLE supports a DNS thing where I can name devices on my network like with the `etc/host` file, but it is central to all machines on the network.   OR SO I THOUGHT! </p><p>Now as much as you are now thinking:   ""That's a PIHOLE problem"", it is and it isn't. </p><p>Here's why: </p><p>I make an entry in the DNS table of PIHOLE for `arlec1 - IP 192.1168.0.1`  (I can't remember the exact address, but for the sake of.) </p><p>I can now `ping arlec1` and I get replies and it is correct IP address. </p><p>The idea (story) is that rather than enter the IP address, I enter the name.

It just failed. `dig arlec1` went to 8.8.8.9 - or the ""main"" DNS server I use. It wasn't going through PIHOLE's DNS - for some reason. and it never got an ""ANSWER"". `dig PIHOLE arlec1` works.
