Instead, if I click and hold on the scroll bar and move the mouse vertically, when I release the left mouse button, the browser jumps to a random part of the web page.

IOT -&gt; internet thingy that is an appliance, etc. </p><p>Story: </p><p>I have PIHOLE as my DNS and run mostly RasPi machines. I have a ""smart"" TV and other devices that ""Call home"" a lot. PIHOLE is used to block them and it seems to be working. My main machine is a Ubuntu machine. </p><p>All machines point to PIHOLE as their DNS server - rather than the router, as it makes see who is doing what harder. </p><p>Things seem to be working, but then ""this"" happens. Upfront: I have `/etc/host` files on all pi's and the Ubuntu machine.   Not sure that is good or bad, but it may be important.  It is (for now) only computer names, not any other IOT devices. </p><p>PIHOLE supports a DNS thing where I can name devices on my network like with the `etc/host` file, but it is central to all machines on the network.   OR SO I THOUGHT! </p><p>Now as much as you are now thinking:   ""That's a PIHOLE problem"", it is and it isn't. </p><p>Here's why: </p><p>I make an entry in the DNS table of PIHOLE for `arlec1 - IP 192.1168.0.1`  (I can't remember the exact address, but for the sake of.) </p><p>I can now `ping arlec1` and I get replies and it is correct IP address. </p><p>The idea (story) is that rather than enter the IP address, I enter the name. Further disclosure:  I have NEVER UNTIL NOW used that in the browser.  It is more for when I need to access them from a CLI/Terminal.  It works. </p><p>I'm getting lazy.  It dawned on me that I can use the name to get to my device's web page and it would save a lot of typing. (It didn't - it cost me two days or more of confusion.) </p><p>`arlec1` is NOT on any of the local machine's `/etc/host` files.  I'm trying to use PIHOLE as the main DNS server. (Again:  ""Why are you asking here?""    Sorry, I am putting all the cards on the table so you know the story up to now.) </p><p>`ping arlec1`. NOTHING. It just failed. `dig arlec1` went to 8.8.8.9 - or the ""main"" DNS server I use. It wasn't going through PIHOLE's DNS - for some reason. and it never got an ""ANSWER"". `dig PIHOLE arlec1` works.  I see the correct IP address and pings are working. (skipping a bit here) </p><p>Now that it is working I open a FF page and enter `arlec1` into the URL and press enter. It goes to ""Mr google"". HOWEVER! If I enter: `http://arlec1` it works. </p><p>Thought! </p><p>I have/had the option to have the search and URL combined. I unticked that and tried.  (Didn't exit FF, I have about 40 windows and a few hundred tabs open, it is slow doing that.) I now have a separate (and visible - so I'm guessing it should be handled separately now) URL and search areas. </p><p>STILL FAILS and goes to mr google if I don't prefix it with `http://` </p><p>Kinda defeats the purpose - doesn't it? </p><p>There seems to be an elephant hiding close by, but I don't see it. </p><p>Could someone help me get my head around what is going on and what is causing this from a FF point of view? </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1060;firefox-10601;,firefox,customize,en-US,1543177;,teeny_weeny
