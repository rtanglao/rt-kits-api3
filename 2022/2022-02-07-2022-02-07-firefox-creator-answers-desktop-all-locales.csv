The problem is that many thumbnails are repeating or look very similar to other image links and thus I often click the same image multiple times just to realize I already visited that one. This costs me time and money. </p><p>Would it be possible to check the visited status against history programmatically via an addon or any other way and if the link is found in browser history, and instead of checking for :visited inject an own CSS class (e.g. MyClass) into the image link tags so that I can either format the image with a border or even replace it with some void image or so? Well in fact I need to see on the fly, whether that link needs to be visited or not. </p><p>Br, Pascal </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",pz7

What happens is that the page loads but when I try to click on the the first field to fill it Firefox does nothing and if I do the same 2-3 times eventually ends up displaying the  ""(Not Responding)"" message on the title bar and nothing happens for about 10 sometimes 15 seconds until the page finishes loading and then I can fill the form field normally. This happens for example when I try to enter my online banking, or login into Paypal via the popup window at ebay, to name some. Also some other pages that don't have any forms seem to also cause this initial delay in being able to interact with the page, for scrolling down, clicking a link, etc. It feels like when there are scrips on the page being loaded, the problem happens, but I cannot be 100% sure that is what might actually be going on. </p><p>If I disable all the AddOns by starting Firefox in Safe Mode the problem goes away and pages load normally in the sense that I can fill the form field almost immediately without having to wait. But when I go back into normal mode with AddOns reenabled, and then proceed to manually disable ALL my AddOns, the problem still continues to happen. So I am assuming there must be something else the Safe Mode also affects besides the AddOns, and that seems to be causing the problem I am having with the slow load of pages mostly with forms. </p><p>For  a bit of context, this problem started happening some months ago, out of the blue as I am pretty sure it did not start to happen immediately after something new was installed or some FF settings where changed/tweaked. Basically things where fine and the suddenly I started noticing the problem, but as usual one tends to first think it might be due to a temporary Internet speed hiccup, and so on, but eventually realizes that something definitively had changed permanently for the worst. And that is where I am now, and have been for a few months already. Very frustrating. </p><p>Hope someone here can give me some answers, primarily what encompasses to go into Safe Mode, which seems to solve the issue, but what else besides AddOns being disabled is also affected? Perhaps any custom user settings in About:Config are also temporarily reversed? </p><p>Thanks in advance for any information </p>",windows-server-2003;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-520;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1481435;1481446;1481451;1481462;1481465;1481466;1481468;1481469;1481538;,ffsup
