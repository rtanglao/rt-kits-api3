1367093,2022-02-06 21:46:50 -0800,2022-02-06 21:46:50 -0800,Firefox Enhanced Tracking Protection,"<p>I have the following setup - macOS Monterey v 12.2, Firefox 96.0.3 (64bit) with Enhanced Tracking Protection set at Standard. </p><pre>I have also previously been using Privacy Badger and Noscript which both offer some points of finer, easier control other than the rather On/Off set up in ETP (in my opinion).  In this regard I should note that all 3 Apps report a grand total of 103 different Trackers on the website in question, some detected across all the Apps and others picked up on only 1 or 2 of the Apps - with only one of the 3 Apps enabled in turn at any one time.  On the face of it it would appear that all of the Protection Apps have their areas of particular focus or sensitivity. </pre> <p>For a particular website as an example, if I enable ETP it shows it is blocking 6 trackers.  If I disable ETP it shows 67 ""trackers"" (including the 6 detected when ETP is enabled). </p><p>Question 1:  I would be grateful if someone could explain why the 2 lETP ists differ so markedly and what the list including the other 61 ""trackers"", showing when ETP is ""disabled"", represents?  Does the larger list represent the possible full detection range if ETP is set at ""Strict""? </p><p>Question 2:  Are there any known conflicts which can arise if using such Protection type Apps simultaneously? </p><p>Question 3:  Is there any order of precedence in the operation of such Apps? Or ,to put it more bluntly, will one of the Apps overrule the others, or if any of the Apps is set at ""Trust"" will the particular tracker will be permitted to operate irrespective of what the other Apps are set at? </p><p>Any advice would be gratefully accepted. </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-960;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Poppa1

1367080,2022-02-06 16:19:00 -0800,2022-02-06 17:55:26 -0800,Safe Mode question: what else is affected besides disabling AddOns?,"<p>I have a problem opening some sites, specially it is for example a login form. What happens is that the page loads but when I try to click on the the first field to fill it Firefox does nothing and if I do the same 2-3 times eventually ends up displaying the  ""(Not Responding)"" message on the title bar and nothing happens for about 10 sometimes 15 seconds until the page finishes loading and then I can fill the form field normally. This happens for example when I try to enter my online banking, or login into Paypal via the popup window at ebay, to name some. Also some other pages that don't have any forms seem to also cause this initial delay in being able to interact with the page, for scrolling down, clicking a link, etc. It feels like when there are scrips on the page being loaded, the problem happens, but I cannot be 100% sure that is what might actually be going on. </p><p>If I disable all the AddOns by starting Firefox in Safe Mode the problem goes away and pages load normally in the sense that I can fill the form field almost immediately without having to wait. But when I go back into normal mode with AddOns reenabled, and then proceed to manually disable ALL my AddOns, the problem still continues to happen. So I am assuming there must be something else the Safe Mode also affects besides the AddOns, and that seems to be causing the problem I am having with the slow load of pages mostly with forms. </p><p>For  a bit of context, this problem started happening some months ago, out of the blue as I am pretty sure it did not start to happen immediately after something new was installed or some FF settings where changed/tweaked. Basically things where fine and the suddenly I started noticing the problem, but as usual one tends to first think it might be due to a temporary Internet speed hiccup, and so on, but eventually realizes that something definitively had changed permanently for the worst. And that is where I am now, and have been for a few months already. Very frustrating. </p><p>Hope someone here can give me some answers, primarily what encompasses to go into Safe Mode, which seems to solve the issue, but what else besides AddOns being disabled is also affected? Perhaps any custom user settings in About:Config are also temporarily reversed? </p><p>Thanks in advance for any information </p>",windows-server-2003;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-520;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1481435;1481446;1481451;1481462;1481465;1481466;1481468;1481469;,ffsup
