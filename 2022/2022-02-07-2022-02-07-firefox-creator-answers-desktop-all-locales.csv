I have 64GB in one system and 32GB in another system, and both of them crash with version 79 and below on every linkedin profile. </p><p><br> Also if helps, I set browser privacy to custom and untick every box (I have my own security system that is 1000 times better that what Firfox trying to provide) Also OCSP and Security and firefox data collection are all unchecked and Don't enable HTTPS-only is checked. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",bobsort

Also the option to pick portrait or landscape just goes away before I can pick an option. specifically the site is Raymond James  Investor Access. It prints in gigantic letters using the drop down menu,and way oversize using the default dialog. going to the same site with chrome and printing not a problem. Also why doesn't the"" whats new"" in the help about firefox when clicked on show whats new with the coming update not whats new with the already installed version. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-960;firefox-9603;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",bluegate841

1367080,2022-02-06 16:19:00 -0800,2022-02-06 17:55:26 -0800,Safe Mode question: what else is affected besides disabling AddOns?,"<p>I have a problem opening some sites, specially it is for example a login form. What happens is that the page loads but when I try to click on the the first field to fill it Firefox does nothing and if I do the same 2-3 times eventually ends up displaying the  ""(Not Responding)"" message on the title bar and nothing happens for about 10 sometimes 15 seconds until the page finishes loading and then I can fill the form field normally. This happens for example when I try to enter my online banking, or login into Paypal via the popup window at ebay, to name some. Also some other pages that don't have any forms seem to also cause this initial delay in being able to interact with the page, for scrolling down, clicking a link, etc. It feels like when there are scrips on the page being loaded, the problem happens, but I cannot be 100% sure that is what might actually be going on. </p><p>If I disable all the AddOns by starting Firefox in Safe Mode the problem goes away and pages load normally in the sense that I can fill the form field almost immediately without having to wait. But when I go back into normal mode with AddOns reenabled, and then proceed to manually disable ALL my AddOns, the problem still continues to happen. So I am assuming there must be something else the Safe Mode also affects besides the AddOns, and that seems to be causing the problem I am having with the slow load of pages mostly with forms. </p><p>For  a bit of context, this problem started happening some months ago, out of the blue as I am pretty sure it did not start to happen immediately after something new was installed or some FF settings where changed/tweaked. Basically things where fine and the suddenly I started noticing the problem, but as usual one tends to first think it might be due to a temporary Internet speed hiccup, and so on, but eventually realizes that something definitively had changed permanently for the worst. And that is where I am now, and have been for a few months already. Very frustrating. </p><p>Hope someone here can give me some answers, primarily what encompasses to go into Safe Mode, which seems to solve the issue, but what else besides AddOns being disabled is also affected? Perhaps any custom user settings in About:Config are also temporarily reversed? </p><p>Thanks in advance for any information </p>",windows-server-2003;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-520;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1481435;1481446;1481451;1481462;1481465;1481466;1481468;1481469;,ffsup
