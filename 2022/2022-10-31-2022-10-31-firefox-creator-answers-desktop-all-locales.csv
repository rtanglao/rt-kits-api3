I have spent hours, days and weeks trying everything I can find to increase the font size and nothing has worked. I am vision impaired and understand that everything cannot be adjusted to my needs BUT there are hundreds of postings on line by people with good vision complaining about the non adjustable font sizes. Does FF have any intentions on finding a fix for this? I am an avid user of FF but am at a point with my vision to where it is too problematic for me to continue using. If you cannot fix this issue then I must find a program that does not have this problem. It may very well be a conflict between FF and W10 but even that were the case, there are supposed to be a lot of intellingent individuals that should be able to remedy this situation. Please advise of your intentions as soon as possible in order that I may proceed with my plans.

Also, some websites have buttons to click that no longer work; it's not that any info is missing from input fields; the buttons simply don't work. Actual Example: I recently reformatted my hard drive a few days ago &amp; re-downloaded and installed Firefox. Sometime later on, I signed into my McAfee account, although I kept receiving webpage error messages after sign-in stating the webpage I was seeking didn't exist. However, upon clicking on other buttons, it turned out I was actually signed-in. I went ahead and went to the download section of my account to re-download and install McAfee. No matter how many times I clicked the download button, nothing would happen. I established a chat session with McAfee Support; the Support Agent replied that others had complained about the same thing while using Firefox and the issue had been communicated to Mozilla, who supposedly knows about this and is working on a fix. The tech support agent advised me to use some other browser to download McAfee; I used Edge and the issue was successfully side-stepped. In the meantime, other websites that always have embedded animations or buttons to click don't work any more, either. Firefox has been my default browser of choice for years, but I have to go through the inconvenience to signing-out of whatever website I'm on and re-sign into that website again with Edge; a real pain.
