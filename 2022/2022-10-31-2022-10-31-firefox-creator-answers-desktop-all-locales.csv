I know it occurred around the time I updated the browser but that may not be the problem. </p><p>My 11 year old was playing on a PC during those days on Microsoft Edge during the same period and may have been using both browsers. I am on a Macbook.   </p><p>I had Sync set up and it's never been a problem before. When I went looking for something extremely important that I've lost (two days worth of work), I notice those dates are missing except for the massive number of browser tabs my son had on the PC upstairs.   </p><p>I am wondering if there is a way to recover or go back to those dates.  I'm not blaming the update or the sync. I just thought they could be possibilities for the problem.  If anyone has any suggestions for me to try, I would truly appreciate offers of advice. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,other,en-US,"",kpoagavelt

I wanted to ask what is the cause of this. When I export the list it is for certain there is no difference. Example: If I bookmark now want to be sure, that the exported list contains this question-site, and nothing else. Is it possible to edit the list manually, for to be sure there is no difference? Or is that not possible? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;mac-os-x-1015;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",ernloiaue

But this time I got an error PR_CONNECT_RESET_ERROR. Unfortunately for me there is no workaround for this error. How can I ignore this error and connect to such website? I'm not the first user having such problem. When are you going to put a button saying ""Go anyway"" or something like that next to this error message. I need to solve some payment problem with them. Who will refund my losses caused by your bug. I'm a grown man, and I can judge myself where to go, and where not to go. Especially after years of using such website. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",pawel.bos

The main one I use often is<em><strong> <a href=""https://french.typeit.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://french.typeit.org/</a></strong></em> which allows typing French characters on a QWERTY keyboard. It works well with Firefox on my other, non-touch screen Windows 10 laptop but not on my touch-screen Windows 11 laptop. If I use Opera browser, no problems on either laptop. If you open that website, the special French characters (with accents on them) are supposed to be at the top of the page. On the Windows 11 laptop they are at the bottom, which would not matter at all, except they do not respond to keystrokes, but they do respond to finger touch. I asked the developer and he said it is because Firefox detects my laptop as a mobile device. The developer said he did not have any solutions for me and the problem is entirely with Firefox.  I much prefer to use Firefox, but at least with this website, I have to use another browser. Is there anything I can do to fix this?  Thank you. </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",ffellag

I hit CTRL+F and instead of the usual search bar down below, it goes to the 'Find in Settings' field at the top and it starts filtering my results as I type.  Filtering results is not the expected behavior for CTRL+F.  And the the new, weird and distracting search highlights do not help the experience (They are trying to be smart, where all I wanted was a simple text search - see attached image).  </p><p>If I'll want to use the filtering I'll use it, but please do not hijack the regular CTRL+F in the settings page.  it is the most annoying behavior to change a shortcut only in one specific place whereas everywhere else it works the way you are used to.   </p><p>How can I disable 'Find in Settings' search so CTRL+F works like everywhere else? (And please please remove this behavior in future releases). </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1060;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",kaizer1

Also, some websites have buttons to click that no longer work; it's not that any info is missing from input fields; the buttons simply don't work. Actual Example: I recently reformatted my hard drive a few days ago &amp; re-downloaded and installed Firefox. Sometime later on, I signed into my McAfee account, although I kept receiving webpage error messages after sign-in stating the webpage I was seeking didn't exist. However, upon clicking on other buttons, it turned out I was actually signed-in. I went ahead and went to the download section of my account to re-download and install McAfee. No matter how many times I clicked the download button, nothing would happen. I established a chat session with McAfee Support; the Support Agent replied that others had complained about the same thing while using Firefox and the issue had been communicated to Mozilla, who supposedly knows about this and is working on a fix. The tech support agent advised me to use some other browser to download McAfee; I used Edge and the issue was successfully side-stepped. In the meantime, other websites that always have embedded animations or buttons to click don't work any more, either. Firefox has been my default browser of choice for years, but I have to go through the inconvenience to signing-out of whatever website I'm on and re-sign into that website again with Edge; a real pain. Please fix ASAP, and please give us a heads-up when this might be fixed, thanks. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1544749;,jhmotjr
