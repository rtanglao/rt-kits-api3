Who will refund my losses caused by your bug. I'm a grown man, and I can judge myself where to go, and where not to go.

The main one I use often is<em><strong> <a href=""https://french.typeit.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://french.typeit.org/</a></strong></em> which allows typing French characters on a QWERTY keyboard. It works well with Firefox on my other, non-touch screen Windows 10 laptop but not on my touch-screen Windows 11 laptop. If I use Opera browser, no problems on either laptop. If you open that website, the special French characters (with accents on them) are supposed to be at the top of the page. On the Windows 11 laptop they are at the bottom, which would not matter at all, except they do not respond to keystrokes, but they do respond to finger touch. I asked the developer and he said it is because Firefox detects my laptop as a mobile device. The developer said he did not have any solutions for me and the problem is entirely with Firefox.  I much prefer to use Firefox, but at least with this website, I have to use another browser. Is there anything I can do to fix this?

I hit CTRL+F and instead of the usual search bar down below, it goes to the 'Find in Settings' field at the top and it starts filtering my results as I type.

And the the new, weird and distracting search highlights do not help the experience (They are trying to be smart, where all I wanted was a simple text search - see attached image).  </p><p>If I'll want to use the filtering I'll use it, but please do not hijack the regular CTRL+F in the settings page.  it is the most annoying behavior to change a shortcut only in one specific place whereas everywhere else it works the way you are used to.   </p><p>How can I disable 'Find in Settings' search so CTRL+F works like everywhere else?

Also, some websites have buttons to click that no longer work; it's not that any info is missing from input fields; the buttons simply don't work. Actual Example: I recently reformatted my hard drive a few days ago &amp; re-downloaded and installed Firefox. Sometime later on, I signed into my McAfee account, although I kept receiving webpage error messages after sign-in stating the webpage I was seeking didn't exist. However, upon clicking on other buttons, it turned out I was actually signed-in. I went ahead and went to the download section of my account to re-download and install McAfee. No matter how many times I clicked the download button, nothing would happen. I established a chat session with McAfee Support; the Support Agent replied that others had complained about the same thing while using Firefox and the issue had been communicated to Mozilla, who supposedly knows about this and is working on a fix. The tech support agent advised me to use some other browser to download McAfee; I used Edge and the issue was successfully side-stepped. In the meantime, other websites that always have embedded animations or buttons to click don't work any more, either. Firefox has been my default browser of choice for years, but I have to go through the inconvenience to signing-out of whatever website I'm on and re-sign into that website again with Edge; a real pain. Please fix ASAP, and please give us a heads-up when this might be fixed, thanks. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1544749;,jhmotjr
