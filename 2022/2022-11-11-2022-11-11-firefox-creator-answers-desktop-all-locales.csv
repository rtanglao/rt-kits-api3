I think Kubuntu is a keeper (until I re-familiarise myself with the Linux OS - maybe a year or two) but still testing. </p><p>My issue is that on everyone of the 3 flavours I have tried Firefox is the main browser by default and I use it as my default on Winblows also for about 25 years or so in it's various incarnations (IE Netscape) </p><p>My issue with this is Firefox on Winblows rarely if ever crashes ()I can't recall the last time Firefox on Winblows crashed it was that long ago) but on Linux this is a completely different story. </p><p>ON Manjaro it crash 4-10 times randomly per hour. ON Mate it as fairly stable but still crashed 4-10 times per evening session (usually 5PM to about 11 or 12 PM) On Kubuntu it as unstable at first but then I got some updates and thing became stable for about a week or so - and by stable I mean 1-2 crashes every few days - so not stable but stabler. I just installed the nvidia driver version 515.x.x for my Nvidia 1070 and immediately after the reboot Firefox started crashing on every single tab I opened. I would re-open it and 10-30 seconds later it crashes again. </p><p>After 5 minutes or os of crashing a firefox update magically appeared to upgrade to version 106.x.x. and so I took it thinking it might make things better. It did not make things better. It made things MUCH worse, now it crashes everytime I try to open it. </p><p>I ALWAYS have at least 2 browsers installed just because of BS like this. I opened up Vivaldi 5.5.2805.42 and it opened, did not crash and is still open.  I am tying this post for help using it. </p><p>Firefox extensions installed : ublock, newtab URL redirector,WebRTC(permanently disables WEbRTC and = keeps it disabled through updates, download helper and that's it. </p><p>Vivaldi extensions installed: uBlock, download helper - vivaldi doesn't need a new tab URL redirector because it has a configuration for newtab URL - as all browsers should (hear me Mozilla!), doesn't need WebRTC as it also has a configuration for this to turn it on or off and upgrading Vivaldi retains all config settings always and everytime I use it and update it - which admittedly is not nearly as much as Firefox and I am going to keep an eye on that one configuration for sure. </p><p>I want to use firefox, I really do, I love it - even through all the changes over the past few years I still love it -even though I HATE some of the changes. That being said it needs to be stable on my OS of choice. </p><p>I donate to the Mozilla foundation because I like their efforts on net neutrality and privacy. I also donate to varios net neutrality and privacy orgs such as the EFF and openmedia to mention 2 more. I am going to try to downgrade my firefox version because in my short Linux experience that usually does the trick. However the minute I decide Firefox is not stable enough on linux and swap out to Vivaldi instead my donation money goes from Mozilla foundation to the Vivaldi developers. NOW thats not a threat, I am sure the Mozilla foundation wont miss my $60.00 yearly but, it can;t just be me thats disappointed with Firefox on Linux and in fact google searches shwo me it is not. </p><p>Are politics more important than the MAIN PRODUCT of the Mozilla foundation? If not you gotta show Firefox on Linux some more loving because there are millions of firefox users round the world who are disappointed by my basic non-scientific search results and reasoning - which cannot be far off. </p><p>I mean - it won't even start and it constantly crashes when it does start. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1547039;,Yodamin

It's gotten to the point where the Firefox Accounts login page asks me to give it a code from my email, I give it said code and the passwords still incorrect. If I can give it codes from my email, why can't I log in through my email or anything else? </p><p>I cannot reset the password because I would lose <strong>hundreds</strong> of saved passwords that I had stored in Firefox along with important bookmarks. I need to know if there is any way I can recover my account without losing my data, because I cannot afford to lose it at all. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",nolynthememerlol
