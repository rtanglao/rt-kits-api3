It's gotten to the point where the Firefox Accounts login page asks me to give it a code from my email, I give it said code and the passwords still incorrect. If I can give it codes from my email, why can't I log in through my email or anything else? </p><p>I cannot reset the password because I would lose <strong>hundreds</strong> of saved passwords that I had stored in Firefox along with important bookmarks. I need to know if there is any way I can recover my account without losing my data, because I cannot afford to lose it at all. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",nolynthememerlol
