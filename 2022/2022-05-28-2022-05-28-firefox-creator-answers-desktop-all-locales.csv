At first i thought it was maybe a GPU driver issue so i DDU'd all drivers on my PC and reinstalled them. Did not fix the issue. Tried rolling back Firefox, since thats a pain i only fought with it begging about corrupted bookmarks for a bit before giving up on that, Firefox 99 still did the same thing. Tried the same websites on Chrome and Edge, no issues. deleted all the data i could find for mozella and still the same issues with a fresh install of Firefox 100.0.2. Even trying to load this page drops text, adds colours to places and just overall a pain. I'm unsure if Firefox is kind of like Norton and when you ask it to uninstall it doesn't but are there anymore files to delete besides formatting this PC to get firefox working again? If i have to format the PC i may as well switch back to Chrome or try Edge since again this seems focused on Firefox on this PC. </p><p>I'll try to list what i've tried again to be clear: - Updated Graphics Drivers - did not fix - DDU'd graphics drivers and reinstalled - did not fix - Rolled FF to version 100 same issues - Rolled back FF to version 99, did not fix - uninstalled FF and deleted all traces of mozella in all directories, did no fix - Go to same websites in Chrome and Edge, no issues.  </p><p>Unsure of what to try next besides formatting the PC. </p>",desktop;windows-10;firefox-1000;website-breakages;firefox-10002;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1508363;1508367;,disczero22

I need a way to disable certain built-in Firefox keyboard shortcuts. I recently switched from Chrome to Firefox but if I can't disable the ctrl+i and ctrl+b keyboard shortcuts I'm going to have to switch back. I use both very frequently for work, so their non-functionality in this browser is genuinely impacting my productivity and it's getting <em>really</em> frustrating. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,customize,en-US,1508356;,heterodyne.girl

I can relaunch it by both using CCleaner to clear the browser in addition to going to Firefox preferences and deleting data and history. I don't have Flash or Silverlight. I have refreshed Firefox a number of times and completely uninstalled it using the MacCleaner Pro App Cleaner and Uninstaller and reinstalling it using Mozilla's online download link. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1508330;,gbmeredith
