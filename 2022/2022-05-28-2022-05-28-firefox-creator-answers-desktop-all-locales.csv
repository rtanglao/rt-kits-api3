First of all, I'd like to congratulate the community on the 100th edition of Firefox. </p><p>The subject was selected as ""other"" because it is not a failure or problem, but a suggestion for improvement related to the information on the volume of cookies and website and cache data stored on disk. </p><p>It's been a while since I noticed this and now I present it in writing asking whether or not it is feasible to implement the suggestion below. </p><p>In Settings / Privacy and security / Cookies and website data, the amount of “bytes” stored taking up disk space appears. </p><p>According to the detailed description on the subject, available at the address </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/clear-cookies-and-site-data-firefox</a> </p><p>there is a screen copy illustrating the explanations, for example: </p><p>Cookies and website data Your stored cookies, website data and cache are currently taking up 468 MB of disk space. know more </p><p>That's the point: ""Your cookies, website data and cache stored are currently taking up 468 MB of disk space"" </p><p>However, this information freezes when reaching 1.0GB. </p><p>The exact question: could this information be shown beyond the conditioned threshold until the user decides to clear all data? </p><p>Without further ado, I thank you in advance for your attention and, as far as possible, I look forward to hearing from you. </p><p>Yours sincerely, Ricardo Pinto.

I need a way to disable certain built-in Firefox keyboard shortcuts. I recently switched from Chrome to Firefox but if I can't disable the ctrl+i and ctrl+b keyboard shortcuts I'm going to have to switch back. I use both very frequently for work, so their non-functionality in this browser is genuinely impacting my productivity and it's getting <em>really</em> frustrating. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,customize,en-US,1508356;,heterodyne.girl

I can relaunch it by both using CCleaner to clear the browser in addition to going to Firefox preferences and deleting data and history. I don't have Flash or Silverlight. I have refreshed Firefox a number of times and completely uninstalled it using the MacCleaner Pro App Cleaner and Uninstaller and reinstalling it using Mozilla's online download link. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1508330;,gbmeredith
