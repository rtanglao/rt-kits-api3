I can relaunch it by both using CCleaner to clear the browser in addition to going to Firefox preferences and deleting data and history. I don't have Flash or Silverlight. I have refreshed Firefox a number of times and completely uninstalled it using the MacCleaner Pro App Cleaner and Uninstaller and reinstalling it using Mozilla's online download link. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1508330;,gbmeredith
