I have photoshop 6 and it won't work on any further OSs) I went to update Firefox, was not sure what version it was. and my computer asked"" replace current version of Firefox with New"" , I said yes, it did.. and then after I downloaded it,  I noticed there was a circle with a slash going thru it on Firefox Icon, when I tried to open new firefox , it bascically said will not work with this OS. I could not go back and lost firefox alltogher, which also had my prefernces and autofill passwords etc. I went to Mozilla site to see if I could find an older version of firefox.. This is what I found :  Firefox version 78 was the last supported Firefox version for Mac users of OS X 10.9 Mavericks, OS X 10.10 Yosemite and OS X 10.11 El Capitan. These users were moved to the Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR) channel by an application update.  </p><p>I downloaded it and it said It will not work on my OS, So,  How can I basically get the same firefox I had or whatever the last version that works on my computer..and best case senario save my prefernces and passwords, which maybe might have been saved somehow when I tried to change in the begining .. thanks so much for your help. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",silversgene

First of all the blured effect is behind everything else and you have to change the z-index to actually see it and if you do it is actually much larger than it should be.

The problem is that when I'm focused on Firefox Ctrl+S pops up the Save Page window and (if I held Ctrl+S for more than a split second) it crashes (probably due to multiple popups becoming unresponsive). The mouse can't click to cancel the pop ups for saving the page nor interact it. I have to kill the firefox process and restart it. I've been looking into disabling Ctrl+S shortcut in Firefox with no success (extensions are deprecated or require too many permissions I'm not comfortable with).  </p><p>Would someone help me to disable Ctrl+S or enlighten me on how to not have firefox crash every time I accidentally press Ctrl+S? </p><p>Thanks! </p>,linux;desktop;fix-problems;ubuntu;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1508386;,joacopaz

At first i thought it was maybe a GPU driver issue so i DDU'd all drivers on my PC and reinstalled them. Did not fix the issue. Tried rolling back Firefox, since thats a pain i only fought with it begging about corrupted bookmarks for a bit before giving up on that, Firefox 99 still did the same thing. Tried the same websites on Chrome and Edge, no issues. deleted all the data i could find for mozella and still the same issues with a fresh install of Firefox 100.0.2. Even trying to load this page drops text, adds colours to places and just overall a pain. I'm unsure if Firefox is kind of like Norton and when you ask it to uninstall it doesn't but are there anymore files to delete besides formatting this PC to get firefox working again? If i have to format the PC i may as well switch back to Chrome or try Edge since again this seems focused on Firefox on this PC. </p><p>I'll try to list what i've tried again to be clear: - Updated Graphics Drivers - did not fix - DDU'd graphics drivers and reinstalled - did not fix - Rolled FF to version 100 same issues - Rolled back FF to version 99, did not fix - uninstalled FF and deleted all traces of mozella in all directories, did no fix - Go to same websites in Chrome and Edge, no issues.  </p><p>Unsure of what to try next besides formatting the PC. </p>",desktop;windows-10;firefox-1000;website-breakages;firefox-10002;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1508363;1508367;1508390;,disczero22
