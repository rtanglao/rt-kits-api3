I've just bought a Mac Mini running Monterey (12.3.1) and downloaded Firefox, which says it is up to date with version 91.9.  Soem websites, when accessed therough Google search, grey out as if wanting me to accept or reject cookies, but no such buttons show.  Examples - Search gresham, offered gresham college in dropdown, click onit and it's greyed out and inactive.  Example - search canon support, offered Canon Product Support in Google listing, click on this main heading, and webpage comes up greyed out.  Both sites work satisfactorily in Safari.  (I've resolved my problem with Canon). I'll be glad if you can help - I'd prefer to go back to Firefox by default. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-9190;firefox-919;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",austinayton

But since I can't get any help from FB, I'd like to check also here.  </p><p>At first, I thought that the problem is on my side, since I am using ICC profiles and maybe I did something wrong. But It is not the problem on my side. I tried with an original jpg file, directly from my camera.  </p><p>So, when I upload JPG to the Facebook, color of the image changes. This happens only if I publish it directly to my FB wall. If I go to FB ""publishing tools"" (on FB pages), everything works normal. If I upload the same photo via for example Chrome or Vivaldi, everything works, even if I upload directly to the FB wall. </p><p>So the problem occurs only If I upload from Mozilla (I have latest version 100) to the FB wall. Not via ""publishing tools"" on FB page. But problem is the same if I publish on my FB business page wall.  So I assume that the problem is on FB side, that somehow renders files differently then via their Publishing tools. But I am allowing that Mozilla does something to them via the interface.  </p><p>There must be some problem with Mozilla too, since all images work OK with Chrome or Vivaldi. So, something in relation of Mozilla - Facebook wall.  </p><p>Currently I just use Chrome for uploading to FB, but I don't want that.  </p><p>Not sure what to do now. FB does not reply, maybe Mozilla can help or check? I attached a sample photos, to see difference. Here is my Mozilla gfx.color profile too: <a href=""https://i.ibb.co/CWRHWnh/6.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.ibb.co/CWRHWnh/6.jpg</a> </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1000;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",cunfek

Well now every time i click on a PDF file it downloads it. I have tried every option in settings/general/apps and they still download in a folder.

Gmail frequently disconnects for varying periods, then reconnects, only to disconnect again almost immediately.  Gmail will not let me open another account from within the current account.  This does not happen on my Android phone where Gmail works properly.  Neither does it happen when I run Gmail through Edge on my desktop.  Hence I presume it results from an interaction between Firefox100.0 and Gmail.  My wife has exactly the same problem using her Microsoft Surface Laptop under W10 since this latest update. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1000;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",colin.matheson

In CONTROL PANEL I even tried REFRESHING Mozilla Firefox short of Uninstalling. (That did nothing.) I tried downloading the latest version.  It installed . . . , but, the old one is GONE.

I continually get intermittent SSL errors of all types when visiting any websites. Simply refreshing the page temporarily resolves the issue, but I'd estimate 20% of the time when I try to load a webpage I get the error. This does not happen on any other browser, or Firefox on any other device on my network. Interestingly I believe this even happened on the same machine inside a Linux VM in VMware, but I'm not 100% I am remembering that right. So far, I have tried various fixes including resetting certificate authorities and changing Firefox to use the Windows certificate store in about:config, but nothing has worked so far.
