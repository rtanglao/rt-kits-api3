But there was one thing I liked in Firefox on W11 is the scroll bars. They were narrow and discreete, and expanded when I hover with the mouse. I prefer that over the wide and very flat Windows 10 bar. </p><p>Is there a way to get this new bar on Windows 10Â ? </p><p>Thanks in advance for your help, have a great day. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1000;,firefox,customize,en-US,1505195;,valentinmarques
