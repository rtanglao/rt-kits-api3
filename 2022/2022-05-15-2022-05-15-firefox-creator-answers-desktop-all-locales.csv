Not via ""publishing tools"" on FB page. But problem is the same if I publish on my FB business page wall.  So I assume that the problem is on FB side, that somehow renders files differently then via their Publishing tools. But I am allowing that Mozilla does something to them via the interface.  </p><p>There must be some problem with Mozilla too, since all images work OK with Chrome or Vivaldi. So, something in relation of Mozilla - Facebook wall.  </p><p>Currently I just use Chrome for uploading to FB, but I don't want that.  </p><p>Not sure what to do now.

But there was one thing I liked in Firefox on W11 is the scroll bars. They were narrow and discreete, and expanded when I hover with the mouse. I prefer that over the wide and very flat Windows 10 bar. </p><p>Is there a way to get this new bar on Windows 10 ? </p><p>Thanks in advance for your help, have a great day. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1000;,firefox,customize,en-US,1505195;,valentinmarques
