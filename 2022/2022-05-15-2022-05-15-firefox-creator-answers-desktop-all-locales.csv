Then after restarting my computer and doing everything else I could think of - I got it to load and my previous session was restored.  All the tabs were there . . . but none of them would respond.  I tried downloading the latest version.  It installed . . . , but, the old one is GONE.  The new one DOESN'T WORK.  In the search box it suggests youtube, facebook, etc. . . .

I continually get intermittent SSL errors of all types when visiting any websites. Simply refreshing the page temporarily resolves the issue, but I'd estimate 20% of the time when I try to load a webpage I get the error. This does not happen on any other browser, or Firefox on any other device on my network. Interestingly I believe this even happened on the same machine inside a Linux VM in VMware, but I'm not 100% I am remembering that right. So far, I have tried various fixes including resetting certificate authorities and changing Firefox to use the Windows certificate store in about:config, but nothing has worked so far. I'm all ears for any ideas. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1000;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1505220;1505221;1505225;1505226;1505228;1505232;,jdial91
