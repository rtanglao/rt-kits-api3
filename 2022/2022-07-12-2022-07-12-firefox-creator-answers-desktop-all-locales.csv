If I have Apple's Private Relay turned off, everything works correctly. However, if Apple's Private Relay is turned on, then Firefox will use Apple's Private Relay DNS (Cloudfare in my location).

I set up the primary password on the computer B.  I found that I forgot the primary password yesterday. So, I deleted Firefox from the computer B. Afterwards, I copied and pasted the Firefox portable from the computer A to B. Everything looked fine. The primary password checkbox was unchecked, so I didn't need to worry about it.  </p><p>However, when I launch Firefox on the computer B today, it asked me the primary password again.  As far as I know, all data is saved in the portable folder and I don't understand why it happened.

AND  despite Firefox being my default browser for over ten years and long before I started using Avast free antivirus. Avast has loaded it on , I never elected to do so ...but that said I do not wish to totally remove it from my lap top as it is, as it were, an insurance policy against Firefox becoming inoperable. I have explored switching off this attribute of avast browser in the browser but to date have been unsuccessful. As a retired man in my seventies I am limited in my peer group for finding anyone that is computer literate YET this technology is so beneficial to people such as myself I believe. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,other,en-US,1518968;,dnp.grey
