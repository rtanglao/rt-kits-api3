First, the settings Ask to save logins and passwords for websites was turned off effectively turning off auto fill then Proxy was turned on.  I didn't make either of those settings.  Also, metro PCS website has been blocked.  Error message says This problem can sometimes be caused by disabling or refusing to accept cookies.  I did not make any changes to cause cookies to be refused or disabled and had been on that site a couple days prior.  I'm thinking this has to be a hack because my Chewy account was hacked, ID changed, login pop up to sign in was changed and 2 orders were made.  I reported it to PayPal and contacted Chewy and got the orders canceled and account closed only to get a notice the next day that the account was reopened.  I almost had to have them list me as having to contact them by phone or chat to open an account in order to close all accounts and make sure no more accounts were opened in my name.  I will be contact Metro PCS also because other numbers on my account have been hacked or have had problems.  I'm trying to catch this thing on all sides.  If possible, if there is a way to see if someone else accessed my account it would be appreciated.  I connect to my account on laptop only at home 1 location and on my phone.  I think the number is on file. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1519111;1519127;,cinvowell
