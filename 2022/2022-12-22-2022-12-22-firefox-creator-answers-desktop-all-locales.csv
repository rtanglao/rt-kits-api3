Tonight I upgraded my Firefox browser to version 108 and I cannot for the life of me figure out how to allow this connection. Before the upgrade, it worked perfectly fine, after the upgrade it tells me it was unable to connect but in the address bar I see that it's trying to connect to HTTPS Even though the bookmark is HTTP. If I remove the s from the address bar, it still refuses to connect. The chromium-based browser on my computer will connect to this site without any trouble, as will the legacy browser. This seems to be a problem introduced in version 108 and I have no way around it. Has anybody else experienced this problem? I don't want to write a sloppy bug report so I'll probably just wait for someone important to have this problem and the next release will probably have it fixed, but it's pretty annoying having to open up my chromium based browser in order to access this one local URL. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1555169;,natelee123

I was sick of websites breaking so I decided to reinstall Firefox, and the website worked perfectly fine on the reinstalled one, since that app is on 109. </p><p>Unfortunately, it caused a whole host of problems since I have two Firefoxes on my laptop. When I finally got rid of the older Firefox, it worked fine… </p><p>…until I restarted my laptop. Upon launching Firefox, it crashed my laptop and when it rebooted, the Firefox reverted back to version 108 with 109 nowhere to be found. </p><p>How can I get Update 109 on my laptop?

I have reinstalled it multiple times and tried clearing the cache after installation so I have a very clean FF. The last time I had this issue, LastPass support had me clear the cache without a new download and that worked for a short time. Is there a file etc. that needs to be cleared to now work with LastPass? I am using chrome with no issues with LastPass. I do not use Safari very often but LastPass works with it on my iMac.  One post said it is a LastPass problem but why does it work on chrome and safari but not FF??? </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",normc19

Also, Youtube ads at the beginning of a video last only 1 or 2 seconds. But I've forgotten how I achieved that. I can find no evidence of an ad blocker on my computer or my Firefox browser. How can I find out how ads are blocked? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1080;,firefox,customize,en-US,1555167;,mwrr
