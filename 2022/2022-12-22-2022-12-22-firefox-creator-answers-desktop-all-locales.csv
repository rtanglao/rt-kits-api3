I have reinstalled it multiple times and tried clearing the cache after installation so I have a very clean FF. The last time I had this issue, LastPass support had me clear the cache without a new download and that worked for a short time. Is there a file etc. that needs to be cleared to now work with LastPass? I am using chrome with no issues with LastPass. I do not use Safari very often but LastPass works with it on my iMac.  One post said it is a LastPass problem but why does it work on chrome and safari but not FF??? </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",normc19

Also, Youtube ads at the beginning of a video last only 1 or 2 seconds. But I've forgotten how I achieved that. I can find no evidence of an ad blocker on my computer or my Firefox browser. How can I find out how ads are blocked? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1080;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",mwrr
