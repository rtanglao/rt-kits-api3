Please try again later""","<p>When trying to play Netflix, or any streaming service that is not Youtube, this error message appeared. I followed the DRM troubleshooting, reset the user configurations, and because the error code when trying to play something on Netflix said I was out of date (even though I'm on the latest version of firefox) I deleted and redownloaded Firefox and synced everything again. It says Widevine will be downloading shortly, and I think this might be a part of the problem but I'm not sure how to get it to manually download. I am on a Macbook Air, I've also followed the instructions on the Rosetta troubleshooting and nothing has changed. I've restarted after toggling the options on and off for always allowing the DRM as well as after setting Widevine to always allow and allowing automatic updates. I don't have Avast but I do use a separate VPN, and I also have U-Block origin and adblock not sure if that's messing with it? I really love Firefox and this is the first time I've followed through all the troubleshooting and something still doesn't work. If anyone has any idea on what to do, would love some help :) Thanks in advance! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",annette.j.shin

When I click a video, it either says ""Playback on this device is not supported"" with a grey screen, or, it loads the player properly, but has a black screen and buffers infinitely. </p><p>The weird part is -- if I then refresh the page, it fixes, only for that video. The next time I click a video, I'll then have to refresh that video's page to make it play. </p><p>Also, right clicking the video and opening in a new tab will make the video play properly, but as soon as I go to another video on that tab, I'll have to refresh again. </p><p>Videos also play without a hitch if I open a new ""Private Window"" to browse with, but then most of my extensions are disabled and it's just really inconvenient. </p><p>This started happening shortly after I let my C:\ drive become full -- but I did quickly free up 100gb of space after I realized, so it shouldn't be that anymore. </p><p>Things I've tried: </p><p>Disabling hardware acceleration </p><p>Turning on ""Autoplay video and audio"" for all websites </p><p>Disabling all my extensions, including relevant ones like YouTube Enhancer, uBlock, SponsorBlock and Dark Mode </p><p><br> Anyone got any ideas? I'd really prefer to avoid doing a full reinstall if possible, as I just did one a while ago and copying over my history/bookmarks/cookies/etc was a pain. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",satoshiji

Tonight I upgraded my Firefox browser to version 108 and I cannot for the life of me figure out how to allow this connection. Before the upgrade, it worked perfectly fine, after the upgrade it tells me it was unable to connect but in the address bar I see that it's trying to connect to HTTPS Even though the bookmark is HTTP. If I remove the s from the address bar, it still refuses to connect. The chromium-based browser on my computer will connect to this site without any trouble, as will the legacy browser. This seems to be a problem introduced in version 108 and I have no way around it. Has anybody else experienced this problem? I don't want to write a sloppy bug report so I'll probably just wait for someone important to have this problem and the next release will probably have it fixed, but it's pretty annoying having to open up my chromium based browser in order to access this one local URL. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;needsinfo;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1555169;1555192;,natelee123

Is there a file etc. that needs to be cleared to now work with LastPass? I am using chrome with no issues with LastPass. I do not use Safari very often but LastPass works with it on my iMac.
