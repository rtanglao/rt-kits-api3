I was sick of websites breaking so I decided to reinstall Firefox, and the website worked perfectly fine on the reinstalled one, since that app is on 109. </p><p>Unfortunately, it caused a whole host of problems since I have two Firefoxes on my laptop. When I finally got rid of the older Firefox, it worked fine… </p><p>…until I restarted my laptop. Upon launching Firefox, it crashed my laptop and when it rebooted, the Firefox reverted back to version 108 with 109 nowhere to be found. </p><p>How can I get Update 109 on my laptop? Thanks in advance. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1555166;,Raeoniel

I have reinstalled it multiple times and tried clearing the cache after installation so I have a very clean FF. The last time I had this issue, LastPass support had me clear the cache without a new download and that worked for a short time. Is there a file etc. that needs to be cleared to now work with LastPass? I am using chrome with no issues with LastPass. I do not use Safari very often but LastPass works with it on my iMac.  One post said it is a LastPass problem but why does it work on chrome and safari but not FF??? </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",normc19

Also, Youtube ads at the beginning of a video last only 1 or 2 seconds. But I've forgotten how I achieved that. I can find no evidence of an ad blocker on my computer or my Firefox browser. How can I find out how ads are blocked? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1080;,firefox,customize,en-US,1555167;,mwrr

No idea why.  Other applications are serving audio in stereo.  Any other reports of this or fix? </p>",linux;desktop;other;debian;firefox-10260;firefox-1026;,firefox,other,en-US,"",isac.petruzzi
