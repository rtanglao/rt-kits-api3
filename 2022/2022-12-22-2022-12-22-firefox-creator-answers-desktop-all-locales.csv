Tonight I upgraded my Firefox browser to version 108 and I cannot for the life of me figure out how to allow this connection. Before the upgrade, it worked perfectly fine, after the upgrade it tells me it was unable to connect but in the address bar I see that it's trying to connect to HTTPS Even though the bookmark is HTTP. If I remove the s from the address bar, it still refuses to connect. The chromium-based browser on my computer will connect to this site without any trouble, as will the legacy browser. This seems to be a problem introduced in version 108 and I have no way around it. Has anybody else experienced this problem? I don't want to write a sloppy bug report so I'll probably just wait for someone important to have this problem and the next release will probably have it fixed, but it's pretty annoying having to open up my chromium based browser in order to access this one local URL. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;needsinfo;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1555169;1555192;,natelee123

Is there a file etc. that needs to be cleared to now work with LastPass? I am using chrome with no issues with LastPass. I do not use Safari very often but LastPass works with it on my iMac.
