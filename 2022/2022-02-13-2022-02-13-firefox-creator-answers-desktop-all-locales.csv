I don't want to remove the download button because I want to monitor download progress, and at times, I DO want to look at specific downloads from time to time.  But the fact that the window automatically pops up and stays there until I click on something is annoying. </p><p>I saw similar posts several years old about older versions which don't apply now. </p><p>So, is there a way to disable this thing without completely removing the download progress indicator from my toolbar? </p><p>Thanks again for the help! </p>",desktop;beta;customize;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",gumby_dammit223

But it shows me a couple of different settings.  Another thing that I've found so far is the setting ""Always check if Firefox is your default browser"" is unchecked AND disabled.

View... bar I do <strong>not</strong> get a visible dropdown menu to chose from Firefox specific:  When I try to use a bookmark folder in the bookmark bar there is <strong>no visible dropdown menu</strong> to chose from When I try to chose from a dropdown menu inside the content of a web site i will get <strong>no visible feedback</strong> at all. </p><p>BUT: when I want to chose a bookmark that should appear in a dropdown list and I move the mouse to that remembered position I see in the lower left corner the bookmark's address and I can chose it! The same happens with the dropdown menus from the the File.... View... Help line. I am able to chose a command once I remember where to point to. </p><p>So I guess all what is missing is the overlay plane where the menu contents reside.  </p><p>This problem occurs in 95% of the time I use both applications, BUT there are 5% of the time where everything works like a charm. I have no idea what i do differently in that usage. Whenever Firefox works normal, also thunderbird does. Is it somehow a KDE releated problem?  </p><p>How can I fix that problem?
