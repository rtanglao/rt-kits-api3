Whether it is audio from Audacious, my music player, or audio from the program I am watching on Firefox. How can I stop the noise, which sounds like static from a week station on an old AM radio?  Using other browser does not have this audio problem, UNLESS Firefox is running. Even if not actively using Firefox, just having it open on the desktop causes noise.  Using Linux Mint 20 64bit.  Audio produced by motherboard ASUS Prime B550 Plus with AMD Ryzen 9 3900X processor.  Clicking on Firefox Help gets a message saying ""Updates disabled by your system administrator"" along with the normal text.  I didn't disable updates and I am the Admin. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-970;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",love390520

I use a transparent version of Discord so I can watch videos through the client on Firefox while using Discord itself. This used to not be an issue at all, but at some point recently, Nightly had an update that stopped me from being able to do this by pausing the video's visuals a few seconds after I tab into Discord. My theory is that it's to save resources in performance, but I'd like to figure out how to revert this so I can do what I did previously. <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/uwBSUtg.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">example</a> </p><p>Things tried so far: hardware acceleration on/off using different types of video outside of Firefox to make sure it wasn't Discord/Windows freezing it different websites besides YouTube to make sure it wasn't YouTube freezing it </p><p>Thank you in advance for your time and help! :) </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;,firefox,other,en-US,"",CutieeCeleste
