I can log into my router from Microsoft Edge and it does show that my router is online. What could be the problem?  My router is a Linksys EA3500, which is about 8-10 yrs old and the firmware is up to date.  The only problem that I know of for sure is that I can't do a speed test through my router.  I am able to connect to all websites except one and I don't know if that is related to this problem.  The only website I can't connect to is after I try to sign in to <a href=""http://www.consumerreports.org"" rel=""nofollow"">www.consumerreports.org</a>.  I have been dealing with this problem for months trying to figure it out.  They say java has to be enabled.  Please help me.  I've been connecting to Consumer Reports for years with no problems.  I have done troubleshooting with them, Xfinity, and Linksys, but can't figure this out.  Even though while on Microsoft Edge it said my router was online, I still could not connect to <a href=""http://www.consumerreports.org"" rel=""nofollow"">www.consumerreports.org</a>. Consumer Reports says that you can't use a VPN on their site and I do have one, but don't use it while logging into their site. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,other,en-US,1501689;,Techless

In recent days they have changed their security access method whereby their site now requests a security number generated on one’s phone using the HSBC App (it used to be a random number from an HSBC supplied handheld device) which then has to be input via my Windows 10 PC to access my data. If I use Microsoft Edge as browser, everything works fine, but when I try Firefox my system just hangs after I’ve put my bank ID into the HSBC opening page (the first security step) and simply never opens the next HSBC page which would ask me to generate the said code on my phone.

I tried adding lines to the gtk.css config files with no success unlike I've been successful doing in the past. It appears they are gone forever unless I can find another way to get them back. I noticed that the scrollbar arrows are gone on only Firefox and Thunderbird. As mentioned, this has happened in the past after some updates but in the past I was able to edit the gtk.css files in both gtk-2.0 and gtk-3.0 to get them back. Is there anything else I can try. I'm using the latest version of Ubuntu (Pop OS to be specific) and the arrows to the scrollbars disappeared around April 2nd for both Firefox and Thunderbird. I didn't notice any other applications where the arrows to the scrollbars disappeared. Is there something else I can try and a way to prevent this from happening in the future. This seems to be a common problem that happens every time there is an update. </p>",linux;desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1501573;1501589;,mtonkinson

I even double checked if my only blocker, UBlock Origin is preventing it from showing but it's not even there either.
