When first downloaded it runs for maybe 2 seconds then crashes and if you try to re open it, you either cant or see it pop up in the task bar only to go away the next second like a flicker. I've deleted and redownloaded it already and I cant find the crash report on my pc even from the Win + R so I was wondering if anybody ever had an issue like this and how they fixed it. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1501571;1501590;,killerbeanfan69

I tried adding lines to the gtk.css config files with no success unlike I've been successful doing in the past. It appears they are gone forever unless I can find another way to get them back. I noticed that the scrollbar arrows are gone on only Firefox and Thunderbird. As mentioned, this has happened in the past after some updates but in the past I was able to edit the gtk.css files in both gtk-2.0 and gtk-3.0 to get them back. Is there anything else I can try. I'm using the latest version of Ubuntu (Pop OS to be specific) and the arrows to the scrollbars disappeared around April 2nd for both Firefox and Thunderbird. I didn't notice any other applications where the arrows to the scrollbars disappeared. Is there something else I can try and a way to prevent this from happening in the future. This seems to be a common problem that happens every time there is an update. </p>",linux;desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1501573;1501589;,mtonkinson
