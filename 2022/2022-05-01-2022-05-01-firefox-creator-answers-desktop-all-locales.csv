In recent days they have changed their security access method whereby their site now requests a security number generated on one’s phone using the HSBC App (it used to be a random number from an HSBC supplied handheld device) which then has to be input via my Windows 10 PC to access my data. If I use Microsoft Edge as browser, everything works fine, but when I try Firefox my system just hangs after I’ve put my bank ID into the HSBC opening page (the first security step) and simply never opens the next HSBC page which would ask me to generate the said code on my phone. Seems a browser related problem. Any ideas why Edge works but Firefox does not? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",keith.pottinger

If I changed my password, would the other computer revert to requiring a password to open Firefox? </p><p>The second part of the instructions I read advise one to also change all one's other passwords: ""If you don't change the passwords for things like your bank account, it would still be possible for someone else to log into your account on your lost device.""
