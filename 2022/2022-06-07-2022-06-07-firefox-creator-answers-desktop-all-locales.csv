Please help me fix this.,"<p>My workflow in Firefox involves 100's of open tabs pertaining to work, personal etc. I regularly bookmark all the abs using the 'bookmark all tabs' feature in the Bookmarks drowdown (or the equivalent 'select all tabs' -&gt; 'bookmark all tabs' by rightclicking on a tab) which offers the option of saving the tabs in a new folder name I specify. As of the last couple of weeks, the option to enter a folder name no longer exists. I've attached a screenshot of the current pop-up when I choose 'bookmark all tabs'.  </p><p>Perhaps related: this may have started occuring after I upgraded to the latest version (v. 101.0 on MacOs 12.4 on Macbook Pro) or the timing may be a coincidence. </p><p>Saving the 100s of bookmarks every week is an essential part of workflow; I've been doiong it for years, and I really need to have this ability back. Please help me debug this.  </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;bookmarks;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1010;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",ushmakriplani
