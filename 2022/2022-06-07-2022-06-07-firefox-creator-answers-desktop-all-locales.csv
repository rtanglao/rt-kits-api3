It's like it tries to create a new tab, yet it's just a half-formed nothing that you can't interact with. And when this happens, Firefox is destined to eventually crash / become unresponsive. I literally have to reboot to get Firefox working again. I haven't tried logging out. That would probably work, too. </p><p>This also happens when moving new tabs, but I've only notice that happen on tabs with <a href=""http://Youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Youtube.com</a> open. </p><p>firefox -V Mozilla Firefox 100.0.2 </p>",linux;desktop;tabs;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",rannday1
