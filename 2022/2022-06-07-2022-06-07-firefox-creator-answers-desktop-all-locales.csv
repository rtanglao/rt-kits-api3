I keep running into a strange bug. I'll start typing an e-mail message, and all of a sudden, my keystrokes are interpreted as commands instead of text. For instance, I'll type a word with an ""n"" in it, like ""and"", and somehow after I type the ""a"", the interface starts grabbing keystrokes away from the text field, so when I hit ""n"", it creates a new message, and the ""d"" ends up going into the text field of this new message. It's very frustrating, because I can't type more than a couple of sentences before the message and interface get screwed up. I've seen this misbehavior for a while, through several updates of firefox. No other web app behaves this way.  </p><p>This has been happening for many months now and I can't wait for an update to fix it unless it's going to happen soon.  </p><p>Should I uninstall Firefox and switch to another browser or is this something that's going to fix soon???!!!??? </p><p>It's going to be a project to switch so once I do it I'm never coming back.
