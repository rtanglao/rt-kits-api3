Recently it started opening homepage on startup instead of the previous session even though the box in the settings that commands it to open previous windows is checked. I'm not sure if that is connected in any way to the most recent update, and the problem persists with all of the add-ons disabled. Curiously it restores previous session if the browser crashed instead of being closed. Browser settings are set to collect all history, and i can open the previous window manually, but it's just not how it's been working before and annoying. Any ideas on how to fix the problem?  </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",tamer18040105
