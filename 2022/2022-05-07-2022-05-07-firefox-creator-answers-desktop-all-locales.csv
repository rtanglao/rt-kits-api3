If I'm not mistaken, it used to be light gray before. How do I change it back?? It looks terrible and the tabs are barely readable when highlighted in blue.

When I changed any option in the fonts settings, the entire browser becomes Liberation Mono. I want Noto Sans be the default font for websites and for the Firefox UI. I tried to fix it by preforming a Firefox Refresh, but it didn't work.

I've been using Firefox as my daily driver web browser for at least a year, first on Windows and now more recently on Linux (specs below). The PC itself is the same, the only thing to change was the OS. Ever since moving to Linux, I've had this problem with crashing. I have two monitors and I will usually snap the browser to half of one screen while I do other things on the rest of my display space. However, most of the time when I try to drag the browser window off of its half of the screen, all of my Firefox windows crash, with an error message about not being able to send a crash report (see attached image). This has been happening with multiple browser versions, both the official repository release as well as the Flatpak. No other application has behaved like this. </p><p>System details:  OS: Manjaro Linux x86_64 Kernel: 5.17.1-3-MANJARO x86_64  DE: Plasma 5.24.4  WM: KWin  CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 1600X Memory: 15982.8 MiB GPU: AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT (amdgpu driver in use) </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1000;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1503192;,barathsandorgergo

I ask because the notification timeout is really fast if there are many notifications, it's impossible to properly read them all before they disappear and there's no obvious way to view notification history if at all. Also, if there are more notifications than what can fit in the available screen height you just don't see them. Additionally the Notifications are still white even when on a dark theme, this seems like something that should have been addressed a long time ago already. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1000;,firefox,other,en-US,1503148;,thesmashedpenguin

Example: websites where you are drilling down through filter options, or in Ancestry where you will typically open a record in the hints screen and scroll down through the detail.  The right scroll navigation causes the whole page to scroll up and down; there's no way to navigate down in the sub-display.  I have run FF in safe mode, and done a scorched-earth uninstall/reinstall and the problem persists even with no plug-ins restored.  This is on a machine running Windows 11.  The machine crashed right before this became a problem.  Sites work in Edge without issue. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1000;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1503128;1503131;1503138;,swalker7736

Mozilla Firefox supposed to be a Privacy Browser is not making business with Meta -&gt; Facebook, lately i really question the mental health of Mozilla, first a unique identifier, now a partnership with zucking facebook, what's next? Let me tell you something, if you are a privacy company then get the zuck away from companies who don't give a damn zuck about privacy -&gt; facebook, mozilla can NOT simply make a deal with facebook and claim ""oh dont worry it's ok your privacy is secure, bullsh!t. </p><p>You know what, i have been using Firefox since i first accessed the internet with a webbrowser, now hear this -&gt; one more negative thing from mozilla and that's it, bye mozilla you have lost your way. </p><p>While this is only me speaking here, MANY people have already quit firefox because of what mozilla has been doing recently. Continue what you are doing now, and soon your greatest product -&gt; firefox will be dead. When privacy partners with tracking &amp; spyware this is the definition of suicidal behaviour. I really worry about Mozillas Mental Health lately. </p><p>I will copy paste this post to a few other mozilla releated forums, let's see how long it stays on before censorship happens. </p><p><br> Here a few comments from reddit users on this topic: </p><p>The article says what it says, but we all have a long memory of Facebook/ Rebranded Facebook being a company that is horrible, and not to be trusted when they put out a press release. -Nailed it </p><p>I’ve been using Firefox since like 2002. I never stopped. I really hope I don’t have to soon. I will give them the benefit of the doubt. -Nailed it </p><p>Facebook is one company you should keep away as far as possible. -Nailed it </p><p>Then read the article, and see that this is a case of Mozilla working with Meta to maintain privacy. -This person must have mental issues, time to see a doctor asap! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1503119;1503173;1503182;1503195;,Firefox_Beginner

This happens whether I close Firefox with the X or using the Exit button or even if I keep it open and restart the computer.  My places file is 75MBs. I have the same one since 2014. I'm using Windows 10 and latest Firefox edition. Any ideas? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1000;,firefox,other,en-US,1503079;1503080;1503141;,exclusive01
