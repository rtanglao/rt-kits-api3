I've been using Firefox as my daily driver web browser for at least a year, first on Windows and now more recently on Linux (specs below).

However, most of the time when I try to drag the browser window off of its half of the screen, all of my Firefox windows crash, with an error message about not being able to send a crash report (see attached image).

Also, if there are more notifications than what can fit in the available screen height you just don't see them. Additionally the Notifications are still white even when on a dark theme, this seems like something that should have been addressed a long time ago already. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;feature-request;firefox-1000;,firefox,other,en-US,1503148;,thesmashedpenguin

This happens whether I close Firefox with the X or using the Exit button or even if I keep it open and restart the computer.  My places file is 75MBs. I have the same one since 2014. I'm using Windows 10 and latest Firefox edition. Any ideas? </p>",desktop;other;escalate;windows-10;dataloss;placescorruption;placessqlite;firefox-1000;,firefox,other,en-US,1503079;1503080;1503141;1503204;1503211;1503257;1503261;,exclusive01
