I've been using Firefox as my daily driver web browser for at least a year, first on Windows and now more recently on Linux (specs below).

I have two monitors and I will usually snap the browser to half of one screen while I do other things on the rest of my display space. However, most of the time when I try to drag the browser window off of its half of the screen, all of my Firefox windows crash, with an error message about not being able to send a crash report (see attached image).

Also, if there are more notifications than what can fit in the available screen height you just don't see them. Additionally the Notifications are still white even when on a dark theme, this seems like something that should have been addressed a long time ago already. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;feature-request;firefox-1000;,firefox,other,en-US,1503148;,thesmashedpenguin
