I've freshly installed ubuntu, pop_os and Manjaro. All 3 crash within minutes of starting up firefox. mind you these are fresh installs and there is no cache to clear and no extensions or addons. And what is stranger is the fact that only on Manjaro, firefox is excruciatingly slow. to the point of almost unusable. Is there any thing i can do, or, can anyone help me with this? its been going on for several months. thank you for your help and time Alchamech </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1556737;1556739;1556745;,xalchamechx
