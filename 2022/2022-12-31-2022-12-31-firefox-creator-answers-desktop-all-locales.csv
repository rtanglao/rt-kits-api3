Once I closed the video and unmuted the tab with the podcast, it still is not making any sound. Other websites such as youtube are still making sound correctly. The podcast website's volume bar is NOT muted, I have also confirmed my windows 10 audio settings are configured properly still. So far to fix this issue I have tried: 1. muting and unmuting the tab again by right clicking on it. 2. closing the podcast and opening it in a new firefox window. 3. checking my windows volume mixer, which is not muted and shows no audio output from firefox despite the podcast playing (according to the progress bar on google podcasts). 4. clearing the firefox cache/cookies for <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> 5. signing out and back in to google. 6. completely closing and reopening firefox (I did restore session to keep other windows I have open, though). 7. unplugging and re-inserting my headphones. 8. looking through relevant support topics on this site. 9. Disabling my adblock add-on and reloading the page. </p><p>I'm hoping for some additional suggestions to try to fix this, I believe the above list shows I've tried all standard/obvious fixes, but maybe there is something I'm unaware of. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",smith4e4

Suljin kaikki laitteet. Ajoin Cclearin. Mietin asiaa. Tulin siihen päätökseen että joku oli hakkeroinut minut käyttäen Youtuben sivustoa ja päässyt bluethoot laitteeseeni käsiksi. (Olin peittänyt läppärini kamerat.) Kysymykseni kuuluukin mitä voin tehdä estääkseni jatkossa tämmöisen ikävän tapahtuman? Käyttääkö hakkerit jotain määrättyä kaavaa, tai videoita tähän? Lisäksi youtubea katsoessani näytölle tuli popup-ilmoitus jossa luki että on tullut uusi websoitin jonka saa ilmaiseksi tässä. En ajatellut sitä silloin kun painoin ei-nappia.
