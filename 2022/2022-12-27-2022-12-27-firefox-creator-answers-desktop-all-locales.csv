In the settings, I only have the option to enable or disable both (see the attached screenshot). </p><p>I would appreciate it if search and form history could be disabled or enabled separately. </p><p>The reason this is important to me is that when logging into websites, I often use [personal handle]+[website]@[email provider] as my email address so I can avoid spam if that site's data gets leaked. However, firefox' form history stores each +[website] as a separate entry, resulting in an impractically long drop-down menu. While it doesn't break anything, it does mean choosing between not using search history or having my screen fill up with a large, useless, attention grabbing drop-down element every time I have to log in. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",philabdapi

Since the latest update, Firefox will stutter, freeze itself, and on several occasions freeze the entire computer when playing videos.

I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, but no change in behavior. On today's occurence, I was barely able to bring up Task Manager and kill the Firefox process. On at least one occurence, I got a Windows BSOD (very rare these days). Never had this issue until very recently so I assume (yes, I know...) it's associated with a recent update.

I moved every cache and config to a new place so it would create new ones and failed the same way. I created a new user for the system and it would fail the same way. Downloaded Firefox from the site and it would fail the same way. Then I downloaded Firefox, Thunderbird and Tor-Browser as flatpaks and those worked fine. I copied my backups profiles over the flatpak newly generated ones and it still was working fine. </p><p><strong>What I know at this point:</strong> My profiles, cache and configs are not the problem as those worked at flatpak installations. Whatever the problem is it only affects firefox and derivatives installed running directly over the system as flatpaks operates over its own libraries and runtimes. Whatever the problem is no other software seams to be affected by it. It does not look like it is a problem with a newer version of firefox since it has updated a few times since the problem started, both minor and major versions. It looks like it is not a Firefox (and derivatives) problem by itself but something that is wrong with some other dependency in the system. </p><p>To be clear: everything was working fine for years up until recently, like 2016-ish. </p><p>Note: I know Tor-Browser is not developed by Mozilla.

I have attempted to clear cache and history and turned off all of my extensions. I've also re-installed Firefox. </p><p>The closest thing I have to a solution is that it has something to do with my home internet (wifi not hardwired) and/or region (Australia). For example, when the sites don't load I've tested turning on a VPN for the US, which then allows the sites to load just fine.  </p><p>Is this some sort of DNS issue or something that I can change in the router or on my desktop?
