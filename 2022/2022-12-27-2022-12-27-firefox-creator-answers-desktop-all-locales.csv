However today I find all my saved passwords have gone. On researching this I see they may be in an old Firefox data on the desktop. Checking this there is a directory there dated 22/12/2022 which is when I did the refresh. Brilliant! But when I go into about:profiles it doesn't give me the option to ""launch profile in new browser"" which is what I think I need to do. Any help very gratefully received. Thank you.

How do I make this go away? </p><p>The ribbon contains a Microsoft search bar (DuckDuckGo is my default), and other icons like sign-in, settings, etc.  This ribbon takes up valuable viewing space -- about an inch high.

I have attempted to clear cache and history and turned off all of my extensions. I've also re-installed Firefox. </p><p>The closest thing I have to a solution is that it has something to do with my home internet (wifi not hardwired) and/or region (Australia). For example, when the sites don't load I've tested turning on a VPN for the US, which then allows the sites to load just fine.  </p><p>Is this some sort of DNS issue or something that I can change in the router or on my desktop?
