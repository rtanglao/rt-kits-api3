A week or so ago I notice that sync was not happening and when I tried to access my Firefox account found that the password was not accepted - even though it was securely stored on the iPhone ""passwords"" list. I had to create a new Firefox password, however, all my other internet passwords that were stored on Firefox have been lost. It is possible for these to be restored?

For instance if I search in the toolbar (google is the default) it won't complete the search, it will just think a bit then revert to a 'new tab' page as if the search never existed (<a href=""http://bing.com"" rel=""nofollow"">bing.com</a> works fine). Or if I go to my gmail account, it'll slowly load the envelope loading screen but will never complete. This is an intermittent issue throughout the day/night where suddenly I just can't load gmail or google search for 20 or so minutes. </p><p>I am able to get to google photos and calendar, etc. but not gmail or google search. </p><p>I am able to load those in other browsers such as Edge. I have attempted to clear cache and history and turned off all of my extensions. I've also re-installed Firefox. </p><p>The closest thing I have to a solution is that it has something to do with my home internet (wifi not hardwired) and/or region (Australia). For example, when the sites don't load I've tested turning on a VPN for the US, which then allows the sites to load just fine.  </p><p>Is this some sort of DNS issue or something that I can change in the router or on my desktop? It's very curious that it's only those two sites that don't work (gmail and google search). </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1555879;1555880;1555883;,StaghAus

It all worked, because I could just sync it, but now a month later I had to reinstall Windows and... I can't sync my browser. </p><p>I've tried every password I could think of.  I can't recall if I wrote it down somewhere last time, or changed it since, but I'm pretty sure I'm using the right email.  Right now I'm logged in with another account. </p><p>And while I see a tab session saved from last month, which is unfortunately a little out of date but better than nothing, I don't see any saved bookmarks from this year.  Just one from a year ago.  I have no idea what's happened exactly, but I wasn't as careful this time because the sync worked so recently.   </p><p>Now I'm stuck!  I have some very important bookmark folders saved, that are key to all my projects basically.  I can't just start fresh.  But I can't log in, can't find any password change written down in my notes, which I may just have forgotten to note down.  And I can't find any contact for Firefox support.   </p><p>I do value security when it comes to handling my data but there must be a way to verify who I am, and change the password using my email? </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,sync,en-US,1555885;,pk3
