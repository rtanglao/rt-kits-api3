It all worked, because I could just sync it, but now a month later I had to reinstall Windows and... I can't sync my browser. </p><p>I've tried every password I could think of.  I can't recall if I wrote it down somewhere last time, or changed it since, but I'm pretty sure I'm using the right email.  Right now I'm logged in with another account. </p><p>And while I see a tab session saved from last month, which is unfortunately a little out of date but better than nothing, I don't see any saved bookmarks from this year.  Just one from a year ago.  I have no idea what's happened exactly, but I wasn't as careful this time because the sync worked so recently.   </p><p>Now I'm stuck!  I have some very important bookmark folders saved, that are key to all my projects basically.  I can't just start fresh.  But I can't log in, can't find any password change written down in my notes, which I may just have forgotten to note down.  And I can't find any contact for Firefox support.   </p><p>I do value security when it comes to handling my data but there must be a way to verify who I am, and change the password using my email? </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",pk3
