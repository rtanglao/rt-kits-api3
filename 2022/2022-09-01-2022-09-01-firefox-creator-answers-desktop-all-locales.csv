Error msg ""Firefox is already running, but is not responding. ..."".  I have to first active the firefox window and then use Ctrl+N, which is very annoying considering someone has to open/close many new windows a day.   </p><p>Details: Here is my environment: in windows 10, say, I have three copies of firefox programs with their own profiles for different purposes. Something like this: D:\Firefox 1, this is the firefox program itself. D:\Firefox 2 D:\Firefox 3 D:\Profiles\1, this is the profile folder named as ""1"" D:\Profiles\2 D:\Profiles\3 </p><p>I then use shortcut to launch each firefox, creating a shortcut then add options in the target line.  Like this: D:\Firefox 1\firefox.exe -no-remote -profile D:\Profiles\1 D:\Firefox 2\firefox.exe -no-remote -profile D:\Profiles\2 D:\Firefox 3\firefox.exe -no-remote -profile D:\Profiles\3 </p><p>I then use autohotkey to designate a particular hotkey to each firefox. Like this: Alt+1, launch firefox 1 Alt+2, launch firefox 2 Alt+3, launch firefox 3 </p><p>The overall goal is to have complete separate operations.  </p><p>The issue, I first use alt+1 or double click the shortcut with launch options to launch a firefox. Then, if I need to open another window of an already running firefox, which is minimized to the taskbar, I have to first activate the firefox window and then click ctrl+n. If I use the Alt+1 or double click the shortcut with launch options, an error msg pops saying, ""Firefox is already running, but is not responding. ...""
