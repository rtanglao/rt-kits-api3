As part of our solution, we provide a HTML document in which we embed the URLs of our web application. This HTML document can be opened locally, but, it tries to contact our application for Login validation. As part of that it needs to access the JSESSION_ID.  </p><p>Before Total Cookie Protection was made default, the application was working fine. But, after making it default, we are observing 2 behaviors which are breaking our application. Those 2 behaviors are: 1. When we click on a button to open the document, nothing happens. We checked the console logs and the network tab in the Browser developer tool, but we couldn't find anything. 2. Sometimes, browser is sending wrong JSESSSION_ID. Here also, we couldn't find anything in browser developer tool.  </p><p>Once, we disable Total Cookie Protection both the above problems goes away. We checked Firefox's documentation : <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API</a>) and we found that our application has un-partitioned storage to cookie jars.  </p><p>We are looking for pointers on how to fix this problem. Thank you. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;website-breakages;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",karthikeyahs

The extension is working if I select the manifest.json from the about:debugging temporary add button. Or when I try to upload the xpi file from my computer. The environment that I'm currently working on is Linux with RedHat distribution 7.9. </p><p>I have he following configuration directories:  </p> <ul><li> Bulleted list item /usr/lib64/firefox/defaults/pref/autoconfig.js which contains the following properties(pref(""toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets"", true); </li></ul> <p>pref(""general.config.obscure_value"", 0); pref(""general.config.filename"", ""firefox.cfg""); </p> <ul><li> Bulleted list item /usr/lib64/firefox/firefox.cfg which contains the following properties: </li></ul> <p>pref(""extensions.autoDisableScopes"", 0); pref(""extensions.enabledScopes"", 15); </p><p>The custom extensions is packed in an .xpi file which is located in /home/&lt;user&gt;/.mozilla/extensions/preventrightclick/preventrightclick.xpi </p><p>The content of the preventrightclick.xpi is in the images below. I've tried multiple locations for this xpi in order to be automatically installed, such as: /usr/share/mozilla/extensions/preventrightclick/preventrightclick.xpi /home/&lt;user&gt;/.mozilla/firefox/&lt;profileId&gt;/extensions/preventrightclick.xpi Nothing worked, strange is that the extensions can be installed manually. </p><p>If you have any clues, or what could I try, please let me know.

Any solutions?  </p><p>Short ver. of the problem: with a designated profile, I cannot launch a new window of an already running firefox using shortcut. Error msg ""Firefox is already running, but is not responding. ..."".  I have to first active the firefox window and then use Ctrl+N, which is very annoying considering someone has to open/close many new windows a day.   </p><p>Details: Here is my environment: in windows 10, say, I have three copies of firefox programs with their own profiles for different purposes. Something like this: D:\Firefox 1, this is the firefox program itself. D:\Firefox 2 D:\Firefox 3 D:\Profiles\1, this is the profile folder named as ""1"" D:\Profiles\2 D:\Profiles\3 </p><p>I then use shortcut to launch each firefox, creating a shortcut then add options in the target line.  Like this: D:\Firefox 1\firefox.exe -no-remote -profile D:\Profiles\1 D:\Firefox 2\firefox.exe -no-remote -profile D:\Profiles\2 D:\Firefox 3\firefox.exe -no-remote -profile D:\Profiles\3 </p><p>I then use autohotkey to designate a particular hotkey to each firefox. Like this: Alt+1, launch firefox 1 Alt+2, launch firefox 2 Alt+3, launch firefox 3 </p><p>The overall goal is to have complete separate operations.  </p><p>The issue, I first use alt+1 or double click the shortcut with launch options to launch a firefox. Then, if I need to open another window of an already running firefox, which is minimized to the taskbar, I have to first activate the firefox window and then click ctrl+n. If I use the Alt+1 or double click the shortcut with launch options, an error msg pops saying, ""Firefox is already running, but is not responding. ..."" The ideal behavior is to use shortcut to launch a new window.  </p><p>Thank you guys! </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-1000;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",moneykor
