I am now 70 years old and my best time of the evening is when I watch my Netflix series or a movie. Since 2 nights ago, however, Firefox is blocking access on both my laptops with the message ""Did not Connect: Potential Security Risk"" and it doesn't allow me to bypass this. It is very upsetting and I cannot understand why Netflix would suddenly have become a security risk. My son--in-law in the UK talked me through how to load another browser, which I did, and was then able to watch Netflix. The other browser didn't block it! So why does yours. I quite frankly would prefer to continue to keep Firefox as my default browser, but it seems silly to have to use a second browser just to watch Netflix? Your assistance in sorting out this problem would be very much appreciated. Thank you Sue Taylor (Ms) </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1000;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1504419;1504470;1504492;,suechoochoo
