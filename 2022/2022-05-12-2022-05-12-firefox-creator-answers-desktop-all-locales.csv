Help!","<p>Apparently, yesterday at 9:03AM, Firefox download 8 blank HTM files. I have not clicked on them to see what they are. I do not know where they came from. They have random file names and when I right click to read the properties, it says zero bytes. I have already googled this question a billion different ways, but I have come up with nothing. </p><p>I have virus scanned it, but it found nothing. </p><p>I do not know where these came from. I was at work at 9:03AM yesterday, and I never download anything from random sites, and like I said, I wasn't even on my computer yesterday at that time to download anything.
