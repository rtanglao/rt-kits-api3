In Settings/General/Applications, the 'mailto"" gives only the options ""always ask"", ""Firefox (default)"" and ""use other"". Previously the option to select Gmail was there. In fact, the list of applications only has 6 items instead of the numerous ones that were there previously. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-990;,firefox,other,en-US,"",lindabknight

I've spent hours on the phone with Apple customer support and they can't fix it.  I can login to my Mac Mail via <a href=""http://icloud.com"" rel=""nofollow"">icloud.com</a> when using a browser, but not on my computer itself.  I think it's related to the 99.0 update (just based on the timing) but Apple isn't sure.  My OS is High Sierra (10.13.6).  Has anyone had a similar experience after updating?  Any suggestions?  Does Mozilla have a customer support number that I can call and talk to someone?  I couldn't find a phone number under Contact Us.  Thanks for the help! </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1013;firefox-990;,firefox,other,en-US,1496095;,dfb9165

This doesn't happen with Google Chrome or MS Edge browsers.  Also, other Amazon pages seem to work OK.  I've tried restarting my computer, clear the cache, and start Firefox in troubleshooting mode, but none worked.
