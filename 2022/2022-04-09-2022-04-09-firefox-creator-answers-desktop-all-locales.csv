This doesn't happen with Google Chrome or MS Edge browsers.  Also, other Amazon pages seem to work OK.  I've tried restarting my computer, clear the cache, and start Firefox in troubleshooting mode, but none worked.  Any ideas on what's going on and how to fix this? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-990;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1496050;,andrakin8
