Nevertheless, the first attempt at entering a search immediately called up millions of the things. At Chrome, I have learned a sequence of eight clicks, whereby I can, for just that one search, avoid those hideous suggestions. If I could have a no-click option at Firefox, I would stay here. Otherwise, can you tell me how to uninst... no, I can first have another look in Windows settings. Looked through the C drive, but I recall now there is an ""uninstall programs"" facility in Windows. So, if you are able to tell me how to switch off the suggestions, I will stay at Fireofox. If not, I won't. I can remember a Google (or Chrome) person talking on TV, about 15 yrs ago, about this new thing they had (search suggestions) that everyone would love. Four or five seconds into his talk, I knew that I hated it, and have never moved a millimeter away from that position. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",mishasibiryak

I could not find the magic setting that allow to changing this behaviour...  I do not use themes, so I do not mind changing something there if needed. </p><p>Could any guru help here please ?
