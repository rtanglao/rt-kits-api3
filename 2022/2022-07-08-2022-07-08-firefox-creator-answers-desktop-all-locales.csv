Stessa cosa con lo strumento cattura in Firefox. Il problema è occorso dopo l'ultimo aggiornamento..mi date qualche consiglio? Ho provato anche a cercare sul web qualche soluzione ma non vorrei tutte le volte che devo acquisire un'immagine pigiare tasti sulla tastiera che, tra l'altro, vengono inviati agli appunti (One note). Vorrei disattivare anche questo perché le immagini acquisite dovrebbero andare sui download, come è sempre accaduto. Non capisco perché sia accaduto questo a complicare il tutto..grazie a chi vorrà rispondere a questa domanda :-) </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,customize,it,"",flavie2070

I would like to transfer ALL of the open tabs to Computer2, before re-partitioning the C Drive in Computer1. </p><p>The problem is, my Computer1's Windows 10 is giving me problems at the moment, so I can not get into the computer by logging in.  No recovery or diagnosis method will do the trick, so I will have to reinstall a fresh copy of Windows into Computer1.  Besides, the computer was troubling me for having only ~50 MB available space in the C Drive (I have multiple partitions in my hard drive). </p><p>For now, I have removed the hard drive from Computer1, attached it in Computer2, and have access to the data in the various Computer1's drives. </p><p>I read many articles here in the Support Mozilla help site to restore the 100+ open tabs from Computer1, into Computer 2, but it is not working for me.  I even tried copying the entire ""sessionstore-backups"" folder from Computer1's location, and replacing the same folder in Computer2's location. </p><p>Maybe I have to do more than just copying the ""sessionstore-backups"" folder, like do something additional through FireFox options?? </p><p>Any help would be appreciated. </p><p>And here is the location of the ""sessionstore-backups"" folder in both computers: </p><p><br> Computer1 K:\Users\Team Umizoomi\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\jrvowkxo.default\sessionstore-backups </p><p>Computer2 C:\Users\einstein jr\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\x9z76c15.default-release-1\sessionstore-backups </p>",windows-7;desktop;tabs;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",lucky11
