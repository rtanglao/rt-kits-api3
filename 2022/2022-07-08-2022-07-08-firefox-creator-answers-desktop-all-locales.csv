( Yes. we can turn off the subtitle as needed). Wonder Firefox offer a solution where the subtitle is played in the original tab and the pop-out pip window can choose to show subtitle or not ? Thank you. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",dimof18187

Stessa cosa con lo strumento cattura in Firefox. Il problema è occorso dopo l'ultimo aggiornamento..mi date qualche consiglio? Ho provato anche a cercare sul web qualche soluzione ma non vorrei tutte le volte che devo acquisire un'immagine pigiare tasti sulla tastiera che, tra l'altro, vengono inviati agli appunti (One note). Vorrei disattivare anche questo perché le immagini acquisite dovrebbero andare sui download, come è sempre accaduto. Non capisco perché sia accaduto questo a complicare il tutto..grazie a chi vorrà rispondere a questa domanda :-) </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,customize,it,1517987;,flavie2070

No recovery or diagnosis method will do the trick, so I will have to reinstall a fresh copy of Windows into Computer1.  Besides, the computer was troubling me for having only ~50 MB available space in the C Drive (I have multiple partitions in my hard drive). </p><p>For now, I have removed the hard drive from Computer1, attached it in Computer2, and have access to the data in the various Computer1's drives. </p><p>I read many articles here in the Support Mozilla help site to restore the 100+ open tabs from Computer1, into Computer 2, but it is not working for me.
