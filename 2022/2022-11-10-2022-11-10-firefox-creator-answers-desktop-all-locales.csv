I am marking up a converted web page (Waze) with the tool with the pencil icon.  That starts out OK.  However, after a while, it gets into a mode in which it thinks I am trying to select some of my previous markings.  Once a box has been selected all I can do is move the content or delete it.  I do not want to do that.  I want to make new marks nearby.  It seems to be impossible.  The only way I have managed to get around the problem is to save the PDF to a file and then reload it.  But that only lasts for a while until it gets back into the mode in which it thinks I am trying to select some of my new marks. </p><p>I don't know what is getting it into the selection mode or how to get out once there.  There are no clues in the menu.

Now it seems to just be an unmaintained afterthough with minimal functionality and no thought to accuracy.  </p><p>is there any way we can go back to a accurate, concise and functional HISTORY?
