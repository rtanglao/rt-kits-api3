Big mistake. I had 4 windows open and for some reason, Firefox decides to only save 3. I lost my main window with a few hundred tabs open. I realized that when I opened firefox back up and immediately wanted to restore it using Recently Closed Windows, which usually works, but not this time, because it's been 4 windows. I backed up the sessionstore-backups folder but it seems like the ""upgrade"" files are too large for it to handle and the recovery files don't contain the missing window.  </p><p>Help? </p><p>On Windows 11, latest version, lots of addons including tree-style-tab, so empty header tabs are in the file for my pinned tabs. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,other,en-US,1546810;,creak1
