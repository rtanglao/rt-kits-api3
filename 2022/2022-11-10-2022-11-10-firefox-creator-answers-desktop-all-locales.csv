Mi è già capitato altre volte e con ""cronologia - finestre chiuse di recente"" ho sempre rimediato all'errore. Oggi, purtroppo no: se clicco su ""finestre chiuse di recente"" non succede nulla e nulla appare. Tra l'altro, mi è impossibile ripristinare le schede perse con la mancata apertura della seconda finestre: sono scomparse dalla cronologia recente! Ho guardato un po' gli articoli  in merito. Sempre in ""cronologia"" dovrei trovare questo ""ripristina la sessione precedente"", ma non c'è neanche quello. Ho letto quanto scritto in ""<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/Ripristino%20della%20sessione#w_risoluzione-dei-problemi"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/Ripristino%20della%20sessione#w_risoluzione-dei-problemi</a>"", ma non mi è servito a risolvere il problema e infatti ho visto che qualcuno ha copiato i files recovery.jsonlz4 e previous.jsonlz4 dalla cartella C:\Users\XXXXX\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\d71f000a.default\sessionstore-backups, ma non trovo la cartella. Come si fa? E, comunque, come ripristinare le funzioni ""cronologia - finestre chiuse di recente"" e ""cronologia - ripristina la sessione precedente"", per non incorrere nello stesso problema in futuro? </p><p>Grazie per l'aiuto che mi darete </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,other,it,"",sangdelan

After clearing Site Data (as advised by site support) still same problem. Tried on MS Edge and it loads OK, so back to FireFox.... switch on troubleshoot mode and try again after clearing site data again (all cookies allowed) Game now reports error and stops during load, as do other games from same supplier.... so I've made things worse ! So this stop may not be the cause of original problem.    Captured Console , which means little to me but does contain lots of errors, but I seem to recall looking at this before and lots of errors seemed harmless.     Will go back to non troubleshoot mode and capture log again.
