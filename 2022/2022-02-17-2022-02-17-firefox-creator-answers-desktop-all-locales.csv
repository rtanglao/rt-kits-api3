I did find it places that thumbnail image as a PNG file in the of %LOCALAPPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\. </p><p>Has there been any updates on this? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",windows-7;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-960;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",ACZano

Any time I used a bookmark or typed in a website, it would start to load and just sit at a blank screen continuing to load but not doing anything.  I checked in another browser and it worked just fine, so it’s not my internet.  I’ve tried closing and re-opening firefox, any time I open it now it says it’s already running and I need to close the previous session. I have tried un-installing and re-installing firefox, clearing my history and cookie cache, and restarting my laptop multiple times but nothing is working.  I would appreciate any help with this, thank you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1484245;1484248;1484250;1484251;1484253;1484254;,zsromisher

I have it set as my default browser. </p><p>When I say it ""does not start"" I mean the hourglass is shown for a few seconds, then nothing.  Task Manager does not show Firefox running. </p><p>Since about 5 days ago it will not start when I click its icon on my taskbar or when I click on a link in an email.  Both of these used to work.  I have also typed Firefox into the Windows search box and clicked the icon then shown, but it does not start. </p><p>I have googled the problem and tried a number of things, such as re-installing. </p><p>When I do <em>Windows-button &amp; R</em> to get the Run box, enter “firefox.exe -P” and click OK, the profile program does not start. </p><p>When I run ""Firefox Installer.exe"" it goes through process and ends with Firefox open.  That is how I was able to get in to get the Troubleshooting Information.  However, I do not want to start it this way all the time, and it would not work on links in emails. </p><p>I could not find how to add Tags. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,other,en-US,1484236;,LarsB

If you go there with Firefox, clicking on the 'Premium' button near the top right does not result in the price updating.  I don't have this problem with Chrome. </p><p>Another example is the AMC Stubs site where I was unable to purchase a membership after several attempts (including rebooting my system).  Did it with Chrome in moments.  However, once I created the account using Chrome, I can now log in using Firefox. </p><p>Yet another example is the Vanguard site (investments) where I have not been able to log in using Firefox for the last few months (had done it for years before this): <a href=""https://investor.vanguard.com/home"" rel=""nofollow"">https://investor.vanguard.com/home</a> .  The site just ignores any clicks I make. </p><p>So... what could be causing this? </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-970;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1484240;,jrlind55
