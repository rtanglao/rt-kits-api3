Any time I used a bookmark or typed in a website, it would start to load and just sit at a blank screen continuing to load but not doing anything.  I checked in another browser and it worked just fine, so it’s not my internet.  I’ve tried closing and re-opening firefox, any time I open it now it says it’s already running and I need to close the previous session. I have tried un-installing and re-installing firefox, clearing my history and cookie cache, and restarting my laptop multiple times but nothing is working.  I would appreciate any help with this, thank you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",zsromisher

I have it set as my default browser. </p><p>When I say it ""does not start"" I mean the hourglass is shown for a few seconds, then nothing.  Task Manager does not show Firefox running. </p><p>Since about 5 days ago it will not start when I click its icon on my taskbar or when I click on a link in an email.  Both of these used to work.  I have also typed Firefox into the Windows search box and clicked the icon then shown, but it does not start. </p><p>I have googled the problem and tried a number of things, such as re-installing. </p><p>When I do <em>Windows-button &amp; R</em> to get the Run box, enter “firefox.exe -P” and click OK, the profile program does not start. </p><p>When I run ""Firefox Installer.exe"" it goes through process and ends with Firefox open.  That is how I was able to get in to get the Troubleshooting Information.  However, I do not want to start it this way all the time, and it would not work on links in emails. </p><p>I could not find how to add Tags. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,other,en-US,1484236;,LarsB

If you go there with Firefox, clicking on the 'Premium' button near the top right does not result in the price updating.  I don't have this problem with Chrome. </p><p>Another example is the AMC Stubs site where I was unable to purchase a membership after several attempts (including rebooting my system).  Did it with Chrome in moments.  However, once I created the account using Chrome, I can now log in using Firefox. </p><p>Yet another example is the Vanguard site (investments) where I have not been able to log in using Firefox for the last few months (had done it for years before this): <a href=""https://investor.vanguard.com/home"" rel=""nofollow"">https://investor.vanguard.com/home</a> .  The site just ignores any clicks I make. </p><p>So... what could be causing this? </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-970;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1484240;,jrlind55

I erased part of the URL that my password manager uses to let me log into Foxfire.  This is what's left: <a href=""https://accounts.firefox.com/oauth/signin?response_type=code&amp;scope=openid"" rel=""nofollow"">https://accounts.firefox.com/oauth/signin?response_type=code&amp;scope=openid</a> Please see the added image below for the error page/message I now land on. I don't need to get to my account page.  I know how to access that from the ""hamburger"" I'm want the URL that would show up after I had created account and set my username and password. . If possible can you send me something that I can cut and paste into the address window in my password manager?   Also my password and email still work.  But the only other URLs that will let me in with them is the landing page for Pocket and the Mozilla Help page. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",lgr282
