I entered my email for my Firefox account and then my password. I was sent a verification code. I entered the code. Fiefox said the password was incorrect but sent me another verification code and again told me my password was incorrect. This process would repeat over and over again. I can't get into my account. I need my bookmarks and passwords. What is going on. Firefox even saved the account email and password when I entered it. I will quit using this browser if I can't get my account back. I don't trust Firefox anymore. Thanks </p>,desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1010;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",david-bozzi
