A la hora de acceder con un certificado digital, si no elijo la opción de guarda el certificado, el navegador me pregunta una y otra vez que certificado quiero usar cuando navego por la pagina en cuestión. He probado con otros certificados mismo resultado. He comprobado que los certificados estuvieran en validez y todavía les quedan tiempo para su vencimiento. He borrado todos los datos de navegación, cookies etc, sin resultado alguno. El único parche que he encontrado es: - Acceder desde una ventana privada y guardar la elección del certificado. Así cuando vuelvas a abrir el navegador te vuelva a pedir el certificado. (evitando la opción de ir a ajustes/privacidad/ver certificados/decisiones de autenticación/eliminar). ¿Cual podría ser la solución? </p><p>Muchas gracias de antemano. </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-917;firefox-9170;,firefox,privacy-and-security,es,"",ayoseguacia

After a recent automatic update to Firefox 91.10.0esr, some websites will not load (just sit with a blank page, showing flicking loading symbol). Examples are <a href=""http://ocado.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ocado.com</a> and <a href=""http://abelandcole.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">abelandcole.co.uk</a>. I have tried all the usual things to fix, including, switching off VPN, clearing cookies and caches, running in safe mode, all with no success.  Both sites run fine in Vivaldi and Brave.  I have eventually got the pages to load by disabling IPv6 in Firefox.  Clearly there is a problem with 91.10.0esr. I'm not sure whether the workaround of disabling IPv6 might cause other problems or weaken security or privacy? </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",chrisorme

Does anybody recommend using another browser? Then how come? The Google Voice search doesn't work even on the Chrome Based. browsers?
