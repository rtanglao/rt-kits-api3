It is worth noting that, all of the browsers worked perfectly fine before. However, after roughly 3 weeks of regularly seeing that all of the browsers on my Windows 10 PC (Opera, Firefox, Tor) <strong>except Chrome browser</strong> don't seem to start up. When I run Firefox.exe, it opens for a fraction of a second, displays a text box, and then closes. I tried recording my screen to understand what's written more clearly, and it said ""Profile Missing"". But not the familiar profile missing error. this one closes immediately, and with no text, only the title. It is also important to mention that all of the files associated with the browser also won't open, except helper.exe. For example, this command ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"" -P to open the profile manager will show the same error. </p><p><em>Things I tried:</em> </p><p><strong>1.  Refreshing the browser.</strong> <strong>2.  Uninstalling and reinstalling.</strong> <strong>3.  Removing the appdata profiles folder.</strong> <strong>4.  Installing other versions of Firefox.</strong> <strong>5.  Scanning for malware with 3 different Antivirus programs.</strong> </p><p>And so far non of these methods worked. I would like to get an answer on how to fix this. Thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",alonalush5
