When I booted the next morning everything had gone haywire. I could not open any bookmarked in Firefox. I would click on a link in my Most Visited bookmark and a tab would open but nothing would happen. I could click on a link in an e-mail (Thunderbird) and the same thing would happen. I am able to run MS Edge without any problems. My Firefox version is 105.0.3 (64-bit) and my windows version is Win10 Pro version 21H2. I cannot figure out what has happened and don't want to lose Firefox. </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1050;firefox-10503;,firefox,other,en-US,"",AZCowboy
