If I close then re-open Firefox everything worked fine for a minute or two, then the tabs crashed again. Clicking on the restore tab button had no effect. A few days later, this stopped happening and everything seemed OK, then there was another Firefox upgrade and the whole thing started again. I've had Firefox for about fifteen years and don't want to move to another browser, but I can't keep switching it on and off like this, it's annoying and a waste of time. I've had to start using Edge, where this problem doesn't exist. I've tried various solutions but nothing seems to work. The only thing that may explain it is that I've noticed in Task manager that the Ethernet throughput is far too high - the leaks go through the top limit. Can anybody help?

After some time browsing the site, the webserver went away - the particulars are irrelevant, suffice to say that I can no longer connect to the images' origin host. I'm now trying to save the images I've already opened, and which Firefox has downloaded and is displaying in tabs, but am baffled that I cannot do that: </p> <ul><li> Firefox has definitely downloaded the image and it exists in its cache, either in memory or on disk. I can see each opened image in full resolution in its individual tab. The URL displayed in the location bar would download as a plain `image/jpeg` file, if the webserver were still available to me. </li><li> When I try to save the image, Firefox always insists on downloading a fresh copy. This happens regardless of the method used to save the image; I've tested File &gt; Save Page As, context-menu &gt; Save Image As, drag &amp; drop into Windows Explorer. </li><li> The only way to ""rescue"" the image from Firefox is to copy the image to the clipboard, paste it into an image editor and save it under a new name. Needless to say, this is extremely cumbersome, loses any metadata associated with the image and is unlikely to create an accurate copy of the original image (recompression, missing color-space information, etc.). </li></ul> <p>Is there a way to make Firefox save the image-opened-in-a-tab to my computer, without asking the origin server for a more recent version? I just want what's already displayed on my screen... </p><p><br> </p><p>P.S.: You can observe this behavior in a standard Firefox without any user-installed addons; it is not specific to Waterfox or any addon. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,1541786;1541800;1541807;,jens55
