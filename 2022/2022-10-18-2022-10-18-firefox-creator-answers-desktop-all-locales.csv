Starting yesterday for some reason Firefox stopped doing the Fill-in part. I've check all my info and its all still in there it just isn't getting from there to my Log In screens like it should?  And to cut out this needless babble, it is NOT my computer! Cause guess what, I also have Chrome and my saved password function works just fine with them. Which is why I have both, it must be a really funny Business Lunch where you and Google flip a coin to see who is going to play dumb this week. </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-1050;firefox-10503;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",sercouwis2004
