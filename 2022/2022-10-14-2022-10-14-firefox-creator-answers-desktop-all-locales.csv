Lately, however, I don't know if with the latest versions, it seems that firefox does not recognize the printer. Let me explain better by giving the example. I opened firefox&gt; I launched a print from my Epson TM-T20&gt; I go to about: config and look for the word EPSON and it shows me all the settings that I could change for this particular printer. For some time or in any case on some PCs (not all), if I do this procedure and then look for the configurations of my EPSON, it will no longer show me all the configurations ... as if it had not found it and therefore it does not give them to me modify ... I am forced to modify the print settings at the general level but here I do not find all the ones that interest me. Can anyone tell me why? how can i restore the old functionality. In the attached image, you can see the strings that I no longer see and that I see regularly on other PCs where I did the same installation. Thanks in advance for the reply. </p>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",cesare.console

What's better getting a unique identifier or downloading from the archive and accepting potential risk? None of this would be necessary if mozilla didn't push a unique identifier. </p><p>When downloading from the archive the sha512 and sha256 always match the installer, doesn't mean anything if the site itself has been compromised i guess? Then again why would it be compromised? Seriously? I could download the fire installer from the official site and from the archive and compare if both sha512 and sha256 match each other, if so i guess no compromise and no token, right? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1050;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1540750;1540753;,Firefox_Beginner
