I found it's located here: C:\users\user\appdata\local\temp\7zsc6e8770c\setup.exe Now what is this and what does it do? What happens if i grant it network access, what data does it send to Mozilla and why? </p><p>I want to use this opportunity to also ask about defaultuseragent.exe, why does it even exist?

Also you warned me that downloading from these sites can be insecure because the sites might be vulnerable to ""hackers"" or might have been ""infiltrated"" by third partys. What's better getting a unique identifier or downloading from the archive and accepting potential risk? None of this would be necessary if mozilla didn't push a unique identifier. </p><p>When downloading from the archive the sha512 and sha256 always match the installer, doesn't mean anything if the site itself has been compromised i guess? Then again why would it be compromised? Seriously? I could download the fire installer from the official site and from the archive and compare if both sha512 and sha256 match each other, if so i guess no compromise and no token, right? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1050;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1540750;1540753;,Firefox_Beginner

This is where Firefox comes in by not being a chromium based browser. I'm curious on how many new clients have been registered lately, is the usage going up?
