Lately, however, I don't know if with the latest versions, it seems that firefox does not recognize the printer. Let me explain better by giving the example. I opened firefox&gt; I launched a print from my Epson TM-T20&gt; I go to about: config and look for the word EPSON and it shows me all the settings that I could change for this particular printer. For some time or in any case on some PCs (not all), if I do this procedure and then look for the configurations of my EPSON, it will no longer show me all the configurations ... as if it had not found it and therefore it does not give them to me modify ... I am forced to modify the print settings at the general level but here I do not find all the ones that interest me. Can anyone tell me why? how can i restore the old functionality. In the attached image, you can see the strings that I no longer see and that I see regularly on other PCs where I did the same installation.
