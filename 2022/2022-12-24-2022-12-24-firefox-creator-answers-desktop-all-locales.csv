It never did this before, and it is extremely annoying. </p><p>The new window appears to slide from the left side of the screen across the screen until it is fully visible; that's what I am trying to describe. As if a card was being dragged out of the left side of the screen, across the page. I hope someone knows how to make this animation stop, please? </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,other,en-US,"",overthedam

I'm not even going to pretend i understand why, but i know what weird stuff fixes it. </p><p>Youtube causes a ton of slowdown and memory/cpu usage on my laptop. Im not sure if its because of google making youtube run worse on other browsers or its because my laptop is an old macbook air. probably both. </p><p>Heres the extremely strange part, When i put the video into picture in picture and switch to another tab, the lag just stops and it runs perfectly smooth and causes no tempurature increase, fans spinning up, or anything else indicating heavy memory consumption. </p><p>It isnt even youtube scaling it down because its in a lower size in the picture in picture thing either. I can double click on the picture in picture thing in another tab that isnt youtube and it runs just as fine in perfect quality. </p><p>First image at 62% is youtube when in the youtube tab the second image is youtube when in picture in picture while not in the youtube tab </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",amananon8
