Should not be a biggy since it gets stored and synced.  Except when the syncing isnt working no matter what fixes you try. I disabled eset, grabbed an even older profile from a older backup try see if it was due to the profile. still nothing. Suggested and tried: Creating a bookmark and removing. Creating a new profile and loging in to sync there. adding an addon something in about:config to force everything syncing resetting browser troubleshoot mode rebooting pc </p><p>Every fix I have tried. I don't get why I cannot just see what sync is doing instead of a spinning icon perhaps a segment on the settings menu of sync since you made a segment for that anyways. I feel stupid for forgetting to copy my profile but firefox is stupid for not being able to have it just simply download the freaking profile. Like I get software sometimes messes up for random reasons. But if only there was then an backup option to download my profile as it is loose from the settings segment. As if its so hard to download a 200~mb profile (I assume since my old profile was around that). I know it can take long to download from what I read but I let it run for over an hour and nothing. </p><p>Honestly I am livid that there is no option now to sync my account and that I can get no feedback other than a log that is just mostly gibberish for the average user. why can't I just see error reading from server or corrupt profile cannot download or w.e or downloading xxxxxx file @5% 0.00001kbps. </p><p>I get sync isn't meant to be a cloud storage system but in the past it always worked when I forgot the profile backup and if it didn't I was able to fix it back then somehow.  I hope someone can help resolve this so I don't loose everything. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,sync,en-US,1555597;,e_antonio_1987
