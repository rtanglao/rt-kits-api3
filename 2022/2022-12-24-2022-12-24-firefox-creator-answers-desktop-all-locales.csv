They seem squished together (see image). I tried restarting FF (108.0) &amp; my computer (running on Pop!OS 22.04, Gnome 42.5), but that didn't help. Tried disabling my Gnome extensions, didn't help. Tried changing FF theme, didn't help. Any help much appreciated! Thank you! </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1080;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",mohan3142

When I want to print something with Firefox (either a webpage or a PDF) and the printer is online everything works fine.

I tried waiting for over 5 minutes and the dialog keeps loading on ""Preparing preview"". </p><p>I tried replicating this issue in Chrome. Chrome just switches to another printer if the currently selected printer is offline.

I'm not even going to pretend i understand why, but i know what weird stuff fixes it. </p><p>Youtube causes a ton of slowdown and memory/cpu usage on my laptop. Im not sure if its because of google making youtube run worse on other browsers or its because my laptop is an old macbook air. probably both. </p><p>Heres the extremely strange part, When i put the video into picture in picture and switch to another tab, the lag just stops and it runs perfectly smooth and causes no tempurature increase, fans spinning up, or anything else indicating heavy memory consumption. </p><p>It isnt even youtube scaling it down because its in a lower size in the picture in picture thing either. I can double click on the picture in picture thing in another tab that isnt youtube and it runs just as fine in perfect quality. </p><p>First image at 62% is youtube when in the youtube tab the second image is youtube when in picture in picture while not in the youtube tab </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",amananon8
