I assume it is a problem where Ralphs web site is blocking me on this computer but then again, it is only when using Firefox. I have contacted Krogers customer service and have received no help. I cleared everything. I tried the ""ipconfig/flushdns""?

All of the above still works, except that once logged in, the system asks me if it should remember me, or not (i.e., store a cookie or not, for future convenience). I always click ""No"". Now, when I do that, I get an error number 500, which is completely non-committal: ""Something Went Wrong"" - with a long garbage code. (See attachment for sample.) Results of tests to see what's wrong: 1) works fine (able to complete eMail login) under Microsoft Edge; 2) works fine on my laptop, running Windows 8.1 and Firefox 94; 3) on the 'problem' computer (desktop), I uninstalled Firefox 99 and downloaded/installed Firefox 93 - ""500"" error persisted. Just today: removed Firefox/Mozilla (including all folders/files, and Registry entries) then re-installed version 99. Still doesn't work. Let me know what else you need to know. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-81;microsoftoffice;office365;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1498114;,hawked-off
