I read in the Firefox documentation that I could loose all my information if I change my email but that's exactly what I need to do.  I currently use gmail and have switched to Outlook.  Two questions, how do I change to Outlook without loosing bookmarks, etc. and can I import my gmail accounts into Outlook.  Thank you in advance.

When I started with it, I was under the (apparently false) belief that the main bookmarks folder was ""other bookmarks"".  Consequently, all of my important bookmarks are contained in this folder. I just bought a new computer from Dell, and I find that I can not import the Other Bookmarks folder into the new computer.    What I would like to do is delete the contents of the Bookmarks folder, then transfer the contents of the Other Bookmarks folder into this. I know I can do this one by one, but it will take a LONG time.  Is there any way to do this in bulk? Thanks. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1498227;1498248;,gwilson5
