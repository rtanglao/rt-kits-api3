And I've got this error message, ""Warning! Internet Explorer should not be used for proper operation of the Administrator Backend"" when I opened my website, <a href=""http://ulattime.com/ulattime/administrator"" rel=""nofollow"">ulattime.com/ulattime/administrator</a>,"" which opens vertically or downward or dropdown, instead of ""horizontally"" and I don't have ""Internet Explorer"" browser. Please see screenshot, <a href=""https://imgur.com/zNMVSSf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://imgur.com/zNMVSSf</a>. I used FireFox and Chrome either as default and had now removed it as default as the same error message happened when I used these browsers.  I went to “Network Setting” of Firefox and tried “Manual proxy configuration” and I also enabled “DNS over HTTPS” and “Use Provider” “Cloudfare”(Default) and “NextDNS” and “Custom” but nothing happened.  But in Safari, my website opens ""horizontally"" so I am keeping Safari as my default browser for now. If Firefox or Chrome opens ""horizontally,"" I can restore either of them as my default browser again. Thank you. </p><p>Joseph Lariosa ontherecord@ulattime.com </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;firefox-960;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",ontherecord

I'm a developer, and currently building a site that's very much based on this websockets protocol. The issue is, when transmitting a huge chunk of data (e.g large json of google auth details), firefox tends to send a corrupted payload which the server cannot decode. This issue doesn't appear in Chrome for some reason. </p>",desktop;websites;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",akwotom
