Occasionally the bookmarks on all devices are synced with an older version of bookmarks. I'm guessing it's from one of the laptops that hasn't been turned on in a few weeks and now is on.  Is there not a way to prevent an old set of bookmarks from replacing a known 'good' set of bookmarks?  Thankfully I have my bookmarks backup turned on and can restore them but would like to know if there is a solution to keeping bookmarks current and stable on all devices, even those devices that aren't regularly used. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",markandlyndon

Now it seems it spends more time trying to prottect me and annoy me than anything else. Either images don't load, or if I'm on my laptop it won't let me access mic and video for a conference call.  The thing is, I have AVG I have ad blocker I know my way around them and yet FF keeps getting in my way I turn those app and extension off/on and I'm just ANNOYED. Finally I just uninstall the mothersucker.  I don't even know I have a question.....Oh yes, I want a clean simple fast browser that doesnt infantilize me or make me wear a helmet if I don't want to. I'm not a new user by any means, but this browser just bugs the shit out of me. Upshot I've gone back to Chrome as my default browser. </p>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",Blackieray
