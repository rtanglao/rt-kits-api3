Why?,"<p>I noticed tonight that I can no longer view ""stories"" I have uploaded to <a href=""http://Ancestry.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Ancestry.com</a> when using Firefox. I thought at first that it was a problem with <a href=""http://Ancestry.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Ancestry.com</a> itself, but then I went to Edge and Chrome browsers and see that the content is still there and viewable on those browsers. Therefore, the problem is with Firefox browser. How can I figure out what is causing Firefox to block this content and fix it? </p><p>I've already cleared the cache and cookies.

The only thing I do know is that this problem only appeared after the option to make and sync an account was offered. I would at least like to know if there is a way to access the password to my main email as that is a business email I cannot afford to lose. At most, I would like to have all those accounts back. Also, I would like to ask that you forgive the account name, as I was very frustrated when I made it.

I used FireFox and Chrome either as default and had now removed it as default as the same error message happened when I used these browsers.  I went to “Network Setting” of Firefox and tried “Manual proxy configuration” and I also enabled “DNS over HTTPS” and “Use Provider” “Cloudfare”(Default) and “NextDNS” and “Custom” but nothing happened.  But in Safari, my website opens ""horizontally"" so I am keeping Safari as my default browser for now. If Firefox or Chrome opens ""horizontally,"" I can restore either of them as my default browser again.

I'm a developer, and currently building a site that's very much based on this websockets protocol.
