Microsoft mostly gets by with one update cycle per week. I like to use software, not update it. I know it has to get updated regularly, but regularly shouldn't be the same as constantly. </p><p>Environment is: Firefox 106.0.5 (64-bit) Mozilla Firefox Snap for Ubuntu canonical-002 - 1.0 Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS (64-bit)  GNOME version 42.5  Wayland windowing system </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",vonhoother
