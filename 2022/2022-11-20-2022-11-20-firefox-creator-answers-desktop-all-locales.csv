After 1 minute of not touching keyboard/mouse (reading, watching), the Firefox window minimizes/disappears. The computer doesn't sleep, just the FF browser minimizes. I've extended the ""Sleep"" times for the laptop and I've Firefoxed the ""about:config - browser.blahblah - false - restart"" suggestions I've found online, but Firefox still minimizes after 1 minute. I read a lot so there are frequent 1 minute+ periods. This is getting irritating. Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1070;,firefox,other,en-US,1549043;,davemac233
