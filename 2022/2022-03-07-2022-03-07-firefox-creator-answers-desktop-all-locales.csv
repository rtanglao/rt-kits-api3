I never had this issue before 3/5/22. Firefox is my default browser. I am able to browse, access my orders, etc. However, when I proceed to Checkout a blank page displays with two statements: </p><p>You cannot buy this item because it's out of stock Another seller might have a comparable offer for the same item. If available, see all buying options and try adding to cart. </p><p>I removed all items from the cart and tried purchasing individually and got the same message. I closed Firefox and tried again with no change. I also cleared cached Web content, but did not clear cookie data. I tried to purchase a different product on 3/6/22, which would be the forth different item and all from different providers. I had the same issue. All products stated they were in stock before and after putting them in the cart. I did open a ticket with Amazon. On 3/6/22, I logged into our Amazon account with MS Edge and I was able to order all products that failed with Firefox. I looked at recent Firefox update history and there was a security update on 3/5/22 and I am on version 97.0.2. </p><p>Don </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",friedadog
