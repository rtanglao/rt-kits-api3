The problem seems to be with <strong>greek websites</strong> (only with <strong>pop-up cookies settings</strong>) or <strong>greek language versions </strong>of websites, but the strange thing is that the problem is almost the same with facebook homepage in english and in greek language (!).    I have tried to search for similar problems and suggested solutions on the internet, but I still can't figure out the cause of my problem and haven't solved it yet. I have followed [<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-extensions-themes-to-fix-problems|this"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-extensions-themes-to-fi...</a>] solution, running Firefox in <strong>Troubleshoot mode</strong>, which resolves the problem temporarily, but not permanently. According to the above solution, ""the likely cause is an extension, theme or hardware acceleration"", but when I follow every step to determine which one of these (extension, theme or hardware acceleration) is the problem, all of these prove to work properly.    Therefore, any suggestions would be much appreciated. </pre>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-970;firefox-9702;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1487892;,iliastolos
