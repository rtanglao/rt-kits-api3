For e.g. with v 100.0 it works just fine and renders the date value appropriately. This issue is causing other things to break on our application in production. Can some one please provide help on what might be going wrong here ? </p><p>Thanks, Maneesh Sharma </p>",linux;desktop;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1514429;1514432;1514438;,maneessh
