Ahora bien, ¿qué ventajas ofrece la barra lateral? Si eres capaz de centrar tu vista y atención en 2 lugares de forma simultánea, supongo que puedes navegar el historial mientras lees un artículo, revisas tus redes sociales o ves una película, por ejemplo. Claro que eso también se podía hacer antes, sólo había que separar la pestaña del historial y acomodarla de forma que tuvieras el historial por un lado y el artículo, película, o lo-que-fuera del otro... </p><p>¿Y qué desventajas tiene limitar el historial a la barra lateral? La principal es que no hay información adicional sobre la fecha y hora en que se accedió al sitio, información importante cuando el título de la página no refleja su contenido. Otra desventaja es el hecho de que no se puede cambiar el tamaño de la fuente (deliberadamente pequeña para que quepan más caracteres en el limitado espacio de la barra lateral). </p><p>¿Alguien sabe de qué forma puedo regresar el historial a su vista anterior o qué otro navegador me ofrece esa posibilidad (Chrome lo hace, pero quiero ""ayudar"" a otras empresas no tan grandes)?
