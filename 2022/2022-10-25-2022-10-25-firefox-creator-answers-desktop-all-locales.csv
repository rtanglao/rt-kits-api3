At first I used Firefox's account sync feature, but it doesn't sync everything - my extensions' settings (not the extensions I have but what their settings are), my toolbar customization, all the sites I'm logged into, and maybe some other things are not sync'd. So instead I tried a different solution which has worked for me before - copying my profile folder on my PC and pasting it into the laptop. This mostly works, except suddenly Firefox warns that a lot of my company's websites are a potential security risk with the error code SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER. I can get past this, but the real problem is some of these websites - namely GitHub - don't load any CSS anymore. I can access the site but it's ugly. Normal GitHub works, only my company's GitHub (which has a different URL) doesn't. </p><p>If I switch back to the other profile, it works. But I'd really like to avoid having to manually sync up my extension settings and other things. Is there any other way to resolve this?

Ahora bien, ¿qué ventajas ofrece la barra lateral? Si eres capaz de centrar tu vista y atención en 2 lugares de forma simultánea, supongo que puedes navegar el historial mientras lees un artículo, revisas tus redes sociales o ves una película, por ejemplo. Claro que eso también se podía hacer antes, sólo había que separar la pestaña del historial y acomodarla de forma que tuvieras el historial por un lado y el artículo, película, o lo-que-fuera del otro... </p><p>¿Y qué desventajas tiene limitar el historial a la barra lateral? La principal es que no hay información adicional sobre la fecha y hora en que se accedió al sitio, información importante cuando el título de la página no refleja su contenido. Otra desventaja es el hecho de que no se puede cambiar el tamaño de la fuente (deliberadamente pequeña para que quepan más caracteres en el limitado espacio de la barra lateral). </p><p>¿Alguien sabe de qué forma puedo regresar el historial a su vista anterior o qué otro navegador me ofrece esa posibilidad (Chrome lo hace, pero quiero ""ayudar"" a otras empresas no tan grandes)?
