Here is a page of the site that misbehaves: <a href=""https://www.yucatan.com.mx/merida/2022/6/13/detienen-en-merida-profugo-de-la-justicia-en-estados-unidos-326494.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.yucatan.com.mx/merida/2022/6/13/detienen-en-merida-profugo-de-la-justicia-en-estados-unidos-326494.html</a>  (and attached) Most pages on the site do not misbehave.  The problem is that the body text is all jammed to the right side of the screen.  I have tried clearing the Firefox cache, and sometimes that works,  I have tried restarting in troubleshooting mode, but that does not change anything.  Internet Explorer shows the same problem, but the Edge browser does not display the problem.  I suspect the site is doing something funky that results in a problem on some pages for some browsers.  That's really hard to troubleshoot! </p>",desktop;windows-10;firefox-1010;website-breakages;firefox-10101;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",rickexner2

About:config doesnt work it just tells me that's not a site or gives me advice on how to use it which isn't really helpful when I can't even search it or find the spot for it. The tabs section in the settings only offers to put it on top or bottom of screen or to have it inactive or not, or automatically close them, there is no option to have more than one tab.
