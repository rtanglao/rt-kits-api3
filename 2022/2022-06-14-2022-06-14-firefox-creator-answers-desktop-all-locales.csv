I have the box in the corner with the numbers but that sometimes vanishes entirely so I only have the one tab and would like it to be like most browsers where you can see them all at the top. I cant get the extension that manages it because the only computer I have is one given to me by my job that's a chrome book and doesn't support those extentions, I tried. About:config doesnt work it just tells me that's not a site or gives me advice on how to use it which isn't really helpful when I can't even search it or find the spot for it. The tabs section in the settings only offers to put it on top or bottom of screen or to have it inactive or not, or automatically close them, there is no option to have more than one tab. Please help I've tried everything I can think of and everything I could find online. </p>",desktop;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",Kiahb67

It does not seem to matter what tab or program I try and switch to, firefox itself becomes unresponsive but still seems like it's tracking clicks in the background, as I will notice new tabs open up when it restores if I middle click the top bar. It's consistent and size of what I cut doesn't seem to impact it. I tried following the directions on this page <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-hangs-or-not-responding#w_firefox-hangs-at-random-times"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-hangs-or-not-responding#w_firefox-hangs-at-random-times</a> for disabling hardware acceleration and renaming the places files, but that hasn't helped. </p><p>Any advice?
