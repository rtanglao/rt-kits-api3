Todas ellas funcionan correctamente y me puedo loguear en cualquiera de las 6 sin necesidad de poner usuario o pasword, ya que firefox los tiene guardados. Puedo cambiar de una cuenta a otra sin problemas, en una sola ventana de Firefox. Sin embargo, al ir a ""contraseñas"" en el Menu de Firefox, solo aparecen guardadas 5 de las cuentas. La numero 6, a pesar de funcionar bien, es como si no existiera en ese listado de credenciales guardadas. Ya probé a exportar a otro Firefox en otro PC, y sigue sin aparecer esa cuenta. Necesito recuperar el password de esa cuenta, ya que pertenecía a mi hermano, que falleció hace unos meses, y los mecanismos de recuperación de contraseña de Google no me sirven, ya que no tengo ni el teléfono ni los otros passwords de mi hermano. Mi temor es que si algo le pasa al PC de donde puedo acceder a la cuenta, ya no tenga acceso a los mails, las fotos y todo lo que el tenía en Google Drive. Además, ya que le robaron el teléfono, quiero poder borrar todo lo que tenía en él, y para ello también necesito la contraseña.

A folyamat meg van, nem csinálom rosszul, hisz egy darabig működik minden a megszokott módon, aztán egyszer csak vagy frissítés, vagy szinkronizálás után eldobja az összes itteni beállítást, visszaállítja alaphelyzetbe, illetve törli a már beállított fájltípusokat.
