It does not seem to matter what tab or program I try and switch to, firefox itself becomes unresponsive but still seems like it's tracking clicks in the background, as I will notice new tabs open up when it restores if I middle click the top bar. It's consistent and size of what I cut doesn't seem to impact it. I tried following the directions on this page <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-hangs-or-not-responding#w_firefox-hangs-at-random-times"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-hangs-or-not-responding#w_firefox-hangs-at-random-times</a> for disabling hardware acceleration and renaming the places files, but that hasn't helped. </p><p>Any advice? I am a habitual ctrl+x user over ctrl+c, anything would be appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",lonelyheart831
