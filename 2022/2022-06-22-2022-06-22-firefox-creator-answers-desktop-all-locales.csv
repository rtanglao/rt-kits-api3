There are multiple recent threads on this issue, and not one of them has a solution, so I'm asking again. I want to increase the font size of the top header text, specifically the <strong>bookmarks toolbar, search bar, and tab titles</strong>. The text is too small for me to read. It would also be useful if I could increase the font size for the applications menu (the hamburger drop down menu in the far right of the header).  </p><p>I do not want to increase the size of anything else, so changing layout.css.devPixelsPerPx is not the solution. I have changed my global zoom settings, and set them specifically to ""Zoom text only"", but this setting does not effect the bookmarks toolbar or the search bar. Changing the default font size also does not increase the size of this text. </p><p>Just to clarify again, these threads are not solutions to my question: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1214027"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1214027</a>  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1293358"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1293358</a> </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",e.bacas

Then I can't visit bookmarks or other google docs saved in my browser history. I click to open and nothing loads/tab stays blank 3. Google is also my default search engine - that won't initiate either 4. The upper right corner of google docs (where my google account/name are linked) doesn't load, and I can't click or get functionality on changing accounts or seeing what other users are in the doc </p><p>It's become very problematic - I have searched help articles and can't find anything to remedy it.
