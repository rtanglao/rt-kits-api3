I have spoken with my ISP, Verizon, and they report no anomalies with my service and network monitoring shows no drop in internet connectivity. I switched to Microsoft Edge to see if the problem persists but have not run into the same issue, so I believe the fault lies with Firefox. I am actually using Edge to submit this help ticket since I cannot get any webpage to load on Firefox currently. I really enjoy using Firefox, but I have no problem switching back to Chrome or a similar browser. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",henrymachado5
