Kullanıcı adı ve şifreleri girdikten sonra açılan kutu pencerede kalıyor. Fotoğrafı ekledim. Aynı hesaplara Chrome yazılımı ile sorunsuz giriyorum. Bir kısıtlama mı var yada ben bir şeyin ayarınımı değiştirdim. Yardımcı olursanız çok sevinirim. Saygılarımla </p>,linux;desktop;other;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,other,tr,"",cuneytacim
