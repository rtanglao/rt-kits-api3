Have tried under Applications changing what application is used to open it and also used Always Ask.  Firefox still downloads the document and, therefore any changes are made to the copy the thin client's Downloads folder instead of the original on the server.  We have multiple thin clients at the locations in question and users accessing the documents on the shared server need to see the most recent version.   Currently I can make changes to a document and save it, go back to the server and open the same file and the changes I just made are not there.  They are on the copy in my downloads file.  Short version.   I need to be able to use thin clients (running Windows) that are connecting to a server (Running Windows) to be able to open say a PDF file without it being copied to the Downloads folder on the thin client.   Edit the file (if needed) and when that modified file is saved, the changes go the the original file on the server and not the copy in the thin client's downloads folder.   Using the same hardware and IE there is no problem with downloads happening and so any updates made are on the server file. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1023;firefox-10230;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",steve.dalton

I enjoy having videos and streams open when gaming and this doesn't allow me to do that. Some fixes that I have tried are: </p><p>widget.windows.window_occlusion_tracking.enabled to false layers.acceleration.force-enabled to true gfx.webrender.all set to true </p><p>My specs: i9-10900KF RTX 3070 16GB 4266mhz </p><p>Game in question is FFXIV in borderless fullscreen. I know that using exclusive fullscreen solves the issue, but I like being able to use my other monitor while playing. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1537302;,nehs.nadroj

I have changed it three times and the Firefox says the change took place each time.  Then, the pop up comes and I fill in my password and it pops up again and again and again and again.  How do I get rid of this?  It's driving me nuts!!! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1537254;,cmgrout
