Win 10 &amp;11 were such a traumatic shock to us. My wife (age 72) was so angry she went out and purchased Apple notebook, ipad and iphone and gave her windoze junk to the trash man after a thorough scrubbing. At age 72 she undertook learning a new O/S to get away from MSFT. (I try hard not to get her real angry!) </p><p>Thank you in advance for any help you may provide.
