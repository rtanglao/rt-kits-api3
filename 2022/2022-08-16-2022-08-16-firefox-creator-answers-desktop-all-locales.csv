I've noticed that Tumblr and TikTok's video players are affected by this. Restarting firefox fixes it, but it's very annoying to restart firefox every couple of hours, and seems like a problem. </p><p>The following things didn't fix it: clearing my cache, disabling my addons one by one, turning off hardware acceleration, trying to watch the video in a private window, or reinstalling firefox. I don't know what's left to try. </p><p>Please advise, thank you! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,other,en-US,1527372;,jackalopington
