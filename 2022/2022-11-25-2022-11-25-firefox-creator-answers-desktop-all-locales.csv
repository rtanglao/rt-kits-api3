The issue of where search results open is completely ignored in the help pages, judging from the number of questions in Support on the issue, that appears to be something of an oversight. As does not displaying the date questions were posted, reading about what applies in an old verion of Ff may not do so in the current one, it didn't in my case.  I wanted to know how to make the search results from Google on the search bar, open in a new tab, as opposed to the same tab, the current default setting. All it takes is changing the value of: browser.link.open_newwindow, from false to true in about:config.  Simple to do, finding out that's what you have to do, isn't.   I thought I'd suggest that you might consider addressing this matter, I'm sure it would be welcomed by at least some users.  Anyway, thank you for a great browser. </pre>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1070;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",SiCo
