One of their feature is absence of prompts like ""Are you sure what you want to replace foo.txt?"". Because I have somewhat organized fs, I always know what that file is for and if I can overwrite it. </p> <hr> <p>Now I have to download some files, what I need only for uploading onto another website / reading them once. So, I just download them into my /tmp folder and save them under the same name (so I could just repeat cat command and reduce clutter). But each time I download a file Firefox asks for confirmation to replace my existing file. Are there any config flags to disable those annoying prompts? </p>",linux;desktop;beta;customize;firefox-1080;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",i-s-d

I have tried with Safe mode, and turning off Enhanced Tracking protection. I have made no changes to Javascript etc. </p><p><strong>Issue 1</strong> If I select a code example and try to run it in an external program (e.g. DAX Studio), it fails, and I have found that the reason is because the ""space"" characters are not ASCII code 32, which is a normal space, but instead ASCII 160. Another symptom of this is that you cannot unindent the paragraphs in a text editor (Vim), if you paste the code there. I have tested and this is not an issue with Chrome, Edge, or Opera. Also if I click on the ""Try It"" button, it takes you to a runnable version of the code where the spaces are correct. These are workarounds, but why is Firefox using the wrong space characters? </p><p><strong>Issue 2</strong> I have seen another response to this kind of question, but it did not exactly answer it: on the website as above, when you click on the ""Copy"" button, which points to https://dax.guide/now/#, the code is supposed to be copied to the clipboard, however it does nothing. This works without issue in the browsers mentioned above. I have noticed previously on other websites that URLs ending in hash / pound did not work in Firefox. Is this something that Firefox just does not handle, or is there a setting to enable it? </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1070;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",MrBobDobbalina

The issue of where search results open is completely ignored in the help pages, judging from the number of questions in Support on the issue, that appears to be something of an oversight. As does not displaying the date questions were posted, reading about what applies in an old verion of Ff may not do so in the current one, it didn't in my case.  I wanted to know how to make the search results from Google on the search bar, open in a new tab, as opposed to the same tab, the current default setting. All it takes is changing the value of: browser.link.open_newwindow, from false to true in about:config.  Simple to do, finding out that's what you have to do, isn't.   I thought I'd suggest that you might consider addressing this matter, I'm sure it would be welcomed by at least some users.  Anyway, thank you for a great browser. </pre>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1070;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",SiCo
