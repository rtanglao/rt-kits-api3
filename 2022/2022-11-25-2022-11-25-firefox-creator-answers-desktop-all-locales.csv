Rarely, even that does not help and I have to press enter one more time again. The same applies to the basic links too - on this support website I practically had to click every link twice to get it opened. The click even is clearly registered: I see the :active state for a second. But afterwards, nothing happens, just like event got canceled in browser (clearly not JS error since it not only happens with links). It doesn't matter which site I'm using, where I am (even start page has this bug), and don't really seem to be connected to the extensions I'm using (recently I had high RAM usage by extension, and being unable to determine which extension uses RAM I disabled most of the untrusted extensions, which do not have cup icon given by Mozilla or not very popular), so I practically use _mostly_ clean Firefox now. </p><p>Before going full reset, I wonder if anyone happen to have the same issue? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",dantaeusb

I have tried with Safe mode, and turning off Enhanced Tracking protection. I have made no changes to Javascript etc. </p><p><strong>Issue 1</strong> If I select a code example and try to run it in an external program (e.g. DAX Studio), it fails, and I have found that the reason is because the ""space"" characters are not ASCII code 32, which is a normal space, but instead ASCII 160. Another symptom of this is that you cannot unindent the paragraphs in a text editor (Vim), if you paste the code there. I have tested and this is not an issue with Chrome, Edge, or Opera. Also if I click on the ""Try It"" button, it takes you to a runnable version of the code where the spaces are correct. These are workarounds, but why is Firefox using the wrong space characters? </p><p><strong>Issue 2</strong> I have seen another response to this kind of question, but it did not exactly answer it: on the website as above, when you click on the ""Copy"" button, which points to https://dax.guide/now/#, the code is supposed to be copied to the clipboard, however it does nothing. This works without issue in the browsers mentioned above. I have noticed previously on other websites that URLs ending in hash / pound did not work in Firefox. Is this something that Firefox just does not handle, or is there a setting to enable it? </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1070;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",MrBobDobbalina

The issue of where search results open is completely ignored in the help pages, judging from the number of questions in Support on the issue, that appears to be something of an oversight. As does not displaying the date questions were posted, reading about what applies in an old verion of Ff may not do so in the current one, it didn't in my case.  I wanted to know how to make the search results from Google on the search bar, open in a new tab, as opposed to the same tab, the current default setting. All it takes is changing the value of: browser.link.open_newwindow, from false to true in about:config.  Simple to do, finding out that's what you have to do, isn't.   I thought I'd suggest that you might consider addressing this matter, I'm sure it would be welcomed by at least some users.
