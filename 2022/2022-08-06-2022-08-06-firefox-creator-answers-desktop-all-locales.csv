I haven't used it in about 6 months &amp; now when I try to sign in, nothing happens. The mouse pointer turns to a pointing hand when I hover over the sign in, but that's it, the tab doesn't refresh &amp; no new tab is opened. It doesn't look like FF recognizes this as a link. </p><p>When I right click on other links I get the option to: Open Link in New Tab Open Link in New Window etc... </p><p>but when I right click on this link causing me issues, I get: Save page as... Save Page to Device etc... </p><p>It is as though FF doesn't see this as a valid link. I'm using Windows 10 64 bit &amp; FF version 103.0.1 &amp; have FF set to automatic update. </p><p>I've run FF in safe mode &amp; no change, suggesting it's not my add-ons.I've Googled the problem &amp; seen examples of what look similar, but no solution seems to work. In particular I've tried the suggestions from  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-cant-load-websites-other-browsers-can"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-cant-load-websites-other-browsers-can</a> but none helped. </p><p>I don't have any issues with this link in other browsers. Chrome opens it up in an instant &amp; I'm wondering whether it would be just easier switching to Chrome as my default.  </p><p>I'd love to stick to FF as my default, can anyone help? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jpasznyk

I've not made any changes.,"<p>After the latest update, Firefox loaded huge. It does not fit screen on Windows 11. I have not made any changes that would cause it to load so big. The actual pages are ok, it is the part with the toolbars that is huge, so if I click on something on a toolbar, I can't get to the bottom because it is so big. I've tried changing the view, etc. with no luck. I've cleared my cache and reinstalled it 3 times. No luck getting it back to what it was before the last update. Please help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1525109;,alinam1
