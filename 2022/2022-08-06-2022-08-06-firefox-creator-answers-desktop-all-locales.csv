I want Windows to respond by opening Firefox to default gmail page, with the file as an attachment. </p><p>Should be easy.  But from what I've found so-far, that legacy feature works only with stand-alone MAPI programs like Thunderbird and Outlook.  I want to do with web mail. </p><p>Has anyone gotten this to work? </p><p>Thanks </p><p>Bill </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",bill247

What the hell?","<p>So, Firefox automatically updated (to 103.0.1), and somehow or other the sidebar with all the bookmarks disappeared. Normally, this would take me about 10 seconds to find where the function was hidden, and turn it back on. No big deal--just a petty nuisance. Now, however, this function has been hidden so well, that I have no clue where to look. </p><p>I understand that interfaces change, and not everyone works the same way, but that's no excuse for flat out taking away a tool that some people (no matter how small a minority) still use on a regular basis, just in the dubious name of 'fashion.' Leave well enough alone. If I wanted my tools changed and moved on an irregular and capricious basis, I'd stick to Microsoft. </p><p>Now, please tell me how to get my bookmarks side bar back, or put together an update that makes it functional again. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1525147;,koohii

I haven't used it in about 6 months &amp; now when I try to sign in, nothing happens. The mouse pointer turns to a pointing hand when I hover over the sign in, but that's it, the tab doesn't refresh &amp; no new tab is opened. It doesn't look like FF recognizes this as a link. </p><p>When I right click on other links I get the option to: Open Link in New Tab Open Link in New Window etc... </p><p>but when I right click on this link causing me issues, I get: Save page as... Save Page to Device etc... </p><p>It is as though FF doesn't see this as a valid link. I'm using Windows 10 64 bit &amp; FF version 103.0.1 &amp; have FF set to automatic update. </p><p>I've run FF in safe mode &amp; no change, suggesting it's not my add-ons.I've Googled the problem &amp; seen examples of what look similar, but no solution seems to work. In particular I've tried the suggestions from  <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-cant-load-websites-other-browsers-can"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-cant-load-websites-other-browsers-can</a> but none helped. </p><p>I don't have any issues with this link in other browsers. Chrome opens it up in an instant &amp; I'm wondering whether it would be just easier switching to Chrome as my default.  </p><p>I'd love to stick to FF as my default, can anyone help? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jpasznyk

The actual pages are ok, it is the part with the toolbars that is huge, so if I click on something on a toolbar, I can't get to the bottom because it is so big. I've tried changing the view, etc. with no luck. I've cleared my cache and reinstalled it 3 times. No luck getting it back to what it was before the last update.
