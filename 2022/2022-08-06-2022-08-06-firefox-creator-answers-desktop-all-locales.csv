Now, however, this function has been hidden so well, that I have no clue where to look. </p><p>I understand that interfaces change, and not everyone works the same way, but that's no excuse for flat out taking away a tool that some people (no matter how small a minority) still use on a regular basis, just in the dubious name of 'fashion.'

Save Page to Device etc... </p><p>It is as though FF doesn't see this as a valid link.
