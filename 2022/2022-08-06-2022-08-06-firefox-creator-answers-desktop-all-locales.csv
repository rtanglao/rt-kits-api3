I've not made any changes.,"<p>After the latest update, Firefox loaded huge. It does not fit screen on Windows 11. I have not made any changes that would cause it to load so big. The actual pages are ok, it is the part with the toolbars that is huge, so if I click on something on a toolbar, I can't get to the bottom because it is so big. I've tried changing the view, etc. with no luck. I've cleared my cache and reinstalled it 3 times. No luck getting it back to what it was before the last update. Please help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1525109;,alinam1
