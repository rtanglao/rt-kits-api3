How can I do this? I'd like to keep my Firefox data synced to Seamonkey, and maybe synced the other way too. And I'd like Thunderbird to be able to sync to the Seamonkey email data too, for what it's worth. I thought the importing of data when Firefox starts would take care of importing SM data but it doesn't. Are there any commandline options for running Firefox that would get the importing done? I sure don't want to mess around with a huge html bookmarks file and there's other data in Seamonkey besides bookmarks that should be imported too.

When searching for some terms with Google in Firefox, the search result would repeat itself. For example, searching for terms like ""ab"", ""abc"", or ""hgi"" would result in two searches, but not ""def"". So let's say if I search for ""ab"" twice, I would get 4 search histories of ""ab"". </p><p>One curious thing I noticed is that if I already have a non-blank tab opened before the search, going back to it and then going forward to any search that would repeat itself would prompt it to produce two search histories again. The problem to this is that if there were other searches further up the tab's histories (I usually search for multiple things within the same tab), they would essentially be lost (I turned off search and form history) when the search repeated itself, since it would act like I made a new search of the same term. </p><p>I have updated the Firefox browser to the latest stable version 103.0.1, and the problem persists. I tried to replicate this on Chrome to no avail. It's irking me to no end, so any help is much appreciated. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,other,en-US,1525221;,urishino

Firefox recognition of version below says 91.0.  Also have Linux Mint 19.3 (Tricia). Computer 15YO Dell Dimension 900. </p><p>I've had no problems with Linux Firefox for many years.  I do not use any other Non-Linux OSes.  Linux Mint updates Firefox regularly and so do I in that OS.  I'm currently in a free version of Zorin which doesn't seem to push out updates, so my Zorin Firefox may be sadly out of date. </p><p>At any rate, today in Zorin, when I went to several of the bigger online sales platforms, they refused to accept my Firefox and suggested Chrome, Opera, and Safari; Target suggested Firefox. </p><p>Went to Mozilla to try and upgrade, but it didn't offer the Linux browser automatically when it read my computer.  I was only offered the Windows browser.  This may be because the computer is an old Dell Windows machine that I converted to Linux or it may not.  I've never had this happen before. </p><p>Yesterday in Linux Mint, in which Firefox is upgraded at least weekly, the same thing happened once with a big online retailer.  They said my browser was outdated and unsafe. </p><p>What's going on?  I'm wondering if Linux OSes are simply not being accepted  when the big retailers are doing software upgrades, or is something going on with Firefox? </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-910;,firefox,other,en-US,"",vineyridge1
