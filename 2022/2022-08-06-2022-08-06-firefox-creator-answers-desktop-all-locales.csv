In mid-May I backed up my bookmarks, and the resulting file was about 13.8 Meg in length. I was using whichever Firefox version was current at the time. I recently upgraded to the latest version (103.0.1, 64-bit, Windows 10). Today when I did a backup the file size was only 7.7 Meg. I have even more bookmarks now than back in May, so I'm confused about why the backup file is half the size. Is this normal or is there a problem somewhere ?

When searching for some terms with Google in Firefox, the search result would repeat itself.

So let's say if I search for ""ab"" twice, I would get 4 search histories of ""ab"". </p><p>One curious thing I noticed is that if I already have a non-blank tab opened before the search, going back to it and then going forward to any search that would repeat itself would prompt it to produce two search histories again. The problem to this is that if there were other searches further up the tab's histories (I usually search for multiple things within the same tab), they would essentially be lost (I turned off search and form history) when the search repeated itself, since it would act like I made a new search of the same term. </p><p>I have updated the Firefox browser to the latest stable version 103.0.1, and the problem persists.

The actual pages are ok, it is the part with the toolbars that is huge, so if I click on something on a toolbar, I can't get to the bottom because it is so big. I've tried changing the view, etc. with no luck. I've cleared my cache and reinstalled it 3 times. No luck getting it back to what it was before the last update. Please help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1525109;,alinam1
