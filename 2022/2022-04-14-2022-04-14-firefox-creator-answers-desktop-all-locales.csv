Normally, when I want to print a ticket, first it opens in a pdf viewer (<strong>it's an .aspx file</strong>), I check and confirm that the document displays properly and when I click print button, the same document still displays the same way and it prints normally, everything works fine.  Since yesterday, I get my text rotated in printer preview and it gets printed rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. Everything in printer settings is double-checked and hasn't been changed in a while now. It happens in every computer I start my web-app (it doesn't matter which printer is attached). There are pictures bellow: 1. pdf preview  (as it should be) and 2. rotated document when I press print button. Is this a bug, can this be fixed somehow, it's super important to me? </p><p>App is used only in Firefox, correct orientation is Portrait. </p><p>Thank you! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ana235
