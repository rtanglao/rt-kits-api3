If I try to access their UK online banking site (<a href=""https://www.hsbc.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.hsbc.co.uk/</a>) using Firefox (which I should very much prefer to do than with any other browser), it is missing the most important feature of 'Chat' (the only sensible way of talking to HSBC without having to endure a half-hour wait).  However, if I access it using any other browser (e.g., Microsoft Edge) the 'Chat' facility is available in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen.  Please note that with Firefox I am using a 'container' (called HSBC) - I don't think that Edge has similar facilities. </p><p>Can anybody please tell me whether I might have some setting or other (e.g., say something to do with 'pop-ups' which I think that the HSBC's 'Chat' facility uses) set incorrectly? </p><p>Thank you and best regards </p><p>John </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",the.sharps
