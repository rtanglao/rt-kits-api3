I have read every article ever written about this subject. But given the thousands of people who are having a problem with this I think that this is your problem as well as ours.</strong> </p><p>I can install any version of FF and I can fix AND break this very easily. If I only install one version (Nightly, Developer, etc) the bookmark toolbar is easily imported from chrome and displays on Windows 11 perfectly. In the good old days, I could install all versions and they would work without a problem. No longer. The second version will not display the Bookmark toolbar and it breaks the first one that has been working perfectly. I refresh but nothing helps. If I remove the first version (or Second, i.e. Firefox removed or Nightly) then I can fix the first by a refresh followed by an import from chrome.  </p><p>Equally bizzare is that I can break the first correctly running Firefox by merely synching using any mail address I happen to own. The toolbar will not come up even after a refresh.  </p><p>I examined the profile. The loaded profile contains a blank series of paragraphs (current profile) followed by a set of filled out paragraphs(previous profile). I use a second existing profile and it will work AFTER a refresh. </p><p>Forgive me, I know that many of you are volunteers, but there's is something ilvery wrong with the coding to cause such a complex failure of Firefox. I am a believer and donated a small sum every month for years. I have been writing to Mozilla and complaining but nothing comes of it. </p><p>Please assume this is a coding problem and not a failure of the user to do things right.  I cannot break any browser but Firefox. </p><p>Please fix. If you want info from me, just ask. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1497695;,alkolkin

I have been using this since 2019 or 2020 and saved all of my passwords there.  What happened is I was using my laptop and wasn't aware that the charger is not plugged in. While working my device turned off because of no battery. I connected the charger and restarted my device like normal.  After I opened my browser(Mozilla Firefox) and ctrl+shift+t to open all the recently closed tabs, I was amazed to see that it restored many old sites like 1.5 month old websites instead of the one's which I was using. However, the recently closed one's were showing in the history. I opened the tabs from history that I needed and started using it normal.  I have using Mozilla Firefox for good 2 years I never felt the need to remember any of my passwords. Everytime I have to create an account on any of the sites I just create a password once, at the time of sign up only and then click on SAVE PASSWORD so I don't have to remember it. I am guessing this is the normal practice that everyone does or may be a cast majority. I was doing my routine work, I tried to login to my account using the same way like you put in your email in the email section and then click on password section and select the user/email you want to use a password for and sign in. BUT TODAY WHEN I FOLLOWED THE SAME PROCEDURE, IT DOESN'T SHOW ME ANY SAVED PASSWORD WHICH WAS QUITE SURPRISING TO ME. I OPENED THE PASSWORD MENU FROM THE TOP RIGHT AND I WAS SHOCKED TO SEE THAT THERE WE ZERO, LITERALLY ZERO SAVED PASSWORDS. I REALLY NEED HELP WITH THIS BECAUSE THOSE WERE SO MANY PASSWORDS LIKE SERIOUSLY SO MANY. </p><p>THANK YOU, AMIR </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,sync,en-US,1497696;,sheikhaamir2014

If you have Firefox 99 running on macOS 12.3.1 Monterey, type ""navigator.userAgent"" and ""navigator.oscpu"" on the Web Console of the Firefox (more explanation later) to obtain their values locally.  (It is April, 2022, now.  If you happen to read this post months or years after this was posted, and if you have newer versions of macOS and Firefox, you are welcome to report the newer values together with the versions of macOS and Firefox.) </p><p>I would like to know the default values of userAgent and oscpu, but NOT your own customized values of them.  To check whether you have customized them, type ""about:config"" (without quotes) (followed by Enter) into the address bar of Firefox, and type ""general.useragent.override"" (without quotes) into the Search Preference.  If the ""Boolean"", ""Number"" and ""String"" radio buttons and the ""+"" button appear, then that means that there is no custom value created for ""userAgent"".  If there is a custom value for ""userAgent"" and if you wish to delete it to restore the default value, then click the Trash Can icon on the far right of ""general.useragent.override"".  </p><p>For oscpu, type ""general.oscpu.override"" (without quotes) into the Search Preference.  Then, do likewise as userAgent. </p><p>Once it is verified that there are no custom values for userAgent and oscpu, then it is time to obtain their values by Web Console.  Open the Web Console as follows. </p><pre>   Menu button &gt; More tools &gt; Web Developer Tools &gt; Console </pre> <p><br> When ""Web Developer Tools"" opens, a row of tabs appear: </p><pre>   Inspector  Console  Debugger  Network  Style Editor ... </pre> <p><br> Select the Console tab, which is the Web Console.  Once the Web Console opens, then, at the ""&gt;&gt;"" prompt, type ""navigator.userAgent"" (without quotes) followed by Enter.  Its value is displayed.  Also type ""navigator.oscpu"". </p><p>There is another method to obtain the values of userAgent and oscpu, without Web Console. </p><pre>    </pre>     <table>     <tbody><tr><td>userAgent: </td><td></td></tr>     <tr><td>oscpu: </td><td></td></tr>     </tbody></table> <pre>   &lt;script&gt;    document.getElementById(""userAgent"").innerHTML = navigator.userAgent;    document.getElementById(""oscpu"").innerHTML = navigator.oscpu;    &lt;/script&gt;     </pre> <p>Copy the above HTML code, and paste it into a blank document of text editor, and save it as plain text with the name ""navigator_values.htm"".  [edit: I tried to present an HTML code above.  However, this web page does not properly display the code.  It dropped most of the code.]  Make sure that JavaScript is enabled on Firefox.  Open ""navigator_values.htm"" with Firefox, then the values of userAgent and oscpu are displayed. </p><p><br> </p><p><br> For ""navigator.userAgent"" and ""navigator.oscpu"", you might want to see the following. </p><p>- <a href=""https://docs.w3cub.com/dom/navigator/useragent"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.w3cub.com/dom/navigator/useragent</a> </p><p>- <a href=""https://docs.w3cub.com/dom/navigator/oscpu.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://docs.w3cub.com/dom/navigator/oscpu.html</a> </p><p>Thank you in advance. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1497631;1497639;,haqzpwgtgz
