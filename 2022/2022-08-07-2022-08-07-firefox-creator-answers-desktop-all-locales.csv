La barra de herramientas imferior está como siempre, puedo regular el tamaño de la fuente. El problema es que la parte superio donde accedo a marcadores, están los complementos, cerrar o añadir página , añadir a favoritos.... esa zona está desproporcionada y no encuentro la manera de reducir el tamaño. Se hace súper incómodo su manejo ya que en vez de tener todo a mano, tengo que usar la rueda del ratón para desplazarme. muchas gracias de antemano </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,other,es,"",agusreplyca

The latest one I've come across is the edit bookmark ""button"" on the right of the URL bar.  It's a blank space on the URL bar, and when hovered over is a highlighted blank space. After clicking it twice it displays the Edit book mark menu. </p><p>How can I remove it completely? I've look at about:config and nothing stands out as obvious to me controlling this and I can't find a setting for it. </p><p>The image below shows the highlighted blank icon space. </p><p>This code in userChrome.css worked in FF91 but only hides the icon in FF102. </p><pre>#star-button { display:none !important; } </pre> <p><br> Thanks </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",citizen1138x

Chrome works fine still.  Other large transfers work fine. </p><p>Latest video I tried to play:  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkN8Aqb2IBc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkN8Aqb2IBc</a>  Is a DND group playing with an actor from The Outpost (TV show on CW) </p><p>In Firefox I see the initial video preview image, and after clicking to play I get a constant spinning progress animation but the video never plays.  Turning on the debug overlay info shows plenty of download capacity detected (I forget the name in the UI) but very little ever transfers (bars further down). </p><p>Only oddity I can see in the debug info it puts in the the clipboard is the wrong Angle GPU.  I have 2 x NVIDIA 1080ti's in SLI, and it sees a 980.  Chrome shows the expected value instead.  I filed a bug on the Angle project just in case.  I looked on the Firefox about:support page with hardware acceleration disabled and it showed two webgl driver entries (1 and 2), both with 1080ti listed. </p><p>I tried disabling the performance feature setting and hardware acceleration (closed app then opened again).  No difference. </p><p>Windows 10 x64, latest patches.  Latest NVIDIA drivers through GFE (auto updates itself).  Two Windows 10 graphics options are on (GPU scheduler and Variable Refresh Rate). </p><p>I've seen a couple notifications from Windows about Firefox ""attempting"" to use GPU hw acceleration, but I have no idea why it'd be blocked.  Clicked it and it did nothing.  I looked in my event viewer and didn't find anything useful either.  I haven't manually set any applications to use a certain GPU.  Integrated GPU from CPU is disabled in BIOS. </p><p>GPU isn't overclocked.  CPU is barely.  And I see no reason to think this is related.  In the past I'd get reboots and event viewer errors.  Even when it worked in the past I was similarly overclocked.  All programs (diagnostics) I've run to verify proper functioning have passed. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",jmillenbach

Im using firefox with a customized about:config modified to enhance privacy. Pretty sure that this is the reason for the green images, however i dont know which setting exactly may cause this... </p><p>Anyways the wired thing is, i use duckduckgo as search engine and when i klick on images the results are looking normally, however for privacy reasons i dont want to use duckduckgo anymore since they had a secret deal with microsoft, i have tried many alternatives but sadly all of them have the same issue (which duckduckgo doesnt) when i search for anything and klick on images either some/most or all results are entirely green.
