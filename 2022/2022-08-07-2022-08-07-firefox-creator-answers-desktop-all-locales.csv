But the new laptop unfortunately come with windows 11. </p><p>and like with windows 10, FF 97+ force the windows OS color theme style for checkboxes over the websites stylised ones (like a dark themed website with its own original soft small dark gray checkboxes being replaced by big light blue windows ones making the design ugly) I tried the same trick as my former laptop by switching <strong>widget.non-native-theme.enabled</strong> to ""false"", but it caused a tab crash on all page using checkboxes. Restarting firefox solved the crash issue, but even if slightly different than <strong>native-theme.enabled</strong> on ""true""(smaller and dark blue) the checkboxes are always a single forced windows like style on all sites </p><p>The trick worked easily on windows 10, how to force firefox to correctly use the websites own style for checkboxes and forms with windows 11? I don't want windows style take over the design of site i visiting. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",thor94

La barra de herramientas imferior está como siempre, puedo regular el tamaño de la fuente. El problema es que la parte superio donde accedo a marcadores, están los complementos, cerrar o añadir página , añadir a favoritos.... esa zona está desproporcionada y no encuentro la manera de reducir el tamaño. Se hace súper incómodo su manejo ya que en vez de tener todo a mano, tengo que usar la rueda del ratón para desplazarme. muchas gracias de antemano </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,other,es,1525414;1525419;,agusreplyca

Turning on the debug overlay info shows plenty of download capacity detected (I forget the name in the UI) but very little ever transfers (bars further down). </p><p>Only oddity I can see in the debug info it puts in the the clipboard is the wrong Angle GPU.  I have 2 x NVIDIA 1080ti's in SLI, and it sees a 980.  Chrome shows the expected value instead.  I filed a bug on the Angle project just in case.  I looked on the Firefox about:support page with hardware acceleration disabled and it showed two webgl driver entries (1 and 2), both with 1080ti listed. </p><p>I tried disabling the performance feature setting and hardware acceleration (closed app then opened again).  No difference. </p><p>Windows 10 x64, latest patches.  Latest NVIDIA drivers through GFE (auto updates itself).  Two Windows 10 graphics options are on (GPU scheduler and Variable Refresh Rate). </p><p>I've seen a couple notifications from Windows about Firefox ""attempting"" to use GPU hw acceleration, but I have no idea why it'd be blocked.  Clicked it and it did nothing.  I looked in my event viewer and didn't find anything useful either.  I haven't manually set any applications to use a certain GPU.  Integrated GPU from CPU is disabled in BIOS. </p><p>GPU isn't overclocked.  CPU is barely.  And I see no reason to think this is related.  In the past I'd get reboots and event viewer errors.  Even when it worked in the past I was similarly overclocked.
