Im using firefox with a customized about:config modified to enhance privacy. Pretty sure that this is the reason for the green images, however i dont know which setting exactly may cause this... </p><p>Anyways the wired thing is, i use duckduckgo as search engine and when i klick on images the results are looking normally, however for privacy reasons i dont want to use duckduckgo anymore since they had a secret deal with microsoft, i have tried many alternatives but sadly all of them have the same issue (which duckduckgo doesnt) when i search for anything and klick on images either some/most or all results are entirely green. Why is this happening and how can i fix it? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Firefox_Beginner
