When restore previous session doesn't work, isn't that the point of signing into the browser so it remembers and you can push the whole Firefox session to another computer? Using this Firefox session on my MacBookPro and want it on my iMac and would like to know how to do that. Would like to know how to lock down the session too. What is going on right now, I don't understand where the session went. I'm logged in. What's the point of logging in? This is getting circular. </p>",mac-os;desktop;sync;firefox-960;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",billing11
