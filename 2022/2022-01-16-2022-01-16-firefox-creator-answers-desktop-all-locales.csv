On previous computers I had to use Chrome over Firefox because sometimes this issue occurs. I won't get error messages, or any freezing. The browser will open but after that the issues arise.  My home page shortcuts won't appear. It will be a blank tab and that is it. If I press any of my shortcuts on the toolbar, or even search anything it will load and load and load. But won't ever crash, have an error or anything. Just a continuous load. Some times it will just open a new blank tab and do nothing. Then after closing Firefox through task manager, the browser won't even open. If it does, the same thing happens. This will happen randomly and quite often. Right now I am on Firefox after having to 'refresh' the browser in the settings and it started up but immediately the websites wouldn't load nor the home page favourite websites. I spammed the websites, opened about 20 tabs of different websites and eventually ONE of those tabs load. I honestly cant find any articles relating to this issue. Edge and Chrome work flawlessly but for some reason Firefox will throw in this issue for me. I prefer this browser over the other two but I have had to use Edge to find support when Firefox wouldn't work.  </p><p>I am currently on Win 11 Dell XPS 13 and have reinstalled Firefox numerous times.  </p><p>Any help will be appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-960;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",dominicsisa

I first noticed it when I tried watching streams on Twitch, then I also noticed it on YouTube, and then when casually browsing Reddit. I've gone through all the troubleshooting steps: </p> <ul><li> I've made sure Windows is up to date </li><li> Firefox is up to date </li><li> My drivers are all up to date </li><li> There are no viruses/malware/any issues with my firewall settings and computer security, I've tested and checked everything </li><li> The crashes DO still happen in Troubleshooting Mode </li><li> I've checked my RAM using Windows Memory Diagnostic for errors and there are none </li><li> I've refreshed Firefox, I've cleared my cache, I've done an entire clean uninstall and reinstall of Firefox </li><li> I'm able to watch streams, videos, and browse Reddit just fine on my other devices and on Google Chrome. This is only an issue I'm encountering with Firefox, which is super disappointing because I've never had a single issue in the past several years I've been using it as my browser ): </li></ul> <p>I've submitted so many crash reports because it's been crashing so often, but here's the Report ID of the most recent:  bp-0b0dac91-ec69-4c9e-a8c0-a622b0220116 </p><p>I'm so confused and have no idea why this is happening. Any help at all would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! </p>",desktop;crashing;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-960;firefox-9601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",BumbleBreeBee

When restore previous session doesn't work, isn't that the point of signing into the browser so it remembers and you can push the whole Firefox session to another computer?

What is going on right now, I don't understand where the session went. I'm logged in. What's the point of logging in?
