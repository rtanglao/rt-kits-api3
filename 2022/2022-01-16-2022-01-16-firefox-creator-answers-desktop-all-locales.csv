Currently when I open the first Firefox I get what I setup. Then if I open another one it is blank. How can I get the same home screen to open for as many Firefox as I open? thanks Jackie.  Note: Firefox is my browser so I open it a lot of times. I may have four-six open at the same time. Each time I open one (after the first) it is blank. I am not sure I am explaining myself clear enough for you to understand. hope so. perhaps I should take a ""snipping tool"" of the settings in Firefox? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",jackie.online

I believe it has something to do with loading images, because with HumbleBundle at least, when going to <em><a href=""http://humblebundle.com/subscription/trove"" rel=""nofollow"">humblebundle.com/subscription/trove</a></em> it only crashes once scrolled down, which causes the images on the page to load and then the site to crash, and sites like Kickstarter will text but crash immediately after. </p><p>This started happening after getting a new monitor, an ASUS VG27AQ.

On previous computers I had to use Chrome over Firefox because sometimes this issue occurs. I won't get error messages, or any freezing. The browser will open but after that the issues arise.  My home page shortcuts won't appear. It will be a blank tab and that is it. If I press any of my shortcuts on the toolbar, or even search anything it will load and load and load. But won't ever crash, have an error or anything. Just a continuous load. Some times it will just open a new blank tab and do nothing. Then after closing Firefox through task manager, the browser won't even open. If it does, the same thing happens. This will happen randomly and quite often. Right now I am on Firefox after having to 'refresh' the browser in the settings and it started up but immediately the websites wouldn't load nor the home page favourite websites. I spammed the websites, opened about 20 tabs of different websites and eventually ONE of those tabs load. I honestly cant find any articles relating to this issue. Edge and Chrome work flawlessly but for some reason Firefox will throw in this issue for me. I prefer this browser over the other two but I have had to use Edge to find support when Firefox wouldn't work.  </p><p>I am currently on Win 11 Dell XPS 13 and have reinstalled Firefox numerous times.  </p><p>Any help will be appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-960;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1474726;1474727;,dominicsisa
