Now to my problem and my question: Recently I looked through my event log and noticed that in the application log two app crashes of Firefox are logged again and again (mostly every 3 to 4 hours, sometimes even shorter). My problem now is that these logs also come from times where Firefox is not running. I am not primarily concerned with what is causing this, Firefox is working fine as written, but why Firefox is running there. Is this an automatic update search? My update settings are as follows: ""Check for updates, but ask before installing"", ""Use a background service to install updates"" is disabled. Also, it shows an incorrect version ""95.0.2.8022"" even though I already have ""96.0.1"" installed.

Me dirijo a ustedes para plantearles un gran problema que me ha surgido para ver si algún desarrollador o usuario podría ayudarme. Hace unas dos semanas me desapareció de repente la carpeta  completa llamada <strong>Firefox</strong> (Ubicada dentro de la ruta: C:\Users\...\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla) y con ella mis cuatro perfiles de usuario que tenía dentro. Quedaron fulminados sin una explicación aparente y tras usar muchos programas de recuperación de archivos (ICare Data Recovery Pro o Easeus Data Recovery Wizard entre varios más) solamente logré recuperar de suerte algunos de Marcadores (places.sqlite) y otros sueltos como archivos perdidos pero sin ruta de ubicación. Tras la pérdida apareció otra carpeta en el lugar de la original pero dentro solamente incluía un perfil nuevo predeterminado de usuario y los programas de recuperación solamente encontraban íntegra esta carpeta de perfil pero no las fulminadas. </p><p>Necesito urgentemente recuperar al menos mis marcadores junto al historial de descargas y de navegación. Firefox no reconoce ni un solo archivo recuperado: Ni places.sqlite, ni el de logins.json ... ni ninguno, pues aunque he vuelto a crear los prefiles nuevos y pegado en ellos los archivos que he podido recuperar en algunos casos me sobreescribe los originales renombrandolos a .corrupt y en otros casos me desaparece mi original de places.sqlite apareciendo uno nuevo vacío sin marcadores ni nada. Igual me sucede con las contraseñas y autocompletado de formularios. </p><p>He probado los siguientes programas para abrir o reparar bases de datos SQLite pero me da error no reconociendo mis archivos places.sqlite: SQLite Expert (Portátil), SQLite Studio (Portátil), SysTools SQLite Database Recovery y SQLiteDatabase Browser Portátil. Incluso en uno de los casos me ponía que el archivo, ¿Estaba encriptado?. Yo nunca encripté ningún archivo de Firefox y mucho menos con contraseña de desencriptación. </p><p>Intentando restaurar los Marcadores desde las carpetas de copia de seguridad de marcadores (Bookmarks) me sale un error en firefox y no restaura nada. </p><p>Firefox no lee correctamente absolutamente ningún archivo original recuperado ni SQLite, ni Json, ni de copia de seguridad de marcadores ni nada. </p><p>Es de vital importancia para mí recuperar al menos el contenido íntegro de los archivos places.sqlite de mis perfiles incluyendo aparte de los marcadores, los historiales de descarga y de navegación de cada uno. </p><p>Yo no tengo ni idea de programación así que por favor solicito la ayuda de algún profesional en bases de datos sqlite para que me pueda explicar por qué sucede esta situación y como poder solventarla. </p><p>Nota: los archivos originales recuperados no están en modo de solo lectura, sino normal. </p><p>Muchas Gracias y saludos. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,es,"",Simplemente_yo_y_punto
