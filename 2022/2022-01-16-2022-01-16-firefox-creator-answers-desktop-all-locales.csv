I first noticed it when I tried watching streams on Twitch, then I also noticed it on YouTube, and then when casually browsing Reddit. I've gone through all the troubleshooting steps: </p> <ul><li> I've made sure Windows is up to date </li><li> Firefox is up to date </li><li> My drivers are all up to date </li><li> There are no viruses/malware/any issues with my firewall settings and computer security, I've tested and checked everything </li><li> The crashes DO still happen in Troubleshooting Mode </li><li> I've checked my RAM using Windows Memory Diagnostic for errors and there are none </li><li> I've refreshed Firefox, I've cleared my cache, I've done an entire clean uninstall and reinstall of Firefox </li><li> I'm able to watch streams, videos, and browse Reddit just fine on my other devices and on Google Chrome. This is only an issue I'm encountering with Firefox, which is super disappointing because I've never had a single issue in the past several years I've been using it as my browser ): </li></ul> <p>I've submitted so many crash reports because it's been crashing so often, but here's the Report ID of the most recent:  bp-0b0dac91-ec69-4c9e-a8c0-a622b0220116 </p><p>I'm so confused and have no idea why this is happening. Any help at all would be greatly appreciated. Thanks! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-960;firefox-9601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",BumbleBreeBee

When restore previous session doesn't work, isn't that the point of signing into the browser so it remembers and you can push the whole Firefox session to another computer? Using this Firefox session on my MacBookPro and want it on my iMac and would like to know how to do that. Would like to know how to lock down the session too. What is going on right now, I don't understand where the session went. I'm logged in. What's the point of logging in? This is getting circular. </p>",mac-os;desktop;sync;firefox-960;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",billing11
