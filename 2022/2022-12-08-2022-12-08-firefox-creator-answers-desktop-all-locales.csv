It has always worked beautifully. But in the past couple of weeks, it hangs constantly on my iPad. (My iPad is relatively new, about two years old.)  Firefox still works great on my desktop and iPhone. I’m not doing anything differently on my iPad and can’t figure out why it’s hanging so much. I don’t notice this problem with any other app. I tried clearing my cache and browsing history. I tried removing Firefox from my iPad and then reloading it. Nothing I’ve tried works. When I’ve Googled the problem, the directions I get for things to try read as though they’re written for a programmer. I sure don’t understand them. I don’t want to have to use a different browser on my iPad, but if the problem persists, then I probably will have no other choice. This is exasperating. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",gregtodd8

It took several attempts before the images would appear properly. </p><p>Today, when trying to upload a tiny 43KB image, the same issue happened, and again I blamed the hosting server. </p><p>However, I have tried uploading the same image to 5 different websites, using Firefox and the SAME thing happens. This time, it doesn't matter how many times I upload and delete the same image. It simply refuses to be displayed. </p><p>Back to the site I want the image uploaded in, and I used the Opera browser... POOF! Image uploads FINE and displays PERFECTLY in Opera, as well as AFTER logging out. Checking with the Brave browser, yes, it too sees the image... but when I try viewing the page in Firefox, the browser REFUSES to load the image. </p><p>I've tried 2 different computers using 2 different IP addresses, and an Android device, using Firefox and NOPE, the image REFUSES to load. </p><p>What is going on... am I the ONLY one experiencing this issue? </p><p>I've cleared cookies, I've rebooted my working computer... I've exhausted EVERY attempt at my end in trying to figure this out. </p><p>Can ANYONE shed some light on this issue please? I have many visitors to all of my sites that use Firefox, so this HAS to be resolved a.s.a.p. </p><p>Thank you in advance, Trish </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,other,en-US,"",trish.parr

With Firefox DoH disabled the problem is not present. [Interesting side, the machine's systemwide DNS settings are configured for Cloudfare 1.1.1.1 ] </p><p>AFAIK all other sites load normally.
