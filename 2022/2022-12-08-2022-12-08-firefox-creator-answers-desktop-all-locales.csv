On logging out of any of my Amazon accounts (including KDP) I get an error on the page saying error  I cannot log out of any site on Amazon.  This is the first time I have encountered a problem.  I have tried resetting my password, which was a disaster. Mozilla, when I enter the new password, it does not recognize the current password until I try again. Then it recognizes the password as old and not new.  It is a shambles. I have been locked out twice and still have no solution and now I have 2 problems and not just one.  </p><p>I did a bit of research but the information was outdated (2015) about such a problem previously. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;website-breakages;firefox-1070;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",runawayprincesses

Some minor differences in interfaces. Something buggy about Firefox initial opening page shows boxes with History visited sites logos for quick reference to sign in to various pre-visited sites. These have always appeared even on previous versions. However on this latest version, the container box for the site logos is same but the logos within the boxes is much smaller. Like floating in the boxes. Must be some way to solve this making the site logos larger within container boxes. Screenshot of current problem.

It has always worked beautifully. But in the past couple of weeks, it hangs constantly on my iPad. (My iPad is relatively new, about two years old.)  Firefox still works great on my desktop and iPhone. I’m not doing anything differently on my iPad and can’t figure out why it’s hanging so much. I don’t notice this problem with any other app. I tried clearing my cache and browsing history. I tried removing Firefox from my iPad and then reloading it. Nothing I’ve tried works. When I’ve Googled the problem, the directions I get for things to try read as though they’re written for a programmer. I sure don’t understand them. I don’t want to have to use a different browser on my iPad, but if the problem persists, then I probably will have no other choice. This is exasperating. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1552733;,gregtodd8
