Trying to log in without the captcha just results in reloading the log in page. Below are screenshots of the site as it should appear, on chrome, and as it does appear on firefox. (I'm also using a dark mode extension, which I have checked has no effect on this matter) </p><p>None of the images are loaded either, but I can get the site running in the mobile browser. In fact, when I first logged into the site on the mobile browser the captcha came up, and I was also somehow able to log back in on mobile despite the captcha not appearing since. I won't question the magic and just thank my luck. However, as you can see, the site is in chinese, which I unfortunately do not speak, and the mobile browser does not support in browser translation extensions like TWP. </p><p>After logging in on the mobile browser the site then loaded properly, so I have some hope that the desktop browser may do the same if I can log in (I don't know why that would work, but I can only say what I see). I don't know why the mobile version would load the site better than the desktop version either, but here we are. </p><p>The captcha itself seems to be called shumei captcha in the code (view-source:<a href=""https://my.jjwxc.net/login.php?action=login&amp;referer=%2F%2Fmy.jjwxc.net%2Fonebook_vip.php%3Fnovelid%3D5157485%26chapterid%3D21"" rel=""nofollow"">https://my.jjwxc.net/login.php?action=login&amp;referer=%2F%2Fmy.jjwxc.net%2Fonebook_vip.php%3Fnovelid%3D5157485%26chapterid%3D21</a>) </p><p>I tried turning enhanced tracking protection on and off, clearing cookies and cache data, and disabling all extensions, non of which made any difference. Is there anything I'm missing that could fix the captcha? </p><p>¬ In case anyone's wondering why I don't just use chrome since it obviously loads the site fine, the site seems to have made some changes to the security on the paid chapters which are apparently incompatible with chrome, and brings up a message that the user's browser is outdated and too slow, the irony of which is not lost on me considering that out of chrome, edge and firefox, chrome is the only one that reliably loads the site - yet the message explicitly recommends the user transfer to edge if using internet explorer. No offense, btw, Firefox has a great interface, I know it boasts security over speed, and I like the extensions and all, but I can't exactly rate it five star when it won't load the one site I really need it for. I want to like this browser, but I need it to work for me first. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",artywolve
