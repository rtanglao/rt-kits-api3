Anche, ad esempio, i PDF visualizzati in Firefox vengono salvati nella cartella Download anziché nella cartella Temp com'era precedentemente. Non c'è modo di ripristinare questa funzionalità? Lo chiedo perché, correggetemi se sbaglio, le cartelle Temp vengono periodicamente svuotate in automatico, mentre la Download no. Siccome poi non la apro frequentemente, i file si accumulano al suo interno. </p><p>Grazie mille! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-990;,firefox,customize,it,"",andreamori1988

Windows 10 reconfigured everything for audio except Firefox.  After a lot of troubleshooting using various methods with no success (as all other aspects of windows 10 audio were working perfectly), I eventually stumbled upon a solution that finally worked for me. </p><p>In Windows 10, there is an app that varies individual app volume that eventually fixed my issue and i thought it best to post here for others, if they also have this particular problem. </p><p>All i did was the following: </p><p>1.  Do a windows search for ""App Volume"".  This will display Sound Mixer Options.  Select it. </p><p>2. In the App Volume and device preferences screen that appears, go to Mozilla Firefox. </p><pre>        a.  Ensure Volume is at a setting you prefer.          b.  Output/Input are most likely showing Default.  Mine did but YouTube video's still had no sound.              Change the Defaults to the same as the Masters at the top of the window and try your audio.              Mine started to work again at this stage.  After i confirmed everything was working again, i changed              Mozilla Firefox Output/Inputs back to Default and it continued to work perfectly. </pre> <p>Please note that I made sure all my OTHER audios were working first with W10 before doing this, ensuring everything was functioning properly.  ie.  Other browsers were playing youtube videos with sound, playing an audio music file, etc </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-990;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",alinmeer

It is a real nusance.,"<p>Whenever I  close an image in Firefox browser, such as with Youtube,  it instantly goes picture in picture. When I close something I naturally expect it to close not pop up somewhere else. This is extremely annoying. I have absolutely no use for picture in picture and think it is a real problem that I would like to purge totally so it never runs.
