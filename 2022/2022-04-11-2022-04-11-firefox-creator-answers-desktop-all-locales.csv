How can I adjust my Firefox settings so clicking on a link takes me to the actual URL?

When I click on an e-mail link to open a document in Firefox, the search bar shows a file:///C:/Users/... string.  When I click links on webpages (even links I've posted myself), the document opens in a new tab with a file:///C:/Users/ prefix rather than showing the actual URL.  I do a lot of work by sharing online files so this is really messing me up.  Prior to the most recent Firefox upgrade, I would always get a shareable URL automatically.  I just want the opening mechanism to go back to the way it was. </p><p>Would greatly appreciate any tips on how to fix this.

When I hold ctrl and left click on a video, it opens the video in a new tab (which I want) but it opens the tab twice. This doesn't happen on every site I visit. I opened FF in troubleshoot (safe) mode and this issue still occurred. I thought that maybe its the mouse on my laptop but I opened Chrome and didn't have this issue at all. Is there anyway to fix this? It isn't a huge problem, just a major inconvenience that I'd rather not have to deal with.
