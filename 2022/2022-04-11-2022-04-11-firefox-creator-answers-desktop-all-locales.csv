""filter:drop-shadow(red 10px 10px 10px)"".  </p><p>Tested on various Win10 and MacOs machines with v98.0.2 and older, images get displayed with a drop-shadow in best quality.  Updating to v99, once <em>any</em> filter gets applied (through dev console or through js within my software) the image quality is reduced a lot, which did not happen before. I attached a sample image from v99 (left: added filter, right: same image without filter). </p><p>When scaling the websites zoom factor to 500% the images will be displayed correctly without any quality loss. Scaling to 30% results in a very bad render. </p><p>I tried applying <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/CSS/image-rendering"" rel=""nofollow"">image-rendering</a> to no avail. It would visibly change the render mode, but not improve the actual quality. The pixelated image would still be pixelated with the new render mode. </p><p>I'm not sure how to further tackle this problem and hope someone could help with this issue.  </p><p>Thanks Max </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-990;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",max.r
