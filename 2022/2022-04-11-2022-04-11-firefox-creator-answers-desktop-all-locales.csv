Every time I open Firefox all of my personalization and bookmarks are gone. It shows that I'm signed in, but when I go into the Settings and go to the Sync section the page will refresh and suddenly show I'm not signed in. I will then attempt to sign back in, but after entering my password I just get stuck on the page with the circle spinning and a small banner saying ""working."" Once this happens, the only solution I've found is to open the Troubleshooter and use the Refresh option. This brings everything back, though I have to go through MFA hassle to get logged back in to my regular website. The problem is that every time I close Firefox, when I reopen it it's once again broken and I have to go through a Refresh again in order to be able to sign back in to sync. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-990;,firefox,sync,en-US,1496699;,kbartrum

Windows 10 reconfigured everything for audio except Firefox.  After a lot of troubleshooting using various methods with no success (as all other aspects of windows 10 audio were working perfectly), I eventually stumbled upon a solution that finally worked for me. </p><p>In Windows 10, there is an app that varies individual app volume that eventually fixed my issue and i thought it best to post here for others, if they also have this particular problem. </p><p>All i did was the following: </p><p>1.  Do a windows search for ""App Volume"".  This will display Sound Mixer Options.  Select it. </p><p>2. In the App Volume and device preferences screen that appears, go to Mozilla Firefox. </p><pre>        a.  Ensure Volume is at a setting you prefer.          b.  Output/Input are most likely showing Default.  Mine did but YouTube video's still had no sound.              Change the Defaults to the same as the Masters at the top of the window and try your audio.              Mine started to work again at this stage.  After i confirmed everything was working again, i changed              Mozilla Firefox Output/Inputs back to Default and it continued to work perfectly. </pre> <p>Please note that I made sure all my OTHER audios were working first with W10 before doing this, ensuring everything was functioning properly.  ie.  Other browsers were playing youtube videos with sound, playing an audio music file, etc </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-990;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",alinmeer
