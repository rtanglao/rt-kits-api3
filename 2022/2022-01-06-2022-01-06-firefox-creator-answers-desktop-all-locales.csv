I SURELY DID NOT use this much data. Absolutely not. I haven't even downloaded anything with mozilla this much. Most all of my mozilla use just comes from Youtube. The only browser extensions I use are the ""Enhancer for Youtube"". That's it.  Shortly before I discovered this massive amount of data usage I was noticing mozilla was acting funny. Everytime I would open it, it would open big and regular maximization, and then immediately turn into a smaller confied rectagle of a window that was barely open at all. Then I would click the maximize button and that window would stay the same size but move from the top area of the screen, to the bottom area of the screen, and then upon pressing maximize again it would be restored to full maximization. I disconnected my router, and plugged it back in, then went to network settings and saw the over 3 terabytes. I need to get to the bottom of this because my internet provider is comcast and they charge money if you go over there data cap for the month, which this is. I don't even know where to begin to find out how and why this has happened. Please help, I am very concerned. I uninstalled mozilla I do use Youtube very frequently and stream multiple videos at a time, often, for sound ambiance, but there is no way I have used over three terabytes just watching Youtube videos. </p>",desktop;other;fix-problems;windows-10;bandwidth;,firefox,other,en-US,1471564;1471565;1471577;,koalnion
