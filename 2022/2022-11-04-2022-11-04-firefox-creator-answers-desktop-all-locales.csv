I don't know about other languages but Bangla font shows weird in Firefox while other browsers work just fine. I am not an advanced user but still I tried to fix the issue by searching online but couldn't solve it. Within all these months I have reinstalled windows several times and thought that font problem might be solved but NO. That is still a problem. I even tried to change the font settings by viewing other browser font settings as well still no solution. Bangla font looks so ugly and quite hard to read. Is there any solution to this problem? I don't know the font names. 1st picture is from Google Chrome (this is how it should look), 2nd picture is from Firefox. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1060;firefox-10604;,firefox,customize,en-US,1545697;,mdbadruzzamannibir

I assumed it was how I was handling PDF's.  So I fixed it in settings.  Now if I click on a pdf it opens, however I have a couple apps that open it in an internal window to the app.  It won't do it now.  Any settings beyond what I've discussed?    I went over to  chrome and it worked fine there but I would prefer to use firefox.  Your help is greatly appreciated. </p><p>Thanks, Bruce </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1060;firefox-10603;,firefox,other,en-US,"",bruce109
