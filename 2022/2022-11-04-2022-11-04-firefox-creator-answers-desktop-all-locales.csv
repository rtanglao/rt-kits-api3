However I often still need to have the content of Miro/Mentimeter on the screen so that I can link my explanation with what students do. </p><p>Now the problem I have is that it seems the rendering of the pages in Firefox freeze when I change of virtual desk, and thus students might add things on Miro/Mentimeter and I do not see it because the page is frozen. When I get back to the virtual desk, suddenly all the changes students made pop-up. It's extremely frustrating, both for me and students, as sometimes they asked questions related to what I was explaining before and then I have to go backwards. </p><p>Is there any way to make Firefox keep rendering pages when they are not on the screen? Any option? I have tried searching about:config with rendering / refresh, but came up with nothing. When looking that issue online, I found the ""Always active Window (Always Visible)"" extension which supposedly prevent the hidden property of pages to go to true, but that has not solved the problem. </p><p>Any help or tips on how to solve this would be greatly appreciated! </p><p>Sincerely, Sleris </p>",linux;desktop;tips;firefox-1060;firefox-10601;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",sleris
