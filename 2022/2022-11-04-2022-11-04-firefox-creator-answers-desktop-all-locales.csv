I assumed it was how I was handling PDF's.  So I fixed it in settings.  Now if I click on a pdf it opens, however I have a couple apps that open it in an internal window to the app.  It won't do it now.  Any settings beyond what I've discussed?    I went over to  chrome and it worked fine there but I would prefer to use firefox.  Your help is greatly appreciated. </p><p>Thanks, Bruce </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1060;firefox-10603;,firefox,other,en-US,"",bruce109

Whenever I'm using the Firefox browser and it is the front focused window, Windows changes my audio volume to 50% whether I have it set manually below or above that.  Whenever I move focus/minimize the Firefox browser, the volume goes back to my manually selected volume globally for my PC.  This doesn't happen with any other application.   </p><p>I've unchecked the option on all audio outputs ""Allow Applications To Take Exclusive Control Of This Device"" located by right clicking ""sounds"" on the speaker system tray then ""playback"" and ""advanced"".  Which didn't fix the problem. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10604;,firefox,other,en-US,"",maxfisher925

Now when I open a Firefox browser and NOT in Fullscreen the browser only takes up about 5/8 of my screen. Going to Fullscreen, I lose all the top information like battery power, date, time, FILE, EDIT, VIEW HISTORY ETC, so that is not desirable. How do I get my browser window bigger? </p><p>Thnx </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1060;firefox-10603;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",sinclairmarty
