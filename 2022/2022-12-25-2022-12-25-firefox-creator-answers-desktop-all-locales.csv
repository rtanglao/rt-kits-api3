I still have all of my bookmarks and history, etc. When I looked out in the profile folder, I found out that the logins.json file actually has all of my logins (halg of them doesn't have the password, but I guess it's because it's encrypted or something), so I don't really get why they aren't displayed when I open view passwords and logins. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",jcfplanck

The problem is, the password to my google account was saved by your password saver which was the only way for me to log in. Unfortunately after I installed my new pc and reset my old drives, I can no longer access that password. The account in question is fiendishfamiliar@gmail.com. I have tried countless times to log into my sync account to try and recover the password but apparently I don't remember the password to my firefox account either. I cannot access my Gmail without my firefox account, and I cannot get into my firefox account without my e-mail so I am stuck on a loop. Is there any other way you could let me recover my firefox account? I am on the same network with the same router, if I can't have my account back I won't be able to access important spreadsheets that I cannot recover. Please help me. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",peronixtv

PERDI MEU NATAL COM ISTO!,"<p>Graças a uma ação conjunta entre Mozilla Firefox e Microsoft, venho sofrendo de diversos ataques de hacking no meu computador após as duas atualizações semanais que o Mozilla me indica e a última atualização do Windows. Desde então, toda minha reclamação se transformou em retaliação me impedindo de utilizar qualquer coisa no computador. Hoje, 24 de Dezembro, fiquei mais de 5h esperando pra me comunicar com minha família graças à retaliação destas duas empresas. Eu não aguento mais, não aguento! Vocês do Mozilla já foderam meu psicologico nestes quase 6 anos de descaso, banimentos e indiferença com a própria comunidade de usuários e clientes. E eu cansei! É uma promessa isso daqui: EU DESCOBRIREI FUNCIONÁRIOS DESTA EMPRESA E ELES PAGARÃO POR TUDO QUE VOCÊS ME FIZERAM! INDEPENDENTE DE QUAL CARGO, FUNÇÃO OU ORDEM ELES TENHAM, PAGARÃO SIM! A empresa quis foder meu Natal? A empresa quis fazer conluio de hacking pra me fazer ficar com psicologico abalado? Conseguiram e minha resposta não será juridica, nem nada, será na base do sangue! É o que voces quiseram e é o que vocês terão. Acabou toda minha vontade de viver em liberdade hoje, parabéns Mozilla! A partir de hoje o inimigo de vocês sou eu e não se esqueçam, TODOS SOMOS MORTAIS!
