It is difficult to explain given that I don't have any idea what is actually happening, but hopefully I can make it clear enough. </p><p>For some websites that require a username and password, I will correctly login and pass authentication but then I will be booted back to the initial login screen, almost like the login failed. I only know that it is technically a log out, not a failure, because I have briefly seen the URL change like I'm logging out. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox fresh multiple times on my Windows 11 laptop, but the same issue occurs consistently. </p><p>This happened when I was trying to login to the student portal for my university and when I was trying to login to my apartment's resident portal. Changing cookie settings or going into a private browser has not helped at all. I cannot tell if this is a bug with Firefox (maybe just on Windows 11?) or if there is some background setting that needs to be adjusted, but it is very frustrating. If this keeps happening, I would have to switch to a different browser, which would not be ideal. </p><p>Does anyone have any idea of steps that I could take for troubleshooting or any experience with similar issues? Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>",desktop;windows-11;firefox-1010;website-breakages;firefox-10101;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1512582;,jakeaevinger

There is a recurring issue that I can not figure out how to potentially replicate where video players of youtube and twitch will freeze their visual component but the audio will continue perfectly fine.

The `Close Tab` menu option is buried in the bottom-middle of the list. </p><p>This issue is somewhat complicated by the fact that I use the excellent Auto-Tab Discard extension to discard/sleep tabs.
