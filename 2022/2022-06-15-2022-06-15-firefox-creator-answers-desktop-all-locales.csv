Dopo un po' di navigazione ho il PC rallentato e trovo in esplora risorse un numero multlipo di processi rispetto al numero di schede aperte. Alcuni processi occupano anche centinaia se non migliaia di Mb. Ho provato a terminarne alcuni e molti, anche di quelli pesanti, non sono collegati a nessuna pagina aperta in quanto alla chiusura del processo non corrisponde nessuna chiusura in firefox. Domande:  1- come si fa ad evitare che si aprano un numero di processi scollegati dal numero di pagine aperte? 2- se rimangono aperti dei processi non più collegati a pagine aperte in firefox come si fa a fare pulizia prima che si rallenti il PC? Grazie per l'attenzione. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,fix-problems,it,"",carlo.fantoni

They are on Windows 7. As part of that setup, I needed to shrink the C: partition so I could create a second partition. The C: drive is on a SATA connected SSD. After running a defragger to do that and consolidate the files to the lower half of the disk I found that there were some unmovable files very near the end of the disk that prevented the shrink. When I examined the files (via the defragger interface), they were in the Firefox profile in the Cache2 folder. But when I navigated to the profile, there was no cache2 folder. </p><p>I have run chkdsk and it fixed a few errors but the files were still unmovable and not visible in Explorer. I have enabled Hidden and System files. So how in the heck do I delete these files so I can shrink the partition? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",DoctorBashir
