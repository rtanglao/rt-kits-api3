I stop it via Task Manager, rerun FF and see that 2 instances of it re running. I untick ""open previous windows and tabs"" and shut down FF.

After the latest update (4 March 22) suddenly pages that have always been black text on white background are now showing in what looks like dark mode. I have vision impairment and now I can't even see these pages properly without considerable difficulty. I can't go on using Firefox like this and no provision seems to have been made for people who don't actually WANT everything changed on them. Can't I just go back to the way it was? I tried disabling dark themes, tried all these fixes, nothing seems to work. Tried Colours under Languages and Appearance, I can get it at least black-on-white but now all the menu and options colour settings have been lost. All I want is for Firefox to display the themes/modes I set and not second-guess me and set something I didn't. It's utterly ludicrous that you actually set it to disable dark modes but FF forces them on you anyway. Not everyone has the eyes of a young fit person in perfect health. I just want it like it was before... or like I actually SET IT... how come that's so hard? What's going on here? Do I have to abandon Firefox just to not be stuck with an unwanted ""feature"" that is making it uncomfortable and difficult to even see the d... thing? Why should it take all this ""try this, try that, did it work? No again, huh? Well *try* this..."" with obscure custom settings that the average user can't understand, just to get a basic display like we've had for decades? At the very least how can I re-install an older version that isn't stuck with this design fail? It's frustrating that I can't finish what I needed to do online because I can't actually SEE the pages I need now and my only option is to go to a completely different browser!
