Each update seemed to change something that was working fine and didn't need changing... the last straw was making the on-screen font so small that it was nearly impossible to read.  </p><p>It took me quite a while to find a way to change the font size and appearance back to something usable. That was when I decided to disable automatic updates. Now, every time I open FF or TB I get a nag screen and this is beyond annoying. There does not appear to be any way to stop this happening outside of doing complicated stuff in the registry that I am not prepared to do.  </p><p>So basically, I am looking for a recommendation on the best alternative browser and mail app that I can use when I delete FF and TB. Chrome seems to work OK for a browser and although I don't like the GUI, Gmail is probably the logical choice as I use Gmail addresses. I don't need apps that work on phones as I work on a PC, so a simple clear GUI is more important to me than all kinds of clever features that I will never use :) </p><p>Cheers...
