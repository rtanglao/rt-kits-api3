Recently I had to reset my Windows 10 because of non-stop ""Not reponding"" errors both offline and online.  That went okay and I was able to re-connect to Firefox 96.  But I was unable to find firefox.exe anywhere.  My work-around was to copy my Win Apps icon to the taskbar in order to click on it. </p><p>The most relevant file I found was this one, which I guess means that FF crashed in the process of being reinstalled: firefox.exe.6892.dmp C:\Windows\old\Users\MyName\AppData\Local\CrashDumps I’m attaching an image that shows the details. </p><p>Despite not having a visible firefox.exe, FF works, except that it intermittently fails to fill in forms.  When I search for Autofill Forms on the Security page, it is missing.  I am a US user and via config tried pasting the autofill forms command and clicked +, but after closing FF, that function was still missing on Security. </p><p>So my question is what to do about the hidden firefox.exe and does that have anything to do with the missing autofill functionality?  </p><p>In advance, thanks very much for your help. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,other,en-US,1478476;1478477;,bo.cinesthetic.30.yx

OK until recently when the resulting jpeg file download is blocked by ff for ""potential security risk"". [Literally the DL report says blocked but my photo software shows a jpeg file created that cannot be read.] An ff clone browser gets the file OK. Also there is a manual over-ride in ff that works one file at a time. I don't see any way to automate for batch or site itself. Manual for each file is a nuisance. I really don't know what I'm dealing with here but I doubt there is a virus or security danger for my home (not networked) pc. Thanks for any assist. </p><p>PS: I see in download help here, the threat warning of PSR [potential security risk] is ambiguous. Compared to ""may harm your computer"", a higher level. PSR says ""uses an insecure connection  . . . may be corrupted or tampered with during  the download process"". I read this knowing that another browser, and the ff override, get the file no problem. Can a security threat be concealed in a jpeg file? FF is relying on google-based protection, I believe. </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-960;,firefox,customize,en-US,1478462;,persister

This works... until it doesn't. For no reason and at random times Firefox stops asking me where I want to save downloads. It also doesn't download them automatically. It basically ignores any commands to 'save as' or download files like PDFs. The only thing that fixes the problem is restarting FF. </p><p>I'm on the latest macOS with the latest FF version, but this has also occurred on previous versions of FF.  </p><p>Any suggestions? </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-960;firefox-9602;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1478486;,info6880

Each update seemed to change something that was working fine and didn't need changing... the last straw was making the on-screen font so small that it was nearly impossible to read.  </p><p>It took me quite a while to find a way to change the font size and appearance back to something usable. That was when I decided to disable automatic updates. Now, every time I open FF or TB I get a nag screen and this is beyond annoying. There does not appear to be any way to stop this happening outside of doing complicated stuff in the registry that I am not prepared to do.  </p><p>So basically, I am looking for a recommendation on the best alternative browser and mail app that I can use when I delete FF and TB. Chrome seems to work OK for a browser and although I don't like the GUI, Gmail is probably the logical choice as I use Gmail addresses. I don't need apps that work on phones as I work on a PC, so a simple clear GUI is more important to me than all kinds of clever features that I will never use :) </p><p>Cheers...
