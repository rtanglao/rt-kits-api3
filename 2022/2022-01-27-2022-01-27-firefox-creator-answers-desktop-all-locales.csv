OK until recently when the resulting jpeg file download is blocked by ff for ""potential security risk"".

Also there is a manual over-ride in ff that works one file at a time. I don't see any way to automate for batch or site itself. Manual for each file is a nuisance. I really don't know what I'm dealing with here but I doubt there is a virus or security danger for my home (not networked) pc. Thanks for any assist. </p><p>PS: I see in download help here, the threat warning of PSR [potential security risk] is ambiguous. Compared to ""may harm your computer"", a higher level. PSR says ""uses an insecure connection  . . . may be corrupted or tampered with during  the download process"". I read this knowing that another browser, and the ff override, get the file no problem. Can a security threat be concealed in a jpeg file? FF is relying on google-based protection, I believe. </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-960;,firefox,customize,en-US,1478462;,persister

Each update seemed to change something that was working fine and didn't need changing... the last straw was making the on-screen font so small that it was nearly impossible to read.  </p><p>It took me quite a while to find a way to change the font size and appearance back to something usable. That was when I decided to disable automatic updates. Now, every time I open FF or TB I get a nag screen and this is beyond annoying. There does not appear to be any way to stop this happening outside of doing complicated stuff in the registry that I am not prepared to do.  </p><p>So basically, I am looking for a recommendation on the best alternative browser and mail app that I can use when I delete FF and TB. Chrome seems to work OK for a browser and although I don't like the GUI, Gmail is probably the logical choice as I use Gmail addresses. I don't need apps that work on phones as I work on a PC, so a simple clear GUI is more important to me than all kinds of clever features that I will never use :) </p><p>Cheers...
