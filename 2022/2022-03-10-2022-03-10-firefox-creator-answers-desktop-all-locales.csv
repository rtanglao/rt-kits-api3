Every time I do a download (and I do a lot) the drop down list showing the downloads I've done pops out. It didn't do this prior to the update. It used only to appear when I selected it. Now it comes out every blasted time.  It's very annoying and distracting. To be clear, I still want to see the download arrow/indicator/whatever so I can see the download is happening, but I don't want to see the list each time. How do I make it STOP? Image attached. Thank you. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,customize,en-US,1488426;,rorfordak
