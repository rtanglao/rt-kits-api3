I can have one profile open with one tab and still wish there would be a better response.  </p><p>I have lots of profiles. I think the performance was better when I first started Firefox on this computer. I wonder If I eliminate profiles will I get a better performance.  </p><p>How do I go proving this? - How easy can I take the profiles folder copy and rename it then start firefox with a profile folder and only one profile and one tab then What?  </p><p>I did not gain a significant advantage in the load times for firefox. The load time for the browser with only the one empty tab 22 - 26 seconds . The load time for <a href=""http://yahoo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">yahoo.com</a> main page 31 -36 seconds. The load time for a link on the yahoo main page 20 - 22 seconds. </p><p>The question was ""does having a large profile folder slow response time for firefox""? I believe I am seeing that this is true. When I load the yahoo profile it can take 10+ seconds more to resolve the main page and up to an addition 5-7 seconds to resolve the opened tabs. </p><p>Know that the browser was the only user process opened at the times of the tests. Know that the internet connection is the primier package and I have been monitoring the speeds frequently recently. I am good with the internet connection times. Know that I know the quick fixes and either there was no improvement or the inconvience of doing with out dark reader is no option. </p><p>Now understand I did not run these tests through a testing suite.
