I cannot see Minimise, Restore and Close button on my Gmail page many times. Not happening always but many times. Attached the screenshot for your ref. I use Win7 at home and Win 10 at the work, both places have the same problem. Both FF browsers are Synced.  Even I cannot see those buttons when I click at those places it responds accordingly. So I guess there is some button visualization problem. Please help. Thank you.
