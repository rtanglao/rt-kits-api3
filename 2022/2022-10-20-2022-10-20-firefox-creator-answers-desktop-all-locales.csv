What used to happen was: I'd go to that webpage, and my username and password were already populating their respective fields, and all I had to do was click the ""sign in"" button. </p><p>Now what happens is: the fields are blank, but if I click into the blank username field, Firefox then offers to fill-in the fields -- my username appears underneath the blank field, and ""From this website"".  If I click on this, only then does Firefox actually populate the fields as if I typed them.  If I only had to this once or twice or day, this wouldn't bother me.  But I have to do this 20 or more times a day.  The extra needed mouse-click is annoying because it used to behave differently, as I described above. </p><p>In settings, I do indeed have ""autofill logins and passwords"" checked.  If I uncheck it, the only difference is a generic ""account name"" label appears where I should type my username (I assume this is Filemaker's prompt).  I can still click on it and Firefox offers to fill it.  When ""autofill logins and passwords"" is checked, the ""account name"" label does not appear, but the field is still blank and I still must click on it to get Firefox to fill in the info.  I have attached an image showing the difference.  Again, what used to occur is: when I'd go the webpage, ""EH"" was already inside the first box. </p><p>Since I can't seem to get the behavior I want from using the standard ""Settings"" in Firefox, I'm hoping there's something under ""about:config"" that one of you experts can direct me to. </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1060;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",redunzl
