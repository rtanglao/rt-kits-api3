I've been facing issues with my browser where I will click on buttons, refresh sites, etc... and they will fail to load. </p><p>One such example is in the image attached where I clicked on a link on google and am noticing in the network that most of the calls are failing. </p><p>Another example is I will open a new tab, type in a search term to the URL bar, and hit the Enter key. The URL will turn into the Google URL to which the browser is calling a GET, but I am never redirected and nothing loads. The screen itself will be completely greyed out, as if the process failed midway (second picture). </p><p>To briefly note, I've tried running multiple antivirus tests, have done a clean install of Windows, and have even brought my computer to a professional to ensure there were no hardware defects. None of these resolved the problem. </p><p>Doing a speedtest I get 900 mbps download, so it's unlikely to be an issue with slow internet connection. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1060;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",bryanejohns

I created a new Firefox account a few days ago, and after the first account tips email I unsubscribed using the link at the bottom of the email. But the emails keep coming. If I open the unsubscribe link in the email, it takes me to my account preferences, where all email options are already unselected (including ""Firefox account tips""). How can I stop these emails? </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1060;,firefox,other,en-US,1542119;,james.butler2

You may end up with multiple reports and somewhat incomplete reports form average users, however asking users to have all of these extra log-ins, to read the bug treatise, to navigate through this laborious - totally the reverse of a streamlined, thought-out process is symptomatic of the lack of focus on user feedback and I believe, the users themselves. </pre> <pre>   I understand during a reconfiguration there may be teething troubles, however this is not the case, it has been this way for a long time and continues to get more distant from a user friendly experience. </pre> <pre>   If you read between the lines above, I will not be gong through to <a href=""http://deas.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">deas.mozilla.org</a> via 2 log-in's, to go to <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/file-bug-report-or-feature-request-mozilla"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/file-bug-report-or-feature-request-mozilla</a> to try to select the correct repository and having read the clumsy tome, report a ""fix"" needed for something that should never of been rolled-out, to go though to <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Firefox</a> (or other) to log-in again and still be no closer to any kind-of direct, meaningful and constructive solution when I can ""hack"" the about:config and these issues IMO have been reported via <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org</a> on more than one occasion. </pre> <pre>   Yours sincerely    Phil B </pre> <pre>   On Fri, 24 Sept 2021 at 12:30, Mozilla Foundation Donor Care Team &lt;donorcare@mozillafoundation.org&gt; wrote: </pre> <pre>   Hello, </pre> <pre>   Thank you for being a Firefox user!

There is no link between the support volunteers and Mozilla, there is no way to contact Mozilla, there is no way to ask for a simple roll-back of a ""new"" unwanted feature i.e. backspace not working, search tab/bar/screen position. Firefox is losing it's way and ignoring and not appearing to want any constructive feedback and no way to monitor or act on it.
