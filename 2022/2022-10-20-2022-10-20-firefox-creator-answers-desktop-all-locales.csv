The main idea of using userChrome.css to override the default styles for Reader View does not seem to work. My userChrome.css file does work on other items though (like removing the sidebar width restriction). </p><p>Whatever advice I find via Google perhaps cites outdated CSS selectors, but current selectors do not seem to be documented anywhere by Mozilla. Moreover, I cannot find any file on my local drive named aboutReader.css when using find or grep commands in bash, those this file name is alluded to when viewing a page in Reader View and then in turn viewing source on that transformed page. </p><p>Moreover, addons that would allow me to change the colors seem to be restricted in Reader View. </p><p>It does seem like something has changed in recent Firefox updates but I can't remember when I last saw, for instance, links in dark mode Reader View that were still pink (whereas now they are blue, and impossibly dark to see, especially when you are disabling as much blue light as possible through your operating system). I need a higher contrast color for links in dark mode Reader View so I can actually see them. </p><p>I can alternatively use the Tranquility Reader addon and have custom colors, but A) that addon does not work with the Automatic Reader View addon, whereby I can always have various sites appear in some sort of ""reader view"" whether the native one or Tranquility Reader, and B) hitting refresh when in Reader View will defeat some soft paywalls but this does not work with, e.g., Tranquility Reader, so I still would prefer to be able to custom colors in the native Reader View feature, rather than rely on an addon. </p><p>1. Where are the current styles for Reader View even documented? 2. Is overriding them now restricted? 3. Why did the link color change from pink to blue in newer versions of Firefox (this is a terrible accessibility bug)? 4 .Where is the alluded to aboutReader.css stylesheet actually stored on my computer (it doesn't seem to be a file on the filesystem in the Firefox profiles folder, it seems more like it is embedded in the Firefox binary/executable)? 5. Will Firefox settings ever allow us to set colors specifically for Reader View (I don't mean the override settings for all web pages, particularly web pages not being rendered in Reader View ... that setting does not help in Reader View, nor would it be the desired preference for pages not in Reader View)? </p><p>Thank you. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1050;firefox-10503;,firefox,customize,en-US,1542233;1542292;1542294;1542330;1542332;,ddfox

What used to happen was: I'd go to that webpage, and my username and password were already populating their respective fields, and all I had to do was click the ""sign in"" button. </p><p>Now what happens is: the fields are blank, but if I click into the blank username field, Firefox then offers to fill-in the fields -- my username appears underneath the blank field, and ""From this website"".  If I click on this, only then does Firefox actually populate the fields as if I typed them.  If I only had to this once or twice or day, this wouldn't bother me.  But I have to do this 20 or more times a day.  The extra needed mouse-click is annoying because it used to behave differently, as I described above. </p><p>In settings, I do indeed have ""autofill logins and passwords"" checked.  If I uncheck it, the only difference is a generic ""account name"" label appears where I should type my username (I assume this is Filemaker's prompt).  I can still click on it and Firefox offers to fill it.  When ""autofill logins and passwords"" is checked, the ""account name"" label does not appear, but the field is still blank and I still must click on it to get Firefox to fill in the info.  I have attached an image showing the difference.  Again, what used to occur is: when I'd go the webpage, ""EH"" was already inside the first box. </p><p>Since I can't seem to get the behavior I want from using the standard ""Settings"" in Firefox, I'm hoping there's something under ""about:config"" that one of you experts can direct me to. </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1060;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1542285;,redunzl
