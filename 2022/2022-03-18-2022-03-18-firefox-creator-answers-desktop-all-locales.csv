It will let me log into Facebook, but when I get there and try to do something, it logs me out,then the log-in pop-up is constantly asking me to log-in, I click on log-in, and it pops-up again asking me to log-in. This has something to do with my picture being missing on the Facebook log-in page. Because when I use my Google Chrome to log-in to Facebook, my picture is on the log-in page and everything works fine. But I like using Firefox on Facebook to play my games. I contacted Facebook, but haven't heard back from them. Are they mad at Firefox and causing problems with log-ins? Do I need to uninstall Firefox and re-install, somebody please help I want Firefox for Facebook please.
