But every once in a while, when accessing the login portal through HTTP protocol, it redirects to the same URL but using HTTPS protocol, and when you try to login, the POST request fails with NS_BINDING_REDIRECT error, probably because it gets redirected to ""login_sucess"" page with HTTP protocol.

For a few days now I have a problem with some websites not opening, or opening very slowly with the message “performing a TLS handshake”. Other websites open without any problem. As an alternative, I use Opera, and there are no problems at all. OS is Windows 10. </p><p>I noticed for a while now that Firefox took some time to start. Then websites started to open very slowly, sometimes not at all, and then regularly the TLS handshake message was displayed. I checked for solutions, tried practically everything, but problem persists. I use the default theme, don't have extensions or add-ons I don't have any anti-virus, other than Windows Defender, integrated in Windows 10. I cleared several times the cache. History and cookies are regularly deleted when I close Firefox. I set the DNS to Google's DNS, primary 8.8.8.8, secondary 8.8.4.4. I disabled Ipv6. Renamed cert9.db, and with restart created a new file (it was cert9, and not cert8, as indicated in some posts) Started Firefox in safe mode. I performed a scan with Malwarebytes. I tried all the troubleshooting indicated on several support forums and websites. Yesterday I created a new profile. This morning I uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox. Don't know what else to do. </p><p>The profiles: There are 7 old profiles with date 12/03/2022, 19:41. Were they all set to this date by an update? One profile is displayed with yesterday's date 17/03/2022, 20:42 . This was the former active profile. I created a new profile yesterday evening, but it is displayed today with 18/03/2022, 08:12 . Maybe I did a refresh, don't remember... Another profile, “xxx.default-release”, is shown with today's date 18/03/2022, 08:41 . The newest profile, “xxx.default-release-xxxxx”, probably created with the new installation, changes its time stamp continuously and displays, when I open or close Firefox, the current hour and minutes.  Is this normal or maybe an indication that something is wrong? </p><p>Anyway... any hints how tho solve this issue?

This all worked fine, but I noticed that Firefox mentioned the home folder of the account on my mac on which it was installed to identify that Firefox instance running on my Mac. This home folder is the name of my user account, which is my actual name. So Firefox has access to and is in some sense broadcasting my actual name over the internet. I understand that this might be only viewable by me and encrypted, so not even viewable by Firefox itself let alone the public internet (and I hope my understanding is correct and this is indeed the case--correct me if I am wrong), but it was still disconcerting that ""metadata"" like this is floating around the internet which can easily identify someone even if he goes to great lengths for privacy. </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-980;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",rbjones111960

Files are now automatically saved to 'Downloads' or can be saved to another folder. This sudden autocratic change has caused much grief to many Firefox users judging by comments already made in numerous forums. It appears some Firefox 'brainstormers' created this change to 'benefit' users and to prevent data loss etc. Well, this user and many others strongly disagree and hope that Firefox will reconsider their decision or at least offer some alternative or option to 'just open' a file without saving it. I have, for now, installed an old Firefox version (96.0) to recover the old option menu to open or save files. However, if Firefox persist with this change, without offering a 'open only' option, I and many other users will be forced to switch to other browsers, e.g. Microsoft Edge, which do offer that option. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-960;v98-download;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",kuya7447
