I'm using Brave, but it blocks about half of all sites; sez they're un-secure or un-verifiable. </p><p>I expect to be able to go back to work eventually, but this is ridiculous.

When I tried to do that today, i cannot do that. I cannot find any settings or solutions to fix this problem. I can zoom in/out when I am normally watching YouTube (not full screen).

I'd noticed that several times the screen would go completely blank.  What seems to be triggering it is if the site gets an update while I'm scrolling deep into its feed, FF just blanks the screen.  I'd prefer that FF just ignored that and let me continue scrolling, instead of having to control-R to get the page reappear [at the top, of course] and then have to fight my way down to where I was. </p><p>Anyone else seeing this kind of behavior? </p><pre>  /Bernie\ </pre>",desktop;other;escalate;display;windows-10;bug_1;webpages;firefox-970;,firefox,other,en-US,"",BernieC

The list is very long, so I am creating the list of links in a separate document until it is completed. Until then, I test the links by having the link href set to 'webpage.html#identifier', but all this ends up doing is opening another tab and reloading the page when it's already open in a different tab. I am using the target='_blank' attribute to go to another tab, but I'm sure this isn't the proper way to do it. </p><p>Is there a way to use a link to go to an already open tab and perform the search for the identifier in that tab rather than opening a new tab and reloading the page repeatedly? </p>",desktop;beta;tabs;escalate;developer;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",WayneCa
