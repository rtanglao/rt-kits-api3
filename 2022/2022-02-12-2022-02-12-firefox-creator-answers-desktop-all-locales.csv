I recently allowed Firefox to update to Firefox 97. The text became very blurred. I adjusted ClearType Text. This did not improve matters and worsened clarity for other browsers. I deleted Firefox, moved to other Chrome and Edge, and found that something was blocking many websites most but not all of the time.  I tried everything I could think of to fix by changing browser settings particularly disabling or deleting add-ons. Ultimately the only way I could restore function was to restore the laptop to what it was before updating to Firefox 97 including loss of some files particularly emails.  The problems started with the update to F97. I am now using F96 and am too concerned to update it. Can F97 cause such problems, is it safe for me to stick with F96, is it now safe to update to F97 or should I just move to other browsers. Any guidance would be appreciated.

Typing in a website into the address bar doesn't even start a load. Nothing simply happens. Tried opening the settings but it will not activate. Restarting in troubleshoot mode causes no changes.

I have configured the proxy in system settings and Proxifier. I even tried configuring it manually on Firefox. But for some reason Firefox keeps trying to send the Facebook traffic directly through the connection instead of using the proxy. As far as I can tell Facebook is the only site this is happening and connecting to any other website works fine. Connecting to Facebook using other browsers forks fine as well. </p><p>PS:- Just found out this issue is not limited to facebook. Firefox tries to directly connect to every site that uses a cdn server. </p>,desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",mahela100

I'd noticed that several times the screen would go completely blank.  What seems to be triggering it is if the site gets an update while I'm scrolling deep into its feed, FF just blanks the screen.  I'd prefer that FF just ignored that and let me continue scrolling, instead of having to control-R to get the page reappear [at the top, of course] and then have to fight my way down to where I was. </p><p>Anyone else seeing this kind of behavior? </p><pre>  /Bernie\ </pre>",desktop;other;escalate;display;windows-10;bug_1;webpages;firefox-970;,firefox,other,en-US,"",BernieC
