The device is managed by Microsoft Family, which blocks Firefox by default. I got around this by renaming ""firefox.exe"" to something else. This works to get Firefox open, but the modified filename is causing Windows to not recognize it as a browser. As a result, I can't get Firefox set as the default for http/https. </p><p>I've tried tools like SetDefaultBrowser from Christoph Kolbicz but no success, it is unable to notice that firefox no longer exists as ""C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"" </p><p>Anyone have any advice on how to fix this? Windows seems adamant not to let me set the http/https protocols to anything it doesn't think is a browser (i.e. my Firefox installation). </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-11;firefox-970;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1483036;,coloradosjones

I have now found that I can access the page and complete the puzzle using Microsoft Edge but I have no desire to use Edge. I have read a statement in the NYT that the puzzle will continue with free access so payment is not an obstacle. Is there likely a setting in Firefox which is preventing me access to the puzzle and, if so, are you able to suggest where I can access the setting.

I'd prefer that FF just ignored that and let me continue scrolling, instead of having to control-R to get the page reappear [at the top, of course] and then have to fight my way down to where I was. </p><p>Anyone else seeing this kind of behavior? </p><pre>  /Bernie\ </pre>",desktop;other;escalate;display;windows-10;bug_1;webpages;firefox-970;,firefox,other,en-US,"",BernieC
