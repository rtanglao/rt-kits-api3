My internet connection is good, FF (88.0) is able to connect to other sites. Other browsers (Opera, Chrome etc ) could all connect and allow my login. With FF it simply continues loading with no result. i have asked the bank to check their FF certificates? and they say there is no problem - just use another browser! Firefox is my main browser, the only one that can save my login details.  This problem is sporadic but has been going on for several months. It may be connected with FF updates but I am om the latest version  for my Linux distribution I believe. </p><pre> At one time FF would never connect to PC Optimum whereas other browsers did, that problem was somehow solved. </pre>",linux;desktop;websites;firefox-880;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",brumman

I have now found that I can access the page and complete the puzzle using Microsoft Edge but I have no desire to use Edge. I have read a statement in the NYT that the puzzle will continue with free access so payment is not an obstacle. Is there likely a setting in Firefox which is preventing me access to the puzzle and, if so, are you able to suggest where I can access the setting. Thank you, John Price </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",jandjp24

Typing in a website into the address bar doesn't even start a load. Nothing simply happens. Tried opening the settings but it will not activate. Restarting in troubleshoot mode causes no changes.

I have configured the proxy in system settings and Proxifier. I even tried configuring it manually on Firefox. But for some reason Firefox keeps trying to send the Facebook traffic directly through the connection instead of using the proxy. As far as I can tell Facebook is the only site this is happening and connecting to any other website works fine. Connecting to Facebook using other browsers forks fine as well. </p>,desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",mahela100

I'd noticed that several times the screen would go completely blank.  What seems to be triggering it is if the site gets an update while I'm scrolling deep into its feed, FF just blanks the screen.  I'd prefer that FF just ignored that and let me continue scrolling, instead of having to control-R to get the page reappear [at the top, of course] and then have to fight my way down to where I was. </p><p>Anyone else seeing this kind of behavior? </p><pre>  /Bernie\ </pre>",desktop;other;escalate;display;windows-10;bug_1;webpages;firefox-970;,firefox,other,en-US,"",BernieC

The list is very long, so I am creating the list of links in a separate document until it is completed. Until then, I test the links by having the link href set to 'webpage.html#identifier', but all this ends up doing is opening another tab and reloading the page when it's already open in a different tab. I am using the target='_blank' attribute to go to another tab, but I'm sure this isn't the proper way to do it. </p><p>Is there a way to use a link to go to an already open tab and perform the search for the identifier in that tab rather than opening a new tab and reloading the page repeatedly? </p>",desktop;beta;tabs;escalate;developer;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",WayneCa
