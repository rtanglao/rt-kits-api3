Colour management is enabled in Firefox, the images are jpeg in sRGB colour space.  It doesn’t matter if the images are viewed in Firefox or another browser or on a different device they look rubbish. However, if I upload them using edge or another browser they look fine, both in the that and in Firefox. So somehow the Firefox interface with Facebook is messing up the colours.  I’m now having to use a different browser to upload to Facebook. Does anyone know what’s going ok? Thans </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",glove99

I've never had this issue before the most recent update where now youtube videos constantly stutter. It's just Firefox as other browsers work fine. I've updated my graphics card and did a little bit of research but none of the fixes quite did it for me. In the past couple days I've always had Firefox crash on me twice, which hasn't happened before either. So I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm prone to point fingers at an update. I don't install extensions or themes, so the only extension I have really is uBlock Origin but that's been there forever. I've restarted my computer as well. It is not my resources, they are more than fine my RAM and CPU and Graphics Card. Task manager shows nothing is even above 50% (CPU, GPU, Memory) when playing the video. I've also tried creating a new profile and opening up a new profile. Same issue. </p><p>Can anyone suggest any fixes or is this a firefox update bug? </p><p>EDIT: This appears to be for all videos I am playing on Firefox.
