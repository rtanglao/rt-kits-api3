In fact, it hasn't worked in years for me, and that's on numerous PCs, with Windows 7 and Windows 10.  I'm doing this so I can paste images into Photoshop.  It looks like, instead of copying the image itself, it's just copying the image file, but this means I can't paste it into Photoshop. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,other,en-US,1513417;,r.thomas.wright

I was previously able to do the following functions, but have had problems with it for the past few Firefox updates. </p><p>1) When I open Gmail in Firefox browser, the paperclip 'attach' button will not open any windows to select a file to attach.  I can only drag files into the email to attach them by opening Finder and locating the file.  The attachment feature works in other browsers. </p><p>2) When I open a PDF file in Firefox browser, it will no longer allow me to download them.  I can do this in Chrome and Safari on my Macbook. </p><p>I really like using Firefox and don't want to use the other browsers.  Can you help with why these problems have started occuring? Thanks. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,other,en-US,"",mridley14

I've never had this issue before the most recent update where now youtube videos constantly stutter. It's just Firefox as other browsers work fine. I've updated my graphics card and did a little bit of research but none of the fixes quite did it for me. In the past couple days I've always had Firefox crash on me twice, which hasn't happened before either. So I'm not sure what's going on, but I'm prone to point fingers at an update. I don't install extensions or themes, so the only extension I have really is uBlock Origin but that's been there forever. I've restarted my computer as well. It is not my resources, they are more than fine my RAM and CPU and Graphics Card. Task manager shows nothing is even above 50% (CPU, GPU, Memory) when playing the video. I've also tried creating a new profile and opening up a new profile. Same issue. </p><p>Can anyone suggest any fixes or is this a firefox update bug? </p><p>EDIT: This appears to be for all videos I am playing on Firefox. It also does not matter if I set it to the lowest quality, even 144p, it will still stutter nonstop. </p>",desktop;windows-10;firefox-1010;website-breakages;firefox-10101;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1513404;1513405;1513406;1513416;,novashmtv
