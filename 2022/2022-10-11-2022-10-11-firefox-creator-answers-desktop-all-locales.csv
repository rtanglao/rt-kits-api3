I need to print them off once a week. Since last week the pages don't print properly. Instead of showing the entire transactions, they are now half covered because the left hand side of the print page is covered by the bank's menu which always shows at the side of the webpage. I contacted the bank who said they'd had other firefox users complaining about this. They said that it's firefox's fault and follows an update which was done. Please can you help? I have attached a snipping tool image of the problem. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1050;firefox-10503;,firefox,other,en-US,"",fncv
