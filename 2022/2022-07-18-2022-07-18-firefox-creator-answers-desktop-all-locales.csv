I would like to know where to report issues regarding extensions and add-ons. If any of the above extensions are enabled then the Home page for YouTube is missing the video in either the #1 position or the #4 position in the top row. (See screenshot). I've used these extensions for years on the same system and have made no changes. Suddenly, for about a month the problem has been occurring. I have another identical system with the same extensions and have no issues. I use the following extensions along with the ones mentioned above. New Tab Override and DuckDuckGo and they have no interplay in with the issue I'm having. I've gone through an exhaustive process of disabling each one and trying various combinations of them and determined that the culprits are AdBlocker Ultimate, Plus or Free and uBlock Origin and Ghostery. Ghostery alone removes the video in the #1 position. But, if either of the other four are loaded with or without Ghostery then the video in #4 position is missing.

Just below the disabled group were Mozilla extension recommendations - among them, a tab manager. I added this and one other, glanced at info pages &amp; restarted to activate the Firefox update. And -- Presto! No tabs to manage. Oh well. </p><p>If adding this extension before checking it more thoroughly or doing any kind of set up is the cause of my hundred tabs loss, well, that ain't the way it should be. I can't give the name &amp; I don't want to look it up. It's long gone. Besides thinking how I might recover some of my lost tabs research, I had some time to try it out. Inane garbage. Put your tabs in carts. P'shaw. Chrome has a scrolling tab function for all open pages hiding at the upper right corner. Click the down arrow, scroll through all open tabs, see one, pick one &amp; presto, I'm on the web page even if it's on a different base page! It works well - for me, and, it is not an extension, it's built in. Guess I'll head that way . . . over to Chrome. Bunch of wonky higher math, commie history, motorcycle &amp; aircraft YouTube vidz awaiting my attention. There's nothing to open &amp; pick up with something I was working on recently on my default browser. </p><p>Wondering what kinds of responses, suggestions I may receive.
