Safari, which I prefer not to use, is no problem but if I try to log in using Firefox it gets stalled on the spinning wheel. I have an ad blocked but I had already turned it off for accessing that particular site, I think I just got a browser update, it just doesn't want to log in. Anyone have any ideas? I'm on a Macbook, OS 12.4. Firefox says it's up to date, version 102.0.1 </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",robertshill

After restart, upon reopening Firefox, I find I cannot find the 5 open pages I was in just minutes prior. Gone with them, about a hundred - maybe more - tabs. Some personal, some family/home/life/finances, some work, some work related research. WHISKEY TANGO FOXTROT ! ! ! </p><p>I usually (and have recently) put off updating Firefox (MBP ""desktop"" or/and Android phone) 'till it just won't go any more. Every time, I'm upset, for mainly trivial reasons, i.e.: extensions I've used for years no longer work &amp; there's never anything quite the same, or, especially on Android OS, I hate the look &amp; feel of changes. IT'S NOT JUST AVOIDING/DISLIKING CHANGE, SOMETIMES UPDATES ARE BAD!  ANDROID, JAN. 2018, MAYBE? WHENEVER, I COMPLAINED, COULDN'T GIVE LESS THAN A ONE-STAR REVIEW, POSTED IT AND FOUND I WAS NOT ALONE. BY A LONG SHOT! </p><p>re: TABS. Six or seven years ago v. 40-something wouldn't work any more. I begrudgingly updated to, hmmm, v.70-something and found a tab manager I really used, really liked, was no longer functional. Earlier today, just prior to updating, I went through extensions &amp; dumped four or five I'd disabled &amp; not chunked or gone back to for a while. Just below the disabled group were Mozilla extension recommendations - among them, a tab manager. I added this and one other, glanced at info pages &amp; restarted to activate the Firefox update. And -- Presto! No tabs to manage. Oh well. </p><p>If adding this extension before checking it more thoroughly or doing any kind of set up is the cause of my hundred tabs loss, well, that ain't the way it should be. I can't give the name &amp; I don't want to look it up. It's long gone. Besides thinking how I might recover some of my lost tabs research, I had some time to try it out. Inane garbage. Put your tabs in carts. P'shaw. Chrome has a scrolling tab function for all open pages hiding at the upper right corner. Click the down arrow, scroll through all open tabs, see one, pick one &amp; presto, I'm on the web page even if it's on a different base page! It works well - for me, and, it is not an extension, it's built in. Guess I'll head that way . . . over to Chrome. Bunch of wonky higher math, commie history, motorcycle &amp; aircraft YouTube vidz awaiting my attention. There's nothing to open &amp; pick up with something I was working on recently on my default browser. </p><p>Wondering what kinds of responses, suggestions I may receive. Truthfully, I'm not expecting a positive outcome. Perhaps I'll be surprised.  Hi HI. JS </p><p>BTW - If the foto ever loads, I'm hanging by the straps, my weenie bro's hanging on for dear life . . . I asked to be cinched tight, he called me a pussy. Big fun at last year's Iowa State Fair. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;website-breakages;firefox-1020;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1520423;,Jernhard.Stang
