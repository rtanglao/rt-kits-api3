Problem is:  search bar at top of my Firefox only intermittently brings up results.  I can type something in there and it appears to be searching, but nothing comes up.  Occasionally, if I hit it again it will bring something up, but not often.  Google is the browser. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ca266b

However, if I delete those Registry entries, it then breaks any embedded links in MS Programs such as Outlook mail and Excel. I have I.E as non-active (i.e. unchecked in Programs) but the system still seems to rely on I.E for opening any embedded links. Any suggestions as to how to fix this problem would be appreciated. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",Sandgroper48

I would like to know where to report issues regarding extensions and add-ons. If any of the above extensions are enabled then the Home page for YouTube is missing the video in either the #1 position or the #4 position in the top row. (See screenshot). I've used these extensions for years on the same system and have made no changes. Suddenly, for about a month the problem has been occurring. I have another identical system with the same extensions and have no issues. I use the following extensions along with the ones mentioned above. New Tab Override and DuckDuckGo and they have no interplay in with the issue I'm having. I've gone through an exhaustive process of disabling each one and trying various combinations of them and determined that the culprits are AdBlocker Ultimate, Plus or Free and uBlock Origin and Ghostery. Ghostery alone removes the video in the #1 position. But, if either of the other four are loaded with or without Ghostery then the video in #4 position is missing. Any help in resolving the issure would be greatly appreciated. Thank You! </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,other,en-US,1520437;,jessedeuce

After restart, upon reopening Firefox, I find I cannot find the 5 open pages I was in just minutes prior. Gone with them, about a hundred - maybe more - tabs. Some personal, some family/home/life/finances, some work, some work related research. WHISKEY TANGO FOXTROT ! ! ! </p><p>I usually (and have recently) put off updating Firefox (MBP ""desktop"" or/and Android phone) 'till it just won't go any more. Every time, I'm upset, for mainly trivial reasons, i.e.: extensions I've used for years no longer work &amp; there's never anything quite the same, or, especially on Android OS, I hate the look &amp; feel of changes. IT'S NOT JUST AVOIDING/DISLIKING CHANGE, SOMETIMES UPDATES ARE BAD!  ANDROID, JAN. 2018, MAYBE? WHENEVER, I COMPLAINED, COULDN'T GIVE LESS THAN A ONE-STAR REVIEW, POSTED IT AND FOUND I WAS NOT ALONE. BY A LONG SHOT! </p><p>re: TABS. Six or seven years ago v. 40-something wouldn't work any more. I begrudgingly updated to, hmmm, v.70-something and found a tab manager I really used, really liked, was no longer functional. Earlier today, just prior to updating, I went through extensions &amp; dumped four or five I'd disabled &amp; not chunked or gone back to for a while. Just below the disabled group were Mozilla extension recommendations - among them, a tab manager. I added this and one other, glanced at info pages &amp; restarted to activate the Firefox update. And -- Presto! No tabs to manage. Oh well. </p><p>If adding this extension before checking it more thoroughly or doing any kind of set up is the cause of my hundred tabs loss, well, that ain't the way it should be. I can't give the name &amp; I don't want to look it up. It's long gone. Besides thinking how I might recover some of my lost tabs research, I had some time to try it out. Inane garbage. Put your tabs in carts. P'shaw. Chrome has a scrolling tab function for all open pages hiding at the upper right corner. Click the down arrow, scroll through all open tabs, see one, pick one &amp; presto, I'm on the web page even if it's on a different base page! It works well - for me, and, it is not an extension, it's built in. Guess I'll head that way . . . over to Chrome. Bunch of wonky higher math, commie history, motorcycle &amp; aircraft YouTube vidz awaiting my attention. There's nothing to open &amp; pick up with something I was working on recently on my default browser. </p><p>Wondering what kinds of responses, suggestions I may receive. Truthfully, I'm not expecting a positive outcome. Perhaps I'll be surprised.  Hi HI. JS </p><p>BTW - If the foto ever loads, I'm hanging by the straps, my weenie bro's hanging on for dear life . . . I asked to be cinched tight, he called me a pussy.
