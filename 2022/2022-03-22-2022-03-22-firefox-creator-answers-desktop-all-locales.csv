I've uninstalled and reinstalled, did Refresh, tried to start it up in Troubleshoot mode, and nothing works. It'll open, and it'll show bookmarks, but if I try to go to a website, it just sits there and doesn't do anything. Doesn't act like it loads no matter how long I let it sit. I've tried to do about:config to maybe turn off ipv6 or http3, i type in about:config and it doesn't load. I tried to go to settings or to view passwords and it just puts in about:login...... in the address bar and just sits there. I'm not sure what's going on and any advice would be welcome. I've uninstalled all AV and am currently just using windows defender firewall, which I have also disabled as well and it didn't make a difference. Any advice or tips or fixes would be more than welcome.  </p><p>Firefox also doesn't shut down when I close it. I have to close it in task manager in order to start it up again </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",michelle_325
