No issues over the past month working with the clients I am having issues with. I work for a marketing company, we have multiple clients, so I have saved the logins and passwords for the clients whose sites I work with the most. For the past few weeks a couple of my clients but, not all of my saved logins, for LinkedIn and MailChimp, in particular, give me an error message saying that the password isn't correct. I have checked with the clients, none of the passwords have been changed. I can log in to some of my saved clients on both sites, but can't for some reason with these two different clients.  </p><p>Today I ran into the same issue with Instagram. I got the same ""password does not match"" error message and tried to log in with the handle rather than the saved email and the same password and it worked. Fine fix in the moment, however if all you use to log into a site is an email and a password, theres no work around for that. And it also doesn't really tell me what the issue is if the pw didn't work for the email but does for the handle (which in this case is exactly the same as the handle but with its @gmail.com) </p><p>I have deleted the saved passwords and emails for the problem clients, refreshed Firefox, turned the computer off/on. Nothing seems to work. I am at a loss as to what I need to do, I don't have any plugins on my browser, I use Firefox to save the passwords and the weirdest part is that its only 2 of my clients that are having issues. All of the other accounts I have saved for LinkedIn and MailChimp work fine, and my coworkers can log into my problem client accounts with the same passwords I am using.  </p><p>What am I missing here, Internet. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-109;firefox-7815;firefox-78150;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",ariana_geneva

I only use one of those accounts, for instance, to view Google News. Every time I click an article link on Google News, spawning a new tab, that particular website installs its own <em>cookies</em> in the specific Google account container tab that spawned the new tab. </p><p>I can overcome this by secondary-clicking on the link, navigating to the « Open Link in New Container Tab » context menu submenu, and in my case, choosing « No Container ». However, after awhile using the context menu gets tedious. </p><p>So I wonder if there is now, or could exist in the future, any way to set a default container tab (or no container at all) for <em>links</em> clicked inside a given container, when the links clicked do not match any of the <em>domains</em> set to automatically open in the given container being configured? </p><p>In the case above, I have Google-specific containers, and I think there is <em>separate</em>, Google-specific addon that may do what I want, but I use <em>multiple</em> Google accounts. Moreover, I really don't want to have to install multiple addons just to manage container tabs, when this univeral container tab management addon already exists. Moreover, I'd like to do the same thing with Facebook and Twitter container tabs </p><p>So in my case, the only domains I can think of offhand that automatically open in my Google 1, Google 2, and Google 3 container tabs are some variation of <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> (mail, voice, analytics, maps, etc) and <a href=""http://youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com</a>. </p><p>Thus I'd like for any other domain clicked inside these three different Google container tabs to open in a different container tab (in my case, no container, but it could also be, say, ""personal"" or any other arbitrary container tab that I have created) — without my ever having to use the <em>context menu</em> (and just primary-clicking the link on, say, Google News). I'd like to be able to do the same thing with, for instance, my Twitter and Facebook container tabs (also using more than one account on both of those platforms). </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-980;firefox-9801;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ddfox

Uso Firefox da molti anni e ho sempre impostato i download dei file su ""Chiedi sempre"" per scegliere se scaricarli o aprirli direttamente. Da un po' di tempo, nonostante io abbia mantenuto nelle Impostazioni, File e applicazioni, sia in Download sia in Applicazioni ""Chiedi dove salvare ogni file"", mi costringe sempre a salvarlo sul PC. Cosa che spesso rallenta il mio lavoro, visto che scarico molti Word e PDF inviatemi dalle case editrici. Ho seguito il tutorial, le impostazioni sono corrette ma continua a volere per forza salvare il file sul PC. Ho Windows 10 Home e uso sia la posta di Aruba sia Gmail. Su entrambe si comporta allo stesso modo. Bitdefender lo uso da anni e non mi ha mai creato problemi in questo senso. Come posso fare?  Vi invio lo screenshot delle impostazioni.
