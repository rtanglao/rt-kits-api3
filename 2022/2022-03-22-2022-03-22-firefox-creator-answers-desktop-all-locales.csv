One of the obvious and annoying ones is when I try to access the Live Chat on Lightspeed. The chat is never available for me even though it is 24/7 (see image below showing chat unavailable), but I can access it if I log in on a New Private Window or use a different browser (see second image below, showing chat available). </p><p>Is this an easy fix? I tried adding the sites as exceptions but it made no difference, I am obviously missing something. </p><p>Thanks for your help.

Uso Firefox da molti anni e ho sempre impostato i download dei file su ""Chiedi sempre"" per scegliere se scaricarli o aprirli direttamente. Da un po' di tempo, nonostante io abbia mantenuto nelle Impostazioni, File e applicazioni, sia in Download sia in Applicazioni ""Chiedi dove salvare ogni file"", mi costringe sempre a salvarlo sul PC. Cosa che spesso rallenta il mio lavoro, visto che scarico molti Word e PDF inviatemi dalle case editrici. Ho seguito il tutorial, le impostazioni sono corrette ma continua a volere per forza salvare il file sul PC. Ho Windows 10 Home e uso sia la posta di Aruba sia Gmail. Su entrambe si comporta allo stesso modo. Bitdefender lo uso da anni e non mi ha mai creato problemi in questo senso. Come posso fare?  Vi invio lo screenshot delle impostazioni. Grazie mille per l'attenzione. Daniela Ariano </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9801;,firefox,download-and-install,it,1491490;,info7166

Furthermore, the drop down menu is now in black and white. I am aware that Noscript just went to version 11.4, but is this part of the changes, or is something weird happening here? I've never seen it change logos or setup like this in all the time its existed. Can someone confirm if this is a normal thing or a glitch? It literally changed icons on me just a few minutes ago for no reason I can determine. I am including images of the icons/logo as it is supposed to look, plus the new weird appearance. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,other,en-US,1491460;1491464;1491470;,Marc7

I tried to go to settings or to view passwords and it just puts in about:login...... in the address bar and just sits there. I'm not sure what's going on and any advice would be welcome.
