Furthermore, the drop down menu is now in black and white. I am aware that Noscript just went to version 11.4, but is this part of the changes, or is something weird happening here? I've never seen it change logos or setup like this in all the time its existed. Can someone confirm if this is a normal thing or a glitch? It literally changed icons on me just a few minutes ago for no reason I can determine. I am including images of the icons/logo as it is supposed to look, plus the new weird appearance. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,other,en-US,1491460;1491464;,Marc7

I tried to give them all different themes. A has a red theme and keeps it consistently. B, my default profile, should have a green theme, and C should have a black theme. However, when I change B's theme to green, the theme on C also changes to green, and when I change the theme on C to black, the theme for B also changes to black. I don't know what I did differently for A!

I've uninstalled and reinstalled, did Refresh, tried to start it up in Troubleshoot mode, and nothing works. It'll open, and it'll show bookmarks, but if I try to go to a website, it just sits there and doesn't do anything. Doesn't act like it loads no matter how long I let it sit. I've tried to do about:config to maybe turn off ipv6 or http3, i type in about:config and it doesn't load. I tried to go to settings or to view passwords and it just puts in about:login...... in the address bar and just sits there. I'm not sure what's going on and any advice would be welcome. I've uninstalled all AV and am currently just using windows defender firewall, which I have also disabled as well and it didn't make a difference. Any advice or tips or fixes would be more than welcome.  </p><p>Firefox also doesn't shut down when I close it. I have to close it in task manager in order to start it up again </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1491427;,michelle_325
