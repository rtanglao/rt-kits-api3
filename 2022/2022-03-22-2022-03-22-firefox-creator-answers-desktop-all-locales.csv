I only use one of those accounts, for instance, to view Google News. Every time I click an article link on Google News, spawning a new tab, that particular website installs its own <em>cookies</em> in the specific Google account container tab that spawned the new tab. </p><p>I can overcome this by secondary-clicking on the link, navigating to the « Open Link in New Container Tab » context menu submenu, and in my case, choosing « No Container ». However, after awhile using the context menu gets tedious. </p><p>So I wonder if there is now, or could exist in the future, any way to set a default container tab (or no container at all) for <em>links</em> clicked inside a given container, when the links clicked do not match any of the <em>domains</em> set to automatically open in the given container being configured? </p><p>In the case above, I have Google-specific containers, and I think there is <em>separate</em>, Google-specific addon that may do what I want, but I use <em>multiple</em> Google accounts. Moreover, I really don't want to have to install multiple addons just to manage container tabs, when this univeral container tab management addon already exists. Moreover, I'd like to do the same thing with Facebook and Twitter container tabs </p><p>So in my case, the only domains I can think of offhand that automatically open in my Google 1, Google 2, and Google 3 container tabs are some variation of <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> (mail, voice, analytics, maps, etc) and <a href=""http://youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com</a>. </p><p>Thus I'd like for any other domain clicked inside these three different Google container tabs to open in a different container tab (in my case, no container, but it could also be, say, ""personal"" or any other arbitrary container tab that I have created) — without my ever having to use the <em>context menu</em> (and just primary-clicking the link on, say, Google News). I'd like to be able to do the same thing with, for instance, my Twitter and Facebook container tabs (also using more than one account on both of those platforms). </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-980;firefox-9801;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ddfox
