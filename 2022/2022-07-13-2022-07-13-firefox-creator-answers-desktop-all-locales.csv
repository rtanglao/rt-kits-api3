Solitamente avvio FireFox e in tal modo si apre la finestra ""principale"" quindi dal menu Cronologia - Finestre chiuse di recente apro le altre due finestre. Oggi, di ritorno dalle ferie (2 settimane), il menu Finestre chiuse di recente è disattivo e mi è quindi impossibile aprire le altre due finestre se non cercando nella cronologia (ma una delle due finestre aveva davvero molte schede aperte quindi l'impresa è ardua). Ho letto delle risposte di circa un anno fa in cui si indicava di utilizzare il menu Rispristina sessione precedente ma nel mio menu Cronologia questa voce non è presente. Esiste una soluzione, eventualmente anche andando a copiare/spostare/modificare dei files ?
