Examples <a href=""https://manhuaplus.com/manga/emperors-domination/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://manhuaplus.com/manga/emperors-domination/</a> <a href=""https://mangaweebs.in/manga/pqmiwcdmho/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mangaweebs.in/manga/pqmiwcdmho/</a> <a href=""https://novelmic.com/manga/god-of-martial-arts-comics/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://novelmic.com/manga/god-of-martial-arts-comics/</a> <a href=""https://www.nightcomic.com/manga/spare-me-great-lord/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nightcomic.com/manga/spare-me-great-lord/</a> There are many more these are just a few. Also sometimes they do save correctly, be it after only clicking it one time to load it or twenty times. They do randomly work sometimes. This has nothing to does with all the normal ways of trying to fix favicons not saving or updating. I have tried all the ways I could find by googling. Most of the bookmarks save just fine. Its only the ones that come from many of the manga sites I read so it has to do with their sites I believe. I do not think their sites aren't broken for saving the favicons though because they do work random and if I try to save any of the websites as bookmarks in chrome it works perfectly. I hope this is just a small fix you can implement or tell me more of a direct way of fixing it myself because I can not find a solution that will work consistently. Especially after clearing history, cookies, and cache. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",drsand40
