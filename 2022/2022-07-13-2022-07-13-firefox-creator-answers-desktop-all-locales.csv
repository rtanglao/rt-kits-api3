I am also getting the slowness circle during this time.   Before this problem I had no issues at all.   I've disabled most startup apps on Windows 10 and also tested Twitch by disabling all add-on's for Firefox.  No change.   Using Brave browser, Twitch is up in seconds so its definitely Firefox.

Ho un problema che non riesco a risolvere: lavoro correntemente con tre finestre aperte, ognuna con X schede. Solitamente avvio FireFox e in tal modo si apre la finestra ""principale"" quindi dal menu Cronologia - Finestre chiuse di recente apro le altre due finestre. Oggi, di ritorno dalle ferie (2 settimane), il menu Finestre chiuse di recente è disattivo e mi è quindi impossibile aprire le altre due finestre se non cercando nella cronologia (ma una delle due finestre aveva davvero molte schede aperte quindi l'impresa è ardua). Ho letto delle risposte di circa un anno fa in cui si indicava di utilizzare il menu Rispristina sessione precedente ma nel mio menu Cronologia questa voce non è presente. Esiste una soluzione, eventualmente anche andando a copiare/spostare/modificare dei files ? Premetto che ho navigato con FireFox ma ho salvato alcuni files che pare contengano i dati per riaprire le finestre. Grazie Marco Melecchi </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,it,1519256;1519259;1519260;1519268;1519422;,MMelecchi68

I have two Firefox windows open. </p><p>When I unlock the computer after a period of non-use, the Firefox task bar icon has two white bars at the edge, indicating that two windows are open, but the windows not visible. Quitting and restarting Firefox does not help. </p><p>To recover the first window I must float the mouse over the task bar icon, opening thumbnails of the windows, then right click the first thumbnail and select Maximize. This makes the maximized window appear. Then I can drag the window away from the edge of the screen, reducing its size. After that it behaves normally until the computer is locked and unlocked; then the process repeats. </p><p>I can't recover the second window at all. Its thumbnail is empty except for a tiny rectangle in the upper left corner, presumably representing a tiny window. When I right click the thumbnail it doesn't open a menu; it just displays a blue rectangle as high as a normal window's title bar and about four times wider than high. Presumably this is what's left of the window. It has no title, no minimize/maximize/close buttons, and no system menu icon. Trying to change its size by dragging its edges has no effect. Nor does trying to maximize it by pushing it up to the top edge of the desktop. </p><p>What can I do to make Firefox behave normally?

Also sometimes they do save correctly, be it after only clicking it one time to load it or twenty times. They do randomly work sometimes. This has nothing to does with all the normal ways of trying to fix favicons not saving or updating. I have tried all the ways I could find by googling. Most of the bookmarks save just fine. Its only the ones that come from many of the manga sites I read so it has to do with their sites I believe. I do not think their sites aren't broken for saving the favicons though because they do work random and if I try to save any of the websites as bookmarks in chrome it works perfectly. I hope this is just a small fix you can implement or tell me more of a direct way of fixing it myself because I can not find a solution that will work consistently.
