The problem started around 27 April 2022. </p><p>In short: </p> <ul><li><ul><li> Both gMail and Google Drive keep saying “Ooops … the system encountered a problem (#2003) - Retrying in x s…” and “Not Connected”.  </li><li> The above message may stop for a period and then gMail within FF fails to render its pages properly. Icons go missing. For example the check boxes to the left of the emails disappear while the remainder of the subject lines remains. Menu icons across the top of an open gMail document disappear (like Download, Report Spam and Delete icons ….). This seems to suggest a cache issue. </li><li> Search within FF using Google fails also. After entering search terms and pressing ENTER, nothing happens.   </li></ul> </li></ul> <p>Note: </p> <ul><li> The stand-alone Google Chrome environment works fine. So gMail, Google Docs, Sheets etc work OK in the stand-alone Google Chrome app. </li><li> Duck Duck Go search works within the FF browser. </li><li> I have noted that if I simply log into MY Google Account under Firefox on her PC the same problem occurs.  </li><li> If we log into my PC the problem is not apparent using either of our Google Accounts. So it appears to be an issue on her PC. </li></ul> <p>I have tried : </p> <ul><li> Flushing the cache in FF for all time, including data. Then rebooted.  </li><li> We have followed your procedures under “Help” ie Runs a Firefox a tune up; used “Diagnose issues” and “cleared the startup cache”. </li><li> Have run Sophos AND MalwareBytes across the whole laptop. No PUPs or malware detected.  </li></ul> <p>I uninstalled FF using Revo Uninstaller which initially uses the standard FF uninstall exe then it scans the drive for removes all FF files and entries within the Registry; then I re-installed the latest version of FF.  Rebooted. No luck here either. I assume there is some remnant file that remains on the hard disk as some settings are retained after a new install. </p><p>Hardware: Lenovo ThinkPad , model 20QFS00B00. OS: Windows 10 Pro, vers 10.0.19044 Build 19044, 64 bit Firefox browser: is up-to-date; vers 99.0.1 (64 bit) </p><p><br> I can't find any recent issues related to this specific problem.  Please advise what to try next. </p><p>Of course I'm happy to provide additional info if required or work through different scenarios to isolate the issue(s). </p><p>Thanks in advance for any assistance, Steve Gee </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",comservmaint

Usually I need to do this if I need to reinstall the OS, (Windows and Linux), or a new pc, the usual, but this time I had a major crash, so I'm starting over.  </p><p>Anyway I have signed in on my pc to my FF account, and went through the menu to turn on sync, and I get to the page where is says, ""when ready click next to display the QR code"". I get my android out, open FF, sign in, click the ""Scan"" button, the FF scanner opens,, I open the QR code on the pc, (I have also went to the website to get a QR code). Then either way I scan the code, and get an errror msg ""Must scan from inside FF"". I am scanning from inside FF, with the FF QR scanner.  </p><p>I don't uinderstand how of the 20 or more times I have tried to do this, I can't get it to work. I don't understand how I screw up every times, over a few years. But I also know as I said, if it was a bug MOzilla would have fixed it by now. Usually I give up on that and just log into both the pc and the phone, close both browsers and reopen them and it will go ahead and sync.  </p><p>But not this time, I am unable to get it to sync for anything. I've been working on this for 3 days now, and at this point I'm confused, I don't remember what I have and have not done. Let me add, and I don't know if this will make a difference, I don't think so, but what do I know? Originally this all started, when I had to reset my password. I tried for 4 days there to get a recovery code to work. (The following is just to describe what I've done, and is not a second question) I had one downloaded, and saved on my pc. But no matter what route I took to go through the reset process, exactly as described in the help file, I never could get a place to enter the code. I read every article I could about it, and finally it seemed easier to just reset the password and resync than try to get the code to work.  </p><p>Which is why I am sitting here, desperatly needing to sync my data, but unable to. If anyone can tell me what I need to do I will appreciate it. If you need any more information, just let me know. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,sync,en-US,1501439;1501441;1501451;1501479;1501484;,1971robby

(This will mostly just be a problem for Meetup organizers.) When I click on ""Save photo"", nothing happens. No error message, nothing. It's as if the ""Save Photo"" button has been disabled. Firefox is my browser while I access <a href=""http://Meetup.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Meetup.com</a>, and I have the latest and greatest version of Firefox.  </p><p>I contacted Meetup and they haven't been able to solve the problem; they suggested that I clear my cache and my cookies and try again, but I get the same result.  HOWEVER, when I go into Microsoft Edge, I can upload photos with no problem.  So I have a work-around: use Microsoft Edge to upload photos.  So my question to you centers around: why does this work perfectly in Microsoft Edge, but it doesn't in the latest version of Firefox?   </p><p>To test the possibility that it's a bug on my personal desktop computer, I went to the public library and tried the same experiment, with the same result.  So I don't think it's problem with my personal desktop computer. </p><p>One other piece of information: the exact same thing happens (failure to update photo, that is) when I have the photo open in another application (Photoshop), even if I try to ""save photo"" to Meetup in Microsoft Edge.  Then when I close the other application (Photoshop in this case), Microsoft Edge lets me ""save photo.""   </p><p>I know that Firefox really doesn't want me to try to revert to a previous version, and it makes me nervous too, but I am suspecting that something in the latest Firefox version actually introduced a problem. (Or maybe triggered a Meetup bug of some sort; I still haven't located the problem.)  I've been on <a href=""http://Meetup.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Meetup.com</a> for years, I've had Firefox for years, they've worked together to upload photos in the past for years.  </p><p>If you want to get into the details, below, for what it is worth, is my initial question to the Meetup support people (with whom I am still in a conversation). </p><p>- - - - - - - -  </p><pre>I can't upload a photo for my event. In fact, I cannot upload a photo for any event at all. I deleted a couple of photos and an album because maybe our group had too many, but that didn't work. I can't even upload a photo that I had previously uploaded to a different event, so I don't think that the problem is with the photo itself. </pre> <p>Here's what happens. 1. Edit the draft of my meetup. 2. Click on ""upload photo."" The photo is 1827 x 1009 pixels, total size 63 KB. 3. I click on ""Upload photo"", then in ""add photo"" I click on ""upload photo"" again. I browse for the photo and select it. 4. The ""crop your photo"" screen appears, with the selected photo in it. It's already the size I want, so I click on ""Save Photo"".(Cropping doesn't help either.) 5. Nothing happens. No error message, nothing. The only think I can click on is ""cancel,"" which takes me out to the previous screen. - - - - - - </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1501469;,keith54

I have disabled graphics acceleration and restarted: the problem is still there. I have restarted in troubleshooting mode: the problem is still there.

The problem is to choose a language. In my case it is Polish. Unfortunately, in the Firefox browser, which I use, there is no option to change the language to Polish (Annex 1) as it is in the Google Chrome browser (Annex 2). Why? I would like to add that this phenomenon only occurs in the case of Onet in Firefox. How can this be removed?
