The problem is to choose a language. In my case it is Polish. Unfortunately, in the Firefox browser, which I use, there is no option to change the language to Polish (Annex 1) as it is in the Google Chrome browser (Annex 2). Why? I would like to add that this phenomenon only occurs in the case of Onet in Firefox. How can this be removed? Regards Alex. </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",orei
