Mozilla toimi aluksi ongelmitta ensisijaisena selaimena. Ensimmäisten W11 päivitysten jälkeen W11 palomuuri ei suostu enää päästämään Mozillaa nettiin. Saapuva ja lähtevä liikenne estetty. Firefoxin lisääminen sallittujen sovellusten joukkoon ei auta. Kirjoitan tätä vanhalla tietokoneella missä Windows 10 ja kaikki toimii kuten ennenkin. Ellen pysty tai ellette pysty ratkaisemaan ongelmaa on pakko vaihtaa selainta?

I also try to modify server response content-type to ""application/octet-stream"", content-length to ""0"" or ""-1"", all does not work even save a photos.zip with zero size. In the download manager of other browsers, for example, Chrome, it does not save anything to local download folder if the status code is 204/4xx/5xx. So, my question is: How to let FF not to save anything to local download folder for the download URL which response with 204/4XX/5XX, keep the same behavior with download from webpage? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",wangf1978
