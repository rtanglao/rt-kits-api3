So for almost all websites (when using Firefox) I use the Ctrl-scroll-wheel method to enlarge the page view, typically to 130 or 140% magnification. But strangely, when I do this on eBay, if the magnification is above 120% (i.e. 130% or larger), 'Contact Seller' links no longer work.  Instead of a 'hand' mouse pointer when hovering over the link, the cursor remains as an arrow.  Only when I reduce the magnification to 120% or less does the cursor change to a hand and the link then works (goes to the 'Contact' page for that seller). </p><p>When I view the same page in Chrome (Version 104.0.5112.80) I don't even need to use magnification – it displays most pages at a respectable text size, presumably scaled to the (known by Windows and thus available to browser) screen resolution.  Why doesn't Firefox do this??  Interestingly, in Chrome the same thing happens if magnified more than 110% (it has coarser magnification steps, the next being 125%): links also don't work.  But, of course, in Chrome I don't need to use magnification! </p><p>My request is thus that Mozilla either: 1. Display web pages at an appropriate size for the 'discovered' monitor resolution; 2. Make links work at any magnification; 3. Preferably both! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",DanielFFF
