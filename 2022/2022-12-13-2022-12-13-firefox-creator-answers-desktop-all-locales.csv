Preparing a big zip file, for example, photos.zip, 20MB 2. Put it to http server side, and write a simple download web page    	<a href=""photos.zip"" rel=""nofollow"">Download a zip file</a>   3. Download it with FF, and then cancel it before the download is finished 4. Remove this file from http server 5. In FF download manager, select the cancel download, and retry or restore the download 6. It will download the below response body, and save the below 404 page as ""photos.zip""        ""<a href=""http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd</a>""&gt;  </p><p>              &lt;meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text/html;charset=utf-8""&gt;         &lt;title&gt;Error response&lt;/title&gt;                   </p><h1>Error response</h1>         <p>Error code: 404</p>         <p>Message: File not found.</p>         <p>Error code explanation: HTTPStatus.NOT_FOUND - Nothing matches the given URI.</p>       <p></p><p>It is very confused, and let end-user misunderstand that the original file is already downloaded successfully. I also try to modify server response content-type to ""application/octet-stream"", content-length to ""0"" or ""-1"", all does not work even save a photos.zip with zero size. In the download manager of other browsers, for example, Chrome, it does not save anything to local download folder if the status code is 204/4xx/5xx. So, my question is: How to let FF not to save anything to local download folder for the download URL which response with 204/4XX/5XX, keep the same behavior with download from webpage? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",wangf1978
