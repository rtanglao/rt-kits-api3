One could say i am some Mozilla fanboy, having convinced many of my friends and relatives to use Firefox instead of any chrome based options (Which there are to many these days). It struck me today, as i was reworking some workflow elements in many programs i use daily, that it is impossible to change any key binding in Firefox anymore. I know it has been a while now, and i searched all over the web for an answer or a solution, but at this point it is clear that other than going in the code and recompiling Firefox manually, it is not possible. I stumbled upon the (only) extension that allows to change some shortcuts, but the two that i wanted to change are impossible to configure from it, being disabling only f12 as i would use it for other things but i do not want to lose the dev console and also ctrl+L to open the address bar, it is quite inconvenient and would much prefer to use ctrl+spacebar as it matches many other bindings i am using with other software. There have been many other features that were changed in the recent years that made me start to look for an alternative, as i see features melting away almost as quickly as the user base of the product. </p><p>I do understand that one person's problem is not going to change the way a big piece of software is working, but i am wondering, why are the users losing such features as basic as customizing key bindings in a piece of software that used to be so incredibly customizable in the past? Why is the only viable option to anything chrome based losing it's edge over the competition? Is Firefox v150 be based on the chromium engine or will it die before? </p><p>Thank you in advance, and no, i don't need the link to the shortcut page, i already have it. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1020;,firefox,customize,en-US,1516813;1516822;1516827;1516829;1516836;1516837;1516868;1516869;1516871;1516873;1516874;1516875;1516876;1516877;1516878;1517026;,1520lemoine
