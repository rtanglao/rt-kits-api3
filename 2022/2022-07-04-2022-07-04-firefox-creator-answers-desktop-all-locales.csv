Every time I change them, they revert to something else.  I need &amp;T for headerleft, &amp;PT for headerright, &amp;U for footerleft and &amp;D for footerright.  Invariably it changes all the headers to &amp;U, footerleft to &amp;P, and footerright to &amp;D.  My only thought is that I haven't saved the updates properly.  Please help!  ~AM </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1020;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",marquara
