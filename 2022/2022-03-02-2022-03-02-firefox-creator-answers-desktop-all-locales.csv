However, I lost my passwords. I have a password manager, but it was convenient with Firefox having them, and my cached sites, bookmarks, and other stuff. Not the end of the world, but would make my life easier having this back. Any ideas? </p><p>I looked through some articles to try and find the text or JSON files with this info, but no luck - either under the Firefox install files, or my Windows profile files. I also thought of uninstalling, just the 64 bit version, but not sure if the 32 bit will still be there when I'm done. </p><p>Unfortunately I never used the Mozilla/Firefox ""sync"" feature until now - so I didn't have them saved to the cloud.
