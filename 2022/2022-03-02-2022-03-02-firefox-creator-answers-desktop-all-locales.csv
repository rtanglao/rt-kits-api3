I couldn't find the password so I thought resetting it would be faster than trying all my passwords, especially with the 15 minutes wait every X tries.

I am devastated that years worth of work was destroyed just like that. I had some very valuable data there, and my folders will litterally take weeks if not months to restore by hand.  </p><p>Hopefully I didn't update the password on my smartphone yet. Is there any way to export the bookmarks from it? Otherwise, would it be possible to revert this change on Firefox's side? I just can't stress enough how valuable this data was to me.  </p><p>I looked for saved profile data on my computer, but of course everything I had locally before the password change was overwritten by the new data. </p><p>Please help me, I just don't understand this choice from Mozilla.
