Response from Firefox is ""Access Denied - Certificate issuer not recognized"". Also kept getting bumped out of my email account and all my open tabs would close abruptly. The last may have been rectified but I still can't get into the website I want to access.  </p><p>I've tried different browsers as well so I don't know if it's Mozilla only or my PC. Even if I type in https://www.(pagename).com, it displays as you don't have permission to access http://www.(pagename).com.  </p><p>I changed nothing on my PC that would cause the problem. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",Bcamp

I already contacted university tech support and Microsoft Outlook tech support and neither was able to provide me with a solution except for suggesting it could be a browser issue. </p><p>When I draft an email, as I am typing the email will delete itself, archive itself, or try to set up some weird category system that I didn't initiate. It has become impossible to draft emails online for this reason because I never know when something might erase or delete as I type. I do not have any issues typing on other websites, including using Gmail. </p><p>Has anyone else had this issue before with Outlook? </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;firefox-970;firefox-9701;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",a314acosta
