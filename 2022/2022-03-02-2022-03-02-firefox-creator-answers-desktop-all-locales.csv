I already contacted university tech support and Microsoft Outlook tech support and neither was able to provide me with a solution except for suggesting it could be a browser issue. </p><p>When I draft an email, as I am typing the email will delete itself, archive itself, or try to set up some weird category system that I didn't initiate. It has become impossible to draft emails online for this reason because I never know when something might erase or delete as I type. I do not have any issues typing on other websites, including using Gmail. </p><p>Has anyone else had this issue before with Outlook? </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;firefox-970;firefox-9701;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",a314acosta
