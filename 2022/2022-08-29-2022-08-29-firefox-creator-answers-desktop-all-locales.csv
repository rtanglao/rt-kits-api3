Every other site works fine. Youtube videos sometimes load fine but then the comment section never loads. When trying to go back to the home page of youtube it sometimes tells me I have no internet connection even though I do. On twitch the home page loads fine and stream previews play fine. As soon as I click on a stream though I just have a black screen with endless loading but I can see the chat activity. I have reset firefox and removed all extensions but have had no luck. I also tried a fresh install of firerfox but still no luck. The issue also still happens in a private window. I tried on chrome and do not have this issue. Any ideas? </p>,desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1040;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",g3charlie
