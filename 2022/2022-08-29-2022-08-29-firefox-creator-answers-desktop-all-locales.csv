So after the last update I disabled updates. That was a while ago (version 89) and my browser was getting pretty stale. So I backed everything up, reenabled updates, and now I have version 104. </p><p>And, of course, something is broken now. The context menus when I right click are not functioning as before. The userChrome.css is still there in the chrome folder in my profile and has the same contents. The option toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets is set to true. But it doesn't work anymore. I added a line to change the color of the tab toolbar and that worked. So userChrome.css is being read and acted upon. But the other command (I whittled it down to just one additional command for testing) is ignored. </p><p>Here is what my userChrome.css looks like right now: </p><p>@namespace url(""<a href=""http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul</a>""); </p> <ol><li>context-openlinkintab { display:none!important; } </li><li>TabsToolbar{ background-color: #CCCCCCÂ !important } </li></ol> <p>But the ""Open Link in New Tab"" still appears in the context menu when I right click a link. It didn't do this before the upgrade to 104. Did something break in between version 89 and 104 or is it some other oddity? </p><p>Any ideas? </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1040;,firefox,customize,en-US,1530165;,penderjohnd

Every other site works fine. Youtube videos sometimes load fine but then the comment section never loads. When trying to go back to the home page of youtube it sometimes tells me I have no internet connection even though I do. On twitch the home page loads fine and stream previews play fine. As soon as I click on a stream though I just have a black screen with endless loading but I can see the chat activity. I have reset firefox and removed all extensions but have had no luck. I also tried a fresh install of firerfox but still no luck. The issue also still happens in a private window. I tried on chrome and do not have this issue. Any ideas? </p>,desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1040;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",g3charlie
