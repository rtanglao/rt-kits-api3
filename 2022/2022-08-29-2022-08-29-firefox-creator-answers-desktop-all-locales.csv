Upon restart, neither BitDefender nor Firefox would open without crashing. I reinstalled both programs to see if that helped, but it did no good. I then completely uninstalled BitDefender, but Firefox still wouldn't open. I can't even open it in Safe Mode. They're the only programs that seem to be affected. I tried to find out what exactly updated so I could roll it back, but I can't find record of anything.
