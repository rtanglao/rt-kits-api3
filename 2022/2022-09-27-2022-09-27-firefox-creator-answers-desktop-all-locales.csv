When I clicked on it, it would either take me to the Instagram login page of a particular Instagram account I follow, or else take me to my own Instagram profile page. I did not sign into Instagram in the open tab upon receiving these notification. I'm including some screenshots so you can see how it appeared on my screen. The other Instagram accounts besides my own that would appear in my Firefox browser tab were both people in the UK, for what it's worth, contacts of mine on Whatsapp also.  </p><p>I just found it kind of creepy and thought I should report it to Mozilla.  </p><p>Thanks, JJ </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jenjusti11
