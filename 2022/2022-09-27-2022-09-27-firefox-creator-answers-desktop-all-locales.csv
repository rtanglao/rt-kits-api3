Acronis reported that the files were now quarantined. From that point on, I could not launch Firefox.  I deleted the app, and downloaded the latest FF from Mozilla and installed it.  When I attempt to launch it, a popup states that I do not have the required permission to launch the app. (see image) I have checked Acronis and have taken a screen shot of the problem files (see image). In an effort to clear the Macbook Pro of any residual issues, I ran a full scan with CleanMyMac X MAS, and cleared all caches and redundant files.  This ran and reported the job done and zero malware found.  Kaspersky Total also reports no malware found. I downloaded the current Mac release of FF again and installed it, but still cannot launch it because I don’t have the relevant permissions.  The app properties have been checked and as Admin, I have all relevant permissions.  However I still cannot launch FF browser.
