It listed the files and asked if I wanted to delete or quarantine the files.  I elected to quarantine them so that I could investigate the claim/issue.  Acronis reported that the files were now quarantined. From that point on, I could not launch Firefox.  I deleted the app, and downloaded the latest FF from Mozilla and installed it.  When I attempt to launch it, a popup states that I do not have the required permission to launch the app. (see image) I have checked Acronis and have taken a screen shot of the problem files (see image). In an effort to clear the Macbook Pro of any residual issues, I ran a full scan with CleanMyMac X MAS, and cleared all caches and redundant files.  This ran and reported the job done and zero malware found.  Kaspersky Total also reports no malware found. I downloaded the current Mac release of FF again and installed it, but still cannot launch it because I donâ€™t have the relevant permissions.  The app properties have been checked and as Admin, I have all relevant permissions.  However I still cannot launch FF browser. Any advice/recommendations would be welcome, as Firefox is my main browser, after Safari. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",r.oberin

When I clicked on it, it would either take me to the Instagram login page of a particular Instagram account I follow, or else take me to my own Instagram profile page. I did not sign into Instagram in the open tab upon receiving these notification. I'm including some screenshots so you can see how it appeared on my screen. The other Instagram accounts besides my own that would appear in my Firefox browser tab were both people in the UK, for what it's worth, contacts of mine on Whatsapp also.  </p><p>I just found it kind of creepy and thought I should report it to Mozilla.  </p><p>Thanks, JJ </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jenjusti11
