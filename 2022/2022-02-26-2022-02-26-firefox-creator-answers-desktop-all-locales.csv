1369193,2022-02-26 08:50:02 -0800,2022-02-26 08:50:02 -0800,Firefox physical RAM access problem?,"<p>I have a problem with Firefox that mostly manifests itself when opening some sites, specially it is for example a secure login form. What happens is that the page loads, the form fields show up, and there is a blinking cursor in the first field. But almost immediately the cursor freezes up and when I then try to click on the first field to fill it out Firefox does nothing and if I click 2-3 times eventually ends up displaying the  ""(Not Responding)"" message on the title bar and nothing happens for about 10 sometimes 15 seconds until the page finishes loading and then I can fill the form fields normally. This happens for example when I try to enter my online banking, or login into Paypal via the pop up window at ebay, to name some. Also some other pages that don't have any forms seem to also cause this initial delay in being able to interact with the page, for scrolling down, clicking a link, etc. It really feels like that this slowdown happens when there are scrips on the page being loaded and are being run as simple pages without any scripts on them do not seem to be affected and can be scrolled, links clicked on or anything else starts happening immediately. </p><p>The problem gets progressively worse as I open additional tabs, so the whole thing feels a bit like Firefox is choking on lack of physical RAM. It really reminds me back when win98 first came out and once you upgraded from win95 most PCs where falling very short of minimum system requirements, specially if the user had installed way too many programs and applications that where all competing for very little physical RAM. </p><p>I do have 8GB of total physical RAM installed, but the percentage of used RAM indicator barely goes above 15%, sometimes it reaches perhaps 17-18%. Furthermore there is very little variation of only around 3-5% between Firefox being open and running with several open tabs, to the amount of used RAM when closing it, even tough Firefox appears in Task Manager Processes always at the top with as the highest memory user (around 500-600MB with only one tab open, but this quickly increases up to about 1.1G to 1.2G as I progressively open more tabs. But strangely the total memory used will never go over around 1.2GB and the browser will start to slow down if additional tabs are opened. This happens even tough the Physical RAM usage indicator is still only showing 15-18%, so there should be still plenty of physical RAM available but somehow Firefox is unable to access it. </p><p>If I disable all the AddOns by starting Firefox in Safe Mode the problem goes away and pages load normally in the sense that I can for example fill in the form fields almost immediately without having to wait, or scroll the page, or click on links etc. But when I go back into normal mode with AddOns re enabled, and then proceed to manually disable ALL my AddOns, the problem still continues to happen. So I am assuming there must be something else that Safe Mode also affects besides the AddOns, and that seems to be causing the problem I am having with the slow response time of loaded pages. </p><p>For  a bit of context, this problem started happening some months ago, out of the blue as I am pretty sure it did not start to happen immediately after something new was installed or some FF settings where changed/tweaked. Basically things where fine and then suddenly I started noticing the problem, but as usual one tends to first think dismiss as being due to a temporary Internet speed hiccup, and so on, but eventually one realizes that something definitively had changed permanently for the worst. And that is where I am now, and have been for a few months already. Very frustrating. </p><p>I do not use any themes besides the default, and I already had tried switching HW acceleration off/on without any change in the issue. So besides already having tried disabling all AddOns manually there must be something else causing my problem. I also tried to create a new ""virgin"" profile and it did not help either, same problem. </p><p>The fact that the issue goes away when I go into Safe Mode makes it overly clear that it is indeed something that is causing it, but when in normal mode why does not help to manually disable ALL AddOns? What else does Safe Mode affect besides AddOns, that would make some difference between running Firefox in Safe Mode and normal mode? </p><p>Hope someone here can give me some answers, primarily what encompasses to go into Safe Mode, which seems to solve the issue, but what else besides AddOns being disabled is also affected? Perhaps any custom user settings in About:Config are also temporarily reversed? </p><p>If anyone is interested in the about:support information of my browser, here is a plain PDF file of all the Troubleshooting Info that came up, so I uploaded the PDF to one of my website servers. I am not sure this is the right way to share this information but I hope its acceptable. Its a plain PDF file. </p><p><a href=""https://ovprotection.com/tmp/Troubleshooting%20Information.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ovprotection.com/tmp/Troubleshooting%20Information.pdf</a> </p><p>Thank you for any hints on how to solve the problem. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ffsup

I'm not going to apologize because firefox raped my computer again. I hate people doing things they have no right to do and I fought for everyone to have the right to free speech and thats a joke anymore. I rarely get this angry and most people will tell you I help anyone in need but I've had all this violation of privacy and owners right violation I intend to put up with.Last of all I'm terrible at all this tech stuff I have dyslexia and it takes me a lot more to learn the simple things. I hate to even ask for help but whoever helps me will be a true hero I can assure you of that and if any of you have any dirt on the CEO send it to me and I'll see to it that he stops allowing this.  Thanks for listening to me blow off some steam and you know I haven't had a drink in 21 years but I'm tempted as hell right now. Thanks again and if you can't  help me thanks anyway. I don't have the money to pay the geek squad I've had cancer 3 times and 2 surgeries in the last 7 years and guess who got my life savings. Blessings to you and all you love and pray for Canada and keep one eye open causer they more than likely are going to pull that crap here and I promise you about 90% of the ones claiming to be a patriot will crawl up inthe fetal position and cry for mommy the first bullet whizzes  by there head I've seen soldiers fully trained do it.

Specifically, Microsoft's Edge seems to know what I'm viewing on Firefox. I have Firefox privacy set at ""strict"" and use Duck Duck Go as my search engine with Windows 10 OS. Yet, without fail, If I later open the Edge browser it will show me relevant ads for whatever I was viewing on Firefox. As I am not a tech, but just a user, I just want to know if this is as it's suppose to be. I've used Chrome and Firefox for years and cannot recall this happening between them. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1486160;,darberlaw

I had over 200 when I lost it the first time.  I've entered over 75 since then and today I just lost those.  Fortunately, I had a backup of my profile.  The old ""key4.db"" and ""logins.json"" files I had didn't work, although they have a significant size.  In fact, looking at the ""logins.json"" using VS Code I see the logins are there but they don't display in the ""Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security"".  How can I get access to them when this happens again.  I was able to restore the profile from several days ago so I'm not completely in trouble.  :-) </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1486091;1486095;,BPaul_H
