It is not and never has been set to do that or empty cookies/cache until I direct it to do so on my computer. I have checked all settings. What is going on and how--in simple language--do I fix this? (Can't even understand the troubleshooting directions, too much jargon.) </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-970;,firefox,other,en-US,"",airebird

On Firefox:  sign in only has ID box and no PW box so I can't sign in. I called IT at the college..they can't figure it out.  There must be a formatting issue with FF since it comes up fine on Safari. </p><p>What do I do?  Thanks.

When VR content is being displayed, I do not get a prompt to allow access to my VR headset in the address bar. </p><p>I have a first generation Oculus Rift CV1. In the Oculus software's settings, I have enabled Unknown Sources and selected it as my default OpenXR runtime (see attached image). </p><p>I would like to provide some suggestions as to what might be going wrong but I am unable to even hazard a guess. VR games and standalone applications work fine. It is almost as if Firefox doesn't recognise I have a VR-compatible device? </p><p>Thanks in advance for any support, -L </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-970;firefox-9701;,firefox,other,en-US,"",simplelogin-newsletter.wip4w
