I bought this computer and no one has any right to install anything I don't want!!! This is the fourth time in 2 months that Firefox has updated against my settings. I hope and pray someone can tell me how to stop this once and for all . I am a decorated veteran disabled and this is causing my ptsd to come back and I don't want to hurt anyone I've seen more killing than I ever want.If firefox updates and causes me all this time lost never to be gotten back again I am going to loose it. So please someone help me and I am writing a very nice letter to the CEO of firefox as soon as I find the address. I would like to get his computer and put all the things I want on it 4 time in 2 months and put my foot where he sits. Can anyone honestly think that this is right ? If you do send me your computer and let me make changes to it. I'm running windows 10 home and am always up to date except I'm running FF version 94.0 . If you want to know why it's because some genius decided that the latest version 97 doesn't need rt ck copy &amp; paste  and man I would like to see that guy with a flat tire on a long highway on a hot summer day so I could drive by and give him the one finger wave.  I'm not going to apologize because firefox raped my computer again. I hate people doing things they have no right to do and I fought for everyone to have the right to free speech and thats a joke anymore. I rarely get this angry and most people will tell you I help anyone in need but I've had all this violation of privacy and owners right violation I intend to put up with.Last of all I'm terrible at all this tech stuff I have dyslexia and it takes me a lot more to learn the simple things. I hate to even ask for help but whoever helps me will be a true hero I can assure you of that and if any of you have any dirt on the CEO send it to me and I'll see to it that he stops allowing this.  Thanks for listening to me blow off some steam and you know I haven't had a drink in 21 years but I'm tempted as hell right now. Thanks again and if you can't  help me thanks anyway. I don't have the money to pay the geek squad I've had cancer 3 times and 2 surgeries in the last 7 years and guess who got my life savings. Blessings to you and all you love and pray for Canada and keep one eye open causer they more than likely are going to pull that crap here and I promise you about 90% of the ones claiming to be a patriot will crawl up inthe fetal position and cry for mommy the first bullet whizzes  by there head I've seen soldiers fully trained do it. Have a great day you guys </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,other,en-US,"",1ARICHARDhead

Specifically, Microsoft's Edge seems to know what I'm viewing on Firefox. I have Firefox privacy set at ""strict"" and use Duck Duck Go as my search engine with Windows 10 OS. Yet, without fail, If I later open the Edge browser it will show me relevant ads for whatever I was viewing on Firefox. As I am not a tech, but just a user, I just want to know if this is as it's suppose to be. I've used Chrome and Firefox for years and cannot recall this happening between them. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",darberlaw

I had over 200 when I lost it the first time.  I've entered over 75 since then and today I just lost those.  Fortunately, I had a backup of my profile.  The old ""key4.db"" and ""logins.json"" files I had didn't work, although they have a significant size.  In fact, looking at the ""logins.json"" using VS Code I see the logins are there but they don't display in the ""Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security"".  How can I get access to them when this happens again.  I was able to restore the profile from several days ago so I'm not completely in trouble.  :-) </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1486091;,BPaul_H

That's the WHOLE POINT of Adobe’s portable document format — that you can wean yourself off of paper and strap a rocket to what used to be contained in file cabinets by making the content INSTANTLY searchable. </p><p>Mozilla sigh. Why? Why are you so paranoid about enabling the User to generate web pages in PDF format? It’s positively baffling to me. I just don’t get it. Generate the equivalent of a brain dead document by saving it only as an unintelligible collection of zeroes and ones? An image???  </p><p>HOW STUPID DO YOU THINK YOUR USERS ARE? My god you insult me. Not once has anyone at Mozilla given a satisfactory answer for the disabling of PDF generation ever since you gutted the last True version of Firefox many, many years ago.
