His hands are HUGE and his fingers are numb.   </p><p>Somehow, he is inadvertently adding bookmarks to the bookmark bar.  I do not know how he is doing this but he'll call and ask me to ""put Gmail back on the bar"".  When I go over, there are a gazillion new bookmarks which pushes his Gmail bookmark beyond the &gt;&gt; spot.  I have to delete these umpteen extra bookmarks so that the Gmail bookmark is visible again.  Yesterday, I decided to move Gmail to the far left, hoping these accidental bookmarks he creates won't push it off the bar.  The bookmarks he ""creates"" are specific gmail conversations, or facebook pages, or Publisher's Clearing House pages (he LOVES PCH games and plays them constantly).   </p><p>HOW IS HE DOING THIS?  He doesn't know enough to click the star button.  He doesn't know about using the Ctrl and D keys to create a new bookmark.  It's driving me BATTY.  I'm sure he's somehow doing this using his mouse (clicking both right/left simultaneously but not aware of doing so).   </p><p>Thanks in advance for helping a daughter keep her sanity ... </p>",windows-7;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-970;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1486157;,romiha

I bought this computer and no one has any right to install anything I don't want!!! This is the fourth time in 2 months that Firefox has updated against my settings. I hope and pray someone can tell me how to stop this once and for all . I am a decorated veteran disabled and this is causing my ptsd to come back and I don't want to hurt anyone I've seen more killing than I ever want.If firefox updates and causes me all this time lost never to be gotten back again I am going to loose it. So please someone help me and I am writing a very nice letter to the CEO of firefox as soon as I find the address. I would like to get his computer and put all the things I want on it 4 time in 2 months and put my foot where he sits. Can anyone honestly think that this is right ? If you do send me your computer and let me make changes to it. I'm running windows 10 home and am always up to date except I'm running FF version 94.0 . If you want to know why it's because some genius decided that the latest version 97 doesn't need rt ck copy &amp; paste  and man I would like to see that guy with a flat tire on a long highway on a hot summer day so I could drive by and give him the one finger wave.  I'm not going to apologize because firefox raped my computer again. I hate people doing things they have no right to do and I fought for everyone to have the right to free speech and thats a joke anymore. I rarely get this angry and most people will tell you I help anyone in need but I've had all this violation of privacy and owners right violation I intend to put up with.Last of all I'm terrible at all this tech stuff I have dyslexia and it takes me a lot more to learn the simple things. I hate to even ask for help but whoever helps me will be a true hero I can assure you of that and if any of you have any dirt on the CEO send it to me and I'll see to it that he stops allowing this.  Thanks for listening to me blow off some steam and you know I haven't had a drink in 21 years but I'm tempted as hell right now. Thanks again and if you can't  help me thanks anyway. I don't have the money to pay the geek squad I've had cancer 3 times and 2 surgeries in the last 7 years and guess who got my life savings. Blessings to you and all you love and pray for Canada and keep one eye open causer they more than likely are going to pull that crap here and I promise you about 90% of the ones claiming to be a patriot will crawl up inthe fetal position and cry for mommy the first bullet whizzes  by there head I've seen soldiers fully trained do it.

Specifically, Microsoft's Edge seems to know what I'm viewing on Firefox. I have Firefox privacy set at ""strict"" and use Duck Duck Go as my search engine with Windows 10 OS. Yet, without fail, If I later open the Edge browser it will show me relevant ads for whatever I was viewing on Firefox. As I am not a tech, but just a user, I just want to know if this is as it's suppose to be.

In fact, looking at the ""logins.json"" using VS Code I see the logins are there but they don't display in the ""Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security"".
