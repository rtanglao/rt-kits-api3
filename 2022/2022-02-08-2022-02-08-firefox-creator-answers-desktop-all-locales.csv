The link text doesn't have to be the same as the URL it's going to. </p><p>But the ""hover"" link that shows at the bottom of the screen is *extremely* misleading, because it doesn't show the real link - it doesn't show where it actually is going. If I right click a link and Copy Link, then I can see the real destination by pasting it in a text file. </p><p>How do I change the hover ""status bar"" text to show the actual, real destination of a link? </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",PeterL777

I know that simplified printing is not always available but I don't understand why it wouldn't be consistently available or unavailable when the pages of a site are ostensibly the same?  e.g., my Data Science prof has a site she created with ""chapters"" and quizzes/exercises.  I sometimes can print the quiz that I took and sometimes I cannot (in simplified view).  They seem to be the same format.  I've had this occur with other sites too, e.g., a site that offers recipes.  The recipes seem to be presented the same way and show up the same when you go to print them. </p><p>What might be different among these pages that would prevent simplified printing from consistently being presented as an option?  It becomes super frustrating to find a workaround to print something I need without it being 18 pages long--when in simplified view, it's only 2! </p><p>Thank you! </p><p>Lisa </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ldpmail

I cannot recall which at the moment. </p><p>When ever I browse for more than a few minutes, and in the process also open new tabs of facebook (different groups and posts), after a while, images won't load (screenshot attached). </p><p>This can be fixed by exiting and relaunching the firefox browser. Or, it can be fixed by itself if I refresh some times, or maybe after a few minutes of me not browsing facebook. </p><p>I have tried disabling the ad-block software for the site, as well as disabling firefox enhanced tracking protection - and then refreshing. There was no change. Also, I use the Multi Firefox Account Container, and I tried opening facebook tab in ""no container"" but it will still open in the facebook container (I still see the colored line no top), so I am not sure if that can fix it. </p><p>Another issue I experience, is while scrolling - the more I scroll down and see more posts, the slower and more sluggish facebook gets. I do not remember this being an issue a while ago. </p><p>If you need more information, let me know </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-960;firefox-9603;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",sata67
