I know that simplified printing is not always available but I don't understand why it wouldn't be consistently available or unavailable when the pages of a site are ostensibly the same?  e.g., my Data Science prof has a site she created with ""chapters"" and quizzes/exercises.  I sometimes can print the quiz that I took and sometimes I cannot (in simplified view).  They seem to be the same format.  I've had this occur with other sites too, e.g., a site that offers recipes.  The recipes seem to be presented the same way and show up the same when you go to print them. </p><p>What might be different among these pages that would prevent simplified printing from consistently being presented as an option?  It becomes super frustrating to find a workaround to print something I need without it being 18 pages long--when in simplified view, it's only 2! </p><p>Thank you! </p><p>Lisa </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ldpmail
