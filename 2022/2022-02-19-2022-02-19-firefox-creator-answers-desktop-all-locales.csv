Now, beginning 2022, I cannot access this webpage <a href=""https://www.bdo.com.ph"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bdo.com.ph</a>. Not sure why but, I was able to access this website last December 2021.  I also tried accessing my other bank's website and all are working fine. Is this problem only specific to this website or is it related to the latest updates by Firefox? </p><p>I've already tried disabling all my add-ons, extensions, and my internet security extension in Firefox, but to no avail. Note that I'm using Firefox 97.0.1 and my internet security suite is Kaspersky.  </p><p>Appreciate your tips on how to resolve this issue. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-970;firefox-9701;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",pjbersamina

I can't find a setting in Firefox preferences to block/allow it.  Speakers work on YouTube/Vimeo with no problems (speaker volume 100% and not muted).  Speakers had been working with Zoom until a couple weeks ago.  I don't want to install the Zoom app just because Google hates privacy and and I don't want to help them own my privacy anymore than I must.  I use DuckDuckGo for the default search engine, have Ghostery for an Extension/add-on, and have the Firefox browser set for private window always.  I have tried various cookie settings for the Zoom meetings and even the dreaded ""accept all cookies"" and have Firefox cookie handling set to Standard, with deleting all cookies and history upon exit.  I am on 64-bit Windows 10 up to date as of 2/16/22, Dell computer updated to same date, and latest update of Firefox 2/18/22.  I have done a number of web searches and not finding the speaker topic or error message other than three unanswered help requests from others with the same problem dated from July-Sept 2021. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1484820;,jn9olvr

I have included screenshots of Firefox and Chrome where you can clearly see the difference in color. The black background is very uncomfortable and I need to change it back to the gray color like in Chrome.

It is visible in the preview, and that's the way it prints. Nowhere can I find a margin adjustment. What is even stranger is that this only happens with ""fillable"" tax files which I downloaded from IRS and filled in with Firefox, some in release 96 and some in 97. In release 96 they printed correctly, but not in release 97. Do I need to use a different browser? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,other,en-US,1484807;,werner42graf

I just was not so sure until now... </p><p>Details:  I've gone a couple weeks without syncing and had no issues with any websites; watched lots of Netflix too. </p><p>After today's upgrade to FF97, I decided to risk it and log back onto Sync. Right away Netflix was broken in its tab, with ""Pardon the Interruption. This title is not available to be watched instantly. Please try another title. -1044"" and then ""Error Code F7121 - 1331"" </p><p>I have received this error code and more other similar ones from Netflix back a few weeks ago when I was actively troubleshooting this glitch. None of the fixes worked, and the ones that involved sifting through many dozens of about:config settings were avoided. </p><p>Thing is, back then, I made no changes I can surely recall, except upgrading to FF 96.  OK, maybe some others... </p><p>And what's happening to my Netflix tab is not happening to any other tabs/sites, now or before; just Netflix. </p><p>I'm hoping someone here has seen this same thing happen and can shed some light on why my FF synced login breaks Netflix but when I'm not logged in, Netflix is ok. </p><p>Thanks; </p>",mac-os;desktop;sync;firefox-910;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",mkwritch
