Firefox fullscreening itself.,"<p>Hello, </p><p>Around a week ago (ish), I tried to play a GIF on Firefox. The GIF wouldn't load, Firefox became very unresponsive and it would occasionally fullscreen itself (Removing the taskbar) for a brief moment before changing back. It would keep this up until I force closed it. I went to load a Twitch stream after loading Firefox again, and the chat would work just fine, but the video wouldn't load. The micro freezes (Loading symbol next to mouse pointer) and the fullscreening would happen again. I tried a computer restart and things were fine for a few days. </p><p>Today, the same issue happened with Twitch streams, even though I watched one yesterday with no issues. I tried a restart, but the issue persists. Everything seems to work fine on Chrome. </p><p>Also, games seem to work just fine. I thought the load time on one may have felt a little slow, but that could just be the game, but I felt it was worth mentioning. </p><p>So far, I've tried: - Using Chrome (Everything works fine there) - Using Firefox in troubleshooting mode - Disabling hardware acceleration - Refreshing the startup cache - Updating my GPU drivers - Ensuring Firefox is up to date </p><p>Any ideas? Thank you for any help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",minkysteve

Now I need to browse among numerous folders in my bookmarks, it worked fine before, but I cannot do it anymore because the folder names are not visible! As if they are written with a white font on a white background. I can scroll, choose (blindly) some folder, which is marked by the faint rectangle visible on the image. And the bookmark will be saved to that folder indeed. But scrolling blindly through my hundred folders is obviously not practical.  </p><p>The problem appeared 1-2 weeks ago, probably after a FF update.  Now I updated FF to the latest version 97.0.1, it doesn't help.  </p><p>A couple of months ago I did some changes in FF config in particular to make bookmarks appear more dense: newer FF versions introduced huge vertical space between bookmarks. I can't remember what exactly I did (followed some recipe on internet), but it didn't introduce any problems. The problems appeared 1-2 weeks ago.
