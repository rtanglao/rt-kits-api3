I try to download MP4 files and even compressed ZIP files (containing large number of photos).  I right-click on the Download link and chose Save Link As.  As the browser is opening a window for me to browse to where to save the file to, an error message pops up.  ""filename.mp4.part could not be read from the source file.  Please contact the system administrator""  The download is never placed in the download queue and if I browse (in File Explorer) to where I tried to save the file to, the file shows as 0 kb.  I have experienced this in Microsoft Edge, too, so it may be computer-wide, such as antivirus blocking the downloads.  I have Chrome but Chrome crashes about 5 mins after opening it.  I will add that Firefox can save JPG picture files from the websites.  I have tried going to Show All Download and clicking Clear Downloads, but as the downloads in question are not queueing, there is not much to clear there.  I really don't believe this is an issue related to MP4 files as I can playback MP4 files on the sites.  Windows 10 and latest Firefox version.  Next troubleshooting steps for me are temporarily disable my antivirus and try saving to a different folder, preferably on the internal HDD.  Normally, I save videos to an external USB HDD. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1515302;,cjsagfan1
