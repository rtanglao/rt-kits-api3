When I tried to use Firefox an error message appeared that it could not find Firefox starting point (or something similar).  So, I installed Firefox again using Edge browser but other errors came up where it couldn't find certain system files. </p><p>Well, I loaded Office 2019 and then Firefox appeared again but there were 2 Firefox icons.  One icon said do you want to make Firefox the default browser.  The other icon had Firefox as the default browser.  </p><p>So, I have 3 questions. I deleted the wrong (new) desktop firefox icon.  How can I create the firefox icon for the correct icon? </p><p>Next question, there is only one Firefox application listed in the add/remove programs function.  Should I uninstall and reinstall with the possibility of losing firefox history? </p><p>I created an firefox account to ask my questions.  Upon sending the code from the email that was sent to me an error occurred - something like bad page or something similar.  I tried to continue and got to here to ask my question but there was a message that said my account was not active.

Actually I didn't update it, it did it by itself and in doing so lost all tabs, bookmarks etc and even the menus don't work. The thing is this has happened to me over and over and over and over and over again! Actually add a few more over and overs in there. My father's firefox hasn't been updated in two years for the fear of losing data and now this is the last straw for me too. If I continue to use firefox the only way I can be sure not to lose data is to disable updates altogether. You simply cannot be trusted. How many threads on here with the same issue? We have work to do, sit down at the computer and are faced with this bs, are left to search nerdy threads for a complicated workarounds. Why don't you make a feature or program which recovers from this situation, i.e something we can click on? You know where the missing data is, why must we go on a wild goose chase? Programming is all about automation, so automate it! We should not have to fear updates, cross our fingers and hope our data doesn't go missing. Let me know when have fixed this. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,1485543;1485544;,brokewokebloke

See <a href=""https://drive.protonmail.com/urls/A6NPZMWQH8#CUf8vnOFOdG4"" rel=""nofollow"">this link</a>  to the screen recording that I took showing the whole thing.  </p><p>Quick rundown: I was looking for a dashcam and was about ready to purchase one on Amazon and so I used Firefox's neat ""Send tab to device"" trick to send the tab from my phone to my laptop where I could checkout with my Amazon Prime account. That is where I noticed the SAME product (and the exact same listing) was cheaper on my laptop by $8!  Quick disclaimer: If you watch the video, you will see me tap ""Clip &amp; Save up to $10"" while using my phone which results in me being deemed ineligible for that coupon. I believe that coupon WOULD have applied if I were logged into an Amazon account which I did not try doing on my phone. However, even if that coupon was successfully applied, the price for the dashcam on my phone would have been $89.99 while my laptop showed $91.99, a $2 difference. Yes, I know it's not a big price difference and rather insignificant at that price range, but the implications are huge. Makes me wonder just how many times I've been charged different prices on Amazon as other people... </p><p>Also, on my laptop you'll notice the product is on sale from $129.99 which is NOT the case on my phone. The price on my phone was $99.99 and that's it, no discount price or anything.  </p><p>I always knew that companies did this, but I never thought I'd ever see it THIS CLEARLY side-by-side right in front of my eyes! </p><p>BTW: I was using Firefox on my phone and laptop if you didn't catch that. No VPN connected, both devices running off the same WiFi. Laptop was logged into my Prime account, phone was not.  </p><p>Anyway, I just thought I'd share that here for anyone who's interested. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,other,en-US,1485504;,lukefrostzw

When using specifically FaceBook, whenever I click in the text box and start typing, the page suddenly scrolls down so the text input box is almost hidden. I have: Turned off all plugins/addons Tried in Trouble Shoot mode Tried in another browser (Edge) Everything works as expected in Edge - when typing, no matter where the input box is, the page does not scroll/move. When typing in FireFox, as soon as a button is pressed within the cursor in the text input box, the page will scroll down, almost obscuring the box, and it's very annoying as the page should not move when I type, it should stay where it is. So far, FaceBox seems to be the only affected page that I use. Any pointers gratefully received!
