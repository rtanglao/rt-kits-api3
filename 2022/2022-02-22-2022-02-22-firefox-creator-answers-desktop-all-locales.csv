However, I expect the (temporary) downloaded document to be (opened) in the temp folder, but it's actually being saved in my Downloads folder.  </p><p>That's not comfortable, but i end up with a massive lit of files in the download folders which were never intended to be saved in the first place, but just opened. That gets mixed up with other stuff in downloads folder. </p><p>How can i force the behavior ""Open With"" to save the document in firefox temp folder rather Downloads ? Thanks for your help.

I turned my mac on this morning and when I tried to go fullscreen, the browser froze and eventually closed itself a minute later. I've tried reinstalling, using different versions of firefox, but nothing seems to fix it. Firefox Nightly doesn't freeze, but it crashes instantly when fullscreening. Any idea why any of this is happening? It was working perfectly fine yesterday, I don't believe it was an update because I manually updated it after the bug appeared to see if it would fix it. Thanks! </p><p>MacOS: 12.0 Monterey Firefox Version: 98.0b7 </p>",mac-os;desktop;beta;fix-problems;firefox-980;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ryzechgaming
