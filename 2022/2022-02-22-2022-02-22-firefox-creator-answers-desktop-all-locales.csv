When using specifically FaceBook, whenever I click in the text box and start typing, the page suddenly scrolls down so the text input box is almost hidden. I have: Turned off all plugins/addons Tried in Trouble Shoot mode Tried in another browser (Edge) Everything works as expected in Edge - when typing, no matter where the input box is, the page does not scroll/move. When typing in FireFox, as soon as a button is pressed within the cursor in the text input box, the page will scroll down, almost obscuring the box, and it's very annoying as the page should not move when I type, it should stay where it is. So far, FaceBox seems to be the only affected page that I use. Any pointers gratefully received!
