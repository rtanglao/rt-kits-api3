That does not seem to work anymore. Is there a keyboard shortcut for refresh, or can I create one?""</em> </p><p>Unfortunately, he asked for a keyboard shortcut, instead of a fix or a solution, and he got several, most of which didn't work, at least for me. One that did work was Ctrl+R. I had also found another that worked, which was Fn+F5. That was a pain to use since those keys on my keyboard are on opposite sides of the keyboard, so it took both hands to press the keys. </p><p>However, instead of shortcuts or workarounds,'<em><strong> I would like to offer an actual solution to this very annoying problem. '</strong></em> </p><p>Option one. The function lock has been toggled, but you can toggle it back to the F5 key. If the Escape key on your keyboard has a lock symbol, press Fn+Esc. The issue should now be resolved. Press F5 and check if everything is back to normal. This will also fix the same problem in Windows, i.e. the F5 key not refreshing the screen in File Explorer and other programs. </p><p>Option two. If that does not work, search and open Windows Mobility Center. You will have an option under “Function Key Row” to choose between Function Key or Multimedia Key. Choose the Function Key option (or the other way round) to fix the issue. This option did not work for me as there was no “Function Key Row” in my Windows Mobility Center. </p><p>Option three. You can also enter the BIOS and make this change under Function Key Behavior. I didn't try this one because I had already fixed the problem with the Esc key. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1050;firefox-10503;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",letsdothis

Also I have a neat idea to increase the amount of users using Mozilla data collection and that is by adding an advanced section for that which allows us to pick specific data that we want to send and don't want to send. Also I think we should focus more on fingerprinting protection. Could their be a way to not allow websites to see certain data about our browser and device? What if we fed them something randomized instead?

Firefox has seemed to have a very exacting definition of what is and is not clickable when browsing every website I go to. It used to have a nicely large area to make a lick and have it activate the link I was trying for. Now, when I want to click, to say open an email in Gmail, I need to find the most exact spot in the UI to be the active/clickable location to use the link. I have to find the most exact spot to use the check boxes to select items. I can't drag labels over because I cannot find the correct spot on the page anymore to drag the link, but not open it. The Unread and Delete buttons have the same kind of issue: in Firefox V105.X, I have to find the perfect spot to click them to be usable. Otherwise, I'm sitting there clicking all around trying to find it.  </p><p>I have similar issues on sites like CNN or Facebook. On CNN, I have to hunt down the spot in the link to open a story. Firefox recognizes my mouse is over the link, but I have to hunt to find the clickable spot in the entire link. In Facebook, if I click into a picture, the entire page is slightly off when viewing. So the arrows to click to a next picture may get me the the next picture or it might get me to an entirely different page I can't see but apparently registered a click on.  </p><p>I've checked my mouse drivers and those haven't changed in years. Just trying to correct a typo in the last sentence took 4 mouse clicks to get the cursor in the text field to the correct spot, when I'd lined it up to be next to the letter to correct. It's nearly impossible to drag a browser tab to a new position as I can hardly ever find the correct spot on the tab that makes it active anymore. Even just clicking to make a tab the active/viewable tab is hard as hell. Closing one is similarly frustrating.  </p><p>I'm on Win11. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1050;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",dhampir984
