I have seen this before, several times, usually after updating Firefox, IIRC. </p><p>This time, however, Gmail is not presented as an option, in this pop-up.  Clicking ""Choose..."" just opens up a Windows Explorer file-picker window.   </p><p>I tried to fix this in Tools &gt; Settings, under General &gt; Applications.  There, ""mailto"" just shows ""Use other..."" and if I click that, the ""Select Helper Application"" pop-up window is basically blank, with a message at the bottom saying ""No applications were found for this file type."" </p><p>See attached images. </p><p>I am running v98.0.2 on Win 10 Pro. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,customize,en-US,1494694;1494709;,bjkeefe
