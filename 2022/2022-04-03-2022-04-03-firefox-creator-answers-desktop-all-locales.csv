I set up my account for decent security: 2FA, wrote down the recovery <em><strong>key</strong></em> and recovery <em><strong>codes</strong></em>. </p><p>As I changed the password recently (didn't re-generate said recovery strings), I expected the disconnected state, all right. So I proceed on entering my new password, and out of curiosity, decide to make as if I didn't have the 2nd factor on hand </p><p>The Firefox Sync dialog page now asks me for a ""Recovery code"" that's 10 <em>digits</em> long. To my great surprise, none of those I saved when first setting up the account worked!  I know I didn't use any of them. </p><p>More, the terminology had me confused: when is a recovery <em><strong>key</strong></em> used vs. <em><strong>code</strong></em>? Both files contain ""Recovery codes"" in their name, besides, a ""digit"" is: ""1 any of the numerals from 0 to 9, especially when forming part of a number."" Nowhere in Firefox Sync a string of 10 ""digits"" generated: the ""recovery key"" is 32 character long, in 8 sets of 4 characters, and the ""recovery codes"", as I understood it, 10 ""character"" long (and there are 8 of them), number <strong>and</strong> letters, so not digits. </p><p>Why none of my codes worked? Would have it been necessary to generate a new set after changing password? </p>",desktop;sync;mac-os-x-1014;firefox-9171;firefox-917;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",gestos

I have seen this before, several times, usually after updating Firefox, IIRC. </p><p>This time, however, Gmail is not presented as an option, in this pop-up.  Clicking ""Choose..."" just opens up a Windows Explorer file-picker window.   </p><p>I tried to fix this in Tools &gt; Settings, under General &gt; Applications.  There, ""mailto"" just shows ""Use other..."" and if I click that, the ""Select Helper Application"" pop-up window is basically blank, with a message at the bottom saying ""No applications were found for this file type."" </p><p>See attached images. </p><p>I am running v98.0.2 on Win 10 Pro. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,customize,en-US,1494694;1494709;1494722;,bjkeefe
