And there are some problems: </p><p>Problem 1-   Every time I use CleanmyMac X app on my Mac to optimise or clean my computer .. this action delete my saved passwords in firefox. I do have Chrome on this machine. But nothing is effected in that chrome... never. </p><p>But firefox is deleting saved passwords every time.  </p><p>So How can I stop CleanMyMac app to access my password in firefox. ??? </p><p>Now actually firefox seems less secure.  how come.. another app can access my saved passwords in my Firefox account? Mac never asked for that permission.  And there is no warning before deleting either. </p><p>Now I have to waste my hours to sort out my passwords again. </p><p>Problem 2-  Whenever I access my bank account on firefox ( in private and standard browsing mode) ... <strong><em>I cannot access my previous bills and payment and schedule payment options</em>.</strong> all other functions on bank websites works fine.  </p><p>Firefox just keep searching for few minutes and eventually shows up an error message. This is happening since last 4-5 months.  ( I turned off ad blocker and also no pop up permission appears in title bar).  </p><p>But I can access that on Chrome and Safari as normal. This is a browser issue .. not a website issue. I already confirmed with bank. </p><p>____________ </p><p>Please make password more secure and inaccessible to any mac cleaning app or software. That is must. </p><p>and fix 2nd issue for bank websites as well. its so frustrating to sort out the whole things again and again. thank you. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,other,en-US,"",im.maan

I have seen this before, several times, usually after updating Firefox, IIRC. </p><p>This time, however, Gmail is not presented as an option, in this pop-up.  Clicking ""Choose..."" just opens up a Windows Explorer file-picker window.   </p><p>I tried to fix this in Tools &gt; Settings, under General &gt; Applications.  There, ""mailto"" just shows ""Use other..."" and if I click that, the ""Select Helper Application"" pop-up window is basically blank, with a message at the bottom saying ""No applications were found for this file type."" </p><p>See attached images. </p><p>I am running v98.0.2 on Win 10 Pro. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,customize,en-US,1494694;1494709;,bjkeefe
