I know I didn't use any of them. </p><p>More, the terminology had me confused: when is a recovery <em><strong>key</strong></em> used vs. <em><strong>code</strong></em>? Both files contain ""Recovery codes"" in their name, besides, a ""digit"" is: ""1 any of the numerals from 0 to 9, especially when forming part of a number."" Nowhere in Firefox Sync a string of 10 ""digits"" generated: the ""recovery key"" is 32 character long, in 8 sets of 4 characters, and the ""recovery codes"", as I understood it, 10 ""character"" long (and there are 8 of them), number <strong>and</strong> letters, so not digits. </p><p>Why none of my codes worked?
