When I chose open the media would play in my media player from the temp folder and then get deleted later on automatically. Now however when I select open the file gets placed in my downloads folder and then plays. I have to go manually delete these files if I don't want them on my hard drive. I've already gone into Troubleshooting Information, Profile Folder, to delete the handlers.json file to hopefully get it to reset but it still doesn't send opened files to the temp folder. Any other ideas? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",Thesmiler63
