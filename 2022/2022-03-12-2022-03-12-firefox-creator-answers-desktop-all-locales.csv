Now, when it downloads a file for me, it no longer asks me whether to download it or open it (and with what application); it just downloads it, and shows me a list of my most recently downloaded files.  I can then click on one to open it.  I honestly am not sure if this is an improvement or not, but I can work with it.  HOWEVER, unlike the previous versions of Firefox, when I open the file and close it (without modifying it), it adds it to my jumplist for the application that was used to open it (e.g., Excel).  This is NOT good.  My jumplists have little enough space available as it is, and when you add these to my jumplists, it pushes other, far more useful items off, and it is REALLY annoying.  Who thought this was a good idea?  This to me causes significant interference in my productivity, and therefore its usefulness.  If you insist on keeping this ""feature,"" can you please add some setting that I can then reset so that it does NOT do it for me? </p><p>Thanks, Rick </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,other,en-US,"",angieplace

It used to be I never had to alter any settings, just using all the defaults in the browser ensured my 4x6 labels printed correctly. Now they default to being printed on A5 paper, meaning that they're too large and the shipping label runs off the side.  </p><p>The only way to fix this that I've found so far is to click the ""Print using system dialog"" button below Firefox's print settings, and there doesn't appear to be a way to add a custom paper size in firefox that I have found. When I print using the system dialog, everything is fine without any settings changes. This work around is doable but not very intuitive, and has lead to a good amount of wasted printer labels as myself and other members of my team sometimes hit print too early instead of going through to the second system window.  </p><p>My only theory is that there has been some update to the browser that has changed things, as all other programs on our machines are still working correctly with our current printer and we have not updated the actual printer drivers, but there's no good place to edit printer settings and I have not found a place to add a custom paper size in Firefox. I've tried going in the troubleshoot menu to return to default printer settings and that also hasn't seemed to have helped. Other info I can find online is telling me to switch to Chrome, which is obviously not something I want to do. I switched away from Chrome to Firefox because Chrome is so heavy on RAM use in the first place and am not very interested in going back for an issue like this.  </p><p>Any advice you all could give me would be super helpful! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,other,en-US,"",paiganism

When restoring yesterday's bookmarks backup, they were *all* placed in only one folder (I have about 12 folders), and in reverse order! Is the only solution to move them in groups to the correct folders and then painstakingly reorder them? There must be a better way... </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1489039;1489132;,douggoesshopping

Now it seems that Firefox will NOT bookmark properly.  After doing a normal bookmark, the blue star shows in the URL line but I can NOT find the newly linked URL where I put it.  However, if I export the bookmarks to a html backup file, the new bookmarks appear in the backup file exactly where I put it.   </p><p>I tried Firefox Help, the instructions, ""Can't add, change or save bookmarks - How to fix | Firefox Help"" did not help.  The places.sqlite file was unchecked for Read Only.   Trying to create a new bookmark file seemed overwhelming.   </p><p>I lost most of a day when Firefox quit browsing.  After discovering this bookmark problem, I have spent over an hour trying to solve it.  And I fear there are other problems ahead as well.  Having used Firefox for years, I just do not  want to  go to Chrome or Edge (aaarrrghhh), but I can't afford the lost time. </p><p>Is there a real (and simple) solution to this bookmark problem?
