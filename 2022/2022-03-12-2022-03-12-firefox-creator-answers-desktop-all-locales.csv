The story is a bit complicated so bare with me. </p><p>1.) I should say that I use my PC professionally for Music Production and Mixing. I use a dedicatet software (Cubase in my Case). 2.) The Problem that occurs is, that when I switch from my DAW Cubase to Tidal oder Firefox the Audio Driver is not released which leads to Videos or Songs not being played correctly or not at all. 3.) I've contacted support from the Manufacturer of my Audio Interface and Cubase to look for a Solution there. All Attempts to fix this lead to the same source: Firefox.  4.) Experimenting with other browsers like Edge shows, that this Problem only occurs in combination with Firefox, or at least this is the most plausible theory at the moment. </p><p>So my question is how Firefox could be affecting this and if so, what could be done to remedy the error? I use several Apps at the same time since it's part of my workflow and I would like not to have to sacrifice it due to an error. </p><p>Are there any settings in Firefox that could be affecting the audio driver?

This is NOT good.  My jumplists have little enough space available as it is, and when you add these to my jumplists, it pushes other, far more useful items off, and it is REALLY annoying.

It used to be I never had to alter any settings, just using all the defaults in the browser ensured my 4x6 labels printed correctly. Now they default to being printed on A5 paper, meaning that they're too large and the shipping label runs off the side.  </p><p>The only way to fix this that I've found so far is to click the ""Print using system dialog"" button below Firefox's print settings, and there doesn't appear to be a way to add a custom paper size in firefox that I have found. When I print using the system dialog, everything is fine without any settings changes. This work around is doable but not very intuitive, and has lead to a good amount of wasted printer labels as myself and other members of my team sometimes hit print too early instead of going through to the second system window.  </p><p>My only theory is that there has been some update to the browser that has changed things, as all other programs on our machines are still working correctly with our current printer and we have not updated the actual printer drivers, but there's no good place to edit printer settings and I have not found a place to add a custom paper size in Firefox. I've tried going in the troubleshoot menu to return to default printer settings and that also hasn't seemed to have helped.
