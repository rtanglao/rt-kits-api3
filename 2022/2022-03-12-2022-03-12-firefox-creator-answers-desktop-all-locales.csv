When restoring yesterday's bookmarks backup, they were *all* placed in only one folder (I have about 12 folders), and in reverse order! Is the only solution to move them in groups to the correct folders and then painstakingly reorder them? There must be a better way... </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",douggoesshopping

Now it seems that Firefox will NOT bookmark properly.  After doing a normal bookmark, the blue star shows in the URL line but I can NOT find the newly linked URL where I put it.  However, if I export the bookmarks to a html backup file, the new bookmarks appear in the backup file exactly where I put it.   </p><p>I tried Firefox Help, the instructions, ""Can't add, change or save bookmarks - How to fix | Firefox Help"" did not help.  The places.sqlite file was unchecked for Read Only.   Trying to create a new bookmark file seemed overwhelming.   </p><p>I lost most of a day when Firefox quit browsing.  After discovering this bookmark problem, I have spent over an hour trying to solve it.  And I fear there are other problems ahead as well.  Having used Firefox for years, I just do not  want to  go to Chrome or Edge (aaarrrghhh), but I can't afford the lost time. </p><p>Is there a real (and simple) solution to this bookmark problem?
