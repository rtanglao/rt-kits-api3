The remembered size works perfectly for sizes less than the height of the screen.  </p><p>The xulstore.json file is not corrupt, as I've tried removing it and altering it, resulting in the same issue. I have also tried changing the window height inside the xulstore.json file to larger than the screen size, and found that it get's cropped to slightly less than the window height, same as my issue above. This has led me to believe that when firefox starts a new instance, the size is cropped so that it doesn't extend past the screen borders. This is good, but the size it gets cropped to is clearly bugged, unless it's intended to crop to less than screen size.  </p><p>I use a window manager that lets me easily snap windows to each other as well as to the screen borders, so firefox always leaving a slight gap when it starts drives me mad as I have to manually resize it every time. </p><p>I use windows 10, firefox 106.0 (64 bit), however I experience the same issue with both firefox developer edition and firefox nightly. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1060;,firefox,other,en-US,"",tony.stroemsnaes

ADDING A SCROLL BAR TO THE BOOKMARKS DROPDOWN LIST </p><p>As a systems architect and senior software engineer with more than 20 years experience, I don't make requsts lightly because I fully understand that time and effort that goes into creating a new feature for a application like a web brower.  However,  based on previous posts to this help forum, it's clear that Firefox developers need to broaden their horizons and start realizing that what they personally like should NEVER be a universal standard for the global community.  Yes, I'm talking about dark mode being the default to nearly everything, even then light mode is selected in the FireFox settings. </p><p>A huge number of people can not use dark mode because of the vision-related issues it causes.  The bookmarks dropdown list can get very long and at some point, it becomes unreadable in the dark mode because the separators are not in bold white or a color that I can choose, such as read.  Hence, the disappear in my field of vision and purpose of having separators is lost complete.   </p><p>It's well past the time for the Mozilla tech support to stop blaming themes for options that should be in the Firefox global settings, but have never been designed and implemented.  One of the most requested, based on an extensive search of the Help Archives, is the ability for an end-user to choose the color of drop down lists.  For Mozilla tech support to respond with ""oh, get a different theme"" is inappropriate.  Finding another theme is time-consuming because most themes do not list what colors are used for drop down lists, so you have to install theme after theme until one comes up that is close to what you need.  Thanks, but I don't have hours on end to do this.  No end-user should be subject to this type of nonsense.  </p><p>Years ago,  I chose my theme because certain cominations of colors on a computer screen trigger a migraine, which is not a normal headache.  It's a serious medical conditon.  Until recently, my drop down lists had a light background and now they all have a black background.  It seems Mozilla's tech support reponse to simlar complaints is ""write your own CSS code"".   If it's so easy, then the Firefox development group needs to do it.  To tell the end-user community to write custom code is nonsense.   </p><p>Secondly, the bookmarks dropdown list needs a sidebar for quick scrolling.  Having to hold down the mouse button and use the wheel to scroll is medieval.  An option to have more menus, besides the main menu and other bookmarks, would be nice too.  But that option is for convenience and not a vision-related industry standard. </p><p>Therefore, I am putting in this request for two necessary fixes: </p><p>1.  Create a global option in the Firefox Settingsto have dropdown lists have a light background that overrides any theme settings. </p><p>2.  Add a scroll bar to the bookmarks dropdown list. </p><p>Let's be very clear.  Many people are getting really fed up with Mozilla and there comes a point where people like me - who have used Firefox ""forever"" - will jump ship and never come back.   You already lost my husband, who migrated to Opera.  For an organization, attrition of the end-user community is never a good thing.  I hate to leave, but I can't continue to risk having a severe migraine, where I have to take an injection, lay down for an hour, take another injection, and maybe end up in the ER - because the development group of the browser I prefer doesn't give a crap about industry standards related to color and people with vision problems.    </p><p>In closing, an end-user should be able to choose colors for features that are used heavily, which includes the bookmarks toolbar dropdown list.  My vision-related health issue is very common.  Here's a few more that people suffer from:  dyslexia, refractive errors, cataracts, color blindness, floaters, and many more.   Most of these are not curable.  The treatment is to avoid activities which can cause headaches, nausea, and other harmful physical reactions.  It would be a very sad day that Mozilla Firefox is officially listed by the American Society of Opthamologists and it's counterparts in countries around the world to formally list Firefox as an activity to avoid. </p><p>Therefore, I hope you put the two fixes at the top of your project list! </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",martimasters

I'm using the Adwaita (dark version) theme on my OS. </p><p>The problem is that Firefox uses the dark theme in Its menus (I don't mind) but It transmits to websites this setting and thus, websites supporting dark mode use it (Google, DuckDuckGo for example). I don't like that. I want them to use the light mode but keeping my theme on my OS. </p><p>So, I tried to change the value to 0, 1, 2, 3 (I tried each for them) for the setting layout.css.prefers-color-scheme.content-override and put ""Adwaita:light"" in the widget.content.gtk-theme-override field in about:config. Each time I restarted Firefox. It never works, websites still continue to use the dark theme... </p><p>Thanks in advance </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-7815;firefox-78150;,firefox,other,en-US,1541890;,DimGoodStuff

Every year I notice the performance of the browser getting worse and worse, more and more errors unexpected closures and slowdowns, it's bad to work because such small crashes make you look for another alternative. I do not write this maliciously, but that you think about how to improve the performance and speed of firefox. I only hope that someone wise will read this and pass it on to the higher-ups to make real changes. </p><p>In any case, you are going in the right direction and I still consider firefox with the most friendly and easy to use browser. </p><p>greetings to the team </p><p>Andrzej Nowacki </p>",desktop;beta;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1060;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1541838;,aleuty11
