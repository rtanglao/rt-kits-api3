I'm using the Adwaita (dark version) theme on my OS. </p><p>The problem is that Firefox uses the dark theme in Its menus (I don't mind) but It transmits to websites this setting and thus, websites supporting dark mode use it (Google, DuckDuckGo for example). I don't like that. I want them to use the light mode but keeping my theme on my OS. </p><p>So, I tried to change the value to 0, 1, 2, 3 (I tried each for them) for the setting layout.css.prefers-color-scheme.content-override and put ""Adwaita:light"" in the widget.content.gtk-theme-override field in about:config. Each time I restarted Firefox. It never works, websites still continue to use the dark theme... </p><p>Thanks in advance </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-7815;firefox-78150;,firefox,other,en-US,1541890;,DimGoodStuff

Every year I notice the performance of the browser getting worse and worse, more and more errors unexpected closures and slowdowns, it's bad to work because such small crashes make you look for another alternative. I do not write this maliciously, but that you think about how to improve the performance and speed of firefox. I only hope that someone wise will read this and pass it on to the higher-ups to make real changes. </p><p>In any case, you are going in the right direction and I still consider firefox with the most friendly and easy to use browser. </p><p>greetings to the team </p><p>Andrzej Nowacki </p>",desktop;beta;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1060;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1541838;,aleuty11
