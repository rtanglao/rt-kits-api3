I usually browse on Chrome, but my user also has a 'Mozilla Firefox' browser installed. When I opened it today, I found that it is somewhat out of date. Aside from buggy tab formatting, the biggest indication is an invalid certificate warning for many sites including Wikipedia and the Mozilla support website. </p><p>As shown in the attached screenshots, Firefox version 34.0.5 is running, and it considers itself up to date. I subsequently installed the default version of Firefox for Windows 10 (apparently 97.0), but it did not update the previous Firefox browser, which is still accessible under 'Mozilla Firefox,' whereas I am writing this ticket in the current browser, called 'Firefox.'  </p><p>I think this question should be very low priority, but I am wondering why the browser thinks it is up to date. According to the current documentation, the only internal path to updates seems to be a 'Help' &gt; 'About Firefox' &gt; (Firefox initiates automatic update) sequence, but that isn't working for the older browser version. It feels like updating to the newest version should be possible from within the outdated Firefox, rather than doing what I did and installing another instance on my machine. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1487107;1487110;,jacksondougherty
