(Mac -  now Monterey.)  Today it would not open after a crash, so I downloaded a new version (97.0.1).  It doesn't really work at all.  It shows Pocket articles, but won't take me TO articles.  It also won't open links from my email client. </p><p>It would be very awkward to copy Pocket articles to another browser, but far too many links don't show the whole article.  Today it also did not transfer my bookmarks to the new browser.   </p><p>Firefox ​has long been my preferred browser, but I find that sites increasingly don’t use Firefox-friendly code.  Is it time to give up on it?  I also find your bug-reporting process to be incomprehensible. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",istephen

I know there is an entry in about:config to prevent ads from opening new tabs and pop ups without authorization, even from legit websites like the login pop-up windows when doing a sign in in Google, in those cases to allow the windows it's needed to click on the lock icon next to the URL bar and allow it from there. The problem is that I don't remember the name of that setting and I have spend an hour looking for it on Google. </p>",linux;desktop;tabs;firefox-970;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1486928;,ttfh3500
