Now all those icons are default white squares that don't do anything when clicked. </p><p>Also, if I try to edit one and recreate what it was previously, it appears to accept my input but then nothing happens when I click the shortcut. If I edit that shortcut again, the stuff I entered is gone. </p><p>So basically, the shortcut tile feature on the new tab page is non-functional for me. (This is on the current version of Firefox (97.0.1) for Windows 10 (version 2004, build 19041.1415). </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mattsg

I know there is an entry in about:config to prevent ads from opening new tabs and pop ups without authorization, even from legit websites like the login pop-up windows when doing a sign in in Google, in those cases to allow the windows it's needed to click on the lock icon next to the URL bar and allow it from there. The problem is that I don't remember the name of that setting and I have spend an hour looking for it on Google. </p>",linux;desktop;tabs;firefox-970;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1486928;,ttfh3500

A few months ago with an update that occurred at the time, firefox suddenly switched to some sort of dark mode - ie all text was white with black background.  I found others online with the same issue and with their help was able to change the main view back, however all the menu's and any popup dialogue options are still in this mode.  I have attached a screen shot. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,customize,en-US,1486929;,dfilby
