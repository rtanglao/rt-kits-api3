That would be easy if the Firefox automatic generation of a new secure password worked with this site but it doesn't.  Firefox thinks that both the Password and Confirm Password fields are asking for a username instead.  Obviously I can take this up with with the website owner too -- but is there any other means of generating an obscure password when Firefox won't do it?  An app?  A Firefox plug-in? </p>,desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1552945;,a.smith2

I have a monitor 4k resolution, my win10 setting is 150% scaling(recommended), the youtube viewport size is ""2560x1440*1.5"" with a ""*1.5"". When I change win10 to 100%, viewport is ""3840x2160"". This seems correct but the video quality is lower because it is not a x2 upscale from original 1080p youtube stream, but rather x1.5x1.33. Is there anyway for firefox to render video directly? I am aware I can change system scale each time to play video but that's not what I'm looking for. I guess since firefox is rendering text pixel perfect so it has a solution for this problem. Thanks </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",whitecafe

I always use the most current version, and have it set to check for automatic updates. My computer is current, 10th gen Intel with RTX 3060 graphics card, 1 TB SSD drive, etc. I just loaded up my Firefox and I got a blank screen, and EVERYTHING was deleted, including the 367 bookmarks I have over the last two years, and all my settings!!! I regularly use Revo Unistaller Pro, but this NEVER does anything like what I experienced, only clears cache, cookies, etc etc. I have been using that program for years also, with no issues like this. So it is puzzling to me what just happened. I literally lost ALL my progress in Firefox for the last two years! How did this happen?!?!? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1552935;,erniemink
