I always use the most current version, and have it set to check for automatic updates. My computer is current, 10th gen Intel with RTX 3060 graphics card, 1 TB SSD drive, etc. I just loaded up my Firefox and I got a blank screen, and EVERYTHING was deleted, including the 367 bookmarks I have over the last two years, and all my settings!!! I regularly use Revo Unistaller Pro, but this NEVER does anything like what I experienced, only clears cache, cookies, etc etc. I have been using that program for years also, with no issues like this. So it is puzzling to me what just happened. I literally lost ALL my progress in Firefox for the last two years! How did this happen?!?!? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1552935;,erniemink

This overlay remains in place permanently until I enter a ""name"" for my about-to-be-created profile.  However, upon entering a ""name"", the overlay and FF app both terminate immediately. </p><p>This repeats every time I try starting FF (as Administer) and encounter the User Profile overlay. </p><p>I am left wondering if this overlay is malicious on some other systems where security detection is absence? </p><p>This User Profile requirement has never been required before (10yrs).  Maybe a FF update was auto installed in the last 36 hrs.  I checked for pending updates / corrections but only found details of a new Beta version available. </p><p>I have a Win10 Restore Point dated 12-7-22 which I could apply.
