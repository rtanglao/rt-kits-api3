I have update Firefox to version 102.0.1.  </p><p>I'm running into an issue where if I want to have a video playing from a browser in full screen on one monitor, I lose the menu bar and access to the dock on the other monitor. I have set them up so that they behave as separate spaces but the issue persists. It should be noted that this only occurs when I'm trying to use the web browser on the second monitor. My impression of what's happening is the browser thinks that since it's in full screen on one monitor, it should be on the second screen as well. I want them both to act independently of one another and retain access to the menu bar and dock on the second screen.  </p><p>I've trialed this with Brave Browser and Safari and neither of them have the same issue which leads me to believe with overwhelming probability that the issue I'm experiencing is isolated to Firefox.  </p><p>I've included a screenshot from my second monitor. On my primary monitor I have a YouTube video in full screen. I think you can see from the screenshot that the Menu Bar has disappeared from the second display. I also have the Dock set to automatically hide and when the video is full screen on the primary monitor, the Dock will not un-hide itself on the second screen. Unfortunately clicking within the browser will not restore the Menu Bar and access to the Dock. Is this atypical behavior? </p><p>I appreciate whatever help you're able to provide. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Rcq1511

'Ah, simple answer,' I thought, 'I must have turned it off.  Just move the pointer to the top and right click.  The bookmark tab option will be there.' </p><p>But no, it isn't.  Sure, there's the Bookmark name with a right-pointing arrow.  And if I follow that I can see that it says ""Bookmark Toolbar &gt; Always show.""  And although that option has a tick against it, no bookmarks are visible. </p><p>So what's happened to them? If I click on the Bookmarks name right at the top and then click 'Manage Bookmarks' I can see them all, so they haven't been deleted, erased or anything - but why can't I see them? By the way, if I click ""Never Show"" then the space where they should be disappears and if I then click ""Always Show"" then the space returns but without any bookmarks. </p><p>Help please - bookmarks are essential for browsing. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1020;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1517662;,christopherlea12
