Actually, they do not. My previous notebook has a series of bookmarks, but the bookmarks in the latter one is exactly different. It seems like two accounts, but I log in with the same account. Miracly, when I log the same account with my phone, the bookmarks in my phone is sync with my previous notebook I don't know how to solve it and appreciate your answer. </p><p>我有两台笔记本，登录同一个账户时是不同步的。两个笔记本的书签页完全各顾各，但我登录的是一个账户且一直保持着同步。当我用手机登录同一个账户的时候，手机会有第一个笔记本同步；第二个笔记本就好像完全是新的账户。 我不知道怎么解决这个问题，希望专业的你的回复。 </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1020;,firefox,sync,en-US,1517443;,siffer391

I login to my PP account popup window and am taken to the next window where I can - theoretically - choose which means of payment I want to use. Most often I don't have the time to check the banner for Agree and Pay as the app immediately takes me to the page where it tries to connect to register the payment. Then I get the message to the effect of the app is too busy and 'Try again later', so I hit the 'try again' button and am taken back to the login page. Usually, at this point I login, am taken to the Agree and Pay screen but which no longer displays the button to agree and pay, so now the app will no longer register anything and comes to a -- Full Stop. Sometimes for variety I am taken back to the opening page where I again choose PayPal which begins the whole procedure all over again. </p><p>All I'm trying to do is pay Firefox $0.99@month for this ""unlimited"" service. It shouldn't be this  hard. I have also tried to pay using MS Edge; same thing: 'Server busy, try again later' Any suggestions to rectify this annoying time sink would be welcomed. </p><p>I am running FF 102.0 64bit on  Windows 10 Pro Version 21H2 Installed on ‎6/‎18/‎2021 OS build 19044.1766 Experience Windows Feature Experience Pack 120.2212.4180.0 </p><pre>   On 07/05/2022 3:22 PM Firefox Accounts &lt;accounts@firefox.com&gt; wrote: </pre>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1020;,firefox,other,en-US,1517474;,thevike

There is a delay when starting the video, and at times Firefox stops responding if I try to switch to another tab when this is happening. (Not always, but sometimes).  </p><p>The delay can be anywhere from 5 to 45 seconds or so, and repeats whenever I pause and unpause a video, or even rewind slightly. This doesn't seem to be buffering, and videos seem to work just fine on Edge.
