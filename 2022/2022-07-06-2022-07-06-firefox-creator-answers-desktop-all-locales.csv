Samozřejmě vím že FF nabízí jakousi čtečku, odkazuje na ni ikonka na konci adresního řádku, ale po kliknutí na ni nikde nevidím spuštění předčítání a to platí pro většinu webů. Dříve stačilo prostě kliknout pravým tl. myši a dát číst. Stejně to funguje v MS Edge, prostě kliknou myší na text, v kontextové nabídce vyberu čtení a už to jede. Ve FF jsem už vyzkoušel několik doplňků, ale bud mají šílenou podporu hlasu (pro porovnání vyzkoušejte čtečku v EDGE) nebo doplňky ani češtinu neumějí . </p><p>S Firefoxem to jde z kopce,  po tom nasazení hnusného vzhledu jsem to loni nevydržel a přešel na EDGE,  pak jsem FF zapnul a zjistil že se změnilo ovládací menu, takže jsem zůstal u EDGE,  pak jsem FF zase zapnul a zjistil jsem že byla odstraněna čtečka, mám připomínat i zákaz starých doplňků po přechodu na nový engine, .....atd atd..... no nedivím se že FF tak rychle ztrácí uživatele </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;,firefox,tips,cs,1517494;,Honza1616

I login to my PP account popup window and am taken to the next window where I can - theoretically - choose which means of payment I want to use.

Usually, at this point I login, am taken to the Agree and Pay screen but which no longer displays the button to agree and pay, so now the app will no longer register anything and comes to a -- Full Stop.
