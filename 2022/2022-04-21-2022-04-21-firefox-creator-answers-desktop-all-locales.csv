I am sure that there is confusion between the new and the old since I cannot set up the new account with the same secondary email address as the old one as it claims a user already has an account with this secondary address. </p><p>Any ideas on how I can get rid of the new account, if it is new, or clean it up so that I can restore it to the original ? </p>",linux;desktop;other;escalate;verificationemail;synclogin;firefox-990;,firefox,other,en-US,"",paul.guilbert15
