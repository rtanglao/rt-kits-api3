I'm feeling more and more stupid every time this happens.  Why can't mozilla make Firefox robust enough that I can always get my previous session back.  This time it happened for a new reason: Firefox had a new window open up when I restarted my PC, with an advertisement for a Disney movie.  Fuck!!! Fuck!!! Fuck!!!  IF Mozilla is so smart, why can't they fix a problem like this?

One case was related to Amazon, another case to Home Depot, but in my case it is caused on the initial start of Firefox after a boot. Once the router/modem is reset, we can restart Firefox multiple times each day and it never causes a problem again.  In our case, it is caused by the home page (<a href=""http://aolmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">aolmail.com</a>).  I have read all the solutions that I have found and the only thing that appears to work for us is to start Firefox in Troubleshooting Mode.  Then we are fine with no  further modem/router hang ups.  Any suggestions as to what to try to resolve this issue.  It's on my Wife's computer and if she ain't happy, no one else is.
