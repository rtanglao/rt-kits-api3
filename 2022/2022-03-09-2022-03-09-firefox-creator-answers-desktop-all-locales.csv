I lost all of my Firefox tabs again (again!) today, in the last half hour.  I can't 'restore the previous session'.  I'm starting to feel pushed into giving up PC's altogether, with with problem of losing my Firefox session tabs after restarting my PC.  Who needs PC devices/smart phones altogether.  I'm feeling more and more stupid every time this happens.  Why can't mozilla make Firefox robust enough that I can always get my previous session back.  This time it happened for a new reason: Firefox had a new window open up when I restarted my PC, with an advertisement for a Disney movie.  Fuck!!! Fuck!!! Fuck!!!  IF Mozilla is so smart, why can't they fix a problem like this?  I see in the Mozilla knowledge base that people ask about this problem frequently. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",narva1944

One case was related to Amazon, another case to Home Depot, but in my case it is caused on the initial start of Firefox after a boot. Once the router/modem is reset, we can restart Firefox multiple times each day and it never causes a problem again.  In our case, it is caused by the home page (<a href=""http://aolmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">aolmail.com</a>).  I have read all the solutions that I have found and the only thing that appears to work for us is to start Firefox in Troubleshooting Mode.  Then we are fine with no  further modem/router hang ups.  Any suggestions as to what to try to resolve this issue.  It's on my Wife's computer and if she ain't happy, no one else is.  Thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mike.steele1
