It is not my internet as other browsers have no issues i moved to firefox due to chromes ram hungry nature and left opera due to it taking massive storage space. I dont want to have to move again but its becoming a great annoyance, I was thinking is this due to firefox not being chromium based so youtube does not like it? I cleared the startup cache and this hasn't fixed i hope you can sort this if not i will have to move browser. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Mrjak900

I do many image downloads individually (save image as), and now, when I download an image, the download panel comes up, a new feature, but it is an annoying behavior. I prefer the old way: when I want to open the downloads panel I click on the download icon on the menubar. This page apparently describes this new behavior: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/manage-downloads-preferences-using-downloads-menu"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/manage-downloads-preferences-using-downloads-menu</a> How do I prevent the downloads panel from automatically opening when I don't want it to open? Unfortunately it's tough to get a picture of this. I tried for a movie on my phone so maybe you can see what it looks like, though right now it looks like it won't upload. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,other,en-US,1488173;,lemonodo

I lost all of my Firefox tabs again (again!) today, in the last half hour.  I can't 'restore the previous session'.  I'm starting to feel pushed into giving up PC's altogether, with with problem of losing my Firefox session tabs after restarting my PC.  Who needs PC devices/smart phones altogether.  I'm feeling more and more stupid every time this happens.  Why can't mozilla make Firefox robust enough that I can always get my previous session back.  This time it happened for a new reason: Firefox had a new window open up when I restarted my PC, with an advertisement for a Disney movie.  IF Mozilla is so smart, why can't they fix a problem like this?  I see in the Mozilla knowledge base that people ask about this problem frequently. </p><p><em>[Profanity removed by moderator.

One case was related to Amazon, another case to Home Depot, but in my case it is caused on the initial start of Firefox after a boot. Once the router/modem is reset, we can restart Firefox multiple times each day and it never causes a problem again.  In our case, it is caused by the home page (<a href=""http://aolmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">aolmail.com</a>).  I have read all the solutions that I have found and the only thing that appears to work for us is to start Firefox in Troubleshooting Mode.  Then we are fine with no  further modem/router hang ups.  Any suggestions as to what to try to resolve this issue.  It's on my Wife's computer and if she ain't happy, no one else is.
