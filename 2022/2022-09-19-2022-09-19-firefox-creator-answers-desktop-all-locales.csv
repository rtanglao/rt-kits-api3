It's kinda disturbing and makes me want to stop using the whole thing, even though I'm a big fan of Firefox.  </p><p>1.) The first sign of the error is the browser suddenly becoming partially unresponsive. The UI still works - as in, you can scroll down/up on open pages, navigate through menus, open/close tabs, etc. but no HTML content is loaded JS isn't running. First I thought this was just bad connection, but I had a stable internet connection and other browsers would load the same pages.  2.) At this point, when I try to close the whole app and restart it, I get a message that the browser is already running. The dialogue box also offers to force restart the app, which doesn't work (it stops the process but doesn't restart it, so I still have to manually launch the app). 3.) After manually launching after failed force restart, I'm getting another error message saying that I'm using an ""old version of Firefox"", due to which my old profile ""might not work"". I can either exit the app or create a new profile. From a new profile I can load profile manager but I'm unable to launch the other profile. However, indeed there is an app update pending. 4.) After the update is installed, the browser launches the new profile and and then from the profile manager I'm able to load the other profile, set is up as standard and remove all other profiles. After this step, all seems to be normal and Firefox keeps working without any issues until a next update is found, but then the whole issue starts from point 1. </p><p>First time I suspected that the profile is corrupted, so I deleted it and resynced the settings from my Firefox Account, but this has not helped, so I fully removed Firefox with all the data stored on the local drives and reinstalled it. Then the latest version was installed and the profile worked, so I presumed the issue to be resolved until a new update came. In the last month there's been at least 3-4 updates, all triggering this very peculiar issue issue. I was thinking this might be known so the devs would release a fix soon, but I couldn't find the same issue mentioned, so now I'm suspecting one of the add-ons acting up. However, since the issue only reproducible when an update is released, it would somewhat complicated and time-consuming to deduct which one is causing the error. Hence, asking question here as I'm wondering if anyone had encountered anything similar or could suggest any further steps to fix the error. </p><p>I'm using 104.0.2 (64-bit) and following add-ons: </p><pre>   Dark </pre> <p>Extension ID </p><pre>   firefox-compact-dark@mozilla.org </pre> <p>Internal UUID </p><pre>   e19ebbac-c904-4833-9836-b34cd99aedf7 </pre> <p>Manifest URL </p><pre>   moz-extension://e19ebbac-c904-4833-9836-b34cd99aedf7/manifest.json </pre> <p>LeechBlock NG </p><p>Extension ID </p><pre>   leechblockng@proginosko.com </pre> <p>Internal UUID </p><pre>   fcae5d2b-d421-46db-b85f-bf4b01b74042 </pre> <p>Manifest URL </p><pre>   moz-extension://fcae5d2b-d421-46db-b85f-bf4b01b74042/manifest.json </pre> <p>HTTPS Everywhere </p><p>Extension ID </p><pre>   https-everywhere@eff.org </pre> <p>Internal UUID </p><pre>   ed95fe88-894b-4f71-b65f-d94ca39184d6 </pre> <p>Manifest URL </p><pre>   moz-extension://ed95fe88-894b-4f71-b65f-d94ca39184d6/manifest.json </pre> <p>Decentraleyes </p><p>Extension ID </p><pre>   jid1-BoFifL9Vbdl2zQ@jetpack </pre> <p>Internal UUID </p><pre>   249d0d84-b3f5-4682-9a07-2bd77246a6f7 </pre> <p>Manifest URL </p><pre>   moz-extension://249d0d84-b3f5-4682-9a07-2bd77246a6f7/manifest.json </pre> <p>Stylus </p><p>Extension ID </p><pre>   {7a7a4a92-a2a0-41d1-9fd7-1e92480d612d} </pre> <p>Internal UUID </p><pre>   fa3b5461-95c0-4472-9306-8428d080f931 </pre> <p>Manifest URL </p><pre>   moz-extension://fa3b5461-95c0-4472-9306-8428d080f931/manifest.json </pre> <p>Privacy Badger </p><p>Extension ID </p><pre>   jid1-MnnxcxisBPnSXQ@jetpack </pre> <p>Internal UUID </p><pre>   c69318fb-2a37-4c3c-abed-60758264c38d </pre> <p>Manifest URL </p><pre>   moz-extension://c69318fb-2a37-4c3c-abed-60758264c38d/manifest.json </pre> <p>Cookie AutoDelete </p><p>Extension ID </p><pre>   CookieAutoDelete@kennydo.com </pre> <p>Internal UUID </p><pre>   c452aab0-c8bd-4336-81e3-9482d58fbde0 </pre> <p>Manifest URL </p><pre>   moz-extension://c452aab0-c8bd-4336-81e3-9482d58fbde0/manifest.json </pre> <p>Super Dark Mode </p><p>Extension ID </p><pre>   {be3295c2-d576-4a7c-9987-a21844164dbb} </pre> <p>Internal UUID </p><pre>   fd0ffaf5-043d-405c-872f-dbd547640b2e </pre> <p>Manifest URL </p><pre>   moz-extension://fd0ffaf5-043d-405c-872f-dbd547640b2e/manifest.json </pre> <p>NoScript </p><p>Extension ID </p><pre>   {73a6fe31-595d-460b-a920-fcc0f8843232} </pre> <p>Internal UUID </p><pre>   492c4958-9f48-48fe-b927-c0259592f1ca </pre> <p>Manifest URL </p><pre>   moz-extension://492c4958-9f48-48fe-b927-c0259592f1ca/manifest.json </pre> <p>uBlock Origin </p><p>Extension ID </p><pre>   uBlock0@raymondhill.net </pre> <p>Internal UUID </p><pre>   b73fc177-8d0f-4a6c-84b9-950e67c850a8 </pre> <p>Manifest URL </p><pre>   moz-extension://b73fc177-8d0f-4a6c-84b9-950e67c850a8/manifest.json </pre> <p>I haven't captured the exact error messages but I'm happy to do if that sheds some further light on the issue (would have to wait until next update for the issue to happen though).
