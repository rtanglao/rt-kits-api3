I am able to select open on the download dialog, and this will open the file and save it to the temp directory firefox uses for this function, but this does not save the files to disk/the download folder like I want to. I am unable to ""Save image as..."" as well, since this is considered a download. There is no record of these downloads even being attempted in the download history. </p>",linux;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",liptherapypirate
