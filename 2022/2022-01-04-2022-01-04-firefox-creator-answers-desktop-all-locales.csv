It would be wonderful to just be in ine well moderated browser ecosystem and actually being able to have my preferences, interest and personal information centralized with eventual goal of digitally divorcing tech companies from my personal data. I still have to use a lot of different devies with varying OS and it literally took me two years to help Apple fix an AppleId problem. Now that I have that sorted out I have been hoping to move away from gmail entirely and eventually have my own mailserver but using icloud now for macs and pcs.   </p><p><br> At a minimum it seems like even after forced manual I have not properly sync an imac with windows 10 PC. So to keep it simple I stay there but this morning when I typed into Firefox on my iMac its was google search not Duckduckgo. Not only have I synced it in firefox but icloud should be redudant and I had removed google from list of potential search engines. There seems to be some way for a hostile takeover of these settings and google connstant agressive intrusions asking for data is not just wrong or annoying its simply impossible to not have facebook or google track me beyond california digital privacy standards. The worst offender may be youtube.  I want to fix the browser and sync my stuff. But I am also looking for extensions that will help me do that better.   </p><p>I am pretty thorough and now just want to learn more and would like to believe one can have a semblance of privacy but it seems like it will be an adversarial experience when the companies that do can rollback privacy with clever tv ads.  The 'providers'  clearly do not give hoot about rules, preferences and laws designed to protect people's rights..  That is what is particulary frustrating. It is not a fair fight but a good one. I guess what I am wondering is if there are specific modules you could add to detect maybewhen an event like change in search engine occurs and whether logs may exist as to how or why the change was made. Even if it was an accidental quick through a popup in chromium or edge where I was always being cued to  come back to Chrome.  Logging out doesnt always seem to work so i tried syncing with and chrome with more or less same results.  Very little actual control or at least a tendency to revert back to the data miners preferences over mine.

Additionally, if the video is briefly paused and restarted, the problem resurfaces, especially if I've browsed to another open tab or active window; although, I can't say for certain that the latter two are related, and whether or not it is merely the act of pausing alone and leaving the video idle for a brief period that triggers the behavior. </p><p>Of particular note during my troubleshooting efforts, I noticed odd behavior in my system tray at the same time as the behavior observed above occurs:  </p><p>Firefox appears to very quickly attempt to switch to speakers that are not designated as the default system speaker in use before trying to switch back, resulting in the audio being muted. That is, if I have my television set hooked up and set as the default audio output, when videos are played in Firefox, Firefox appears to be hunting for different outputs before settling back once again on the TV Speakers. Even more oddly, Firefox appears to be attempting to hunt for and select speakers as outputs that are 1.) Not even connected to physical media 2.) Disabled in Windows 10 software settings, and 3.) have <em>never</em> been used on this PC at all, ever! It seems especially keen on selecting Digital Audio (S/PDIF), which are disabled in software, before reverting back to the TV set's speakers, which are, again, set as default.  </p><p>With the onset of this problem in the last couple of days, this behavior is new and in terms of hardware, the only thing that has changed in that time is an upgrade from an old Sony Bravia HDTV set to a new LG OLED 4K TV set (model number: OLED48C1AUB). </p><p>This behavior is also exclusive to video content played through Firefox's browser with embedded links and streaming content from social media platforms. Nota bene: This does <em>not</em> appear to impact other streaming platforms, like Netflix and the like, which so far seem to play perfectly. I'm not ruling anything out, but so far, so good on that front. </p><p>Things that I have already done to troubleshoot this issue on my own include: 1.) Clearing browser cache and related files; 2.) Clean reinstall of all video and audio drivers; 3.) Run Firefox in safe mode, to ensure add-ons are not the culprit (they are not, problem persists); 4.) Play the same video content in another browser (video content plays problem free in Microsoft Edge). </p><p>Any help toward fixing this problem is welcomed. </p><p>Here is an abridged copy of a DXDIAG report (system, audio, and video reports only, for brevity) that I generated for the purposes of this post: </p> <hr> <p>System Information </p> <hr> <pre>     Time of this report: 1/3/2022, 17:27:14             Machine name: [REDACTED]               Machine Id: [REDACTED]         Operating System: Windows 10 Home 64-bit (10.0, Build 19042) (19041.vb_release.191206-1406)                 Language: English (Regional Setting: English)      System Manufacturer: System manufacturer             System Model: System Product Name                     BIOS: 0801 (type: UEFI)                Processor: AMD A10-7850K Radeon R7, 12 Compute Cores 4C+8G (4 CPUs), ~3.7GHz                   Memory: 16384MB RAM      Available OS Memory: 16320MB RAM                Page File: 12001MB used, 6751MB available              Windows Dir: C:\WINDOWS          DirectX Version: DirectX 12      DX Setup Parameters: Not found         User DPI Setting: 96 DPI (100 percent)       System DPI Setting: 288 DPI (300 percent)          DWM DPI Scaling: UnKnown                 Miracast: Available, with HDCP </pre> <p>Microsoft Graphics Hybrid: Not Supported </p><pre>DirectX Database Version: 1.0.8           DxDiag Version: 10.00.19041.0928 64bit Unicode </pre> <hr> <p>DxDiag Notes </p> <hr> <pre>     Display Tab 1: No problems found.
