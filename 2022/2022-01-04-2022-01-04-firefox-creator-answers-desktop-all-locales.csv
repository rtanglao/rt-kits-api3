1363079,2022-01-03 18:32:12 -0800,2022-01-03 18:32:12 -0800,Audio becomes muted when playing video content in Firefox,"<p>As per the title, when video content is played in a Firefox browser, under Windows 10, latest builds current to the date of this post; whether it's embedded videos, or videos uploaded (typically mp4) by users on various social media platforms (ie: Discord, Twitter, etc.); or whether it's videos streamed from sites like YouTube, the audio portion of the content cuts out after a couple of seconds while the video continues playing silently.  </p><p>Audio can be restored by rewinding the video content a few seconds and allowing it to resume, although this is obviously a workaround and not ideal if I, for example, am away from my keyboard while a playlist progresses on to the next video and I'm not there to fiddle with it. Additionally, if the video is briefly paused and restarted, the problem resurfaces, especially if I've browsed to another open tab or active window; although, I can't say for certain that the latter two are related, and whether or not it is merely the act of pausing alone and leaving the video idle for a brief period that triggers the behavior. </p><p>Of particular note during my troubleshooting efforts, I noticed odd behavior in my system tray at the same time as the behavior observed above occurs:  </p><p>Firefox appears to very quickly attempt to switch to speakers that are not designated as the default system speaker in use before trying to switch back, resulting in the audio being muted. That is, if I have my television set hooked up and set as the default audio output, when videos are played in Firefox, Firefox appears to be hunting for different outputs before settling back once again on the TV Speakers. Even more oddly, Firefox appears to be attempting to hunt for and select speakers as outputs that are 1.) Not even connected to physical media 2.) Disabled in Windows 10 software settings, and 3.) have <em>never</em> been used on this PC at all, ever! It seems especially keen on selecting Digital Audio (S/PDIF), which are disabled in software, before reverting back to the TV set's speakers, which are, again, set as default.  </p><p>With the onset of this problem in the last couple of days, this behavior is new and in terms of hardware, the only thing that has changed in that time is an upgrade from an old Sony Bravia HDTV set to a new LG OLED 4K TV set (model number: OLED48C1AUB). </p><p>This behavior is also exclusive to video content played through Firefox's browser with embedded links and streaming content from social media platforms. Nota bene: This does <em>not</em> appear to impact other streaming platforms, like Netflix and the like, which so far seem to play perfectly. I'm not ruling anything out, but so far, so good on that front. </p><p>Things that I have already done to troubleshoot this issue on my own include: 1.) Clearing browser cache and related files; 2.) Clean reinstall of all video and audio drivers; 3.) Run Firefox in safe mode, to ensure add-ons are not the culprit (they are not, problem persists); 4.) Play the same video content in another browser (video content plays problem free in Microsoft Edge). </p><p>Any help toward fixing this problem is welcomed. </p><p>Here is an abridged copy of a DXDIAG report (system, audio, and video reports only, for brevity) that I generated for the purposes of this post: </p> <hr> <p>System Information </p> <hr> <pre>     Time of this report: 1/3/2022, 17:27:14             Machine name: [REDACTED]               Machine Id: [REDACTED]         Operating System: Windows 10 Home 64-bit (10.0, Build 19042) (19041.vb_release.191206-1406)                 Language: English (Regional Setting: English)      System Manufacturer: System manufacturer             System Model: System Product Name                     BIOS: 0801 (type: UEFI)                Processor: AMD A10-7850K Radeon R7, 12 Compute Cores 4C+8G (4 CPUs), ~3.7GHz                   Memory: 16384MB RAM      Available OS Memory: 16320MB RAM                Page File: 12001MB used, 6751MB available              Windows Dir: C:\WINDOWS          DirectX Version: DirectX 12      DX Setup Parameters: Not found         User DPI Setting: 96 DPI (100 percent)       System DPI Setting: 288 DPI (300 percent)          DWM DPI Scaling: UnKnown                 Miracast: Available, with HDCP </pre> <p>Microsoft Graphics Hybrid: Not Supported </p><pre>DirectX Database Version: 1.0.8           DxDiag Version: 10.00.19041.0928 64bit Unicode </pre> <hr> <p>DxDiag Notes </p> <hr> <pre>     Display Tab 1: No problems found.
