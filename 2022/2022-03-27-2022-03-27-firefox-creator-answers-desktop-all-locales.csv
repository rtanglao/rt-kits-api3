Found a comment to change setting from 3 to 2 in about:config, which solved part of the problem, but left bookmarks black. Read somewhere to go to ui.something something something &amp; turn off dark mode, but no instructions where to find this or how to change it. Read several other places to change theme, which I really did not want to do &amp; really should not have to do, but I found a different theme.   Got rid of black bookmarks but now search box &amp; dropdown are black!  What do I have to do to fix that?  Preferably without turning anything ELSE to dark mode? And WHY is this so incredibly difficult?   And is anybody (development-wise) ever going to fix this?  'cause if not, I will be re-installing FF94 &amp; turning off updates, or, much as I like Firefox, looking for a new browser...

It is true that it is more consistent with what other browsers do, but firefox being different was to me a plus of firefox. </p><p>As others have noticed here, the biggest concern is that you end up polluting the Downloads directory, that substantially becomes a sort or Trash. Every single file you view (e.g. in the integrated PDF viewer or in an external application) now must go in Downloads, even if you do not care about it at all, while you would like them to go to a ""Temporary"" directory, reserving Downloads for the items you explicitly wanted to download and not for all the useless stuff you casually happen to look at. </p><p>Additionally, on ultraportable that often have limited disk resources, the Downloads directory can rapidly explode to a too large size. </p><p>I have noticed that as of today, it is possible to revert the previous behavior (files that are casually opened get to a temporary folder that is automatically cleaned up, unless you explicitly save them to a non temporary place such as Downloads) by the browser.download.improvements_to_download_panel option available in about:config. </p><p>My question is: for how long is that option expected to stay? Indefinitely? For some releases?  How many? This is important to know to arrange time to set up different work flow. For instance I think that it may be possible set the dowload dir to some place that gets auto cleaned by some system script removing files older than some threshold time. ... Or see if in the meantime some extension to manage dowloads via a temporary dir comes out. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,customize,en-US,1492952;,sergio.callegari

This happens so dependably that whenever Firefox crashes I know it will update. This is very annoying. I would rather to choose when Firefox updates not have it suddenly decide it wants to update and force that decision on me. </p>,desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1492968;,matt00wyrick

It was Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus - KB2267202 (Version 1.361.793.0). Now, I cannot open Firefox. When I click on Firefox for around half a second I see an error box that says ""Open Firefox in troubleshooting mode?"" and nothing else, with no option to click yes, then the box closes. The same thing happens when I try to run firefox.exe -p to change profiles. I also cannot open Tor Browser, and I am wondering if there is a connection. I have tried uninstalling Firefox using the uninstall tool and reinstalling but I have the same issue. I uninstalled the windows update and opened Firefox. This time, it had the ""Open Firefox in troubleshooting mode?"" box but I could actually click on the yes option, and Firefox opened. However, when I clicked on the option to get a fresh install and remove the extensions, Firefox closed and I am back to the same place of it not being able to open again. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1492841;1492920;1492990;,alexestein
