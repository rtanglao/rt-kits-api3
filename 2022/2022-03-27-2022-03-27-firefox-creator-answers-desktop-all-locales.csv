I've recently added a couple of extensions to Firefox (Easy Youtube Video Downloader Express &amp; AdBlocker for YouTubeâ„¢). I don't see the icon for these extensions in the toolbar. When I go to the toolbar customizing page, I don't see the icons in the list to add to toolbar. So I don't even know how to use the Youtube downloader extension when I can't even click on or open it in any way. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",p.t.tabayi
