Whereas, it was previously at the top (which is more like every other application I use). </p><p>After some head scratching and web searches, I remembered I had to fix this issue previously (after a Firefox upgrade some time back). The method to fix it then could be found here:  [<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1197650|Is"" rel=""nofollow"">there a way to put the Find Bar at top</a>]  That link is of course to the same question asked 4 years back. </p><p>I have once again followed the procedure there explained per: •  Access my Firefox profile folder. In my case: </p><pre>  C:\Users\&lt;Me&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\5ym42ewi.default </pre> <p>•  Create folder therein called ‘chrome’ •  In that folder create a file called ‘userChrome.css’ •  In that file add text:  </p><pre>  .browserContainer &gt; findbar {     -moz-box-ordinal-group: 0;   } </pre> <p>However, after doing that (and restarting Firefox), the Find bar stubbornly remains glued to the bottom of the window. </p><p>Can anyone tell me how to solve this issue? </p><p>As a separate note to the developers: This issue is long-standing, that a web search reveals is still relevant to many users. Any chance of considering making it a standard option? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,customize,en-US,1492846;,Spinner4000

It was Security Intelligence Update for Microsoft Defender Antivirus - KB2267202 (Version 1.361.793.0). Now, I cannot open Firefox. When I click on Firefox for around half a second I see an error box that says ""Open Firefox in troubleshooting mode?"" and nothing else, with no option to click yes, then the box closes. The same thing happens when I try to run firefox.exe -p to change profiles. I also cannot open Tor Browser, and I am wondering if there is a connection. I have tried uninstalling Firefox using the uninstall tool and reinstalling but I have the same issue. I uninstalled the windows update and opened Firefox. This time, it had the ""Open Firefox in troubleshooting mode?"" box but I could actually click on the yes option, and Firefox opened. However, when I clicked on the option to get a fresh install and remove the extensions, Firefox closed and I am back to the same place of it not being able to open again. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1492841;,alexestein

I've recently added a couple of extensions to Firefox (Easy Youtube Video Downloader Express &amp; AdBlocker for YouTube™). I don't see the icon for these extensions in the toolbar. When I go to the toolbar customizing page, I don't see the icons in the list to add to toolbar. So I don't even know how to use the Youtube downloader extension when I can't even click on or open it in any way. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,customize,en-US,1492833;,p.t.tabayi
