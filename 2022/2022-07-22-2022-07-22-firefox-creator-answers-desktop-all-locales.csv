Im using Windows 10 64-bit 19044.1415 OS build. I tried to use Firefox as I have been using chrome on my other past devices for years now. I tried to install FireFox multiple times for Windows 64x, but it didn't work; I used Mozilla's desktop download link. is there some particular download I need to get for my device? (all firmware is installed to its latest version) </p><p>'<em>The Problem:</em> I use the chrome browser literally for everything, and it is what I'm using to write this question. Anywho all other browsers, including Firefox, fail to load on my device; I've tried reinstalling, I've tried factory resetting my PC, and I've read countless articles on how to fix this, yet none has worked. The issue is when I click on the browser icon or try to run the program, Mozilla doesn't open. Instead, it shows a black screen for a split second, then nothing. And nothing works either. No amount of troubleshooting, firewall deactivating, hardware wiping, installing the latest version of java, and crap will work. It's absurd, and I'm genuinely frustrated. Can someone help me? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",dhruvkberry

These actions worked for a couple of days but no more. </p><p>I understand what TFA is and why in some cases it is a good thing, but these are trusted sites and the continual requirement to get a code is more than a little annoying.

Before, I could download/open/save or whatever and the Yahoo mail tab would remain open (as I would expect it to). </p><p>Any suggestions gratefully received. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",szsteve7
