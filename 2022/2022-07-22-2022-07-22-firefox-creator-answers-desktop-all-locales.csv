Where would I file a feature request for this? </p><p>(There have been at least 3 identical requests in the past 2 years, all archived.) </p>",desktop;other;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",larry_west

Just recently it has changed so that if I select the download option, to download any attachment to an email, it will either open (if say a PDF) or ask me where I want to save the attachment, but then the tab the Yahoo mail is open in will close once the attachment has opened/saved. Before, I could download/open/save or whatever and the Yahoo mail tab would remain open (as I would expect it to). </p><p>Any suggestions gratefully received. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",szsteve7
