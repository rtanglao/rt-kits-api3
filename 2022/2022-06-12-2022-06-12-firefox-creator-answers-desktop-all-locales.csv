Having been using FIREFOX for ages, continue to use it and tell others to use it.  </p><p>For the last couple of days encountering a problem. I regularly visit <a href=""http://www.tribalfootball.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.tribalfootball.com</a> website to read soccer news. Never had any issue. For the last two days, when I go to <a href=""http://www.tribalfootball.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.tribalfootball.com</a>, the home page of the site comesup, but then automatically takes me to <a href=""https://duta.in/tribalfootball-iframe.php"" rel=""nofollow"">https://duta.in/tribalfootball-iframe.php</a> after few seconds. Whatever I do to get back to tribalfootball site home page, it again takes me to <a href=""http://duta.in"" rel=""nofollow"">duta.in</a> website. </p><p>Don't know why this is happening and also don't know how to fix it. Uninstalled FIREFOX from my macbook and installed again but the issue still remains. Any help from you would be great. Note that I don't see this issue in Safari browser. </p><p>Thanks, Kumara </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",kumara121
