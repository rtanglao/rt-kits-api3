What I find strange about this is that this only happens on my desktop PC but not on my Laptop. Both are running the same build of FireFox so I am thinking that there must be something in the settings of one that is causing this. It could also be the way I navigate webpages.  On my PC I use a side button on my mouse.  However, on my laptop I use the gestures on the trackpad. </p><p>If anyone has encountered this issue and know a fix please let me know </p>",desktop;beta;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1020;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",Grimprovise
