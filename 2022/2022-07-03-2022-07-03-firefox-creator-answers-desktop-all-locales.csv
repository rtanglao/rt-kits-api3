I thought this was x-useful as it seems there are a few websites that frequently appeared near the top of the search results that were ""come-ons""; that is when you click on the link in the search results, they only offered an option to ""sign up"" for access. I don't want to see this junk, and I did add one website to the list.  </p><p>I've got another one I want to add, but I can't find the interface to add this website to the list.

Doing that I have to get the new firefox which I now have version 102. Updates disabled instantly. I was on version 88. On version 88 this feature was not on it and version 102 now has this feature and I do not like it. </p><p>The feature I am talking about is if you open the downloads panel and view the downloads list and right click on one of the downloaded files in list there is now an option to Delete. I accidentlly hit this and thought it was just deleting it from downloads panel. Nope it deletes it from computer permanently, not even to recycle bin. Click Delete its gone for good until download it again. </p><p>And this delete option is right above the option remove from history, which I use a lot. </p><p>So I want to know how to disable this delete option?

I can almost always sort out my own issues, especially with browsers. However, this one has stumped me. </p><p>I've noticed that, on any website where user interaction requires use of a microphone, the Linux build of Firefox only ever offers ""source_default_name"" for choice of microphone. Well, OK; I can see this being fine for the vast majority of folks who use a laptop; the built-in microphone WILL be the ""default"" microphone, no questions. </p><p>My question is this; what do those of us running desktop PCs do about microphone selection, hmm? A desktop PC doesn't HAVE a ""built-in, default microphone"", does it? By their very nature, any microphone you're going to use with a desktop is going to be an externally plugged-in device. I have three of these; a USB microphone.....a wireless headset, and the twin stereo mikes on a Logitech c920 webcam. </p><p>Do I get anything resembling a drop-down list to choose what I want to use? Uh-uh. Firefox - apparently! - doesn't ""see"" any of them. Not individually. All I ever see is ""source_default_name""..... </p><p>Grrrr...!! </p><p>C'mon, guys! Frankly, this is about as much use as a chocolate teapot. Linux, to the best of my knowledge - unlike Windoze - doesn't make 'global' device settings, which every application then uses. It's always been far more fine-grained than that, allowing individual device use on a per-app basis. But that only works if the 'app' in question allows those choices to be made. </p><p>Any Chromium-based ""clone"" - and I use several of these, as I package portable versions for the Puppy Linux community - will give a full drop-down list of every available device it can find. Why can't the Linux builds of Firefox do the same? </p><p>I shall be interested to see what, if any, replies I get to this question. It's been bugging me for years...! </p><p>Mike. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1020;,firefox,other,en-US,1516454;1516456;1516465;,cromer.cat
