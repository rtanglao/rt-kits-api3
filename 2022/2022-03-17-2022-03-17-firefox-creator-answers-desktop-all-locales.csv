The only way I've fixed this is to change to scale and tweak around.  Only problem with this is that it then will affect other printing functions and need to switch back to fit to page width. </p><p>I'm sure there must be something I'm not doing right </p><p>Thanks in advance </p>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,1490227;,jappleby27

Desde hace unos días, cuando hago clic sobre un archivo de Word, PowerPoint y otros muchos tipos de archivos, no se abre la ventana en la que se ofrecía la opción de Abrir, Abrir en firefox y Descargar. Únicamente se abre la ventana para elegir la carpeta de descarga (ya que lo tengo configurado para preguntar dónde realizar la descarga), pero no puedo abrirlo directamente. He recurrido al artículo de Administrar los diferentes tipos de descargas: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/es/kb/Administrar%20los%20diferentes%20tipos%20de%20archivo#w_cambiar-las-acciones-de-las-descargas"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/es/kb/Administrar%20los%20diferentes%20tipos%20de%20archivo#w_cambiar-las-acciones-de-las-descargas</a> Pero es inútil. He intentado Cambiar las acciones de descargas y añadir aplicaciones, pero no funciona porque el tipo de archivo no está en la lista en Aplicaciones Tampoco he podido Añadir nuevas acciones para la descarga, porque no me ofrece la posibilidad. He intentado restablecer las opciones de descarga borrando handlers.json He desinstalado firefox borrando todo rastro de él en el ordenador y cuando vuelvo a instalarlo sigue en la misma situación. Por si fuera un problema de plugins, después de reinstalarlo, no puse ningún plugin y seguía haciendo lo mismo. ¿Qué puedo hacer? Porque si no puedo resolverlo tendré que cambiar de navegador después de estar usando Firefox como predeterminado desde siempre. Un saludo. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,other,es,"",ludoronode

When I choose to open the file, <strong>it gets downloaded to my Desktop and opened.</strong> After that it stays on my Desktop forever, and I have to delete it by hand, which kills the whole point of ""open vs download"". </p><p>How can I restore the previous behavior?

The accounts include banking, insurance, travel, government, etc.  This has been on ongoing problem for several weeks.  I first realized it with an airline more than a year ago.  In Firefox, I have tried to delete cookies, to forget about the site.  I have tried changing various protection and security switches.  Nothing seems to help.  Please see the attached screen shots of return messages.  Some messages that say it is a problem with the website and I need to contact that administrator.  However, I am able to immediately go to MS Internet Explorer and get into the account.   I have read community helps and note that other people have these same problems.  And, I have read their frustration as nothing seems to help.  I would appreciate some advice that works.  I like Firefox better than other browsers and do not want to change.
