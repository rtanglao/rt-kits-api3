Firefox has been dying, its been getting worse for years. Every update strips a little bit more away and makes the whole thing even worse than before and the only reason I still use it, is because its still better than the alternatives however, Mozilla, you are doing your absolute best to destroy Firefox for good. You are probably deliberately doing this too, you probably just don't want to provide this service anymore so you're trying your best to make people leave. Or perhaps you want to go the Microsoft route, and assume all users are morons so you have to tell them what to think, how to think, how their software should behave, remove all function and capability and turn it into that alphabet computer I had when I was 4 years old with the old school SNES-like cartridge for learning games. </p><p>Now, I spend a ton more time than I ever should have, using about:config just to try and tweak things you've taken away or changed. Most notably that last thread I linked, and the changes didn't even work. Honestly, maybe I need to disable the update service completely and stay behind on Firefox 98. Its not like Firefox 99 or 100 is gonna be any better. Its not like you still give us security updates, do you? Maybe you do, you just hide them behind forced changes no one wants.

Desde hace unos días, cuando hago clic sobre un archivo de Word, PowerPoint y otros muchos tipos de archivos, no se abre la ventana en la que se ofrecía la opción de Abrir, Abrir en firefox y Descargar. Únicamente se abre la ventana para elegir la carpeta de descarga (ya que lo tengo configurado para preguntar dónde realizar la descarga), pero no puedo abrirlo directamente. He recurrido al artículo de Administrar los diferentes tipos de descargas: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/es/kb/Administrar%20los%20diferentes%20tipos%20de%20archivo#w_cambiar-las-acciones-de-las-descargas"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/es/kb/Administrar%20los%20diferentes%20tipos%20de%20archivo#w_cambiar-las-acciones-de-las-descargas</a> Pero es inútil. He intentado Cambiar las acciones de descargas y añadir aplicaciones, pero no funciona porque el tipo de archivo no está en la lista en Aplicaciones Tampoco he podido Añadir nuevas acciones para la descarga, porque no me ofrece la posibilidad. He intentado restablecer las opciones de descarga borrando handlers.json He desinstalado firefox borrando todo rastro de él en el ordenador y cuando vuelvo a instalarlo sigue en la misma situación. Por si fuera un problema de plugins, después de reinstalarlo, no puse ningún plugin y seguía haciendo lo mismo. ¿Qué puedo hacer? Porque si no puedo resolverlo tendré que cambiar de navegador después de estar usando Firefox como predeterminado desde siempre.
