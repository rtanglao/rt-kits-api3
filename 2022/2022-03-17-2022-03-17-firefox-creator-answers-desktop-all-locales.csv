I attempted to export via HTML my bookmarks from the 32 bit version into the 64 bit version I'm now using 99% of the time.  I imported the HTML file using Manager/Bookmarks/Library and ended up with three Bookmarks Toolbars folders and many bookmarks I don't need. I deleted the unwanted bookmarks, however, they still appear when I click open the ""Bookmark"" at the top of the browser page. Reboot didn't correct issue, nor Refresh. Ideally, I'd like to delete ALL the bookmarks, using the Manager, and just import the bookmarks from the HTML file I have from the 32 bit.  I don't see a complication arising from moving to 64 bit from 32 bit. I've made several attempts to clean this mess up, but no success. </p>",windows-7;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-980;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",JerseyTom1

I tried changing it to ""Always ask""--this is what I had it set to before the update AFAIK--and now it is opening files in a new tab when I select ""Open in Firefox"" from the pop-up menu, but it also actually saves the files in my ""Downloads"" folder instead of the ""temp"" folder where it used to store the files and where they would be deleted by Windows periodically if I didn't manually save them myself.

You are probably deliberately doing this too, you probably just don't want to provide this service anymore so you're trying your best to make people leave. Or perhaps you want to go the Microsoft route, and assume all users are morons so you have to tell them what to think, how to think, how their software should behave, remove all function and capability and turn it into that alphabet computer I had when I was 4 years old with the old school SNES-like cartridge for learning games. </p><p>Now, I spend a ton more time than I ever should have, using about:config just to try and tweak things you've taken away or changed.
