For example, in China. </p><p>I know that Firefox fears. And it is guided by external factors, not its own beliefs. From fear, it is even ready to stoop to a lie.

You also keep locking threads related to this. Someone comes along, helps provide an answer that doesn't ultimately help at all, and then you archive the thread so we can't come back and tell them ""Hey, this doesn't work anymore"". </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1343131"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1343131</a> </p><p>This question, provided some interesting information, which I tried to use to disable the crappy update notifications that Mozilla is forcing on us like a catholic priest alone in a room with a child. Its obvious that so many people have posted that they don't want these notifications, especially since you update this piece of crap software every half day it seems like and you insist on slapping us with notifications every 10 minutes. </p><p>No one wants to be told there's an update every single time they open firefox. No one wants to be reminded every few hours that firefox is open, that there's an update. An update that probably makes firefox even worse than it was before. Firefox has been dying, its been getting worse for years. Every update strips a little bit more away and makes the whole thing even worse than before and the only reason I still use it, is because its still better than the alternatives however, Mozilla, you are doing your absolute best to destroy Firefox for good. You are probably deliberately doing this too, you probably just don't want to provide this service anymore so you're trying your best to make people leave. Or perhaps you want to go the Microsoft route, and assume all users are morons so you have to tell them what to think, how to think, how their software should behave, remove all function and capability and turn it into that alphabet computer I had when I was 4 years old with the old school SNES-like cartridge for learning games. </p><p>Now, I spend a ton more time than I ever should have, using about:config just to try and tweak things you've taken away or changed. Most notably that last thread I linked, and the changes didn't even work. Honestly, maybe I need to disable the update service completely and stay behind on Firefox 98. Its not like Firefox 99 or 100 is gonna be any better. Its not like you still give us security updates, do you? Maybe you do, you just hide them behind forced changes no one wants.

I currently have two Firefox browser windows open, one with four tabs and the other with seventeen.  Ordinarily when I click on the Firefox icon in the taskbar it displays a thumbnail of the two windows and whichever page is active in those windows.  Recently, however, it has been displaying all of the open webpages in list format, instead of the thumbnails.   </p><p>The behavior is inconsistent and I have not been able to determine a pattern, but the list is becoming more common and makes it more difficult to locate the page I was on.  The issue began after my data hard-drive crashed, which held certain Firefox files despite the operating system being on another drive.  But now that I have replaced the drive, the problem persists and I am not certain the issue was related to the crash at all.   </p><p>Does anyone know what might be causing this behavior?
