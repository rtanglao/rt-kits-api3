I've been using Foxfire to play this game for years and never had an issue until a couple of days ago. I did a uninstall/reinstall, cleared data, cleared cache but nothing fixes this issue.

Firefox works great when its working. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",genghis.boy
