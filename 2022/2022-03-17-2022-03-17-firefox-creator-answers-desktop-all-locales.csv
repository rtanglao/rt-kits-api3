FIrefox would contstantly reset a setting to where it saved it and I would change it back to open with Adobe.  Now I just noticed even though the settings have not changed it is saving the attachment in addition to opening it.  It is very annoying.  I do not want to save the attachment, I just want to view it. I do not see any other setting to check or change. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,other,en-US,"",gdfish78

I currently have two Firefox browser windows open, one with four tabs and the other with seventeen.  Ordinarily when I click on the Firefox icon in the taskbar it displays a thumbnail of the two windows and whichever page is active in those windows.  Recently, however, it has been displaying all of the open webpages in list format, instead of the thumbnails.   </p><p>The behavior is inconsistent and I have not been able to determine a pattern, but the list is becoming more common and makes it more difficult to locate the page I was on.  The issue began after my data hard-drive crashed, which held certain Firefox files despite the operating system being on another drive.  But now that I have replaced the drive, the problem persists and I am not certain the issue was related to the crash at all.   </p><p>Does anyone know what might be causing this behavior?  I have attached screen shots of both the list and thumbnail views I am referring to. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",wynden
