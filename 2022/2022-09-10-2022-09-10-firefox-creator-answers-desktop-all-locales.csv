Standard stuff. Firefox suggested a secure password and I agreed; Firefox came up with a good one. The key icon in the URL bar showed a little message that said it had saved the passwords. Hooray.  </p><p>It turns out, it didn't update my passwords at all and now I am locked out of my accounts. Firefox hasn't saved these new passwords it came up with and I'm stuck with my old ones which, obviously, don't work.  </p><p>What can I do? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10401;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1532868;1532874;,JTDJTD
