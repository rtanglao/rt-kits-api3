IT is not Kaspersky internet security , and there is no problem if i use Google Chrome. Every indication is, that Microsoft has found a way to mess up the Firefox browser through the Google search engine, to make the Firefox use every bit of the ram and CPU to make consumers use the Google chrome browser. It would be much appreciated if the program writers can find exactly what has happened and if what I suspect is the case,  update Firefox with a patch  Regards Win 10 os 64 bit with 4gb ram, and Kaspersky internet security on a ASUS P5g41T-MLX mother board. </pre>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-8;firefox-1040;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",billboyd09

Standard stuff. Firefox suggested a secure password and I agreed; Firefox came up with a good one. The key icon in the URL bar showed a little message that said it had saved the passwords. Hooray.  </p><p>It turns out, it didn't update my passwords at all and now I am locked out of my accounts. Firefox hasn't saved these new passwords it came up with and I'm stuck with my old ones which, obviously, don't work.  </p><p>What can I do? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10401;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1532868;1532874;,JTDJTD
