I also performed a procedure in the browser's advanced settings so that I could have this option, but it doesn't work either.

It would be much appreciated if the program writers can find exactly what has happened and if what I suspect is the case,  update Firefox with a patch  Regards Win 10 os 64 bit with 4gb ram, and Kaspersky internet security on a ASUS P5g41T-MLX mother board. </pre>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1040;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",billboyd09
