For Private mode, I used settings for custom history and Always use Private browsing Mode. Somehow, it didn't work. I'm old and forget a lot of what I did. I reinstalled FF a few times, to no avail. So did uninstall and told them why, and that I planned to be back in a few days.  Also, I uninstalled the Maintenance program first. I went to EDGE, but really hate it, so I downloaded FF now. Set for Private browsing.  But it doesn't work. Keep getting public browsing.  Even if I select it on taskbar icon, no luck. Don't see the purple glasses or whatever they were. I really like to use private mode. </p><p>I can sure use some advice. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1519519;1519521;,gokathyd
