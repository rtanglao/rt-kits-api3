I do NOT want to be synced to Windows, they're the problem!","<p>My pc crashed about a month ago. We all know how screwed up Windows is, hence Firefox. Something changed in the past week &amp; it was NONE of my doing. Once I get this crap working right, I leave it alone. Of course, I have Bing/MS because it's required to have MANY browsers since not one can do it all. I use Bing/MS mostly, I only ever had Firefox because they know what a screenshot is. I don't use it for much else because it's slow as hell. Here I am tonight, 1:45 a.m., trying to do my screenshots. Windows has changed the settings &amp; how I operate. I have NOT synced ANY of my laptop stuff to them because they'll fu-- it up. That's the only thing THEY'RE good for, you can count on it.  </p><p>1. I take the screenshot. 2. I go up to the top bar &amp; click the folder.  3. I rename the file. (png to jpg, NOT a deal breaker.) 4. Now after taking 5 shots, the download folder is automatically retaining the original screenshot as well as the renamed one, so I'm having to do manual deletions.  </p><p>Since I've been doing thousands of screenshots in the last 7 months, it's been going great (other than the freaking MS/Bing crashing my pc). Of course, why would it keep going smoothly when my damn deadline is coming up? I HATE WINDOWS &amp; MS. Meanwhile, I have to keep doing double work, lather, rinse, repeat, etc. from the above-mentioned pains in the ass. Also, that automatic adding of the png after I manually change it to jpg is another pain in the ass.  </p><p>I will elaborate on the deadline because I don't have time to waste. I'm having to do my testimonies as Dying Declarations because I won't live long enough for the trials due to a brain tumor. I'm sure that is adding to my thinking skills as it is. I can barely write or talk anymore, thank God I can still type. Gmail's a useless product as well, but if anyone can offer a simpler way for me to get the screenshots done, disable those pains in the ass, please email me. I would have attached a few of the screenshots to show you, but I don't have time to edit them, delete my personal info, etc. I'll check back later in the day. Thank you.  </p><p>PS When I clicked share data, the first thing I see is MS defender. I'm assuming that's the fu-up, not sure. I certainly did not CHOOSE it. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,other,en-US,1519576;1519593;1519597;,seniorlife171

So did uninstall and told them why, and that I planned to be back in a few days.  Also, I uninstalled the Maintenance program first. I went to EDGE, but really hate it, so I downloaded FF now. Set for Private browsing.  But it doesn't work. Keep getting public browsing.  Even if I select it on taskbar icon, no luck. Don't see the purple glasses or whatever they were.
