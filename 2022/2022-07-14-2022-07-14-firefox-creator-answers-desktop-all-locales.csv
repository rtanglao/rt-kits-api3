You say go to settings, stop using a master password, restart Firefox -- then sometime later, you could start using one again. Wow. Please. There are times when I do not want to enter the master word, even when going to sites for which I saved passwords. For one thing, I can leave my computer for a while, without having to restart Firefox, lest someone has access to all my sites. But the prompt -master password ""required""- comes back again and again. It can be ignored, and I can go to any site and log in (it's not really ""required""), but the prompt comes back, again and again. You've received several complaints about this. Please, why can't you do the simple programing task of an option the user can select, saying ""don't ask again (until you restart Firefox).""   </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>p.s. if you can't manage that, please change the existing prompt to more honestly read: ""Enter your master password. Firefox thinks you're an idiot for not entering your master password, so even though it's not strictly required to sign in to web sites, we're going to ask you again and again, unless you go the trouble of stopping use of master word and then the trouble to restart it. Because that's how Firefox works, and our programmers don't know how, or we don't care enough, to give you the option to suspend this prompt."" </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1519675;,rickskane

I can't sign into Gmail again until at least 15 minutes have passed, usually longer.  In addition, Gmail is extremely slow to open in the morning when I first open Firefox - like security features are being set up that take a long, long time. Google Chrome, on the other hand, immediately opens Gmail for me, though I do get a message saying my connection isn't secure. (Hence my conclusion that security features are slowing Firefox down.)  Is there some fix for this? Because I'm pretty much ready to ditch Firefox and use Chrome.
