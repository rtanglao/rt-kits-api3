When you use that add-on, then press control+T it does NOT highlight or remove the existing address.  This means when I type a search, it sends my contents AND ""moz-extension://....."" which given the uniqueness of that URL is a privacy violation as it seems unique enough to identify me personally. </p><p>The behaviour I expect is the same as the default tab, i.e. I press Ctrl+T and then can type directly into the address bar without any existing content.  </p><p>RANT: I've been using firefox almost 20 years and this is the 1 item that may make me move, not because it's an essential feature but because it shows the total disrespect shown by ignoring and fobbing off of users that obviously want this feature. Removing it was part of a slightly user hostile move to force them to see pocket or other social links. </p><p>Users that want this: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/mk/questions/1162532"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/mk/questions/1162532</a> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/gu-IN/questions/1218838"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/gu-IN/questions/1218838</a> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1073254"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1073254</a> <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/bm/questions/1266777"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/bm/questions/1266777</a> <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/vdy44z/i_cant_get_a_new_tab_to_open_at_google_homepage/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/vdy44z/i_cant_get_a_new_tab_to_open_at_google_homepage/</a> </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ryan80
