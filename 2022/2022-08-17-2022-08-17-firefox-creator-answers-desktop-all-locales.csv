The other suggestion, to “Click the Lock icon in the address bar,” will not work because there is no Lock icon in the address bar with this address.

Firefox (103.0.2) will lock up (not the pc, it will keep working in other apps). It doesn't seem to matter about the number of tabs open, or what sites I'm accessing. It 'seems' random, and closing Firefox and reopening it seems to work for a short while before locking up again. I'm not a tech guru so I don't know exactly what to include here, like logs, or other info. The other issue associated with this issue is, when it locks, and I restart, Firefox does not start the first time I click on it. I have to click on it again and when I do, it will start, but usually (not every time) I get an error message along with the open home page of Firefox. I have to press the (not sure what to call it) windows key and switch to the error to close it. In the past, I've always had a great experience with Firefox, but this is starting to really be annoying! Especially when I have four of five tabs open and have to do a restart. Firefox doesn't seem to realize it's had a problem so the option to re-open tabs with a restart doesn't happen. So I have to use history, which can be troublesome and confusing, to get back to the pages I was reading. I only open multiple tabs most often when I'm researching an issue and want to 'order' the tabs so I read the ones that look like they apply the most  to my research topic. So it really is an annoying issue. So much so, that I have been looking to switch browsers. But I really do not like the large commercial entities not to name names, but I may have to suck it up and install the Big G's browser, the Big C! )^:  (note:  if you respond requesting additional information, please be kind and offer how to obtain the info!

I have to manually add login/password entries via Settings. 2.  Firefox no longer suggests logins/passwords for websites that are already saved. 3.  Firefox no longer offers to generate strong passwords for new websites. 4.  I can sometimes right-click on a login or password field and choose ""Used saved login"". </p><p>See the attached image of the Logins and Passwords settings section. </p><p>Is this the result of some enterprise policies that have been pushed to my PC?
