I've tried all the suggestions; none worked.  Might have same problem in Safari, but never with Chrome.  Also, only started with Firefox 2 days ago.  Refreshing page sometimes helps, usually doesn't.  It's like trying to start a fire with a flint spark.  It either ""goes"" or it doesn't.  Very weird.  Btw, when it goes, link turns purple.  When it fails, link stays blue. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;mac-os-x-1011;firefox-7815;firefox-78150;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",czxcz2

The browser just stops responding. It doesn't crash. Eventually, it will return and behave normally.  </p><p>I tried removing all extensions and closing all open tabs. No change. I'm out of ideas. I suspect it may be trying to synchronize with something it can't find or there's network latency. Task Manager shows it's using a lot of resources. It doesn't do it every time, just often enough to be frustrating.  </p><p>Windows Specifications:  Edition	Windows 11 Pro Version	22H2 Installed on	‎5/‎14/‎2022 OS build	22622.598 Experience	Windows Feature Experience Pack 1000.22634.1000.0 </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",karla10
