I waited a long time before updating from FF 88 to FF 104, concerned that the header and footer issues I previously experienced (and resolved) with FF's print preview interface would recur after updating to a newer FF version. Unfortunately after updating to FF 104 the very same issues recurred. The only solution was to disable FF's print preview interface once again and use the Mac print window instead for all printing tasks. Doing that solved the issue with headers and footers getting cut off pdfs and printed pages, but it did not solve two new issues that began after updating to FF 104, which have persisted through FF 107. </p><p>When printing emails and/or content from webpages, FF has been inserting what I believe is called square box symptom (multiple square boxes in a row with question marks in some of them) instead of the actual text that is on the email or webpage. FF is also printing a long series of dots across the page in certain areas of my emails, which I assume are the very bottom of the letters that are supposed to be there. These issues have never occurred in all my years as a Firefox user until updating to 104. </p><p>Does anyone else have these problems when printing emails and/or webpages? This behavior does not occur with every email or webpage that I print or save as a pdf, but it is prevalent enough that I am having to rely on Safari to create pdfs and/or printouts. </p><p>I've done everything I can think of to resolve these two new issues but the behaviors persist. I am attaching 2 screenshots of a recent order confirmation email that I saved as a pdf to demonstrate what the issues look like. The title of the email is cut off. All you can see is a bunch of tiny dots. The amount of the refund is nothing but dots. The title of each item in the order is a bunch of dots, as is the price on the far right. There is a row of square box symptom between some of the items in the order, followed by more missing titles and prices represented by dots, and more dots for the amount of the discount and subtotal. </p><p>I was going to submit a bug about this but wanted to inquire here first in case there is a solution that I have not tried. Clearing cookies, cache, and running Disk Utility has not resolved this. Any assistance you can give me is greatly appreciated. Thank you. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1014;firefox-1070;,firefox,other,en-US,"",youngjane

I ALWAYS click the ""X"" in the top right corner and then it brings up the ""close xx"" tabs window. Then when I reopen firefox I can click history&gt;restore previous session. Anyways I closed regular firefox.. because a friend of mine wanted to look up something but not interfere with my open tabs so we opened firefox private browsing.. thinking it wouldn't interfere with normal firefox... Yet when I went back to normal firefox and tried to go to history&gt;restore previous session it was grayed out.

I have tabs open for a reason and they should all stay there until I close them. But now they're gone and I wish to have them back. So if someone could let me know how to get a hold of a Mozilla/firefox staff member so they can revert my account that would be awesome. Just to be clear I was able to replicate the issue by having a few tabs open in normal firefox and then closing it.. then opening private browsing firefox and closing it. You should be able to go to history&gt;restore previous session in normal firefox to be able to get your tabs back.. but are unable to do so after opening and closing private browsing firefox.
