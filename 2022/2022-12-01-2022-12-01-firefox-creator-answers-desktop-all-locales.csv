Not that it matters because I can't get in any way..... it just gives me a blank screen tab.

On my tuulen@gmail.com Gmail account I can send a test message to my email.hp15c@gmail.com Gmail account and can receive it there, but for some unknown reason my attempts to have that same secondary email verified have failed by its not appearing on my Gmail account where I have it listed as a secondary email.  I also have spent time in trying find ways to correct this and to contact Google about this, but have not found any such corrective ways and have had no response from Google. </p><p>I thank you.  – Doug </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1070;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",tuulen
