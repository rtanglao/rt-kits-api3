Fin qui tutto ok tutto funziona regolarmente fin quando non mi accorgo di una anomalia che prima non avevo ed è questa: anche impostando la chiave contenuta in about:config avendo impostato di default come browser predefinito firefox sul mio sistema, quando si accede a firefox cliccando su un link esterno, e di conseguenza richiamando l'apertura di firefox in automatico, questo non tiene piu conto delle impostazioni di default precedentemente settate su about:config e quindi mi si ripresenta lo scorrimento del mouse al contrario. Se chiudo firefox e poi lo riapro invece è tutto ok. Spero di essere stato abbastanza chiaro nella spegazione dell'anomalia. Buona Gionata e Grazie. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,customize,it,"",sadale

I'm not sure what exactly it does, but since I've been to it, a profiler icon has been added to the toolbar and I can't find any way to get rid of it completely (only ways are to hide it). If it could be added, there must also be a way to remove it? How can I close it? </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,other,en-US,1538484;,tmitmi

Then while trying to fix the password problem I removed all passwords/ids.  I clicked on the import from a file, selected the file I exported to but nothing happens.. No passwords, no id's. I thought maybe I wouldn't see it in the about:logins screen, so  I tested out three different sites from the export file and no luck on anything.  I was expecting a box to pop up telling me the import was successful or if I was sure I wanted to import all of these passwords but nothing, so even though I get the drop down to import I can't.  Has anyone experienced this problem before or any solutions.   </pre> <p>Thanks in advance </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1538415;,mlorkowski
