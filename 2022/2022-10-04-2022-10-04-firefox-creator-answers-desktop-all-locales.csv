Fin qui tutto ok tutto funziona regolarmente fin quando non mi accorgo di una anomalia che prima non avevo ed è questa: anche impostando la chiave contenuta in about:config avendo impostato di default come browser predefinito firefox sul mio sistema, quando si accede a firefox cliccando su un link esterno, e di conseguenza richiamando l'apertura di firefox in automatico, questo non tiene piu conto delle impostazioni di default precedentemente settate su about:config e quindi mi si ripresenta lo scorrimento del mouse al contrario. Se chiudo firefox e poi lo riapro invece è tutto ok. Spero di essere stato abbastanza chiaro nella spegazione dell'anomalia.
