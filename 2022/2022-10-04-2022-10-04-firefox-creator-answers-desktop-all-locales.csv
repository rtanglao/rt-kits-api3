Then while trying to fix the password problem I removed all passwords/ids.  I clicked on the import from a file, selected the file I exported to but nothing happens.. No passwords, no id's. I thought maybe I wouldn't see it in the about:logins screen, so  I tested out three different sites from the export file and no luck on anything.  I was expecting a box to pop up telling me the import was successful or if I was sure I wanted to import all of these passwords but nothing, so even though I get the drop down to import I can't.  Has anyone experienced this problem before or any solutions.   </pre> <p>Thanks in advance </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1538415;,mlorkowski
