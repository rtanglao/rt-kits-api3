However, when I installed Firefox I started getting this exact error message on all twitch streams: ""Your browser encountered an error while decoding the video. (Error #3000):. Keep in mind I have tried most if not every ""fix"" I've found. I've disabled the hardware acceleration, cleared cookies and cache, I've disabled the extensions, I've tried Incognito mode, I do not have a third-party anti-virus and I do not have a VPN. This works on all other browsers and it used to work on Firefox before I wiped my PC, so that I can install Windows again. I really do not want to use a different browser, I love everything about Firefox right now.  </p><p>Any suggestions will do, thank you very much. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1070;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1549234;,ae.dimitar

One of them I am currently using and the other I sold so what I did was I logged out of firefox and did not press the check box that asked if I wanted to delete data. I believe this laptop was synced to my fire fox account. </p><p>After logging out of firefox and backing up all my personal files I used windows reset to reset my pc and to completely wipe the laptop of my information so I can ship it out to the buyer. With that said I was wondering if I am able to obtain the tabs from my time using the laptop. When I go to firefox sync I don't see the tabs I had open from my old laptop. </p>,desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1070;,firefox,sync,en-US,1549216;,Dariel64

So it makes sense why Im getting the ""new sign-in"" email twice but I dont understand why I'm getting it twice to both emails. All sign ins come from the same IP address but not mine (I use a VPN) but 2 will have a slighty different time (2-3 minutes) than the other 2. I also have 2 factor authentication set up with Microsoft authenticatior so is the double authentication what might be causing the double emails?
