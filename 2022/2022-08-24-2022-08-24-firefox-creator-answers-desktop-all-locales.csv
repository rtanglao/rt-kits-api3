Il profilo risulta mancante o non accessibile</em>"".  Il profilo è chiaramente mancante poiché nel disco non c'è ancora nulla.

For years I have been able to access youtube by simply typing the letter y and duckduckgo just by typing in d because address bar would show my saved bookmarks at the top and allow me to click the full link. Now it doens't show them at all, even if i type in <a href=""http://youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com</a> firefox no longer suggests my <a href=""http://www.youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.youtube.com</a> bookmark. Not a single time in about a decade of using this platform have I needed to use * to get m bookmarks to show but now I need to do both * and type the full link before the address bar realizes that I already have the destination bookmarked. </p><p>Then there was a problem with uploads, I use <a href=""http://speedtest.net"" rel=""nofollow"">speedtest.net</a> to keep an eye on my speed and for some reason, specific to firefox alone it cannot upload, every test on every server, with and without vpn gives an error about uploading. Despite the settings in my vpn client, my internet options, firefox's own settings, firewall and my router all being set to allow the traffic. </p><p>It also uses an absurd amount of RAM. I have 32gb, at the time of writing this I have one window with 3 tabs open and firefox alone is using 64% of my RAM. This is less of a bug and more of a poor design/optimization choice ( I think) because with each passing update for a long time now firefox has become more and more needlessly resource tasking, so much so that it now requires more from my system than chrome and somehow even taxes my system more than most modern triple a games. </p><p>I tried running it in ""safe mode"" did nothing. I have since done a completely fresh install and even before having any add ons or changing any of the ""about:config"" settings the same problems still cropped up. Is anyone else experiencing this? I tend to stick with firefox because its what I have always known but the amount of problems I have had with numerous versions of firefox over the past 6 months alone heavily outnumbers the problems I have had with my experience with chrome,brave,safari,inernet explorer and puffin combined.  Does anyone have any suggestions other than losing all of my data and add ons, doing a fresh install every 20 odd days and waiting for it to inevitably break again? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,other,en-US,"",howamo

The website <a href=""https://www.arkadium.com/free-online-games/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.arkadium.com/free-online-games/</a> is a site I enjoy playing on.  For two of my computers, the site works great.  For the one I'm currently on, though, when the video box appears (square black rectangle) it has the wheel of doom going and going for, literally, hours.  The other systems sees the video and either plays an ad or not (depending if the site currently has ads available).  Either way, after about 20 seconds the video page shows that the games will start is so many seconds.  The problem computer does everything but finish and move on.  No way to close that screen except to just close it out.  I've checked the settings I can find that might apply but changing the settings does nothing new.  I hope this isn't confusing.  It's been a long day.  I'd just like to play those games with this laptop.
