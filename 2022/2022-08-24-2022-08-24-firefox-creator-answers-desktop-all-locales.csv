When I went back to the one that had been playing, it was now a black screen and the endless loading circle. </p><p>There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to which videos will actually play and which will not, other than I've noticed it happen a bit more frequently on videos uploaded in the past twenty four hours. </p><p>I've uninstalled the browser and reinstalled it, cleared my cookies and cache, made sure firefox is up to date, everything I can think of doing.

But Firefox uses always the IPv4 connection when I open a website. When I open the same website in MS Edge, the IPv6 connection is used. </p><p>I've captured the network traffic during opening a website in Firefox, which is reachable over IPv4 and IPv6. First I see two DNS queries (A and AAAA) for the domain name. Both responses containing the correct IP address, and they arrive nearly at the same time at the client. Next I can see the TCP handshake. But it's send between the IPv4 address only. No IPv6 connection was attempted.  </p><p>When I run the IPv6 test at <a href=""https://test-ipv6.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://test-ipv6.com</a>, the IPv6 resuls are nearly fine. Only the web browser test says ""Your browser has real working IPv6 address - but is avoiding using it."" </p><p>When I run the same test in MS Edge, all tests are fine.  </p><p>So it seems that this is not a OS or network issue. It affects Firefox only. </p><p>What I've already tried: </p> <ul><li> Disabled all extensions </li><li> Created a new profile </li><li> Used the IPv6 address of the website instead of the FQDN -&gt; Works fine. </li><li> Checked DNS cache of Firefox (about:networking).

I have had a *lot* of issues trying to sync between these two. I keep getting spurious old data (bookmarks etc), regardless of what I do. I have tried this:  Both computers logged out from Sync. On the computer I want to keep the current settings on and send to other computer - set all bookmarks, logins etc as wanted - log in to Sync and sync - log out of sync. On second computer which I want to be identical to first one, log in to sync - wait a while - log out of sync.  This sort of works, but there are always extra items and/or some items that didn't seem to sync correctly.  There are always extra bookmarks that neither computer started with, and, duplicated entries in passwords and login data. </p><p>Question 1: how do I 'clear out' all data currently held by Sync so I can start fresh? Question 2: if the answer to question 1 is to delete firefox account and recreate, then, would the above procedure work correctly without extra's and duplicates? </p><p>I feel the term 'Sync' is misused in firefox when spurious old data not on either machine is introduced to both when syncing. In my opinion, a better way to achieve everything would be to have an option to 'clear and copy' from this computer so that on any other computer, you can be sure of identical data after sync. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1040;,firefox,customize,en-US,1528987;1528992;,user156808893380193994673081419355516969228

Not a single time in about a decade of using this platform have I needed to use * to get m bookmarks to show but now I need to do both * and type the full link before the address bar realizes that I already have the destination bookmarked. </p><p>Then there was a problem with uploads, I use <a href=""http://speedtest.net"" rel=""nofollow"">speedtest.net</a> to keep an eye on my speed and for some reason, specific to firefox alone it cannot upload, every test on every server, with and without vpn gives an error about uploading.

I have 32gb, at the time of writing this I have one window with 3 tabs open and firefox alone is using 64% of my RAM. This is less of a bug and more of a poor design/optimization choice ( I think) because with each passing update for a long time now firefox has become more and more needlessly resource tasking, so much so that it now requires more from my system than chrome and somehow even taxes my system more than most modern triple a games. </p><p>I tried running it in ""safe mode"" did nothing. I have since done a completely fresh install and even before having any add ons or changing any of the ""about:config"" settings the same problems still cropped up. Is anyone else experiencing this?

The website <a href=""https://www.arkadium.com/free-online-games/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.arkadium.com/free-online-games/</a> is a site I enjoy playing on.  For two of my computers, the site works great.  For the one I'm currently on, though, when the video box appears (square black rectangle) it has the wheel of doom going and going for, literally, hours.  The other systems sees the video and either plays an ad or not (depending if the site currently has ads available).  Either way, after about 20 seconds the video page shows that the games will start is so many seconds.  The problem computer does everything but finish and move on.  No way to close that screen except to just close it out.  I've checked the settings I can find that might apply but changing the settings does nothing new.  I hope this isn't confusing.  It's been a long day.  I'd just like to play those games with this laptop.  The attached screen shot is what I see after trying to open the site. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1528948;,haiweepp1

I re-installed Firefox but it deleted my bookmarks. What do I have to do to get them back? Fortunately I did a backup on my computer before re-installing Firefox. Is there some other way to get them back other than to restore the backup? Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Unfortunately, this changed the login settings and now when I go to my Gmail, Minds, mewe or other accounts is auto signs me in.   I have gone into to settings and unchecked the auto fill and Ask to save logins and passwords for websites.  That did nothing.  I do not want any pages to auto login but I would like to be able to select a user name an password when I go to enter a webpage that requires one.   Having the Auto login is a hug security issue for me.

(The windows 10 computer has no problem.) I have searched for any settings that would show blocked web sites and cannot find any settings / listing of blocked web site. As the win11 is my primary computer, this is VERY annoying. Any help will be greatly appreciated.

The Firefox on my laptop is just updated to 104.0 and I realised that I can no longer drag the slider of the scrollbar on a webpage with the touch screen of my laptop.
