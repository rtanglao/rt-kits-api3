But Firefox uses always the IPv4 connection when I open a website. When I open the same website in MS Edge, the IPv6 connection is used. </p><p>I've captured the network traffic during opening a website in Firefox, which is reachable over IPv4 and IPv6. First I see two DNS queries (A and AAAA) for the domain name. Both responses containing the correct IP address, and they arrive nearly at the same time at the client. Next I can see the TCP handshake. But it's send between the IPv4 address only. No IPv6 connection was attempted.  </p><p>When I run the IPv6 test at <a href=""https://test-ipv6.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://test-ipv6.com</a>, the IPv6 resuls are nearly fine. Only the web browser test says ""Your browser has real working IPv6 address - but is avoiding using it."" </p><p>When I run the same test in MS Edge, all tests are fine.  </p><p>So it seems that this is not a OS or network issue. It affects Firefox only. </p><p>What I've already tried: </p> <ul><li> Disabled all extensions </li><li> Created a new profile </li><li> Used the IPv6 address of the website instead of the FQDN -&gt; Works fine. </li><li> Checked DNS cache of Firefox (about:networking). It contains the IPv4 and IPv6 addresses of the requested websites </li></ul> <p>I guess that Firefox prefers the A record for some reason. But I've no idea why.

I have had a *lot* of issues trying to sync between these two. I keep getting spurious old data (bookmarks etc), regardless of what I do. I have tried this:  Both computers logged out from Sync. On the computer I want to keep the current settings on and send to other computer - set all bookmarks, logins etc as wanted - log in to Sync and sync - log out of sync. On second computer which I want to be identical to first one, log in to sync - wait a while - log out of sync.  This sort of works, but there are always extra items and/or some items that didn't seem to sync correctly.  There are always extra bookmarks that neither computer started with, and, duplicated entries in passwords and login data. </p><p>Question 1: how do I 'clear out' all data currently held by Sync so I can start fresh? Question 2: if the answer to question 1 is to delete firefox account and recreate, then, would the above procedure work correctly without extra's and duplicates? </p><p>I feel the term 'Sync' is misused in firefox when spurious old data not on either machine is introduced to both when syncing. In my opinion, a better way to achieve everything would be to have an option to 'clear and copy' from this computer so that on any other computer, you can be sure of identical data after sync. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1040;,firefox,customize,en-US,1528987;1528992;,user156808893380193994673081419355516969228

For years I have been able to access youtube by simply typing the letter y and duckduckgo just by typing in d because address bar would show my saved bookmarks at the top and allow me to click the full link. Now it doens't show them at all, even if i type in <a href=""http://youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com</a> firefox no longer suggests my <a href=""http://www.youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.youtube.com</a> bookmark. Not a single time in about a decade of using this platform have I needed to use * to get m bookmarks to show but now I need to do both * and type the full link before the address bar realizes that I already have the destination bookmarked. </p><p>Then there was a problem with uploads, I use <a href=""http://speedtest.net"" rel=""nofollow"">speedtest.net</a> to keep an eye on my speed and for some reason, specific to firefox alone it cannot upload, every test on every server, with and without vpn gives an error about uploading. Despite the settings in my vpn client, my internet options, firefox's own settings, firewall and my router all being set to allow the traffic. </p><p>It also uses an absurd amount of RAM. I have 32gb, at the time of writing this I have one window with 3 tabs open and firefox alone is using 64% of my RAM. This is less of a bug and more of a poor design/optimization choice ( I think) because with each passing update for a long time now firefox has become more and more needlessly resource tasking, so much so that it now requires more from my system than chrome and somehow even taxes my system more than most modern triple a games. </p><p>I tried running it in ""safe mode"" did nothing. I have since done a completely fresh install and even before having any add ons or changing any of the ""about:config"" settings the same problems still cropped up. Is anyone else experiencing this? I tend to stick with firefox because its what I have always known but the amount of problems I have had with numerous versions of firefox over the past 6 months alone heavily outnumbers the problems I have had with my experience with chrome,brave,safari,inernet explorer and puffin combined.  Does anyone have any suggestions other than losing all of my data and add ons, doing a fresh install every 20 odd days and waiting for it to inevitably break again? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,other,en-US,"",howamo

The Firefox on my laptop is just updated to 104.0 and I realised that I can no longer drag the slider of the scrollbar on a webpage with the touch screen of my laptop. I can still drag the sliders of the History sidebar and bookmark library though. Is this change intended? Or is my Firefox profile just messed up after the update? </p><p>Thank you. </p>,desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1040;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",beterc
