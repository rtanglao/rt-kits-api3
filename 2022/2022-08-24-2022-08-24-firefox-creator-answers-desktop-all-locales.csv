The website <a href=""https://www.arkadium.com/free-online-games/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.arkadium.com/free-online-games/</a> is a site I enjoy playing on.  For two of my computers, the site works great.  For the one I'm currently on, though, when the video box appears (square black rectangle) it has the wheel of doom going and going for, literally, hours.  The other systems sees the video and either plays an ad or not (depending if the site currently has ads available).  Either way, after about 20 seconds the video page shows that the games will start is so many seconds.  The problem computer does everything but finish and move on.  No way to close that screen except to just close it out.  I've checked the settings I can find that might apply but changing the settings does nothing new.  I hope this isn't confusing.  It's been a long day.  I'd just like to play those games with this laptop.  The attached screen shot is what I see after trying to open the site. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1528948;,haiweepp1

Now, whenever I try to open that site (via link or direct entry) the tab closes immediately.  From a link, I can see the tab open then close, from direct input it just closes when I hit enter. (The windows 10 computer has no problem.) I have searched for any settings that would show blocked web sites and cannot find any settings / listing of blocked web site. As the win11 is my primary computer, this is VERY annoying. Any help will be greatly appreciated.
