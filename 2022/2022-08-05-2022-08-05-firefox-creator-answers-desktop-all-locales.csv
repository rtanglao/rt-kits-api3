I have said it before and i will say it again, Mozilla claims to stand for Privacy (maybe that was true in the past at some point) while Google is tracking Billions of Human beings 24/7 as they use Google as their Android Operating System, that can be considered very much anti-privacy. (Sadly majority of people either don't care or are to silly to install a different OS on their Phone). </p><p>Clearly this looks like a conflict of interest, one company want's privacy while the other one makes their money with tracking human beings and selling their data and then giving a part of that money to mozilla for using google as the default search engine in firefox. </p><p>If knownledge is power then how much power does google have? How much do they know about you? Your contacts, location, online searches and history, and so on... I seriously think people should quit google immediately, what this company is doing is literally criminal, unless ofcourse people are once again silly enough to let it happen. </p><p>Firefox says on it's website ""At Mozilla, we believe that privacy is fundamental to a healthy internet."" If true why do you BY DEFAULT have telemetry ENABLED and why do you BY DEFAULT use GOOGLE as search engine?? Something is obviously not right here. What is also very interesting is that this site <a href=""http://support.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">support.mozilla.org</a> is connected to <a href=""http://www.google-analytics.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.google-analytics.com</a> and to <a href=""http://www.googletagmanager.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.googletagmanager.com</a> Im guessing this basically means when i use the mozilla support site or login with my account, google is also gathering data about me. </p><p>Google has become the cancer of the internet, way to many sites have it embed aswell as facebook. Shame on all those greedy people who allow this massive privacy invasion just for their own profit. But honestly at the same time, can you really blame them? After all the people who allow this to happen are responsible aswell, this is just disgusting. I woonder if the whole world would like to end up like china, because if not then what in the universe is wrong with people? Wakeup! Delete Google Delete Facebook Delete Tiktok and eventually your brain might be able to function again, install a privacy operatingsystem like lineageos or grapheneos and don't touch any anti privacy app ever again, is it so hard?? Was totally simple for me. </p> <h1 id=""w_"">=</h1> <pre>   Interaction data: Firefox sends data about your interactions with Firefox to us (such as number of open tabs and windows; number of webpages visited; number and type of installed Firefox Add-ons; and session length) and Firefox features offered by Mozilla or our partners (such as interaction with Firefox search features and search partner referrals). </pre> <pre>   Technical data: Firefox sends data about your Firefox version and language; device operating system and hardware configuration; memory, basic information about crashes and errors; outcome of automated processes like updates, safebrowsing, and activation to us. When Firefox sends data to us, your IP address is temporarily collected as part of our server logs. </pre> <h1 id=""w__2"">=</h1> <p>As a final notice, i don't beleve that this is everything mozilla collects, surely your tight parnership with google analytics is able to identify every single firefox profile and connect it to the person using it. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Firefox_Beginner
