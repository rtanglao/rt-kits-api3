A few versions ago (I don't remember the correct version), I started noticing some sites have broken font (defaulting the base font as used font is not available) and/or icons not being displayed. </p><p>I started investigating my extensions (I'm using ublock origin) and standard protection from firefox. Inside the console and found out that fonts (in my example at least) are being block by CORS policy. </p><p>E.g: ""Blocking of a cross-origin request: the ""Same Origin"" policy does not allow viewing the remote resource located at <a href=""https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/materialicons/v135/flUhRq6tzZclQEJ-Vdg-IuiaDsNc"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/materialicons/v135/flUhRq6tzZclQEJ-Vdg-IuiaDsNc</a> .woff2. Reason: CORS request failed. Status code: (null)."" on website ""<a href=""https://materializecss.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://materializecss.com/</a>"" </p><p>That is not breaking the browser but is kinda annoying. How can I do to allow fonts to be downloaded and used ? I've checked with other browsers (chrome/chrome-like/safari) and they work as excepected. </p><p>Thanks ! </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",datahearth

I have fixed the individual pages, but the issue now is the size of the toolbars (tabs/middle bar/web addressEtc/Bookmarks) and my weather are huge and I can't find where to re-size them. My weather is off the screen for the 5 day view and the one day view is too high so it gets cut off. This basically makes this add-on useless now. Please help me to be able to view the top toolbar and my weather properly again &lt;3 Thank you! </p><p>This has never happened before after all the years I've been using Firefox </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,other,en-US,1524947;1524948;,Dru

When the image is shrunk down to 16px (CSS type pixels), because of the border area, the area for the working image is only 12px square. </li><li> Shrinking a 180x180 pixel PNG image down to 16px (or 32px for high-resolution displays) does lose quite a bit of detail. Most SVG favicons are designed to work well at 16 and 32px. </li></ul> <p>For sites that only have an ICO favicon, Firefox will use that image for the bookmark and history. (Firefox also seems to continue to use the ICO favicon if a site was previously bookmarked.) </p><p>Safari only uses ICO favicons (not (SVG)<a href=""https://caniuse.com/link-icon-svg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://caniuse.com/link-icon-svg</a>), so designers do need to be sure their ICO designs work with light and dark backgrounds (Apple’s logo is a #888888 gray, so is visible against a light or dark background, although not ideal). </p><p>Chrome and Edge use SVG favicons for the tab, history, and bookmarks, <em>and</em>, if the user switches their configuration, the icons on the bookmark bar can be switched from light to dark or vis-versa by refreshing the page. (Chrome seems to always use the initial light or dark version when clicking into the address bar). </p><p>This is probably how Firefox is intended to work, but it does seem to be a less-than-desirable solution. If it’s too complicated to use the SVG favicon for the bookmark icon (the way Chromium based browsers do), then would it be possible to only use the ICO favicon for the tab icon and the bookmark (like Safari and Internet Explorer)? Repurposing the apple-touch-icon doesn’t seem like a good solution. </p><p>Note: I did try changing the order of the links, putting the apple-touch-icon first instead of last, but it didn’t make any difference. </p><p>The code for icons for my site is: </p><p>`&lt;link rel=""icon"" href=""favicon.ico?v=2"" sizes=""any""&gt;` `&lt;link rel=""icon"" href=""favicon.svg?v=2"" type=""image/svg+xml""&gt;` `&lt;link rel=""apple-touch-icon"" href=""sbf-apple-touch-icon.png""&gt;` `&lt;link rel=""manifest"" href=""manifest.json""&gt;` </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",rdebourke

I have said it before and i will say it again, Mozilla claims to stand for Privacy (maybe that was true in the past at some point) while Google is tracking Billions of Human beings 24/7 as they use Google as their Android Operating System, that can be considered very much anti-privacy. (Sadly majority of people either don't care or are to silly to install a different OS on their Phone). </p><p>Clearly this looks like a conflict of interest, one company want's privacy while the other one makes their money with tracking human beings and selling their data and then giving a part of that money to mozilla for using google as the default search engine in firefox. </p><p>If knownledge is power then how much power does google have? How much do they know about you? Your contacts, location, online searches and history, and so on... I seriously think people should quit google immediately, what this company is doing is literally criminal, unless ofcourse people are once again silly enough to let it happen. </p><p>Firefox says on it's website ""At Mozilla, we believe that privacy is fundamental to a healthy internet."" If true why do you BY DEFAULT have telemetry ENABLED and why do you BY DEFAULT use GOOGLE as search engine?? Something is obviously not right here. What is also very interesting is that this site <a href=""http://support.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">support.mozilla.org</a> is connected to <a href=""http://www.google-analytics.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.google-analytics.com</a> and to <a href=""http://www.googletagmanager.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.googletagmanager.com</a> Im guessing this basically means when i use the mozilla support site or login with my account, google is also gathering data about me. </p><p>Google has become the cancer of the internet, way to many sites have it embed aswell as facebook. Shame on all those greedy people who allow this massive privacy invasion just for their own profit. But honestly at the same time, can you really blame them? After all the people who allow this to happen are responsible aswell, this is just disgusting. I woonder if the whole world would like to end up like china, because if not then what in the universe is wrong with people? Wakeup! Delete Google Delete Facebook Delete Tiktok and eventually your brain might be able to function again, install a privacy operatingsystem like lineageos or grapheneos and don't touch any anti privacy app ever again, is it so hard??
