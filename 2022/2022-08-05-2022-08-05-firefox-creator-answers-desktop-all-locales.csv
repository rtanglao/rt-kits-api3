The headline and body text appears normally, but the lead graphic or photo is just a blurry smear, the Comments button does nothing, comments do not load at all, the Section button doesn't work, the Sign In button doesn't work, and the magnifying-glass Search function doesn't work correctly). Links at the bottom of the page to other articles do lead to the articles themselves (which are also displayed as described above), but the links, normally shown as an image with a headline, just appear as a gray rectangle. Article display worked normally in 102.0.1 and works normally in Chrome. Articles from the New York Times and a couple of other randomly selected periodicals that I read all work normally in 103.0.1. </p><p>jscher2000, a Discussions collaborator, suggested that I toggle the Reader View switch. When I do that, the article text displays fine but there are no photos or graphics. In-article links (to sources, other articles, etc.) do work; links to other Washington Post articles produce the same result (very blurry lead photo, no photos at all in the body of the article, Sign In, Section and Comments buttons not working, etc.).  </p><p>Because the Sign In button on the newly opened article does not work, I can't verify that I am indeed logged in, even though I am logged in on the main <a href=""http://washingtonpost.com"" rel=""nofollow"">washingtonpost.com</a> page.  </p><p>jscher2000 also suggested that ""One possible reason for the content to look blurred on a news site would be if one of your add-ons removed a forced-subscription overlay without cleaning up fully. However, if you are already a subscriber, then that would be unlikely (assuming you are signed in)."" I don't quite know what to do about this -- I don't know what the forced-subscription overlay is or where I'd find it or what to do about it. I do have several add-ons installed, mostly to block ads and trackers and promote security. Also, as I mention, I can't verify whether I am still signed in when I open a new article because the new article displays a non-working Sign In button even though I'm signed in on the main page. So I'm kind of stuck on that one.  </p><p>Everything I describe here was not a problem in FF102.0.1 -- things worked fine. After upgrading to FF103 and finding the problems, I went backward and reinstalled FF102, and after some fumbling around got my old profile installed. Everything worked normally.  And everything works normally with the same Web sites and pages in Chrome.  </p><p>Thanks for any light you can shed on this. In the meantime, I'll go back to FF102.0.1 and stand by for further developments. </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1014;website-breakages;firefox-1030;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",pts2

Mnoho let používám internetové bankovnictví – naprosto bez problému. Mám Windows 7, 64b, používám váš prohlížeč  Firefox (Mozilla). Naposled bez problémů jsem byla v intern. bankovnictví 22.7. t.r. Poté 1.8. a objevily se problémy(myslím, že v té době jste upgradovali): Po přihlášení se stránka otevřela klasicky, mohla jsem si prohlížet své učty. Když jsem chtěla stáhnout do PC výpis, stránka zmizela, obrazovka začla blikat – chvíli černá a chvíli bílá. Dole na líště se objevila hláška s vykřičníkem: „Ovladač zobrazení Intel Graphics Accelarator Drivers for Wind.8(R) přestal odpovídat a byl úspěšně obnoven“. Nešlo ale nic dělat (např. ukončit), prostě mými slovy počítač zamrzl, nešla ani myš. Musela jsem resetovat. Znovu jsem se na stránku přihlásila, jenom se podívala na účet a zkusila kviknout na „ukončit“ (odejít). Naprosto stejný problém a nutnost resetování. Vyzkoušela jsem to znovu po třetí, tentokrát jsem kvikla na volbu Nastavení, změna názvu účtu – poté opět stejný problém. Vyzkoušela jsem prohlížeč Google Chrome a vše funguje, jak jsem byla zvyklá.. S počítačem jsem nic nedělala, jsem totiž 70letá uživatelka internetu a el. bank. a odborným věcem naprosto nerozumím. Pokud budete tak laskavi a odpovíte mi, případně poradíte, budu velmi ráda, na váš prohlížeč jsem si zvykla (používám ho mnoho a mnoho let, nikdy nebyly problémy) ale, prosím, nepoužívejte odborná slova.  Jít na nějaké vaše „fórum“ je pro mne bezpředmětné, nerozumím tomu, co kdo píše.

When the image is shrunk down to 16px (CSS type pixels), because of the border area, the area for the working image is only 12px square. </li><li> Shrinking a 180x180 pixel PNG image down to 16px (or 32px for high-resolution displays) does lose quite a bit of detail. Most SVG favicons are designed to work well at 16 and 32px. </li></ul> <p>For sites that only have an ICO favicon, Firefox will use that image for the bookmark and history. (Firefox also seems to continue to use the ICO favicon if a site was previously bookmarked.) </p><p>Safari only uses ICO favicons (not (SVG)<a href=""https://caniuse.com/link-icon-svg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://caniuse.com/link-icon-svg</a>), so designers do need to be sure their ICO designs work with light and dark backgrounds (Apple’s logo is a #888888 gray, so is visible against a light or dark background, although not ideal). </p><p>Chrome and Edge use SVG favicons for the tab, history, and bookmarks, <em>and</em>, if the user switches their configuration, the icons on the bookmark bar can be switched from light to dark or vis-versa by refreshing the page. (Chrome seems to always use the initial light or dark version when clicking into the address bar). </p><p>This is probably how Firefox is intended to work, but it does seem to be a less-than-desirable solution. If it’s too complicated to use the SVG favicon for the bookmark icon (the way Chromium based browsers do), then would it be possible to only use the ICO favicon for the tab icon and the bookmark (like Safari and Internet Explorer)? Repurposing the apple-touch-icon doesn’t seem like a good solution. </p><p>Note: I did try changing the order of the links, putting the apple-touch-icon first instead of last, but it didn’t make any difference. </p><p>The code for icons for my site is: </p><p>`&lt;link rel=""icon"" href=""favicon.ico?v=2"" sizes=""any""&gt;` `&lt;link rel=""icon"" href=""favicon.svg?v=2"" type=""image/svg+xml""&gt;` `&lt;link rel=""apple-touch-icon"" href=""sbf-apple-touch-icon.png""&gt;` `&lt;link rel=""manifest"" href=""manifest.json""&gt;` </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",rdebourke

I have said it before and i will say it again, Mozilla claims to stand for Privacy (maybe that was true in the past at some point) while Google is tracking Billions of Human beings 24/7 as they use Google as their Android Operating System, that can be considered very much anti-privacy. (Sadly majority of people either don't care or are to silly to install a different OS on their Phone). </p><p>Clearly this looks like a conflict of interest, one company want's privacy while the other one makes their money with tracking human beings and selling their data and then giving a part of that money to mozilla for using google as the default search engine in firefox. </p><p>If knownledge is power then how much power does google have? How much do they know about you? Your contacts, location, online searches and history, and so on... I seriously think people should quit google immediately, what this company is doing is literally criminal, unless ofcourse people are once again silly enough to let it happen. </p><p>Firefox says on it's website ""At Mozilla, we believe that privacy is fundamental to a healthy internet."" If true why do you BY DEFAULT have telemetry ENABLED and why do you BY DEFAULT use GOOGLE as search engine?? Something is obviously not right here. What is also very interesting is that this site <a href=""http://support.mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">support.mozilla.org</a> is connected to <a href=""http://www.google-analytics.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.google-analytics.com</a> and to <a href=""http://www.googletagmanager.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.googletagmanager.com</a> Im guessing this basically means when i use the mozilla support site or login with my account, google is also gathering data about me. </p><p>Google has become the cancer of the internet, way to many sites have it embed aswell as facebook. Shame on all those greedy people who allow this massive privacy invasion just for their own profit. But honestly at the same time, can you really blame them? After all the people who allow this to happen are responsible aswell, this is just disgusting. I woonder if the whole world would like to end up like china, because if not then what in the universe is wrong with people? Wakeup! Delete Google Delete Facebook Delete Tiktok and eventually your brain might be able to function again, install a privacy operatingsystem like lineageos or grapheneos and don't touch any anti privacy app ever again, is it so hard?? Was totally simple for me. </p> <h1 id=""w_"">=</h1> <pre>   Interaction data: Firefox sends data about your interactions with Firefox to us (such as number of open tabs and windows; number of webpages visited; number and type of installed Firefox Add-ons; and session length) and Firefox features offered by Mozilla or our partners (such as interaction with Firefox search features and search partner referrals). </pre> <pre>   Technical data: Firefox sends data about your Firefox version and language; device operating system and hardware configuration; memory, basic information about crashes and errors; outcome of automated processes like updates, safebrowsing, and activation to us.
