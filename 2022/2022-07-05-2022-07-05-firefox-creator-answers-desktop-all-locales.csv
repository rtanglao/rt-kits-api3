The issue listed below happens when using both Mozilla and Google Chrome browsers. Here's my story... I'm not very savvy at purchasing tickets through second-party websites. My troubles may have begun when I forwarded the initial email to my daughter to claim the ticket barcodes; she's the person I purchased the tickets for as a gift.  </p> <ul><li> She did try to collect the tickets through my forwarded email and was directed to the original seller's website. I did list her email address as the owner of the tickets. She did receive an email asking if she would like to finish the purchase. </li><li> As my daughter was reading this email, I was trying to pay for the tickets through PayPal, but the transaction did not go through as I had expected.  </li><li> I then went back to <a href=""http://TicketNetwork.com"" rel=""nofollow"">TicketNetwork.com</a> and canceled the tickets. This time, I used my email address as the address to send the ticketing information. </li><li> Then, I returned to <a href=""http://TicketNetwork.com"" rel=""nofollow"">TicketNetwork.com</a> and repurchased the same group of tickets using my PayPal account. This time after checking PayPal, the transaction did go through. </li></ul> <p>While trying to purchase concert tickets through <a href=""http://TicketNetwork.com"" rel=""nofollow"">TicketNetwork.com</a> and then being directed to <a href=""http://Ticketmaster.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Ticketmaster.com</a>, and somewhere while trying to retrieve three tickets at <a href=""http://Ticketmaster.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Ticketmaster.com</a>, this is what pops up on the screen: ""Pardon the Interruption As you were browsing, something about your browser made us think you were a bot.

I did not find Ghostery or NoScript installed within the system. </p><p>A friend suggested that my IP address has been tagged as a bot because of the several attempts to retrieve the concert tickets through my daughter's and my email address. Another red flag may have been that both of us attempted to claim the tickets at <a href=""http://TicketNetwork.com"" rel=""nofollow"">TicketNetwork.com</a> and followed <a href=""http://Ticketmaster.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Ticketmaster.com</a> within a relatively short period. </p><p>My tale has ended, to the best of my recollection.

If I don't do anything for about three seconds, the dialog closes and the bookmark is saved to a place where I most likely don't want it to be saved. Is there a way to get rid of the three second time limit? Thanks! </p><p>It's not necessary to read  further to answer my question. Bellow I'm going to give some criticism and express  frustration about this new feature (or is it a bug?). The criticism is not directed towards the nice people here who give support to users who have problems.  </p><p>I understand that developers get new ideas and want to put them into practice, but if you change an often used behaviour like this, I don't think it's user friendly to just change the behaviour without asking the user if he want's that behaviour. Personally I don't see how the automatically disappearing dialog helps me (it's very easy to click Esc if I change my mind about bookmarking a page), but I keep experiencing how it makes my browsing experience worse, as I often pause for a moment for example to think what name I'm going to give for the bookmark, or where am I going to place it. </p><p>In practice this change has wasted at least an hour of my time (to find an explanation and (in vain) a solution to fix the behaviour), made me annoyed, and based on the comments here and other places, made quite a few other people annoyed too.  </p><p>Please, when you change the behaviour of Firefox in the future, before changing the behaviour for an individual user, ask him first if he even wants the change. For example show him a dialog where he is told that ""we have this new feature where your familiar dialog keeps disappearing every three seconds for no reason so that you get the pleasure of invoking it again...and again...and again. If you want to have that feature, check the box on the left"". </p>",linux;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-1020;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1517118;1517123;,ari.torhamo
