The windows 10 upgrade saved my windows 8.1 files. I installed firefox on windows 10. I deleted the files created by the install in the folder 'profiles'. When I copy my old firefox profile contents into that firefox profile folder, firefox does not pickup my bookmarks and extensions as I had hoped. Is it possible to get firefox to recognize my old profile contents? Thanks, Doug </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",literski

Is it possible to make it so that ""Logins & Passwords"" are by default sorted by last modification, rather than alphabetical order or security notification? Thanks","<p>I resort to ""Logins &amp; Passwords"" fairly often and would like my old default setting back: before one of the recent updates, I used to simply find my choice, that is ""sort by last modification"", coherently conserved upon each launch. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1020;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",jacopissimo

The problem is, thanks to this little option I can't use alt + numpad to write ASCII characters anymore, and since that is a big part of my day-to-day activities, I prefer just to turn of the navigation so I can write the ASCII characters like I'm used to. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,customize,es,"",juanfelipejaramillolosada

It might seem important to you, but it's super annoying, especially when your automatic updates don't work well anymore. I keep getting a ""updates are available"" pop-up at the menu bar, and then clicking on it brings me to the download page. I have to download and install every time you bring in a minor update! Also, the school I work in works behind a firewall. Your descriptions and updates always fail their safety precautions, and I have to get the administrator to unlock every time for minor updates! Please organize your updates a little more better. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1020;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",jennychan75
