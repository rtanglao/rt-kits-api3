I have 5 profiles on this particular computer with no previous issues. I decided to create another profile to be used for some test work and when I created it I then launched it and opened a few tabs to make sure it worked then closed. I planned on copying the profile files from another profile into this one so I went to the profile folder - /home/user/.mozilla/firefox/profile.names </p><p>Once there I saw my other profiles but could not locate this one so I went back to an open browser where I had the about:profiles page open and decided to delete that new profile and start over I figured maybe I accidentally saved it to a different directory. I hit remove it and it gave me the box asking if I wanted to remove files I chose yes I then go back to - /home/user/.mozilla/firefox but folder firefox was gone with all of my profiles all that was left in .mozilla was -  /home/user/.mozilla/extensions and - /home/user/.mozilla/systemextensionsdev. Both of these folders - “extensions” as well as “systemextensionsdev” are empty. I go to the local directory for each profile and the data is still there for each of the profiles - /home/user/.cache/mozilla/firefox/<a href=""http://profile.name"" rel=""nofollow"">profile.name</a>.  </p><p>The recycle bin is empty. A system-wide search for the profiles comes up with just the ones in the .cache folder. Back at the about:profiles page any attempt to open the preexisting profile results in a prompt asking me to create a new profile. I still have the one profile open and the addons are not working correctly. I did a bookmark export on this profile and doing so generated the “firefox” folder that had disappeared plus a profile folder using the same name of this open profile - /home/user/.mozilla/firefox'<a href=""http://profile.name"" rel=""nofollow"">profile.name</a> -  it created a profile folder for this open profile using the correct name.  </p><p>Any ideas on how this happened? Can the local profiles still in .cache be used to somehow restore the full profiles? </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-91110;firefox-9111;,firefox,other,en-US,"",komms.tb

I did list her email address as the owner of the tickets. She did receive an email asking if she would like to finish the purchase. </li><li> As my daughter was reading this email, I was trying to pay for the tickets through PayPal, but the transaction did not go through as I had expected.  </li><li> I then went back to <a href=""http://TicketNetwork.com"" rel=""nofollow"">TicketNetwork.com</a> and canceled the tickets. This time, I used my email address as the address to send the ticketing information. </li><li> Then, I returned to <a href=""http://TicketNetwork.com"" rel=""nofollow"">TicketNetwork.com</a> and repurchased the same group of tickets using my PayPal account.

The criticism is not directed towards the nice people here who give support to users who have problems.  </p><p>I understand that developers get new ideas and want to put them into practice, but if you change an often used behaviour like this, I don't think it's user friendly to just change the behaviour without asking the user if he want's that behaviour. Personally I don't see how the automatically disappearing dialog helps me (it's very easy to click Esc if I change my mind about bookmarking a page), but I keep experiencing how it makes my browsing experience worse, as I often pause for a moment for example to think what name I'm going to give for the bookmark, or where am I going to place it. </p><p>In practice this change has wasted at least an hour of my time (to find an explanation and (in vain) a solution to fix the behaviour), made me annoyed, and based on the comments here and other places, made quite a few other people annoyed too.  </p><p>Please, when you change the behaviour of Firefox in the future, before changing the behaviour for an individual user, ask him first if he even wants the change. For example show him a dialog where he is told that ""we have this new feature where your familiar dialog keeps disappearing every three seconds for no reason so that you get the pleasure of invoking it again...and again...and again.

The windows 10 upgrade saved my windows 8.1 files. I installed firefox on windows 10. I deleted the files created by the install in the folder 'profiles'. When I copy my old firefox profile contents into that firefox profile folder, firefox does not pickup my bookmarks and extensions as I had hoped. Is it possible to get firefox to recognize my old profile contents? Thanks, Doug </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1517130;,literski

The problem is, thanks to this little option I can't use alt + numpad to write ASCII characters anymore, and since that is a big part of my day-to-day activities, I prefer just to turn of the navigation so I can write the ASCII characters like I'm used to. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,customize,es,"",juanfelipejaramillolosada

It might seem important to you, but it's super annoying, especially when your automatic updates don't work well anymore. I keep getting a ""updates are available"" pop-up at the menu bar, and then clicking on it brings me to the download page. I have to download and install every time you bring in a minor update! Also, the school I work in works behind a firewall. Your descriptions and updates always fail their safety precautions, and I have to get the administrator to unlock every time for minor updates!
