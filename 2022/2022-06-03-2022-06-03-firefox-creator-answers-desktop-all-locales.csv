I will usually rapidly read through the PDF file online before deciding to add it or not. For some unknown reason, Firefox blocks the use of Mendeley on PDF file, for security reasons, and I can no longer add them to my library. Most references are only available as PDF files making the add-on completely useless.  Is there a security feature that I can disable to be able to use the extension again? </p><p>Kind regards, </p><p>Mathias </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1010;,firefox,customize,en-US,1509705;1509721;1509726;1509730;,mathias.rsl
