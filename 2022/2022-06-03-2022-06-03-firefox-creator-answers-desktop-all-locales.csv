I will usually rapidly read through the PDF file online before deciding to add it or not. For some unknown reason, Firefox blocks the use of Mendeley on PDF file, for security reasons, and I can no longer add them to my library. Most references are only available as PDF files making the add-on completely useless.  Is there a security feature that I can disable to be able to use the extension again? </p><p>Kind regards, </p><p>Mathias </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1010;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",mathias.rsl

It would often pop up at inappropriate places that had nothing to do with email, and often blocked me from inputting text in things I was filling out online.  Once it pops up, you can't move it out of the way.  Thanks.  </p><p>BTW, had to do a lot of searching just to make a comment. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,other,en-US,"",mjk3310

Now, all of a sudden, the section titles in the program are faded gray almost to white, which makes entering info (not to mention eye strain), really difficult.  Just wondering if this might have been something that occurred with the last Firefox update.  </p><p>I've tried adjusting the screen resolution but it makes no difference.  See the screenshot with this message. </p><p>cwr@sti.net </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1010;,firefox,other,en-US,"",cwr34
