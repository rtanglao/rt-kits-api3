When I click the reply icon associated with a comment, the sidebar opens and a loading icon is displayed for a second but then nothing happens; all I get is a white sidebar.  I have updated to 99, shutdown and rebooted, opened Slack in an new window and nothing allows replys.  I am running Windows 10 Pro, build 1903, 64 bit, i5 processor, 16 GB RAM.  Suggestions? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-990;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",rogerbird

Nothing happens for about one minute, then the spinning blue circle appears, then firefox starts to load, then the screen goes back to the desktop, then a black screen appears, then some white rectangles start to appear across the top of the screen, then the screen goes back to desktop, then back to the black and white top-of-browser window that is still trying to load, and then finally after the five minutes, our home page loads. However, clicking on a bookmarked website, or typing in a website in the address bar results in a 2-3 minute wait for that site to load. And this happens time after time with the computer still on, and also startup after startup. If this should continue for a few more days, we will start using Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, and also cancel our subscription to Mozilla VPN. This cannot continue! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-990;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",chezmich
