I am using a VPN, so is that part of the problem ? (shouldn't be, because I have had that for a year or so). I don't know what to do, and it is after 12:45 am now, and I have to go to bed, have to get up for work in 6 hours.  I hope someone has some help for me when I log in tomorrow. I hope that I have not been hacked.  Thanks for reading! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1000;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1506226;1506251;1506269;,brianarc1
