Now I can open any folder and avoid that useless feature... except if I open the download folder from Firefox. </p><p>Details:  - if I open my Downloads folder from the desktop shortcut I get it normal (no group-by) - if I click the folder icon close to the downloaded file in Firefox Library/Downloads window, then the windows folder is shown with Group-by enabled - the same happens if I click the folder icon close to the downloaded file in Firefox's download toolbar icon </p><p>Does this happen to others?

I may have changed a setting or something on Firefox or my VPN. I'm confused, am not very computer savvy. I went to Apple store last weekend for phone and they said I should use Safari for info security, so I made that default on my Mac Mini (where I'm writing now) for a couple days, but then got blocked from a website where I plan to apply for a job, so I went back to Firefox, after I read articles saying that Firefox is more secure. I am using a VPN, so is that part of the problem ? (shouldn't be, because I have had that for a year or so). I don't know what to do, and it is after 12:45 am now, and I have to go to bed, have to get up for work in 6 hours.  I hope someone has some help for me when I log in tomorrow. I hope that I have not been hacked.  Thanks for reading! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1000;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1506226;,brianarc1
