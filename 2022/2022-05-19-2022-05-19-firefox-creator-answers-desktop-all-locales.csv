I've been having this problem with my iMac for sometime, but now it's affecting my Macbook Pro, as well. Both machines are 2015, running OS 10.15.7.  </p><p>They have problems loading webfonts (I get the annoying question marks). I tried creating a new test user, and the issue persisted. Any ideas on what I should do? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1000;firefox-10001;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jack108

I have not loaded any new programs during this period.  The only way I can get Firefox to run is to end all the Firefox processes in Task Manager and restart it. I also noticed that there are usually 9 firefox processes running in  Task Manager. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1000;firefox-10001;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1506211;,jathom1
