Assume user who clicked Ask Community on the previous page, already searched a similar question using ""Find help...""

This is important to me because I often have to quickly scan a document but do not need to save a copy of it.  With the new update when I click on download a Word document it sends me to save with no option to open it instead.  Say it isn't so because this is so important to me I will switch to Chrome or another browser after using Firefox for years.  BTW I go under Applications in ""Settings, General"" and Word files are not listed as an option for me to change how they are handled when clicked on.

Since I upgraded to v98, every file I open online, even if I'm not saving it, is saving a copy of itself onto my desktop. (To be precise, D:\OneDrive\Desktop). And I look at up to 20 files per day, so this is getting pretty annoying. </p><p>My regular downloads directory still exists, and that should be where temporary copies of files are being stored prior to my closing or saving them (right?). But it's empty. </p><p>Note that under Settings &gt; General &gt; Downloads, the default is set to Always Ask rather than one specific directory. However I believe that is for the ""permanent"" version of the files, not the temporary version. </p><p>How do I get Firefox to revert back to the pre-98 defaults for the temporary versions of files? I was hoping this change was a mistake but I see that 98.01 did not fix it and from the article referenced above, it looks like changes were made deliberately. And the desktop is clearly not a place where temporary files should be being placed. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-980;v98-download;firefox-9801;,firefox,other,en-US,1489703;1489719;1489742;1489836;,babyrd
