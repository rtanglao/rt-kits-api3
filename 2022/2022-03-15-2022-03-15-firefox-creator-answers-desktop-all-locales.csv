This is important to me because I often have to quickly scan a document but do not need to save a copy of it.  With the new update when I click on download a Word document it sends me to save with no option to open it instead.  Say it isn't so because this is so important to me I will switch to Chrome or another browser after using Firefox for years.  BTW I go under Applications in ""Settings, General"" and Word files are not listed as an option for me to change how they are handled when clicked on.  I'm using Windows 10 and Outlook (web version). </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",pamelalehto

I used to download csv files and Firefox would open them with the option to save as an excel file. Now it does not. I have to save it as csv then convert it to excel. It also doesn't seem to save my settings on the website I'm downloading from - I always have to manipulate the settings before downloading. It is a huge headache and I have resorted to using Chrome instead. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-980;v98-download;firefox-9801;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1489700;,tkirl

Since I upgraded to v98, every file I open online, even if I'm not saving it, is saving a copy of itself onto my desktop. (To be precise, D:\OneDrive\Desktop). And I look at up to 20 files per day, so this is getting pretty annoying. </p><p>My regular downloads directory still exists, and that should be where temporary copies of files are being stored prior to my closing or saving them (right?). But it's empty. </p><p>Note that under Settings &gt; General &gt; Downloads, the default is set to Always Ask rather than one specific directory. However I believe that is for the ""permanent"" version of the files, not the temporary version. </p><p>How do I get Firefox to revert back to the pre-98 defaults for the temporary versions of files? I was hoping this change was a mistake but I see that 98.01 did not fix it and from the article referenced above, it looks like changes were made deliberately. And the desktop is clearly not a place where temporary files should be being placed. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-980;v98-download;firefox-9801;,firefox,other,en-US,1489703;,babyrd
