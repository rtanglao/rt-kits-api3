I only have my banking in FF because it does seem more secure than other browsers. So I need to do banking immediately and FF of course wants to upgrade. Ok, I upgrade to 98.0.1 Now I get 500 error when I attempt to log into my one banking account. There is no error when I use Chrome. And so I revert back to version 97.0 and now I'm forced to use a new profile. Ok, I use the new profile and lo and behold I can now log into my bank account without any 500 error. So obviously the latest version has some problem with authentication.  So I try to get version 97.0 to utilize my previous profile. But it won't every time I select my good profile as the default and relaunch it relaunches with 98.0.1 which must be stored someplace in the profile data.  </p><p>How do I get the good profile to open with the older version of the software? There must be some file in the profile set of files that I can edit to get it to think it is version 97.0 and be able to start my good profile with my good version of FF. Please help!! </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",nfink@litebiz.net

This may happen almost immediately, or it may only happen after a few minutes. This is extremely disconcerting when reading (for example) a large webpage or forum. </p><p>Initially I thought it was a faulty mouse. I tried swapping out the mouse, but then I discovered that even if I open the browser, scroll (using the scroll wheel on the mouse) partway down a page, and then immediately turn off both mouse and keyboard, it still randomly scrolls (usually up) after a few seconds. I have also tried to see if I can get any other application to do this, but no, it is definitely only Firefox. </p><p>A quick read online and somebody else mentioned ""Enhanced mouse scroll"" or something similar, but I think they are talking about a Windows ""feature"". I am running Ubuntu 20.04 64 bit with the latest version (98.0) of Firefox. </p><p>I have not changed any settings with my browser in recent times either, however there have been periodic Ubuntu updates, and this covers Firefox updates too.

Since I upgraded to v98, every file I open online, even if I'm not saving it, is saving a copy of itself onto my desktop. (To be precise, D:\OneDrive\Desktop). And I look at up to 20 files per day, so this is getting pretty annoying. </p><p>My regular downloads directory still exists, and that should be where temporary copies of files are being stored prior to my closing or saving them (right?). But it's empty. </p><p>Note that under Settings &gt; General &gt; Downloads, the default is set to Always Ask rather than one specific directory. However I believe that is for the ""permanent"" version of the files, not the temporary version. </p><p>How do I get Firefox to revert back to the pre-98 defaults for the temporary versions of files? I was hoping this change was a mistake but I see that 98.01 did not fix it and from the article referenced above, it looks like changes were made deliberately. And the desktop is clearly not a place where temporary files should be being placed. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-980;v98-download;firefox-9801;,firefox,other,en-US,1489703;1489719;1489742;,babyrd
