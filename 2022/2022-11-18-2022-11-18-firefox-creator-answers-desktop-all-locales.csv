Download a random photo (e.g. <a href=""https://unsplash.com/photos/hMVlMBXaP_M"" rel=""nofollow"">from Unsplash</a>) 2. Select the file and hit ctrl + c in Files/Nautilus 3. I go to the <a href=""https://evercoder.github.io/clipboard-inspector/"" rel=""nofollow"">clipboard inspector</a> 4. I hit ctrl + v 5. The image does <strong>not</strong> show up in the output (see screenshot) </p><p><strong>Test with Brave:</strong> 1. Do the same as above 2. The image does show up in the output (see screenshot) </p><p><strong>Notes:</strong> - I am using Linux Ubuntu 22.04 with Wayland - Firefox Version 107.0 (64-bit) for Ubuntu Canonical - 1.0 - I have no extensions installed - I am <strong>not</strong> using the snap version (so I can scroll smoothly) ... I think I used apt-get install but not 100% sure </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1070;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",st_phan

It happens whenever I use any light (white taskbar background, system pages backgrounds, etc.) Firefox full theme, and there are many tabs in the window (the buttons start to glitch as I open more 'live' tabs, then go completely; empty ones don't seem to count). They are still functional, just transparent. The problem is not specific to my main profile, I have reproduced it on clean profile with only a theme installed (so, no addons are involved). It doesn't happen, though, when I: </p> <ul><li> use any dark theme </li><li> use a Firefox Color theme </li><li> activate Troubleshoot Mode (obviously, as the themes themselves are not enabled) </li></ul> <p>WTF?

Until I upgraded to 108, the Window menu remained as I set it -- in the order that I opened windows. As I have tabs grouped by subject, this worked out well given the breadth of IT and academic work that I've been doing.  </p><p>Now with Firefox auto-alphabetizing the Windows menu, I'm effectively losing my tabs. Is there any way to fix this and revert to the old behavior of organizing by order-of-open-window? </p><p>For what it's worth, I'm running the latest developer version Firefox on macOS Ventura for ARM. </p>",desktop;beta;customize;firefox-1080;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",rzeznikj

(windows 10),"<p>Hi, </p><p>since a week or so, I haven't been receiving push notifications from twitter on firefox. I'm still able to receive them on other browsers such as chrome. I've been using push notifications for months, but according to twitter settings, push notifications are no longer supported by firefox? </p><p>I gave twitter permissions to send notifications through the settings. In about:config, I've set push.dom.enabled to true. In windows Background Apps, I've toggled twitter on. </p><p>Is there any other option I can try in order to fix this problem? Or could it possibly be related to the firefox version? </p><p>Recently almost every day firefox has been asking me to update, which I do, but it seems like it's only getting downgraded somehow, since somehow push notifications are no longer supported. Is v107.0 the latest version?  </p><p>Thanks in advance for your help. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1070;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ksartrjt
