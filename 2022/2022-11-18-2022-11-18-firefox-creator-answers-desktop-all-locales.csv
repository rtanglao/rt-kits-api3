I get disconnected from my server and my email is disabled. I am running PC Matic malware protection, a VPN. It doesn't matter. Big Brother is always looking over my shoulder, suppressing everything that they deem is not in line with the governments agenda. I have been shut out of my browser on occasion, so I can't get to my banking login. They have scrambled and deleted certain contacts on my contact list. I have changed my email, passwords, ISP, computer now using Windows10, upgraded everything but still cannot block this monitoring system. If I write a letter to my MPP my computer noticeably slows down and just locks up, they change my port settings, etc so I can not send it. Whatever monitoring program walks right past my VPN, kicks my PC Matic aside and simply locks me out, I have been to our local police station, the RCMP. they say the government can do as they please and I have no say!!!! This is a profound violation of our Charter of Rights. How can I find out who is at the root of this and how do I stop it? could you find out who is doing this to me? Would you have any suggestions on how to block this electronic eavesdropping.
