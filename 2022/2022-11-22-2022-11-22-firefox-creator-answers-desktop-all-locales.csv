I can click one item on a listing search page and it will be purple as long as I open a second tab when opening it.  But when reloading the same list, the same item is not purple as they always used to be.  Actually, a few still are, and those have the shorter URL.  The links do show in the history record.  This is very annoying, I can't imagine I am the only one who is finding this.  It has persisted through the last two updates.  This needs to be fixed. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1070;,firefox,other,en-US,1549349;,lyleleverich

Refreshing hasn't fixed the issue, neither has restarting or shutting down my laptop, as it was turned off for 12+ hours and I still had the issue when using YouTube today. It's even an issue in incognito mode, but not an issue if I use a completely different browser. I can't find anything else that has been affected by whatever button I must have pushed. Laptop is a Dell G15, if that's relevant. Would love any tips to fix this. </p>",desktop;windows-11;website-breakages;firefox-1070;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1549326;1549330;1549334;1549335;1549336;1549338;1549339;1549341;1549344;1549346;,rgold96306
