When I turned it back on, I was greeted by Microsoft asking me to install Windows 11. Of course, I declined the offer several times. I then noticed that everything I had opened was now closed. So I opened everything up again, including Firefox. </p><p>My laptop has a wide-gamut display, and colours look oversaturated by default. It's one ""feature"" of this computer that I don't like. So, anyway, I had to fiddle with the color management settings in Firefox to get page elements like images and text not to look blindingly saturated. Aside from videos still being unchanged, the settings worked great for many months. Now, suddenly after this push for Windows 11, the color management has seemingly gone back to what it was like before I got it looking right. Nothing I change has any effect. Change settings. Restart browser. Nothing. Repeat that process until I'm ready to launch my laptop out the window. </p><p>I closed out and then re-opened Firefox. I refreshed the browser. I rebooted the system. Nothing. All color management settings don't take any effect. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1070;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ben-grieve

I looked at Firefox documentation for some answers and I found that NSS support for logging file is disabled by default since NSS 3.24 [2], that-is to say Firefox 48 and 49 [3]. I do not have found any documentation saying it has been re-enabled by default since then. However, I have made some tests on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (it is disabled on Debian) and Windows 10 using Firefox 106 (NSS 3.83) [4] and it works properly. </p><p>So, I have two questions : - Is it normal that this feature still works for decrypting traffic whereas it should be disabled by default ? - What is the position of Mozilla developers and the community on the security of this feature (anyone who have access to someone computer could get all of their internet passwords) ? </p><p>Thank you for your reading and I am looking forward to reading your answer. </p><p>Best regards </p><p><br> [1] <a href=""https://wiki.wireshark.org/TLS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.wireshark.org/TLS</a> [2] <a href=""https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/security/nss/legacy/nss_releases/nss_3.24_release_notes/index.html#mozilla-projects-nss-nss-3-24-release-notes"" rel=""nofollow"">https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/security/nss/legacy/nss_releases/nss_3.24_release_notes/index.html#mozilla-projects-nss-nss-3-24-release-notes</a> [3] <a href=""https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/security/nss/legacy/key_log_format/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/security/nss/legacy/key_log_format/index.html</a> [4] <a href=""https://wiki.mozilla.org/NSS:Release_Versions"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.mozilla.org/NSS:Release_Versions</a> </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1025;firefox-10250;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",hbove
