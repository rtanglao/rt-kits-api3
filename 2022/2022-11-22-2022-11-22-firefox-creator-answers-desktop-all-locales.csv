When I move the cursor within empty the area, it appears on the shrinked graph like where it has to be making it practically impossible to use.  </p><p>I tried other Firefox distributions like LibreWolf, with the same result. Other browsers like Brave does not have this issue and the graph works just fine. I tried disabling graphic acceleration to no avail.

But when reloading the same list, the same item is not purple as they always used to be.  Actually, a few still are, and those have the shorter URL.  The links do show in the history record.

Refreshing hasn't fixed the issue, neither has restarting or shutting down my laptop, as it was turned off for 12+ hours and I still had the issue when using YouTube today. It's even an issue in incognito mode, but not an issue if I use a completely different browser. I can't find anything else that has been affected by whatever button I must have pushed. Laptop is a Dell G15, if that's relevant.
