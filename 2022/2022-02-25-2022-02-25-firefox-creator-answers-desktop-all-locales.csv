I was wasting time for a minor issue as the browser doesn't show the exact line which triggers the issue. After finding the issue by debugging manually line by line (dry running code with state inputs), I found the issue and wondered why the exact line is not shown in exception trace in console. Then tried with chrome to check if it can show proper trace and it did.  I often push myself to use fire fox instead of chrome to overcome monopoly in the future. But these kind of situations leading to wasting my time makes me run back to chrome. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,other,en-US,"",janakar8t6
