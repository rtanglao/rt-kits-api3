These are pages that only allow ""Select All"" to select parts of pages, so that important parts of the pages cannot be selected, or so that a large number of select-and-copy cycles are required to copy the information on a webpage.  The Firefox extensions that I have tried like the old ""right to click"" do not seem to help much.  With old versions of Windows, I would use print-to-file for a generic plain-text printer, but that does not provide a readable file on Win 10. </p><p>I frequently find these problems on web pages with survey questions.  This web page is a very simple example where multiple cycles of select-and-copy are required: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/new/desktop/form"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/new/desktop/form</a> People who have accounts on <a href=""http://Meetup.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Meetup.com</a> should see an egregious example on this page: <a href=""https://www.meetup.com/account/interests/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.meetup.com/account/interests/</a> </p><p>Thanks for any help, Lloyd </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-1000;firefox-10001;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",LloydEwing1
