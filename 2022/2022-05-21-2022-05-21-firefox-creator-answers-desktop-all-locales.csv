Task manager shows that it's trying to pull some 200mbs of data at the rate of 0.5mb\s or less. RAM is fine. HDD is old, but recently defragmented and, outside of &lt;this&gt; particular issue - it's not a problem. System is dusty, but system is system. For some reason virtually any other program launches more or less just fine. A particularly heavy game can pull gigabytes of data in about the same time that Firefox is bottlenecked to kilobyte speed. </p><p>It's not a conflict of start-ups, I have only the driver necessities in there. it's not a windows start-up issue, the browser can take as much time even a minute after windows is loaded. It's not a (anti)virus. Because I don't use either. It's not some 15 year old Celeron trying to handle W10, FX8320 should be able to handle opening a web browser. It's not a ton of extensions, and it's not even Firefox accounting, it happened before I registered. From extensions it's only ublock origin and VPN. </p><p>My personal three guesses are: </p><p>-More than 3-5 tabs on average, but, last I checked, the tabs aren't loaded upon start-up. And power users have sessions of dozens of tabs. -100-200 bookmarks. Again, not sure how hard is it to read a text data, unless it also has to load some thumbnails or icons or whatever. -Software aging.(Latest stable firefox, updates are on, and it has been running far less than this 4 year old system) </p><p>Reinstalling the system isn't a solution. Nor is reinstalling Firefox. Nor is dumping bookmarks, because otherwise why bookmark them. I'd just like to know why is Firefox limited to kilobyte speed of initial page loading. It can't be a damaged HDD cluster, otherwise I'd feel it outside of start-up. </p><p>With my limited knowledge of PC - it's usually a random read issue. Because like every memory benchmarks(HDD and RAM) can show hysterical speeds when loading\copying some 50gigs of a single file, if it's a few hundreds of thousands of small files - it becomes random and tanks. But what I don't understand why does Firefox have THAT much clutter? Is it really the bookmarks? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1506849;1506866;,Wirxaw
