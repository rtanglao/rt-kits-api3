I was using this setting to disable CSP to be able to load local JS scripts on some non-locally hosted sites, for debugging and development, work related purposes. </p><p>Was this setting really removed? Is there a way to disable CSP on Firefox on the latest version? </p><p>Thanks!

I did a clean install of the OS, but used Migration Assistant for all of my applications and settings.  For some reason, all of my Firefox Add-Ons disappeared, for whatever that's worth. </p><p>The issue I'm having is that Facebook won't load in a container page.  I don't have the Facebook Container Add-On installed, I'm only using the Firefox native container settings.   </p><p>FB does load in Banking or Shopping container tabs, but not in a Facebook container tab.  The log in page loads, and the 2 factor authorization page, but once I get past that, I see nothing but a white page. </p><p>Instagram loads just fine in a Facebook container, though.  Banking and Shopping containers seem to be working fine otherwise, too. </p><p>Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated, thanks. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",ivan.rhudick
