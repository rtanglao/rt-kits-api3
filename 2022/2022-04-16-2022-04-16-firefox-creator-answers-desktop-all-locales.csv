I read a bunch of articles but none appear to work; for instance, there is no option to `open with` (as some articles claim)  when the download dialog box pops up.

I've noticed it mainly with Reddit and their 'random' feature. I can only go to one random sub-reddit and then from that point forward it will only go to that same sub-reddit when I hit the Random link. For instance if I hit random and it takes me to say <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/"" rel=""nofollow"">www.reddit.com/r/Ohio/</a> then from that point on I only get the Ohio sub-reddit when clicking the Random link. If I clear my cache and reopen Firefox I again get one click on Random and then any further clicks take me to the first, random sub-reddit. </p><p>This is not replicated in Microsoft Edge or with Firefox in private windows. I have disabled all of addons to see if one of them was causing this behaviour but it made no change. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,websites,en-US,1498033;1498042;,dominexjudex
