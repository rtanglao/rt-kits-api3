I've tried looking at different solutions and most of them make reference to userchrome or something else I have absolutely no idea how to work. Can someone explain to me, in the most simple and hard to get wrong terms as humanly possible, how to change the background and text color in the search bar? Is this something I edit the theme itself for? How do I do that? </p><p>Thanks in advance. Attached image shows the part of the browser I'm talking about if it somehow wasn't clear enough. I'd like to turn the white color into, say, dark blue or gray, and change the text color to a light blue or white. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,other,en-US,1497907;1497909;,wuirgwuighoifmqewfieqg
