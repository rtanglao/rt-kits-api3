All it shows is ""Encrypted Connection"" and I have Site privacy protection on. I've tried going in it's options but I didn't find anything there to help me get it back to it's previous state where it blocks the above mentioned. Am I missing something?

However, when I click on ""Edit contact"" to make a change, an error message pops up that says, ""something went wrong.  Please close this window and try again.""  I do that but nothing changes. Additionally, on my iPhone 11 which is synced to my Hotmail account a number of my accounts had their information duplicated to the point where some of them had up to 40 duplications. My thought was to delete Firefox from my computer and then reinstall it. When I went to do this, I noticed that there were two versions of the program on my computer, one of them installed August 26!  I never installed it and I don't know how the second version got on m computer! Thinking that this duplication was the problem, I deleted the one installed on August 26 but kept the one installed a few years ago.   Now I don't have any of my original bookmarks and the problem of making changes in a contact persists. Can someone guide me to a solution?

I had done this without incident a few times before, but this time several new folders showed up in my profile folder, which I then (perhaps stupidly) deleted. </p><p>The problem is that whenever I restore a session after a crash or close, despite the session itself restoring to the correct place, the tab menu has several malfunctions: </p><p>- The tab menu defaults to the first tabs in each window, regardless of what tab I was on before the restore, and I cannot scroll beyond this because the scroll arrow does not appear. - Each tab appears with the x symbol, not only the one I am currently on. - When I click a tab, it ""loads"" forever and the website icon disappears, even if the content loads and is usable. - The address bar does not give suggested results when I type in it, though it is functional in all other ways. </p><pre>I have attached a screenshot of what this looks like. </pre> <p>These 'sessions' usually last only a short time before firefox crashes and the ""bug"" error box appears. When I tell firefox to restore, it brings up the restore session page, but the ""restore"" button is light blue and unclickable and ""view previous tabs"" is empty. </p><p>I have the same problem when I restore using the previous.jsonlz4 or recover.jsonlz4 files from immediately before the crash or close. I have noticed that there is no sessionstore.jsonlz4 file in my profile folder before restoring, which probably has something to do with the whole problem. I am able to open a previous.jsonlz4 file that I saved a month ago before the problem started without issue, but that means I obviously lose any tabs I opened in the interim. </p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ldh00vt
