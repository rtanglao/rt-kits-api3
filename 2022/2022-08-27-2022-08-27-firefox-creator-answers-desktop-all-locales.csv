I tried the fix about having more than one profile, which worked for a while, but it's suddenly starting to happen again. Mostly on YT right now, but it happened a bit on other pages as well before so I'm sure it'll progress to that point again because YT is quickly getting worse. Has anyone found another cause or fix? Thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",americankaz

I had done this without incident a few times before, but this time several new folders showed up in my profile folder, which I then (perhaps stupidly) deleted. </p><p>The problem is that whenever I restore a session after a crash or close, despite the session itself restoring to the correct place, the tab menu has several malfunctions: </p><p>- The tab menu defaults to the first tabs in each window, regardless of what tab I was on before the restore, and I cannot scroll beyond this because the scroll arrow does not appear. - Each tab appears with the x symbol, not only the one I am currently on. - When I click a tab, it ""loads"" forever and the website icon disappears, even if the content loads and is usable. - The address bar does not give suggested results when I type in it, though it is functional in all other ways. </p><pre>I have attached a screenshot of what this looks like. </pre> <p>These 'sessions' usually last only a short time before firefox crashes and the ""bug"" error box appears. When I tell firefox to restore, it brings up the restore session page, but the ""restore"" button is light blue and unclickable and ""view previous tabs"" is empty. </p><p>I have the same problem when I restore using the previous.jsonlz4 or recover.jsonlz4 files from immediately before the crash or close. I have noticed that there is no sessionstore.jsonlz4 file in my profile folder before restoring, which probably has something to do with the whole problem. I am able to open a previous.jsonlz4 file that I saved a month ago before the problem started without issue, but that means I obviously lose any tabs I opened in the interim. </p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ldh00vt
