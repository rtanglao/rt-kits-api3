I knew this because when starting up the PC state was not persisted. I started Firefox (v97 x64) and it would not load any websites. The about:config page loaded. </p><p>I was at a loss as to how to resolve this as I could find no advice for this problem. </p><p>I thought I would try Safe Mode. Unexpectedly, just starting in Safe Mode resolved the issue without doing anything else. I am now back to normal. </p><p>I'm curious to know what just starting in Safe Mode did to resolve the issue. I also want to broadcast this as I did not find this as a potential solution. </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",johfc
