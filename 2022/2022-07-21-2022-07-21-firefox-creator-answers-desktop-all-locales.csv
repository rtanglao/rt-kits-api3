This happens in two different situations: </p><p>1) I close Firefox. When I re-open it, the first tab is missing. It doesn't happen all the times. But at least 60%. (My Firefox is set to show the tabs of the last time when I open it).  </p><p>2) I'm downloading some file from my email or other place. Sometimes it goes fine. Other times the tab I'm using suddenly closes. </p><p>This problem has never happened with any other Firefox version. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",Ramlyn

It ALWAYS brings up the screen asking me to verify if thiis program can make changes to my computer, Why?  Is v 102.1 the latest? I don't know I see other comments about other versions. </p><p>And so many more issues I am about to pull every last hair out of my head. I don't even know how your Bookmarks work, nothing like I've ever seen. And, why does Firefox Browser open in different pages, sometimes. I'll have 2 rows or 3 rows of add-ons. Sometimes the font is so tiny I cannot read it, other times it's just fine. </p><p>I know what you are going to do. You'll give me some instructions with words that mean nothing to me. Then you'll provide articles I can read, and they mean nothing to me either. I AM NOT an IT person. I just want to turn on my computer and have it work properly JUST ONCE!  Wouldn't that be great, then maybe twice in a row! </p><p>I thoiught i would be happy with Firefox, but I'm not. Just like I'm not happy with Windows platforms from 7 onward. Instead of making things easier for the everyday user all you do is make things more confusing and complex. I read some of the questions on this website and I don't even know what they're talking about. </p><p>I just want Firefox to WORK </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-8;firefox-1020;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Rhonda_89
