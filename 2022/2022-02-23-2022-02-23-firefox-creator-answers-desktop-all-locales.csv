So I haven't been using Mozilla Firefox for very long and I created my account just a few weeks ago. Since then I have bought myself a new PC and when I try to login into my primary account it gives me the message: ""Primary account email required for sign-in"" even though I only have one e-mail (and I had to create a new one just to post here) and even if I go into 'Manage accounts' to add my primary e-mail which doesn't work for whatever reason, it says this: ""This email was already verified by another user"" and the only one that has verified it is me... I'm very frustrated about this and I have been trying to fix this problem for an entire day now. </p><p>I need help fixing this because I don't want to lose all my bookmarked websites! </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-970;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Arcemonde
