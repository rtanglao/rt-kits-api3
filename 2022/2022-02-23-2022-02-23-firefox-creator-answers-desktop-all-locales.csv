Just updated FF today and saw that there are some issues similar but not close. </p><p>It didn't happen immediately, but slow-rolled in.  No popups and no diverting pages, etc., so I really don't know what the issue is.  Virus seems likely. </p><p>Ran 2 AV products.  Nine PUPS detected by MBAM. All installed by PC Cleaner. Installed a second AV and I got <strong>560 </strong>hits - all seemingly cookies placed by PC Cleaner and 1 adware tracker by same. </p><p>I cannot open FF.  I am having a problem with Edge.  Only IE seems to be working. Massive downtime with *Edge not responding* and identically with other Outlook based programs (<a href=""http://OL.com"" rel=""nofollow"">OL.com</a> and Office Outlook.)   Every time I try to open FF, the box pops up telling me FF crashed.  Sent reports, which I cannot open. Of course, I uninstalled and reinstalled FF, but still... </p><p>I should be able to report the link, but unsure where to go. In unfamiliar territory on a different browser that I hate and without the settings (and addons) that I love.  Keyboard now acting strangely, but it is fairly beat up.   </p><p>PILE ON ME today! </p><p>Suggestions welcome. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",CiaoBella1

I've not seen this on my Windows 10 machine, On the right side of the address bar in green it says 'banking $' this is on Youtube. I visited a bank site and this did not appear. It also has a thin green line above the tab. </p><p>What is this? What is it's purpose? And how do I get rid of it? </p><p>Thank you </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-970;firefox-9701;,firefox,websites,en-US,1485568;1485569;1485571;1485572;,falselogic

Uniqlo's Canadian site won't load on Firefox. Works fine in Chrome. Many sites either don't load or are super slow and buggy (like Facebook half the time) when using Firefox. Banking sites don't work well with Firefox, but are fine with Chrome. </p><p>I am getting kind of tired having to use 2 browsers. Firefox used to be my go-to but a couple years ago, everything I needed to use (online banking, shipping, e-commerce stuff) either wouldn't load or would take so long, I just started using Chrome. </p><p>Are these issues ever going to get resolved, or do I have to continually delete cookies and history (huge PITA) only for Firefox to continue not to work like it used to. I think it's time to break up for good. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",anitaleisser
