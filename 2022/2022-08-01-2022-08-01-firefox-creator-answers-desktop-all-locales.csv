Debug instructionxs are gibberish.,"<p>Stop trying to fix, then sabotaging, whatever we finally cobbled together to get things to work. Yesterday, I could set a Firefox page alongside another application, each half a screen, side by side. Today, your idiot upgrade only allows the firefox page to shrink to 2/3 of screen measured horizontally, so it blocks the other half-screen application. You coders and your mania of fixing what ain't broke and breaking what weren't! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,other,en-US,"",markmulligan

Not only that, enabling compact mode in config didn't make it compact, nor did it give me the option to change densities in the toolbar under ""more tools."" What's even more aggravating is that Firefox has made all the elements too big so I feel like it's set for a low-vision user. I can't change the graphical aspects, changing the fonts did not help. Zooming out makes it too small. You ruined a perfectly useful browser.
