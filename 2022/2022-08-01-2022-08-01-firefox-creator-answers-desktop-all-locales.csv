I want to manage blocked cookies via a ""blacklist"", rather than a whitelist.  Also, I want to select cookies to block from a current list, instead of having to memorize them and type them in manually. 2. I have ""strict"" tracking protection enabled, yet I get permanent cookies installed from websites I do not visit or interact with.  For instance, if I open a new site web page, and that page has a Youtube video, even though it doesn't play (because I have autoplay blocked), yet the page adds a permanent Youtube cookie to my computer, that gets updated (and often multiplies), whenever I start my browser.

I usually bookmark all tabs in a window to a named folder under Bookmarks Menu, for example Folder1, Folder2, Folder3, etc.  Recently, the dialog was stuck to a previous folder, lets say Folder2, as the default, instead of the normal default of ""Bookmarks Menu"".  If I bookmark Folder4, it will want to put it under Folder2 as a subfolder, unless I manually change it to Bookmarks Menu, but the next time the default will go back to Folder2.  After trying to manually set the default back to Bookmarks Menu, without success, I tried renaming Folder2, thinking the default will go back to Bookmarks Menu.  This didn't work, Firefox chose the new Folder2 name automatically.  So next I opened all the tabs in Folder2, deleted the Folder2 in the bookmarks manager, thinking that if Firefox couldn't find Folder2, it would fallback to the old default of Bookmarks Menu.  Now when I try to bookmark anything, the save dialog is blank and the only thing I can click is the cancel button.  How do I fix this?  I have hundreds of tabs open, since the session manager I used to use is no longer supported, I was in the process of saving windows into bookmark folders.  I'm worried that restarting Firefox will lose some of recent changes to my open windows/tabs state since the last time Firefox ""autosaved?"" my session </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-890;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1524209;,ednigma42

Is there a way to change this back to the way it was, or is there a way to make it so that when I tell Firefox to OPEN a file, that it saves it a different location from my default Downloads folder? This way I could simply schedule a task to auto delete files older than X days, without risking files that I actually want saved. </p><p>Thanks very much. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,customize,en-US,1524007;1524011;1524012;1524013;,Frogger60
