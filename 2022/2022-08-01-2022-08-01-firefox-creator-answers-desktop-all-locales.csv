I see in a previous version, they changed the way ""Open file"" works, so now instead of it downloading to your TEMP folder and opening the file and hiding where it is ""saved"", it now just SAVES the file to the Downloads folder and opens it. </p><p>This is a problem for me at work, as I essentially open 100s of files every day and my Downloads folder is just full of junk now that I would need to sort out from what is junk and what isn't. Is there a way to change this back to the way it was, or is there a way to make it so that when I tell Firefox to OPEN a file, that it saves it a different location from my default Downloads folder? This way I could simply schedule a task to auto delete files older than X days, without risking files that I actually want saved. </p><p>Thanks very much. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",Frogger60

This is something that started only a few months ago.  Is there a setting in Firefox that I can use to cancel this unblocking; or do I need to do something else?  The FT technical support suggest I switch to Chrome as a browser.  I would rather stick with Firefox, but this problem is particularly irritating.
