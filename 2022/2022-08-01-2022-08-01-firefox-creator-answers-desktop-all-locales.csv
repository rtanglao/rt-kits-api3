Is there a way to change this back to the way it was, or is there a way to make it so that when I tell Firefox to OPEN a file, that it saves it a different location from my default Downloads folder? This way I could simply schedule a task to auto delete files older than X days, without risking files that I actually want saved. </p><p>Thanks very much. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,customize,en-US,1524007;1524011;1524012;1524013;,Frogger60
