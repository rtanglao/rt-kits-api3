After the bug was revealed and fixed the browser seemed to be working until now. </p><p>However since version 98.0 the problem seems to be back.   </p><p>If I close the browser during these outages I can see several Firefox processes in the task manager.   If I open Firefox again I am caught in an endless loop where it keeps saying Firefox is already running. </p><p>The only way to use the browser again is to either restart the computer, or shut down each process in the task manager.   </p><p>Things I have tried to remedy this problem. </p><p>Windows System File Check Disabled all Firefox addons Re-installed the browser over ten times - Cleaned out the residual folders Tried the Firefox Extended Support Release builds Disabled all Firefox updates via the policies.json file Virus/Malware scans Tried various about:config switches </p><p>This happens on my work PC and on my home PC.  I am using two different profiles on each one.   </p><p>The weird thing is it is sometimes random.  Sometimes it occurs once a day, sometimes it occurs multiple times in a day.  The outages usually occur from between 2 - 5 minutes.   </p><p>Tomorrow I will have to uninstall Firefox at work because I work in critical care for a health service.

It's a programmer flaw not extensions I use, especially since I haven't added any new ones in forever and only update them if they quit working! If it ain't broke don't fix it! Also Firefox needs to stop changing my settings to default on updates! I had my settings the way I did because I finally figured out how to get Firefox to run smoothy with audio/video and it isn't with the default settings for those. I am constantly having to  untick use recommended performance settings and hardware acceleration. I also have to go through security and privacy settings and set them the way I like them and which cookies etc. Leave the settings the way I had them!
