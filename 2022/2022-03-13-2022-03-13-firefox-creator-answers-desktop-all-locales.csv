Bittorrent is set to save torrent files in C:/torrents But when i click a torrent Mozilla first wil save my torrent file in C:.temp and than open automaticallly Bittorent wich will save my torrent file also in c:/torrents.  I use Mozilla for over 10 yrs, this behaviour occurs since last update, before this update when clicking a torrent file Mozilla dont download anything but let Bittorent to open and manage that file. Is this a bug or just a setting i missÂ ? Is very annoing </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,other,en-US,"",marius.fetita

It doesn't happen with other browsers or any other application but it's really starting to annoy me whenever I'm on a dark page. I have my taskbar hidden and just on the bottom edge of the screen are a few pixels of white that wont go away. It might be a little hard to see on the snip cause it's so small but its genuinely really annoying when I'm on any site or watching anything.FYI I've already tried to troubleshooting restart and completely wiped my Firefox, default settings and it's still there. Any help would really be appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",killianmckiernan04

I found that this latest update ruined firefox even further because now every single time I download an image, it pops the stupid download list on top of everything till I click somewhere instead of silently downloading like it used to do. I found no options at all for disabling this new terrible feature that you for some reason forced on us against our will yet again. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,customize,en-US,1489293;,VasVadum

Is there any way to go back to opening in new tabs? </p><p>To clarify, for example, I receive a pdf file from web whatsapp, and I open it.  Previously, a new tab is created showing the pdf file I received.  However, now, the pdf file is shown on the tab where web whatsapp was instead of opening a new tab.

Also unsure if something in Firefox caused keyboard characters to be generated, ex. when typing, cursor skips back  1 line, or genrates a code to switch to another app. Rather go one describing, can someone contact me what additional info needed to address these problems.

Maybe Mozilla needs to check add ons more carefully before putting them in their repositories! Most cases have been some Firefox setting malfunction for most of my Firefox issues! It's a programmer flaw not extensions I use, especially since I haven't added any new ones in forever and only update them if they quit working! If it ain't broke don't fix it! Also Firefox needs to stop changing my settings to default on updates! I had my settings the way I did because I finally figured out how to get Firefox to run smoothy with audio/video and it isn't with the default settings for those. I am constantly having to  untick use recommended performance settings and hardware acceleration. I also have to go through security and privacy settings and set them the way I like them and which cookies etc. Leave the settings the way I had them! Is there a way to export my settings to a file and when Mozilla f*cks it all up for me import them from that file? Please make unticked for email me when someone answers the thread. Thanks. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-980;,firefox,customize,en-US,1489269;,nunya_fukkin_bizness
