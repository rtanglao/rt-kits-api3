Also unsure if something in Firefox caused keyboard characters to be generated, ex. when typing, cursor skips back  1 line, or genrates a code to switch to another app. Rather go one describing, can someone contact me what additional info needed to address these problems.

Maybe Mozilla needs to check add ons more carefully before putting them in their repositories! Most cases have been some Firefox setting malfunction for most of my Firefox issues! It's a programmer flaw not extensions I use, especially since I haven't added any new ones in forever and only update them if they quit working! If it ain't broke don't fix it! Also Firefox needs to stop changing my settings to default on updates! I had my settings the way I did because I finally figured out how to get Firefox to run smoothy with audio/video and it isn't with the default settings for those. I am constantly having to  untick use recommended performance settings and hardware acceleration. I also have to go through security and privacy settings and set them the way I like them and which cookies etc. Leave the settings the way I had them! Is there a way to export my settings to a file and when Mozilla f*cks it all up for me import them from that file? Please make unticked for email me when someone answers the thread. Thanks. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-980;,firefox,customize,en-US,1489269;,nunya_fukkin_bizness
