Then I tried it on another browser (Chrome) and it worked just fine. I also tried to check all the settings and everything was fine. I also tried to ""Refresh Firefox"" basically resetting it and it still didn't fix my problem.  I would really appreciate it if you could help me fix this problem because I really love Firefox and love using it but this is a major problem for me...

I am extremely annoyed with Mozilla after this update and am DESPERATE for a fix. </p><p>I am a college student. I have to open several notes, lectures, syllabi, sample assignments, etc. a day. Obviously, I can't download every single one of these files to my computer. I'd run out of space. The SOLE REASON why I picked Firefox as my browser was because of the dialogue box that appeared whenever I went to download something, giving me the option to simply open a file without saving it. </p><p>They made it so that dialog box wasn't the default. Okay, fine, annoying. But all I have to do is go into settings and change it to ""Always ask,"" right? Wrong. EVERY SINGLE FILE GETS DOWNLOADED TO MY COMPUTER NOW. Every PDF and MS Word document is sent straight to my download folder.  </p><p>Is there ANY way I can open up files (specifically PDF and MS Word files) without saving them to my computer? I remember these files would be saved to a ""temporary"" file area, how can I re enable that again? If not, I will be switching to another browser that offers this option. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-980;v98-download;,firefox,customize,en-US,1489316;,beaunathanhoward

I found no options at all for disabling this new terrible feature that you for some reason forced on us against our will yet again. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-980;v98-download;,firefox,customize,en-US,1489293;1489323;,VasVadum

Maybe Mozilla needs to check add ons more carefully before putting them in their repositories! Most cases have been some Firefox setting malfunction for most of my Firefox issues! It's a programmer flaw not extensions I use, especially since I haven't added any new ones in forever and only update them if they quit working! If it ain't broke don't fix it! Also Firefox needs to stop changing my settings to default on updates! I had my settings the way I did because I finally figured out how to get Firefox to run smoothy with audio/video and it isn't with the default settings for those. I am constantly having to  untick use recommended performance settings and hardware acceleration. I also have to go through security and privacy settings and set them the way I like them and which cookies etc. Leave the settings the way I had them! Is there a way to export my settings to a file and when Mozilla f*cks it all up for me import them from that file? Please make unticked for email me when someone answers the thread. Thanks. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-980;,firefox,customize,en-US,1489269;,nunya_fukkin_bizness
