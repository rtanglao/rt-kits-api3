Until a couple of weeks ago the product videos yielded a message ""video not supported by this browser"".  I liked that because I use the internet selectively - I have a filter that provides me with a ""white list""  of sites I wish to access, and unless I make a special request, I cannot access other sites. Similarly I try to avoid most videos. Recently the Amazon product videos have been accessible. Is there some way Firefox can once again ""not support"" them?
