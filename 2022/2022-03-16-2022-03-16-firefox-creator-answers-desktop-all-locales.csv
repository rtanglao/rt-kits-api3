1371085,2022-03-15 20:12:57 -0700,2022-03-15 20:12:57 -0700,creating desktop shortcuts via drag and drop,"<p>My surface pro 7 with windows 10 or 11 will not create desktop shortcut from firefox (ver. 98.0.1 64 bit) using drag and drop with pen but will work using touch pad. I originally noticed this problem while running windows 11 on my surface pro 7. After doing some basic trouble shooting on my own I ended up re-imaging my surface pro 7 back to windows 10, I wasn't really thrilled with windows 11 anyway. At this point every thing worked normally. However, at some point firefox updated and the problem recurred. While using the touch pad is an acceptable work around when the keyboard is attached, using it as a tablet without the keyboard is a bit of an issue. Finger or pen is needed but won't work. thanks for your attention to this matter, it is appreciated.  </p><pre>    Tom. </pre>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9801;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",grizmixstir

Every time I hit ""New Message"" to send an email, Firefox automatically zooms the page in, past the ""Send Message"" button. It seems to be auto-zooming to the ""To:"" line where the cursor flashes on this screen by default. When I type an email, the words are cut off, because the browser is zoomed into the text input area where I write the body of the email. When I try to un-zoom it, I can never get it to zoom all the way out properly again. When I exit the ""New Message"" screen to look at my inbox, it is still zoomed in and cutting text off.
