Before your update, I was able to open a .pdf in a Firefox tab and directly download that file into Acrobat, where I could review, combine &amp; save or discard the file(s).

I then have to go into the save folder and open the file(s) so I can combine them to archive for work those files for work. </p><p>Changing the .pdf preference to open in Acrobat is not an option because one of the functions of my online ERP system allows us to preview .pdf files that we have uploaded in a side bar for entry into our AP system.  For this to work in Firefox, I MUST have the .pdf file optioned to view in Firefox.  Using the Acrobat open option moves that document outside of the entry screen, making it difficult to review and process. </p><p>Using the choose, automatically requires a save, which is redundant since we have already had to save the files to upload it into our ERP.  Using another browser is also not an option.  Edge will not open our web based ERP and Chrome starts glitching after a period of time. I checked for an Acrobat Addon under tools in Firefox to try and resolve this issue, but there is nothing there. </p><p>All of this extra work to complete what should be a simple task is frustrating to say the least.
