Every time I hit ""New Message"" to send an email, Firefox automatically zooms the page in, past the ""Send Message"" button. It seems to be auto-zooming to the ""To:"" line where the cursor flashes on this screen by default. When I type an email, the words are cut off, because the browser is zoomed into the text input area where I write the body of the email. When I try to un-zoom it, I can never get it to zoom all the way out properly again. When I exit the ""New Message"" screen to look at my inbox, it is still zoomed in and cutting text off. How do I fix this? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,other,en-US,"",adampatterson123

However, Firefox sends me an email with a code and requires me to enter that in order to log in. I want to turn this off, so that when I type my password, I immediately log in to my account. How do I do this? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",adampatterson123
