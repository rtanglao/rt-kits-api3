I started to save what I wrote so I could paste the comment again and retry but I still get this error. Even after retrying to re-post the comment several times. This has been happening for over a year now and I've tried to find an answer to fix this problem but I can't determine if this is a Firefox, a Windows 10, or some other program or security issue that is causing this. I've also have run into problems with some websites that have required me to re-register or update information using Firefox and had to use the Google Chrome web browser to do that. The last time that happened was with the UPS site a few weeks ago that I needed to track a package.  Is this another issue with an Invalid Security Token? Is this an issue in Firefox or Windows 10?  Is there some way to find what is causing this problem?  Is there a fix or something I need to change, download or turn off? I've emptied my cash and cookies but these problems persist. Both Firefox and windows are current and have the latest updates. I'm no expert on computers and programs, but I can get through fixes if they are explained well. Some online information seems to assume that you know all the ways to get into a program or folder and just tell you to go to ""X"" folder without mapping directions. Then go to some named program to fix the problem. The biggest problems I've had with that: I have no idea of how to get to that folder and most of the time the name of the folder or program has changed or is in some sub folder that they do not mention. I have been able to fix problems with computers and some programs, but I'm not an expert like you guys are and I don't understand all of the upper high tech language. I guess you could say we are all experts in some things and not so good in others. But if y'all could get back to me on this annoying issue I would appreciate it very much.

I did this using a dual boot laptop with, Ubuntu Linux 20.04.4 and Firefox 103, and Windows 10 with Firefox 101.1. I use the linux side 99.9% of the time. </p><p>I'd initiate a call by clicking on the FB Messenger icon, clicking on the name of the person I wanted to talk with, then clicking on the small phone handset icon. This would bring up a popup window with a picture of the other person, and the sound of a phone ringing followed by the other person answering my call. </p><p>This stopped working late last week (Thursday Aug 11th, I believe). Instead of a popup with the ringing phone, I began getting a popup with the message ""Something went wrong. Try restarting Firefox or restarting your computer. For more troubleshooting suggestions, visit our Help Center. If the issue persists please let us know."" I've attached a screenshot of the message. </p><p>This led me to a series of troubleshooting steps with no success: - clearing my browser cache and cookies - made sure my microphone was available for FB to use and was not muted - rebooting my laptop - doing a Firefox ""Refresh"", which creates a new Firefox profile while removing browser extensions and customizations - logging into a 2nd seldom used linux account I have on the same laptop and trying to initiate a voice chat in Firefox (no luck) - dual booting to Windows 10 and trying it with Firefox 101.1 (no success) - I also tried this on an older desktop pc running Ubuntu 16.04 and Firefox 88 (!). Also, no success and the exact same message as seen in the screenshot. </p><p>What I can also tell you is that in Linux I was able to initiate a FB voice chat call using the Brave and Chrome browsers, and in Windows was able to successfully initiate a call using MS Edge and Brave. </p><p>Based on this, it seems to be either a Firefox issue, or the nice folks at FB changed something that trips up only Firefox. Again, other browsers on two different OS platforms and a separate computer allow me to make these voice calls without issue. </p><p>I'd be glad to provide more information if you need it. I apologize if this was long winded, but I wanted to share as much detail as I could. Thank you very much for your time, and don't hesitate to contact me if I can provide any further information. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1030;,firefox,other,en-US,"",p1977s
