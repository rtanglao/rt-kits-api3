I'm searching for a particular password that may have a data breach, but aside from sorting by username or name I don't see a way to sort for passwords. Or if there was a way to click on the ""show password"" Icon as I scroll through the list of logins without having to click on the icon for each individual account. Safari, for example once you enter a password to ""show passwords"" lets you see each one as you scroll down through the logins. They also let you sort by passwords so I can group the breached passwords all together. It would help if you have a '<em><strong>chat line'</strong></em> or a '<strong>phone number'</strong> that I could discuss options and see if I can find a way to do this easier and faster than what I am faced with now. I hope you can help me. Thank you, Allan F. </p><p>PS From what I'm seeing am I understanding that Firefox does not have a tech support team? Only volunteer users? </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-950;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1472551;1472552;1472553;,allan.frank1

A lot has transpired  </p><p>My son was using 78.15esr. I upgraded it to 91.3esr. After the upgrade the browser worked; tabs loaded, surfing was fine, could go into settings and about:config was fine. </p><p>He went to watch something on Netflix. Netflix complained his browser was not supported and he needed to upgrade to the latest version - which at the time was 91.3esr. </p><p>In frustration he installed Chrome. When he tried to run it he was told software restrictions were in place. I had not set any restrictions, and I checked secpol.msc and there were definitely no path rules defined. If restrictions can be set in group policy I had not set them because I am unaware of them. </p><p>So he installed Microsoft Edge, which installed VC runtime for 2013 and 2015-2019 for both x64 and x86. </p><p>At that point Firefox no longer loads tabs at all. About:&lt;anything&gt; doesn't work. Settings doesn't work. You can't go to safe mode (more on that later), and when closing the browser two processes remain taking about 60 seconds to end. </p><p>I did have the group policy templates for Firefox installed. When I upgraded to FF 91 I installed the latest templates. </p><p>A couple of times when I started FF it complained about vcruntime140 was missing. But just running FF again worked without doing anything else. </p><p>So I reverted to 78.15; I uninstalled v91.3esr. I deleted his profiles.ini and profiles folder and then copied them back from a back up. I removed any registry settings, and copied back the v78 ADML files. I then installed v78.15esr with internet disconnected. Did not run FF after install. Went into group policy editor and turned off telemetry and auto updates then re-enabled internet </p><p>Run FF and same issue. tabs not loading.  Pages not loading. I can click on a menu and I can type into navbar and search bar but there is no response. I checked internet was working.  </p><p>I deleted the %LOCALAPPDATA% cache folders. I flushed the DNS cache. None of this worked. </p><p>So I uninstalled FF again, deleted the profile folders and ini. Disconnected from Internet. Deleted any registry settings, and removed the group policy templates. Then installed 78.15 from scratch and let it create a new profile. </p><p>Same darn problem. It seems to me that installing chrome and/or edge has done something nasty, but I have no idea what. I say that because before he did that he could surf the web, but Netflix just said his browser ver was outdated. </p><p>I tried contacting netflix on chat but they were worse than useless. </p><p>So I uninstalled again and removed everything. Connected the internet and installed FF again and let it update automatically. Same problem. </p><p>I've left him with edge but I need to fix FF. </p><p>I even uninstalled the VCLibs, Chrome and Edge. These did not fix the problem. </p><p>I tried safe mode but when firefox restarts there are two processes that take 60+ seconds to end so FF sits there saying ""restarting..."". When those processes finally end Firefox does not restart.  </p><p>Checked for viruses; nothing found. Rebooted PC several times.  </p><p>So at this point in time; FF will run but will not load the 3 tabs; Facebook, Netflix and youtube. They stay blank.  Settings is not accessable, nor is addon's or logins and passwords. Typing anything on the search bar does nothing Typing anything in the address bar does noting Trying about:config or about:profile or any other about's does nothing. When closing FF two processes take 60+ seconds to end. </p><p>If I go back to him and tell him I need to reinstall Windows he will go absolutely nuts. </p><p>What also worries me is that Netflix said that the most recent esr browser version was not supported and that he should update to a later version. </p><p>And what is even more troubling is I updated his girlfriends PC at the same time and hers works perfectly. This scares the hell out of me because I then expect responses like ""Your sons problem is not a firefox problem"". </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1472554;,citizen1138x

The result is a couple pixels which span the entire side of the other monitor which is extremely annoying.  </p><p>It is hard to post a screenshot of the issue so I will attach a photo from my phone which should make the issue pretty visible. </p><p>Just to clarify. This issue only happens when snapping to half the monitor for example; having firefox and discord taking up half the monitor each. If I make firefox snap to fullscreen the bleed/overflow does not happen. I had this issue on windows 10 but after upgrading to windows 11 I thought it might fix itself but unfortunately I think it is firefox causing this. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",shiroiryu5

It sends me notifications sometimes so when I click these it opens the url from the notification in a new tab next to the web app tab however then web app tab becomes the active one. These are macOS notification centre Notifications. On Chrome it automatically goes to the tab from the notification click. Is there any way to replicate this in Firefox? </p><p>Ps I’ve tried a couple of setting in about:config where you can auto go to a new tab from opening a link on a webpage however this doesn’t fix the issue clicking from a notification.  </p><p>Thanks for any help in advance. </p>,desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",JamesMichael
