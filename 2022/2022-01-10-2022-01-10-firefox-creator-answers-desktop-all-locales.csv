The result is a couple pixels which span the entire side of the other monitor which is extremely annoying.  </p><p>It is hard to post a screenshot of the issue so I will attach a photo from my phone which should make the issue pretty visible. </p><p>Just to clarify. This issue only happens when snapping to half the monitor for example; having firefox and discord taking up half the monitor each. If I make firefox snap to fullscreen the bleed/overflow does not happen. I had this issue on windows 10 but after upgrading to windows 11 I thought it might fix itself but unfortunately I think it is firefox causing this. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",shiroiryu5

It sends me notifications sometimes so when I click these it opens the url from the notification in a new tab next to the web app tab however then web app tab becomes the active one. These are macOS notification centre Notifications. On Chrome it automatically goes to the tab from the notification click. Is there any way to replicate this in Firefox? </p><p>Ps I’ve tried a couple of setting in about:config where you can auto go to a new tab from opening a link on a webpage however this doesn’t fix the issue clicking from a notification.  </p><p>Thanks for any help in advance. </p>,desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",JamesMichael

When I click the Print Button (with the Fit to Page Width icon lit) it only prints a much larger image.  Only the upper left part of the image shown in the print window is printed.  Ctrl-P does the same. This started a week or so ago.  If I select the test on the page, then copy it, insert it into my word processor, then Print from the Word Processor it prints fine, correct size. </p><pre>Ideas? </pre>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-950;firefox-9502;,firefox,other,en-US,"",HCraigM
