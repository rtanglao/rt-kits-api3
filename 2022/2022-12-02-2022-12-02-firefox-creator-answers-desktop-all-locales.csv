I made a firefox account with a (primary) email, e.g. email1@example.com. 2. I followed the instructions here <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-primary-email-address-firefox-accounts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/change-primary-email-address-firefox-accounts</a> to change my primary email. So now I have - primary: email2@example.com, secondary: email1@example.com 3. I delete my secondary email (email1@example.com) </p><p>I want to make a new firefox account with email1@example.com. But when I enter it <a href=""https://accounts.firefox.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://accounts.firefox.com/</a> firefox wants me to log on. (And if I put in the password to the account it was originally tied to, it says to log in with the primary email.) </p><p>The behaviour I expect, especially for firefox which advertises itself on (among other things) privacy, is that if I ""delete"" something from my account, it is actually gone. But clearly, firefox is still keeping track of email1@example.com </p><p>There are other users who tried this in the past but not given a solution: - <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1393844"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1393844</a> - says to disable sync.

However, as the original poster of that question mentions, that would risk locking out both email1@example.com and email2@example.com , at least unless a firefox developer confirms that it would actually delete the data. - <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1329144"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1329144</a> - mentions that from a GitHub discussion, ""a primary email that has been replaced with a new email is Not released for re-use"" </p><p>I could not find that GitHub discussion mentioned, but assuming it is true, I'm wondering if there's a way/where I can make a request to the corresponding developers to implement truly deleting user data (when requested by the user)? </p><p>Thank you! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Raekye

I put the old HDD's as slaves in this new machine. So the old FF is in the slave machine. </p><p>I have also installed new Firefox on this new Win10 LTSC, but when I go looking in my now slave HDD I can see FF, but cannot see any bookmarks. Additionally, when I run the FF executable in the old HDD it still runs the new FF, without the old bookmarks. </p><p>So how can I extract the old bookmarks on the older FF? Without withdrawing the now slave HDD and making it a master again? As it's now missing most of the OS files too. </p><p>Thank you! </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1551455;,satyr37
