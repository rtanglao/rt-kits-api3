I put the old HDD's as slaves in this new machine. So the old FF is in the slave machine. </p><p>I have also installed new Firefox on this new Win10 LTSC, but when I go looking in my now slave HDD I can see FF, but cannot see any bookmarks. Additionally, when I run the FF executable in the old HDD it still runs the new FF, without the old bookmarks. </p><p>So how can I extract the old bookmarks on the older FF? Without withdrawing the now slave HDD and making it a master again? As it's now missing most of the OS files too. </p><p>Thank you! </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1551455;,satyr37
