I just wiped my macbook os and reinstalled macOS (Catalina) with firefox. While firefox on my windows 10 keeps my bookmarks and passwords, firefox on my mac - and even my iphone (ios 16.1.2) - does not sync my passwords, but just my bookmarks. An idea how to solve the issue? Thank for your help! </p><p>Salve a tutti! Sono nuovo e sto cercando aiuto. Ho da poco puliuto il mio mac e reinstallato macOS catalina con firefox.
