Is that possible?,"<p>A few weeks ago I mistakenly delete a few password on firefox passwords, and that passes through sync fast. Now I still have one dormant iOS device (not connected to net) with (no longer on shelf) Firefox lockwise. Are there anyway I can export that, or at least prevent sync? Is that password stored anywhere as a file that can be accessed? </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",youranshen.official
