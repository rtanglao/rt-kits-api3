Clicking on those links to read more ended up with the New Tab thing moving back and forth forever and then I get the note ""Secure Connection Failed:PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR. It did this, the first time, for almost two months and then suddenly cured itself. Next time an upgrade happened I was back to square one. Time line for self fix was a bit shorter, but well over a month. Ditto several more times. I did all the looking and reading and nothing offered helped resolve this issue. More recently...the last month or so...I get ZERO images on incoming emails, regardless who, what, when sends them. For instance, I got a poster, announcing an upcoming art show. I got nothing but blank boxes. Having had this issue with other emails, I've learned that I have to create a forwarded email in order to see any images. I'm still dealing with the inability to open articles, web sites, etc, from and email or other site I'm looking at that may have something of interest.

So even if it is something that firefox itself puts in that folder upon starting a new session why does the data size vary that much? And its not random, it will either be a couple of tens of Kb or around 8Mb.  </p><p>I have ""Delete cookies and site data when firefox is closed"" checked. Under ""Manage exceptions"" there are none.
