(and get it listed on that page) I would also like to be able to try it in my browser (running on Linux btw) before I submit it to Mozilla. </p><p>If I understand it correctly first I need to create the .dic and .aff files used by hunspell. I've done this. I can use the spell-checker on the command line. </p><p>Is that correct? What now? How do I package these files so I can install them locally? How do I submit it to Mozilla? And a bit later: how will I be able to update the version served by Mozilla? </p><p>BTW the source of the project is here: <a href=""https://github.com/szabgab/ladino-diksionaryo-data/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/szabgab/ladino-diksionaryo-data/</a> </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-990;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",szabgab

How can it have site data and/or cookies when it hasnt even visited anything yet? Whats worse is that sometimes it can be around 8Mb. So even if it is something that firefox itself puts in that folder upon starting a new session why does the data size vary that much? And its not random, it will either be a couple of tens of Kb or around 8Mb.  </p><p>I have ""Delete cookies and site data when firefox is closed"" checked. Under ""Manage exceptions"" there are none. History is set to ""Never remember"". </p><p>I actually just checked now. Backed the text above to a file, turned all my addons off, and exited firefox entirely. Made sure there there are no firefox processes running, started it up to blank tab, and first thing I see is that there are 8.8Mb of data under the ""Cookies and site data"" section. I press the clear data button and exit entirely again. No processes running, start a new one, and theres 72Kb of data there. What is that? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",alicewhole

I was using Firefox 100% of the time till you started blocking me from entering email address, I use Firefox for work and some times I have to enter clients email address into forms and your new blocker won't let me enter them.  So, I have to log out of Firefox and open Google Chrome to be able to fill out the forms where I have to enter clients email address.  Please either discontinue the use of this blocker or tell me how to turn it off OR I will have to start using Google Chrome 100% of the time. </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>John W.

Roughly 10 hours later my metamask just crashed and disappeared from my extension toolbar bar. I restarted firefox to see if the problem would be fixed and the add on was still missing from the toolbar. I went into the add ons and themes settings and it was not installed to my surprise. I selected install and now it doesn't recognize my old wallet. I am certain it is the add on. I have the seed phrase, however from my understanding not all accounts appear when reentering the seed phrase. I am not sure what else to do in order to restore all of my old accounts attache to this seedphrase.  </p><p>Why is this happening in firefox?
