Roughly 10 hours later my metamask just crashed and disappeared from my extension toolbar bar. I restarted firefox to see if the problem would be fixed and the add on was still missing from the toolbar. I went into the add ons and themes settings and it was not installed to my surprise. I selected install and now it doesn't recognize my old wallet. I am certain it is the add on. I have the seed phrase, however from my understanding not all accounts appear when reentering the seed phrase. I am not sure what else to do in order to restore all of my old accounts attache to this seedphrase.  </p><p>Why is this happening in firefox? Will it happen again if i continue to use firefox with metamask? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",cryp7ov

(OneTab links, Sidebery configuration, etc.). </p><p>Syncing also appears to be disabled, as while my account is logged in I get no response whenever I hit the ""Turn On Sync"" button. </p><p>My next go-to move would be to refresh the browser and turn sync on to pull everything back. But while I can re-do most of the interface preferences and such, I had a great deal of links saved in OneTab for various projects, browsing etc. so I am really worried about whether I'd lose that data permanently if it isn't gone already so I'm not sure what to do. </p><p>Any help would be most appreciated, thanks! </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-990;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1498738;1498741;1498743;1498748;,jperry0728
