I think all these ""animations"" make my computer lag. </p><p>Hello, </p><p>I would say that <strong>since Firefox 89, my browser has begun lagging</strong> like hell when it loaded some rich Web pages. And I have the impression it is worse with Firefox 107. When I'm saying Firefox lags, I mean it uses heavily my CPU (over 50%), and Firefox is almost unresponsive (for complex Web pages. For Wikipedia or Amazon, I don't have any trouble for example). <strong>I have to wait for Firefox to finish to load the full Web page and to display all elements before the usage of my CPU gets back to 1%</strong>. And it can take several minutes for some sites/pages. </p><p>The problem doesn't come from my connection. And the trouble doesn't come from sites I'm visiting because once all elements are loaded Firefox is responsive. </p><p>More precisely, for some sites, when I start loading the page, Firefox replaces missing (i.e not yet displayed/loaded) elements of the page with a rectangle of the same size of the element and each one of these rectangles are slightly flickering to inform me that AT THIS PLACE there is an element of the same size that is going to be displayed. When I'm saying ""flickering"" I could say it looks like a rectangle with a gradient of gray that is ""waving"" slowly. Sometimes it's a very light gray, sometimes a dark gray. It depends of the sites. </p><p>And all these kind of ""animations"" are killing my computer. And I would like to totally disable these animations/twinkles/flickers/waves. For example, would it be possible to replace the color gradient animation with a static pink color ? </p><p>I have a 10 years old laptop with iGPU (an Intel i5-2410M exactly) without discrete GPU. That doesn't help. I know. For me the trouble comes from there. But currently I can't afford buying a new laptop. I think all my drivers are up to date as my Ubuntu 20.04 is up to date. </p><p><strong>WHAT I'VE TRIED WITHOUT SUCCESS</strong> 1. I removed ‘.mozilla’ folder in my profile (i.e the folder that contains all addons and customizations) 2. Firefox in Safe Mode 3. I disabled hardware acceleration 4. I've tried <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-uses-too-much-memory-or-cpu-resources"" rel=""nofollow"">Firefox uses too much memory or CPU resources</a> </p><p>I really would appreciate your help because now, surfing on some sites becomes a big pain and I'm becoming mad (LOL). </p><p><strong>Thank you in advance :)</strong> </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1070;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1551817;,V-Robin

When I was working I had  Firefox on my computer, my iPhone and my iPad and all three were synced together. Now that I no longer work I don’t have access to the computer any longer. Only my iPhone and iPad. Up until a few weeks ago that was fine. Both of them were still synced. Then, for reasons completely unknown, the one on the iPad became problematic. So, without giving it much thought I, installed a brand new one on the iPad. It told me to set up a login for that one which, I did , again without giving it much thought. Then, when I hit sync, nothing. And I believe that’s where the problem lies. I sat down with the iPad on one side and the iPhone on the other and went through every setting I could find. The only difference I could see was with the account names. The one on the iPhone is “overworked” which I believe was originally on all three. But when I set up the new one on the iPad, once again not giving it enough thought, I used my email address which is “gregcocks193@gmail.com.”  So my belief is that the difference in the account names is why one can’t find the other.  But, what to do?  I don’t want to just experiment because if I do it wrong I could potentially lose the ones on the iPhone, which is the only one left that has all my bookmarks and logins, and if I lose them, they are gone forever.  So I’m hoping you can tell me what to do.  If I need to change one of the account names, which one?  How do I do it. Or is there another way to sync them together, without changing either of the names. I really don’t know.  But since I only have one shot at getting it right I’m not going to do anything until I hear back from you.  I have always used Firefox and nothing else, going all the way back to ver. 17 on the computer, and I don’t want to change.  So now that you know my dilemma, I hope you can help. People ask me why I don’t use Google because it’s the #1 browser, and my answer is always the same. Just because their name is plastered everywhere doesn’t make their browser better. In fact, I think their mobile browser is horrible. So please give me some advice on what to do so I can continue using Firefox.  </p><p>Thanks for taking the time to read this and I look forward to getting your help.  </p><p>Take care Greg </p>",desktop;sync;,firefox,sync,en-US,1551809;,gregcocks193

Emptying Firefox cache, Refreshing Firefox many times, Running Windows 11 clean up corrupt files, making sure there is no spy wear of bad files on the computer.  I have reinstalled Firefox many times but the problem quickly returns.  ( I have wondered if something on my computer is corrupting Firefox, but I cant think, or find out, what it my be.)  I have run the program Restoro many times which claims to correct problems but it doesn't fix this one.   Had a technician look at it, but his advise was to contact Mozilla.  The problem does not always happen and is worse when I first turn the computer on. It plays up on the first new Bookmark I make and then sometimes works correctly.  My Bookmark folder is very large and contains much information in a Book, Chapter, Paragraph, Sentence structure.  Has anyone experience this problem and how did they fix it?

This is highly inconvenient and annoying. I've reset Firefox completely and the issue was not fixed, as well as doing a clean install. Because of how often and consistent the problem has been, I've had trouble finding out the source of this issue. This has been an issue for at minimum a month, most likely longer but my first mention of it to one of my friends was a month ago. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",alyssaclairestrawn

I am an end user, not versed in IT. I have used Firefox as a fast and safe browser for approximately 20 years and with Adblock Plus for over 10 years. Previously once I refreshed or reloaded Firefox it wiped out my navigation bar and bookmarks. Some friends have said that this is a tactic to encourage change to the for-profit paid version.  Also when this happens I get a window for reporting the problem to Microsoft which hangs indefinitely and I have to close it. Again is this a tactic from Microsoft to get me to select Edge and Bing as my default browser and search engine? Or is this a problem with Norton360 software or their VPN?  Or is this due to a failing hard drive (not SSD), registry errors or malaware? What's up and is there a simple fix? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",fila_15.7
