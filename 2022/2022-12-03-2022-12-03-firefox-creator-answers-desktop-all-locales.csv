1398611,2022-12-03 11:01:09 -0800,2022-12-03 11:01:09 -0800,Problem with syncing two browsers,"<p>Hello </p><p>I’ll make this as brief as possible, so here goes. When I was working I had  Firefox on my computer, my iPhone and my iPad and all three were synced together. Now that I no longer work I don’t have access to the computer any longer. Only my iPhone and iPad. Up until a few weeks ago that was fine. Both of them were still synced. Then, for reasons completely unknown, the one on the iPad became problematic. So, without giving it much thought I, installed a brand new one on the iPad. It told me to set up a login for that one which, I did , again without giving it much thought. Then, when I hit sync, nothing. And I believe that’s where the problem lies. I sat down with the iPad on one side and the iPhone on the other and went through every setting I could find. The only difference I could see was with the account names. The one on the iPhone is “overworked” which I believe was originally on all three. But when I set up the new one on the iPad, once again not giving it enough thought, I used my email address which is “gregcocks193@gmail.com.”  So my belief is that the difference in the account names is why one can’t find the other.  But, what to do?  I don’t want to just experiment because if I do it wrong I could potentially lose the ones on the iPhone, which is the only one left that has all my bookmarks and logins, and if I lose them, they are gone forever.  So I’m hoping you can tell me what to do.  If I need to change one of the account names, which one?  How do I do it. Or is there another way to sync them together, without changing either of the names. I really don’t know.  But since I only have one shot at getting it right I’m not going to do anything until I hear back from you.  I have always used Firefox and nothing else, going all the way back to ver. 17 on the computer, and I don’t want to change.  So now that you know my dilemma, I hope you can help. People ask me why I don’t use Google because it’s the #1 browser, and my answer is always the same. Just because their name is plastered everywhere doesn’t make their browser better. In fact, I think their mobile browser is horrible. So please give me some advice on what to do so I can continue using Firefox.  </p><p>Thanks for taking the time to read this and I look forward to getting your help.  </p><p>Take care Greg </p>",desktop;sync;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",gregcocks193

Sometimes when I go to save a new bookmark, as soon as I start typing, the new bookmark vanish.  I then have to go into bookmarks menu, find the new bookmark which may be titled ""No Title"" or just a ""small square"" and re-title it. As I start typing the first letter of the new Title. The typed letter appears on my screen and quickly vanishes.  I have to retype the first letter again and then it works correctly. I have tried many things to fix this. Emptying Firefox cache, Refreshing Firefox many times, Running Windows 11 clean up corrupt files, making sure there is no spy wear of bad files on the computer.  I have reinstalled Firefox many times but the problem quickly returns.  ( I have wondered if something on my computer is corrupting Firefox, but I cant think, or find out, what it my be.)  I have run the program Restoro many times which claims to correct problems but it doesn't fix this one.   Had a technician look at it, but his advise was to contact Mozilla.  The problem does not always happen and is worse when I first turn the computer on. It plays up on the first new Bookmark I make and then sometimes works correctly.  My Bookmark folder is very large and contains much information in a Book, Chapter, Paragraph, Sentence structure.  Has anyone experience this problem and how did they fix it?  I use a dedicated Solid-state drive for my bookmarks and according to Samsung Magician it is working correctly. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-11;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",Bonnermartin1

I am an end user, not versed in IT. I have used Firefox as a fast and safe browser for approximately 20 years and with Adblock Plus for over 10 years. Previously once I refreshed or reloaded Firefox it wiped out my navigation bar and bookmarks. Some friends have said that this is a tactic to encourage change to the for-profit paid version.  Also when this happens I get a window for reporting the problem to Microsoft which hangs indefinitely and I have to close it. Again is this a tactic from Microsoft to get me to select Edge and Bing as my default browser and search engine? Or is this a problem with Norton360 software or their VPN?  Or is this due to a failing hard drive (not SSD), registry errors or malaware? What's up and is there a simple fix? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",fila_15.7
