I am an end user, not versed in IT. I have used Firefox as a fast and safe browser for approximately 20 years and with Adblock Plus for over 10 years. Previously once I refreshed or reloaded Firefox it wiped out my navigation bar and bookmarks. Some friends have said that this is a tactic to encourage change to the for-profit paid version.  Also when this happens I get a window for reporting the problem to Microsoft which hangs indefinitely and I have to close it. Again is this a tactic from Microsoft to get me to select Edge and Bing as my default browser and search engine? Or is this a problem with Norton360 software or their VPN?  Or is this due to a failing hard drive (not SSD), registry errors or malaware? What's up and is there a simple fix? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",fila_15.7
