I've tried re-installing a few times, and even after completely un-installing older versions, including clearing cache data etc., but the same thing happens.  Are there a few 'bugs' to fix in the new ""100"" version or is another browser sabotaging this version in some way? I didn't have problems with earlier versions. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",noel5290

Deleting cache. Signing out of Facebook. Also adjusting the backspace key in my Config. Having no problems on my Android phone or when using Opera. It's on on Firefox and on Facebook. FACEBOOK screen suddenly moves to the bottom of the screen when I am typing a comment. Whenever I hit SHIFT+alpha_letter at the beginning of a line OR simply hit the backspace key, the screen suddenly shifts to the very bottom of the page again even if I have tried to scroll the page back up to the middle of the screen manually. This shifts the entry area where I'm typing down and sometimes off of the visible screen entirely. Just hitting the backspace to correct a typo causes the screen to scroll on its own. I have to scroll back down to the entry box and if I make another typo, it happens again. </p>",desktop;windows-10;firefox-1000;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1504054;,fu22
