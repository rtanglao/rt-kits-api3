Is there any easier way to bring them back to show in the browser page's top as before. They are sitting in the folders but now showing up anymore. Tried dragging them but them won't budge. Closed out browser, restarted macbook - nothing worked. It's already wasted so much time in researching and troubleshooting without a fully applicable instruction anywhere for a mac user trying to resolve this issue. </p><p>Also, tried to upload image in word or pdf, but it doesn't work with the format here perhaps. Not sure what else can I easily and quickly try.  </p><p>Please help, thx! </p>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",bjazzmk
