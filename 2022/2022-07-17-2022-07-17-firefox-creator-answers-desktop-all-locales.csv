Closed out browser, restarted macbook - nothing worked. It's already wasted so much time in researching and troubleshooting without a fully applicable instruction anywhere for a mac user trying to resolve this issue. </p><p>Also, tried to upload image in word or pdf, but it doesn't work with the format here perhaps. Not sure what else can I easily and quickly try.  </p><p>Please help, thx! </p>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,1520216;,bjazzmk
