You can see the tab load, and the name of the site show up there, but nothing ever displays, not a flicker of color or anything. I've cleared cookies and site data, I've turned the tracking protections off and on, so far nothing I've tried has had any effect. I visited Reddit on another browser and it works fine, so it's clearly a Firefox issue. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1020;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1515989;1515995;,sirpenrose

I've been submitting these on a regular basis and hoped that Version 102 would contain a fix, but the issue continues. </p><p>So today I've created some minimum-to-reproduce examples, in each case using the same setup, but closing Firefox in a different manner: </p><p>Setup:  Firefox for Windows V 102 installed today. Windows 10 is up to date. I open Firefox in troubleshooting mode, which displays my home page, located on a shared server that I use for a website and other stuff I want to be able to access from anywhere.  Nothing exotic, just a list of links.  That works. </p><p>Then, without doing anything else (for purposes of these tests), I close Firefox via one of the following (with associated report ID): </p> <ul><li> Click on large X in the upper right corner of the window. </li></ul> <pre>   bp-e31ef7d6-8d17-41c8-a204-0e53c0220630e </pre> <ul><li> In the window menu, select File &gt; Exit. </li></ul> <pre>  bp-d15f97c8-267f-4550-9d42-69eb70220630 </pre> <ul><li> On the task bar, RMB on Firefox, then select 'Close window'. </li></ul> <pre> bp-39756c12-ccb7-4f83-998a-ec8030220630 </pre> <p>My system is an HP laptop with AMD Vision A6 processor.  My wife uses a Dell all-in-one on the same wired network and does not experience the crash-on-close symptom.  This makes me suspect my hardware, but just tested with other browsers: </p><p>Chrome - Blocked my home page (never saw that before, but I use Firefox...) until I removed the block from Settings.  Closed without crashing. Edge - Updated itself, then gave me the same ""Not secure"" warning as Chrome, but displayed the home page anyway.  Closed without crashing. </p><p>In all cases, the link to my home page is specified as http://, not https:// My wife's system is set up the same way. </p><p>My question: How can I get Firefox to close gracefully, without spitting out a crash report 1-2 minutes later?  Note that I can OPEN Firefox and use it for hours without incident, but if I close it and do something else, when I close THAT, there's the Firefox crash report window underneath. </p><p>I just ran the <a href=""http://w3.org"" rel=""nofollow"">w3.org</a> validator on my home page and I see that a few errors have crept in,. mostly unencoded ampersands.  I'll fix those, but if that caused a problem for Firefox, would it wait until much later to crash?  And why only on my system, not my wife's? </p><p>Suggestions? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1020;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1515974;1515981;,CBeall

Any modifications to the browser, including themes and colors and appearance mods ...are displayed when you open the browser to surf, (32-bit,) but if I click from an email link - it opens the uppermost executable instead - with none of the mods I have made to the browser. (So the browser as it first appeared on install, with no/zero/nada customizations and extensions.) I cannot see how to make an email link refer to the deeper executable. Get it?
