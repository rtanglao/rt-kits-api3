Any modifications to the browser, including themes and colors and appearance mods ...are displayed when you open the browser to surf, (32-bit,) but if I click from an email link - it opens the uppermost executable instead - with none of the mods I have made to the browser. (So the browser as it first appeared on install, with no/zero/nada customizations and extensions.) I cannot see how to make an email link refer to the deeper executable. Get it? Thanks for any assistance. (!) </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,other,en-US,1515951;,KentClark
