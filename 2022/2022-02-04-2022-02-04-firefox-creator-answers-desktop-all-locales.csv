This causes the main window to resize vertically. Any content that is sized based on the height of the window is also resized which causes a visible 'glitch' in the display.  My specific use-case is a music rehearsal page that displays an SVG <img> of the music score beside the HTML5 &lt;audio&gt; controls. The height of the <img> is defined, in css, as 'height: 100vh;' so that the whole page is visible. I would like to be able to revert to Firefox's previous behaviour of displaying an icon _beside_ the tab title. Any other solution that does not increase the height of the tab could also be of use. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",linux;desktop;tabs;firefox-960;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",jlemcke1
