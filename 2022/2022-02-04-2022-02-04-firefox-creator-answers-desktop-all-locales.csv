Unfortunately I'm having an issue with it on Laptop. </p><p>I start Firefox and all is fine but after a while of opening new pages or browsing to other sites, Firefox just stops loading pages. The period of time is shorter the more active I am. I can't navigate back or forward, or refresh, or goto Home either. I close Firefox but the process remains open in task manager for a period of time. If I try to reopen firefox from desktop it wont start for a bit but after a period of time I'll get a msg saying firefox is still open and need to close to restart it. I then restart it and its fine, until the above problem reoccurs. </p><p>I've tried the following to fix it with no success: </p><p>- disabled hardware accel - removed all addons - refreshed firefox - uninstalled Firefox (and deleted anything I could find related to FF like registry entries and profile folders) and reinstalled </p><p>Nothing worked. </p><p>My desktop PC is pretty much identical to laptop...same addons, same programs, but have not had the same issue. The only real diff is I've upgraded the laptop to Windows 11 (desktop still Win 10) but the issue did not occur immediately after, probably a week later. </p><p>Any thoughts? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",cdchi1975

I accidentally closed the main page with all the many tabs first and thus the single tab page was closed last which means the command to restore or open all the tabs doesn't work.  You have the choice on the Firefox set up to Open the pages that were open when you closed. Unfortunately is there are what appear to be 2 Firefox browsers open if the unwanted one is closed last -- all the tabs from the other one do not restore and I can't find them in any kind of history. </p><p>Is there anyway to find/restore these tabs?  Many were open and some of those to remind me of things I can't now remember were there, so I cannot find the information. </p><p>Thank you for ANY help with this. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-960;firefox-9603;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1480666;1480670;,phtcac

However, quite often on a customer service chat there is no notification when the rep's answer comes back after researching an issue. What has to happen to get an audible sound when a chat answer comes in? </p><p>E.g. Tripadvisor help chat </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-950;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",jonsevy

When I try to send an email from my xfinity account the reply or forward button do not perform.  I log into Chrome instead of Firefox and the functions work fine.  Is there something I need to set on the Firefox side?  This function worked with my old computer on Firefox. </p><p>Melody Brunetti </p>,desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",brunettimelody
