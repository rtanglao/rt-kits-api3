Not sure if this a rendering issue causing by Firefox producing an image instead of rendering it to the print spooler as text. </p><p>In the attached image this does not look as pronounced (image created from Firefox 96.0.3 64-bit), but in Firefox 91.4.0 ESR &amp; 91.4.1 ESR we have seen the difference between the PDF print job being up to 10x in size. This has caused printing of the same 10 page PDF to take 10-15 minutes vs 10-30 seconds. The size difference has been 13MB vs 700KB. Users are seeing the print job take much longer to get started and pauses between pages of up to 30-90 seconds depending on the content of the page. Obviously, details vary between PDFs. </p><p>I have noticed that newer versions of Firefox do not appear to have as pronounced of a problem, so it may have already been fixed. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",joe+firefox

Unfortunately I'm having an issue with it on Laptop. </p><p>I start Firefox and all is fine but after a while of opening new pages or browsing to other sites, Firefox just stops loading pages. The period of time is shorter the more active I am. I can't navigate back or forward, or refresh, or goto Home either. I close Firefox but the process remains open in task manager for a period of time. If I try to reopen firefox from desktop it wont start for a bit but after a period of time I'll get a msg saying firefox is still open and need to close to restart it. I then restart it and its fine, until the above problem reoccurs. </p><p>I've tried the following to fix it with no success: </p><p>- disabled hardware accel - removed all addons - refreshed firefox - uninstalled Firefox (and deleted anything I could find related to FF like registry entries and profile folders) and reinstalled </p><p>Nothing worked. </p><p>My desktop PC is pretty much identical to laptop...same addons, same programs, but have not had the same issue. The only real diff is I've upgraded the laptop to Windows 11 (desktop still Win 10) but the issue did not occur immediately after, probably a week later. </p><p>Any thoughts? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1480673;1480679;,cdchi1975

I accidentally closed the main page with all the many tabs first and thus the single tab page was closed last which means the command to restore or open all the tabs doesn't work.  You have the choice on the Firefox set up to Open the pages that were open when you closed. Unfortunately is there are what appear to be 2 Firefox browsers open if the unwanted one is closed last -- all the tabs from the other one do not restore and I can't find them in any kind of history. </p><p>Is there anyway to find/restore these tabs?  Many were open and some of those to remind me of things I can't now remember were there, so I cannot find the information. </p><p>Thank you for ANY help with this. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-960;firefox-9603;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1480666;1480670;,phtcac
