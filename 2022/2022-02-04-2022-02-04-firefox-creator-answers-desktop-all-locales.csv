I accidentally closed the main page with all the many tabs first and thus the single tab page was closed last which means the command to restore or open all the tabs doesn't work.  You have the choice on the Firefox set up to Open the pages that were open when you closed. Unfortunately is there are what appear to be 2 Firefox browsers open if the unwanted one is closed last -- all the tabs from the other one do not restore and I can't find them in any kind of history. </p><p>Is there anyway to find/restore these tabs?  Many were open and some of those to remind me of things I can't now remember were there, so I cannot find the information. </p><p>Thank you for ANY help with this. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-960;firefox-9603;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1480666;1480670;,phtcac

When I try to send an email from my xfinity account the reply or forward button do not perform.  I log into Chrome instead of Firefox and the functions work fine.  Is there something I need to set on the Firefox side?  This function worked with my old computer on Firefox. </p><p>Melody Brunetti </p>,desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",brunettimelody
