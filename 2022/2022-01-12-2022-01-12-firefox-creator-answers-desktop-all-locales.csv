I did a few online searches and it appears to be a common issue but I could not find a solution so I thought I'd ask a question.

I can log in to Vanguard just fine on Firefox.  But when I try to open certain sections of the Vanguard site i get a blank page.  For example:  --a few weeks ago I went to the ""Security"" section of my Vanguard profile to see if Vanguard accepts security keys.  I clicked on the  ""Security Keys"" icon and got a blank page instead of a description.  When I tried Chrome I got a the Vanguard description of how Vanguard works with security keys. --today I got a an email from Vanguard telling me to retrieve a message in my Vanguard message center.  I logged onto Vanguard and went to the message center, clicked on the message and a blank page came up instead of my message. I could read the message when I used Chrome. I spoke to Vanguard and was told that they are ""aware of the issue. with the Firefox browser and suggested using Chrome""  It didn't sound like adjusting to Firefox was a priority for them. I would much prefer to use Firefox rather than Chrome but don't know how to proceed.  I read through the solutions in the Firefox Help section relating to Vanguard but none of the questions/solutions appear to be on point. Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.   Thank you. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-950;firefox-9502;,firefox,other,en-US,1472980;1472983;1472987;,peggywarner
