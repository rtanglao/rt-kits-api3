So much space is wasted.  I like the spacing they had before that version.  I just want to go on record as giving feedback that I don't like it, and wish it went back to the original spacing.   I have looked at <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1346987"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1346987</a> and know there's all sorts of weird stuff I can do to customize my Firefox to get the spacing I want, however, my point with this post is to get feedback back to the Firefox developers to see if they will consider changing it back. If posting here is not the best way to get feedback back to the developers/designers/product-owners, please let me know the best way.  I couldn't find another way. </p>",windows-7;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-950;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1473053;1473054;,danwelborn
