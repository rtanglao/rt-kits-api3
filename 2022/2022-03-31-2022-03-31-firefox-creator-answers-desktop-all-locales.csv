I noticed that Firefox (98.0.2) doesn't even ask if the file should be saved or opened with a program when downloading some file types. Unfortunately, these file types (e.g. GPX) are not listed under Settings --&gt; General --&gt; Files and Applications, so that I could assign them to a program or specify that they should always be asked. And I can't add these files somehow... I have also deleted the file ""handler.json"" in the profile folder, hoping to be asked then. But that doesn't happen. GPX files, for example, are assigned to the GSAK program in the system - but Firefox just wants to save them and doesn't offer the option to open them directly in GSAK. Does anyone know advice how I can get Firefox to give me the choice? Thanks a lot. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,customize,en-US,1493875;,oliver.privat
