It's an account I have for work and it was created while I was a temp. I got hired on by the company and they disabled my old AD account and that is the email I used to create a Firefox sync account. I don't have access to that email account anymore so therefore cannot receive a verification email to log in. I would like to change the email on that account to my new address. I really need all those bookmarks. We support well over a hundred different services and such, and it would take weeks or months to build up these bookmarks again.  I have the login info for that Firefox account. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10603;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",DukeStallion

I have tried scanning the QR code on my PC multiple times on each authentication app and retrieving multiple codes each time, but all entries stated ""incorrect 6 digit code"" on my PC to enable 2FA. I am not sure how this is not working. Both authenticator apps identified my correct login email address associated with my Mozilla account so I know it must have something to do with whatever is happening on the back end at Mozilla for my account.  </p><p>Also, I have read a few posts in the Mozilla support knowledgebase regarding this very same issue, but did not see any resolution. I would really like to have 2FA. Can someone please contact me about this? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1060;firefox-10601;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",carlod

I have told firefox not to remember my password but it is remembering the bank account number which automatically pops up when I am on the banks log in page. How do I stop this? Also when I signed up for this firefox help it asked for an email address and all my email addresses poped up for me to chose from. I didn't like this either. Appreciate any help. If these features can't be turned off whats the last version I can use that won't do this?  cheers Neil </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1060;firefox-10603;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",ihatespam666

If I click control shift O it brings up the bookmarks, now I know you can go under ""views"" then ""sort"", then ""added"", but that still does not sort it properly. I just recently bookmarked a random page, tagging with a name so I remember which one it is. Now if I do this correctly that new bookmark I made should either be on the bottom or the top of the page after I sort it. But that is not the case. It's just mixed in somewhere in the middle. I tried sorting a few different ways, but no luck. PLEASE HELP! </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10603;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1545454;,stephanegli313
