Due to a mismatch in frame time, no animation looks smooth at this frame rate on my display unfortunately. This behavior is exaggerated when running firefox maximized, as the frame rate is noticeably higher when running on a smaller window. </p><p>I've had a similar issue in the past on an older Nvidia GPU, where the driver wasn't upping the GPU clock automatically on firefox, so i decided to force max clocks on the GPU yet i didn't notice a performane difference this time. I've also tried running running firefox in troubleshooting mode and have tried firefox nightly with no extensions, to no avail in both cases. Hardware acceleration is enabled on my system and nothing on about:support would indicate it's opting for software rendering instead, so I'm unsure as to how to go on troubleshooting this issue. </p><p>The GPU is a Geforce 1660 Super on a Ryzen 5 3600 powered system, so i guess it should be able to do smooth hardware acceleration as it (mostly) does on chrome and electron powered apps. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",christos.ath4

I also read that Google Chrome and other browsers do not enforce this, which is probably why this is only happening on Firefox for him. </p><p>This leads me to assume that there is a good chance that McAfee or some other setting on his device is causing this to occur and explains why he is only seeing this issue with Firefox.  </p><p>I did see some people mention this only happens when entering a passcode into the 2FA prompt, so maybe have this user try the Duo Push option for 2FA (if he hasn't already) and see if that works. </p><p><br> </p><p><br> </p><p>Any assistance will be greatly appreciated.

I can't!  Amazingly to me, the .msi file type can not be added to the list manually.  There is no ""Add File Type"" functionality in there.

If I click control shift O it brings up the bookmarks, now I know you can go under ""views"" then ""sort"", then ""added"", but that still does not sort it properly. I just recently bookmarked a random page, tagging with a name so I remember which one it is. Now if I do this correctly that new bookmark I made should either be on the bottom or the top of the page after I sort it. But that is not the case. It's just mixed in somewhere in the middle. I tried sorting a few different ways, but no luck. PLEASE HELP! </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10603;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1545454;,stephanegli313
