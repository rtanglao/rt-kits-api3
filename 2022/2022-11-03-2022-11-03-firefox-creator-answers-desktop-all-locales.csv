If I click control shift O it brings up the bookmarks, now I know you can go under ""views"" then ""sort"", then ""added"", but that still does not sort it properly. I just recently bookmarked a random page, tagging with a name so I remember which one it is. Now if I do this correctly that new bookmark I made should either be on the bottom or the top of the page after I sort it. But that is not the case. It's just mixed in somewhere in the middle. I tried sorting a few different ways, but no luck. PLEASE HELP! </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10603;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",stephanegli313
