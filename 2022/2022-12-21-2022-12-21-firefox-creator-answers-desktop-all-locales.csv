That drive developed a number of bad sectors and finally gave out.  I replaced the drive with an identical one, but it turns out the backup of the drive was also corrupted and so I had to re-install all the programs that were located there, including Firefox. </p><p>Using another browser (Edge), I successfully downloaded the ""Firefox Setup 108.0.1.exe"" file from the Mozilla site to a different drive and ran it from there.  Unfortunately, I failed to specify the P: drive as the location and it installed to the C: drive instead.  When I ran it after the install, it worked fine though.  All my preferences and bookmarks, and stored passwords etc. were intact. </p><p>But space on my C: drive is very tight and I needed it on my P: drive instead.  So I tried re-installing again, this time on my P: drive, and the setup program said it was removing it from the old location first.  Then it installed FIrefox on my P: drive.  But when it started up this time, none of my profile data was there.  And as soon as I tried to go to any website (e.g., <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google.com</a> or <a href=""https://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://google.com</a>) I received a ""The connection was reset"" message or ""Secure Connection Failed"" message (with an error code of PR_CONNECT_RESET_ERROR). </p><p>I checked my Windows Defender firewall to ensure the Firefox.exe application was on the list of apps with permissions to go through the firewall.  I removed the one that was there and then re-added it to be sure.  But that didn't help. </p><p>I checked my Anti-Virus app (Kaspersky) and tried turning off File Anti-Virus and/or Web Anti-Virus protections, but that had no effect either. </p><p>I'm not having any problems using my Edge browser or other applications that access the internet through their own methods (e.g., Microsoft Outlook).  And I can use the Ping app in a CMD window to reach both internal and external servers and resources (like my network printer).  I can enter my printer's network address in Edge to display its control dashboard, but I cannot use Firefox to do the same. </p><p>I tried clearing my cache and all data and history etc., to no avail.  I tried uninstalling and re-installing Firefox, but that didn't make a difference.  I still get the same errors. </p><p>I'm at a loss as to what to do next to get this working. </p><p><br> Bill Bowlus-Root BillBR@brincnet.com </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",BillBR
