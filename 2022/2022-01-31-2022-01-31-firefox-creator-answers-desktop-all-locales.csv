I tried to uncheck the box, as I prefer to not share the information, but the window was frozen, and I had to cycle the power in my laptop to reinitialize Firefox.   </p><p>Given the instability with the crash and the frozen window I'm not sure if the incident ended up being reported or not, but I didn't authorize that the incident be reported and I don't authorize Mozilla to use the information in any way.  I would appreciate it if you could help to ensure that my information remains private.  Security is one of the main reasons that I use Firefox. </p><p>Thanks, Rob Reiner </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Rob_reiner

I am using a custom theme (this one: <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/tardis/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=search"" rel=""nofollow"">https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/tardis/?utm_source=addons.mozilla.org&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=search</a>) that Firefox identifies as dark, however I absolutely hate any form of dark mode. So far I figured out how to force Firefox to use a light theme everywhere else using about:config, but I couldn't figure out how to change the abovementioned elemtents back to light without changing the theme. So is there any way to declare a theme as light or some other way to change this behavior? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-960;firefox-9603;,firefox,customize,en-US,1479625;1479627;1479639;1479640;,frasiwa
