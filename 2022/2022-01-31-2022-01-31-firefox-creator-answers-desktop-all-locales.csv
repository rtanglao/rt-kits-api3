The phishing awareness webpage needs to resemble an actual phishing page to see which users would enter their credentials.  </p><p>Both Google Chrome and FireFox are protected by Google Safe Browsing which (correctly) flags the webpage as phishing. I'm aware that sites which are incorrectly flagged could be appealed, but the site is meant to masquerade as a phishing website.  </p><p>That's why I would like to create an exception for the company users to be able to access this specific webpage without the red screen warning the user.  </p><p>On Google Chrome, I was able to download the GPO and edit the allow list for safe browsing: GPO: <a href=""https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/187202?hl=en#zippy=%2Cwindows"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/187202?hl=en#zippy=%2Cwindows</a> GPO Safe Browsing setting: https://admx.help/?Category=Chrome&amp;Policy=Google.Policies.Chrome::SafeBrowsingAllowlistDomains </p><p>I tried to do the same thing for Firefox: GPO: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/customizing-firefox-using-group-policy-windows"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/customizing-firefox-using-group-policy-windows</a> </p><p>I downloaded the Policy template for Firefox 96 (template v3.5) but I couldn't find an option to configure an allow list for safe browsing. I don't want to weaken the overall security by disabling safe browsing altogether.   </p><p>Are there any other options I could take, or is there simply no way to configure safe browsing settings for Firefox?  </p><p>Best Regards Andrea </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;escalate;developer;windows-10;phishing;firefox-960;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Andrea_6767

( Why am I not surprised) I especially hate the auto-play videos that play without sound. So I not only have to unmute the video, I also have to manual adjust the video slider to the start of the video. How I want my web experience to be, I press a play button when I decide to watch the video.

I tried to uncheck the box, as I prefer to not share the information, but the window was frozen, and I had to cycle the power in my laptop to reinitialize Firefox.   </p><p>Given the instability with the crash and the frozen window I'm not sure if the incident ended up being reported or not, but I didn't authorize that the incident be reported and I don't authorize Mozilla to use the information in any way.  I would appreciate it if you could help to ensure that my information remains private.
