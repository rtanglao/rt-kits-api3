Since FF v103 it seems, when working with a VPN, and then trying to use also a browser extension VPN, it either does not or does not connect until after 45s. Before it was immediate. It works in all other browsers (incl FF before v103). So this is a recent change in FF that harms normal VPN connections. I found out by trial and error, that changing the port of the VPN extension to 443 and disabling and enabling the extension and going back to v103 from v103.0.1 helped, but that should not be like that. So something has been broken in the latest v103.0.1 - please kindly look into it. Thank you! </p> <dl><dd>) </dd></dl>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-1030;,firefox,other,en-US,1525653;,spdgnzls
1385448,2022-08-08 03:50:22 -0700,2022-08-08 07:51:20 -0700,FF wont stop deleting cookies,"<p>I notice some problems with firefox since the latest update: </p><p>1. Right after the update I enabled the settings to empty the cookies each time FF is closed down (""Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed""). But, I ended not liking this feature since it constantly demanded me to remember my passcodes and became a headache, so I disabled it. But FF still continues deleting cookies each time, and seem to be stuck on deleting cookies.  </p><p>I've been given various suggestions to go to resolve this, like reinstall, config, etc., uninstall apps, but nothing helps. </p><p>2. Another issue I have is FF with Facebook. Using Facebook in FF I can't backspace and I can't post any comment. If I try to post comments it simply moves the cursor down on the page but you can't post anything. </p><p>None of these issues continue in other browsers so it must be FF related. </p><p>3. FF seem to use enormous amount of memory and power usage, especially when multiple tabs are open (or even if tabs are not open it shows previous tabs in the Task Manager). I'm not a programmer or coder but a friend of mine who was a senior programmer in the banking industry told me it's possible for coders to solve this issue. If I understood him right (and I apologize if my wording is wrong), a solution would be to keep tabs in sleep state if they are open but not active on top so they don't keep running or updating data all the time. This of course would need consideration that sometimes people want to listen to videos or audio while using other tabs - but that would involve every single tab and can perhaps be provided as an option.  </p><p>Many people like to keep multiple tabs open, yet still have good browsing performance. Maybe there can be a new project to offer better tab management to make them easily visible and accessible? Bookmarks are not that great because they disapper into a long stream of text without clarity what exactly they are until you open the page, and even then scrolling down and using bookmarks is not that great if you have many saved...... </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,cookies,en-US,1525663;1525666;,account2022
