But FF still continues deleting cookies each time, and seem to be stuck on deleting cookies.  </p><p>I've been given various suggestions to go to resolve this, like reinstall, config, etc., uninstall apps, but nothing helps. </p><p>2. Another issue I have is FF with Facebook. Using Facebook in FF I can't backspace and I can't post any comment. If I try to post comments it simply moves the cursor down on the page but you can't post anything. </p><p>None of these issues continue in other browsers so it must be FF related. </p><p>3. FF seem to use enormous amount of memory and power usage, especially when multiple tabs are open (or even if tabs are not open it shows previous tabs in the Task Manager). I'm not a programmer or coder but a friend of mine who was a senior programmer in the banking industry told me it's possible for coders to solve this issue. If I understood him right (and I apologize if my wording is wrong), a solution would be to keep tabs in sleep state if they are open but not active on top so they don't keep running or updating data all the time. This of course would need consideration that sometimes people want to listen to videos or audio while using other tabs - but that would involve every single tab and can perhaps be provided as an option.  </p><p>Many people like to keep multiple tabs open, yet still have good browsing performance. Maybe there can be a new project to offer better tab management to make them easily visible and accessible? Bookmarks are not that great because they disapper into a long stream of text without clarity what exactly they are until you open the page, and even then scrolling down and using bookmarks is not that great if you have many saved...... </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,cookies,en-US,1525663;1525666;1525669;1525673;1525678;1525682;,account2022

Task manager shows firefox running at 70% or more I have tried all the power management settings and that makes no difference. The Nvidia Gforce940 appears not to be used at all. All my drivers are up to date I have tried firefox troubleshoot mode, which makes no difference full screen mode or not makes no difference (its a 4k screen so I wondered if it was doing some kind of upscaling) makes no difference whether I run on external monitor or internal.  Also makes no difference whether the laptop is connected to my thunderbolt dock or not. I can run the same content side by side in Chrome.  Chrome displays the video smoothly with no glitches at all and consumes around 16% CPU (still no Nvidia GPU utilisation) </p><p>This problem does not happen on my other PC, a 5 year old Intel NUC, with i5 cpu, also running win 10 connected to my TV. </p><p>If i can't fix this I will have to very reluctantly revert to Chrome for video streaming I havent worked uot how to obtain the troubleshooting info to share but happy to do this if necessary </p><p>many thanks John </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jcpw
