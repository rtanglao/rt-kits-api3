Streaming any video (e.g. BBC iPlayer or GCN+ or any source I have tried) Video very choppy, freezes for several seconds while audio continues as normal.  this is essentially unusable. Task manager shows firefox running at 70% or more I have tried all the power management settings and that makes no difference. The Nvidia Gforce940 appears not to be used at all. All my drivers are up to date I have tried firefox troubleshoot mode, which makes no difference full screen mode or not makes no difference (its a 4k screen so I wondered if it was doing some kind of upscaling) makes no difference whether I run on external monitor or internal.  Also makes no difference whether the laptop is connected to my thunderbolt dock or not. I can run the same content side by side in Chrome.  Chrome displays the video smoothly with no glitches at all and consumes around 16% CPU (still no Nvidia GPU utilisation) </p><p>This problem does not happen on my other PC, a 5 year old Intel NUC, with i5 cpu, also running win 10 connected to my TV. </p><p>If i can't fix this I will have to very reluctantly revert to Chrome for video streaming I havent worked uot how to obtain the troubleshooting info to share but happy to do this if necessary </p><p>many thanks John </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jcpw
