First, one open page stopped updating (webmail), but others (e.g., weather) still worked. Soon, progressively, nothing worked, and it wouldn't open new pages, links, or bookmarks. I downloaded a new version, 106.0.1, but that dmg file wouldn't open: ""no such file or directory"" (despite ostensibly containing 135 MB). Yet that version seems to be what's running now. I don't know how recently my Firefox got updated; possibly an update is the problem, but why newly today is unclear. I'm now using Safari, since Firefox is kaput. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1060;firefox-10601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",johns007
