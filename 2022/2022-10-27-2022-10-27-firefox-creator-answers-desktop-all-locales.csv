Unfortunately recently it stopped working - possibly when I tried to upgrade to a new version of Firefox, but then I downgraded again because the updated version didn't quite work with the old OSX. Slack says my browser is not supported but I used to used it for years and it worked. Is there anything I could do to make Slack work again without updating the OS?

Why did you force these stupid themes on users? Why do developers always want to to tell/force others how they should use their computer?  </p><p>COLOR CHANGES SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN OPTION, not a mandatory change. Realize YOU do not know how EVERYONE else wants to use their computer or have it look. Like, oh say, STANDARD WINDOWS formatting LIKE ALL MY OTHER WINDOWS. I LIKE IT THAT WAY. I don't care if you think that's boring, its not YOU using the computer.  </p><p>SO - looking through all the searches MANY ARE REALLY UPSET, and there isn't an answer. SO What is the fix to get rid of the stupid themes? And don;t say ""Oh, well maybe you will like nnnnn theme!"" I KNOW what theme i want - I want it to match ALL MY OTHER WINDOWS. REALLY simple, yet your developers couldn't figure that out?  </p><p>Or is only fix finally just switching to using chrome? Is that what you are trying to do?  </p><p>FIX THIS. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10601;,firefox,customize,en-US,1543887;,tkremin

This is why I stopped using Microsoft Edge a few months ago and to my horror see that Firefox just did the same thing. Leave history alone! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10601;,firefox,customize,en-US,1543886;,suicidebomber
