I've also added Norton anti-tracker. Could that be causing the problem? </p><p>Thank you. </p>,desktop;fix-problems;windows-8;firefox-1060;firefox-10601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",michaelbrandt362

It causes most of the time the tab to crash and require me to simply reload the page. There have been 2 times however that it has caused Windows OS to completely crash, requiring a restart. I have a picture of the error codes present, but one thing is shared between them. They all contain the reason EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION_READ. This has pointed me to consider it to be the same issue. It may also be a issue with the new computer itself, or maybe something to do with the graphics card. I'll start with this first to see if it's something bigger or not.  </p><p>I also hope that the trouble shooting data can also help, as I rather know how to fix this then be secretive with information that may help. </p><p>As as a final note, as of this moment, while being within safe mode/trouble shooting mode, no tabs have crashed yet. Hope this is a sign, but I'll keep it on just to make sure the videos aren't crashing anymore. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1543882;,rwgamming

Why did you force these stupid themes on users? Why do developers always want to to tell/force others how they should use their computer?  </p><p>COLOR CHANGES SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN OPTION, not a mandatory change. Realize YOU do not know how EVERYONE else wants to use their computer or have it look. Like, oh say, STANDARD WINDOWS formatting LIKE ALL MY OTHER WINDOWS. I LIKE IT THAT WAY. I don't care if you think that's boring, its not YOU using the computer.  </p><p>SO - looking through all the searches MANY ARE REALLY UPSET, and there isn't an answer. SO What is the fix to get rid of the stupid themes? And don;t say ""Oh, well maybe you will like nnnnn theme!"" I KNOW what theme i want - I want it to match ALL MY OTHER WINDOWS. REALLY simple, yet your developers couldn't figure that out?  </p><p>Or is only fix finally just switching to using chrome? Is that what you are trying to do?  </p><p>FIX THIS. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10601;,firefox,customize,en-US,1543887;,tkremin

This is why I stopped using Microsoft Edge a few months ago and to my horror see that Firefox just did the same thing. Leave history alone! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1060;firefox-10601;,firefox,customize,en-US,1543886;,suicidebomber
