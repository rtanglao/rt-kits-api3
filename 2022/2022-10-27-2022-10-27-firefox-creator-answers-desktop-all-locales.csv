I figured out that when I have the adblocker disabled for the window that's playing youtube that the error goes away. The problem is that if I open another window and adblocker is active the window playing youtube recognizes it and stops the autoplay. This happens even when I have youtube playing on a private window. how can I get this to stop? I want to be able to leave a window with youtbe playing and not have to press play every time and still browse the internet. </p>,desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1060;firefox-10602;,firefox,fix-problems,es,"",agutier2
