FF will create a 2-3 page pdf that is over 3 MB of data, while Safari saves the same pdf as 325KB.  I never noticed this to be the case in the distant past but as my available storage space started shrinking rapidly on my MacBook I realized this might be the culprit. </p><p>I don't know when these large pdfs files started with FF but as I reviewed some similar files from several years ago, the same type of 2-3 page pdf in FF was in the KB, not MB of data.  Can anyone help me understand why this is happening?  Is there a setting that should be changed so these pdfs are not so bloated in size? </p><p>I am still using FF 88.0.1 having not made the leap to the newer versions of FF because of all the bad reviews.  That said, I have not seen any info which indicates that FF scaled down pdf file sizes in the newer versions of FF. </p><p>In FF's Preferences pane PDFs are set to open in FF.  Would it help reduce the file sizes if I changed that so they open in Mac's default application which I assume is Preview?  I don't know if that's what the default preference was years ago when FF pdfs were much smaller files, or if changing that would make no difference at all. </p><p>Also, for what it's worth, I previously disabled FF's new-ish Print Preview Interface in about:config because it was consistently overriding the preset positions I set for my headers and footers, resulting in them being cut off the printed pages, however, the bloated pdfs were a problem long before FF introduced the Print Preview Interface feature. </p><p>Any suggestions on how to reduce the size of pdfs that FF is creating?  I don't have and don't want to get a 3rd party application like Adobe Acrobat to deal with this, when I can simply use Safari as my browser.  Thank you. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,"",youngjane

Once open hamburg menu allows drop down and anyone can get my info. I ahd to also remove check mark for master password since annoying. Followed steps to remove and reset master PW but still keep asking every time logged on.  References to my ESET that may be the cause. This was never a problem once registered few years back. So why cant I use Firefox to search without it having access to my private info. I should only need to access this when I need. So in the drop down hamburg menu if I go to Privacy and security that is where you should ask for PW or security question. So that you must have a PW to go into security would make sense to me. Other wise you are allowing anyone that may be using my computer and your web page to access my account, SO PLEASE DO NOT REPLY THAT  the master password is the way to set this since it does not work properly. Even if I did use master this site is open to anyone. So it seems to be insecure and the web master should change the drop down to offer a PW when in the security and password tab,  so that way it a second level pf protection.

I want to be able to see all of my tabs when there is plenty of room to show them.
