Once open hamburg menu allows drop down and anyone can get my info. I ahd to also remove check mark for master password since annoying. Followed steps to remove and reset master PW but still keep asking every time logged on.  References to my ESET that may be the cause. This was never a problem once registered few years back. So why cant I use Firefox to search without it having access to my private info. I should only need to access this when I need. So in the drop down hamburg menu if I go to Privacy and security that is where you should ask for PW or security question. So that you must have a PW to go into security would make sense to me. Other wise you are allowing anyone that may be using my computer and your web page to access my account, SO PLEASE DO NOT REPLY THAT  the master password is the way to set this since it does not work properly. Even if I did use master this site is open to anyone. So it seems to be insecure and the web master should change the drop down to offer a PW when in the security and password tab,  so that way it a second level pf protection. HOPE TO HEAR BACK and not just get a reply to see the Help section.Thanks Joseph Jan 26 ,2022 </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",jpfalcone
