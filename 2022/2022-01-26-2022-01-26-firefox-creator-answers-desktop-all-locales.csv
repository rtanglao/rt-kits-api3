I have to manually click on the desktop I want.  Only then can I complete typing in the address.  This is driving me crazy.  I have turned off all 'suggestions' settings that I can possibly think of.  I can find no way to turn this off.  This never happened in any previous version of Firefox. </p>",desktop;customize;firefox-960;firefox-9601;,firefox,customize,en-US,1478140;1478142;1478145;1478147;,ca3scott
