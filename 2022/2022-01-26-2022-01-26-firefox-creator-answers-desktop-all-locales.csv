In fact, tabs never seem to populate the right 50% of the tab bar.  I have found plenty of advice about how to set minimum and maximum sizes for the tabs themselves, but that is not my problem.  I want to be able to see all of my tabs when there is plenty of room to show them.  Any way to solve this? </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-940;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",wendiwoman2

Now, it takes 90 seconds to load and even longer to open a link. I can hear the HD seeking constantly only when Firefox has loaded.  Using Win7 64bit, HP Envy tower with core i7 3.2 Ghz, resource meters: CPU almost zero, memory about 25%.

I have to manually click on the desktop I want.  Only then can I complete typing in the address.  This is driving me crazy.  I have turned off all 'suggestions' settings that I can possibly think of.  I can find no way to turn this off.  This never happened in any previous version of Firefox. </p>",desktop;customize;firefox-960;firefox-9601;,firefox,customize,en-US,1478140;1478142;1478145;1478147;,ca3scott
