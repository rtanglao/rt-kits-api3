When muting tabs, those tabs will become unmuted when they refresh, or if a new video starts playing in that tab. Everytime I search for people with this issue, I'm surprised to see no one else having this issue. I've given up from there each of those dozen previous times. I don't mute tabs that often, but when I do, this issue is infuriating. So infuriating, that it almost seems like this is a default setting Mozilla has to have been pressured into by advertisers, given how unpopular it must be. </p><p>I'm on Windows 10 with a %TEMP% path variable that points to a Temp folder on my 16GB RAM Disk. This has caused issues in the past, such as not being able to drag and drop tabs after running Glary Utilities or updating Firefox through Chocolatey's package manager if I didn't close FireFox before doing so, but such issues have always been resolved with a PC restart. This issue has not. </p><p>Is there some setting I can change in FireFox's about:config to stop this horrible behaviour? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-960;firefox-9603;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Larrimus

If I remove the IPv4 (A) record from the DNS name, then it connects absolutely fine over IPv6. </p><p>I am aware of how Firefox is designed to handle IPv4 vs IPv6 connectivity where the fastest response time will be favoured. I have verified that in my case, connecting to the 'IPv6 test' websites always favours IPv6 - so my config is good. </p><p>So my question is, if a DNS name returns a public IPv6 and a private IPv4 address, will Firefox favour the IPv4 address on the basis of it being 'internal'? And if so, is there any way to disable this? </p><p>(Firefox 97.0 on Windows 10 20H2) </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,other,en-US,"",hcuk94

This would be beneficial when there are duplicates and deciding which bookmark(s) to keep or how to improve grouping </p><p>2) my workaround was to Export Bookmarks to HTML and use a text editor to search However, the HTML file has a huge overhead of ICON data.  It would be nice to disable ICON data or remove it completely.  I test saved 2 bookmarks to a 16Kb file, after manually stripping the ICON data the file contained 467 bytes. My normal Bookmarks folder is near 400Mb which appears to be held in memory, reducing overall performance when Firefox is running. Removal/exclusion of ICON data would make this closer to 12Mb </p><p>3) the View Cache feature is very helpful but I believe it would be beneficial if the columns could be selected as the Sort By source (instead of just the date). When trying to save cache files like images or videos, sorting by size or type would be a huge benefit. </p><p>I am a retired software developer and would love to look into these things, However I think the overhead of understanding your code and tools could take too long to be beneficial.
