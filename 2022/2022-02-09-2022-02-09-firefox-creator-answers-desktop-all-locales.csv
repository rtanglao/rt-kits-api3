I don't mute tabs that often, but when I do, this issue is infuriating.

This would be beneficial when there are duplicates and deciding which bookmark(s) to keep or how to improve grouping </p><p>2) my workaround was to Export Bookmarks to HTML and use a text editor to search However, the HTML file has a huge overhead of ICON data.  It would be nice to disable ICON data or remove it completely.  I test saved 2 bookmarks to a 16Kb file, after manually stripping the ICON data the file contained 467 bytes. My normal Bookmarks folder is near 400Mb which appears to be held in memory, reducing overall performance when Firefox is running. Removal/exclusion of ICON data would make this closer to 12Mb </p><p>3) the View Cache feature is very helpful but I believe it would be beneficial if the columns could be selected as the Sort By source (instead of just the date). When trying to save cache files like images or videos, sorting by size or type would be a huge benefit. </p><p>I am a retired software developer and would love to look into these things, However I think the overhead of understanding your code and tools could take too long to be beneficial.
