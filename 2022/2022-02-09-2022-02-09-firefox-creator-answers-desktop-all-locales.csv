I'm running Win10 Pro with FF 97.0 64-bit and with this patch installed, FF opens with a blank screen and no DNS lookup or anything.  Other browsers like Chrome or Edge load and work without issue.  After manually uninstalling this patch, Firefox again works like it should. </p><p>Any ideas on how to fix this?  Thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1481927;,gumby_dammit223
