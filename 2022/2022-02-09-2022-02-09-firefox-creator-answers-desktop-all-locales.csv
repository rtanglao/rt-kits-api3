So I restarted my computer, same issue. Reinstalled Firefox, same issue. I then reinstalled after having deleted the %appdata% folder for Mozilla, but that also changed nothing. So I looked in Task Manager, and it would just open instances of Firefox as a background app no matter how many times I clicked. I've also tried using other browsers with no success. (Also, I'm runnning Windows 10, 64-Bit version, and had not installed any programs recently before Firefox stopped working.) I would greatly appreciate if I could get some assistance with this because I prefer Firefox much more than Microsoft Edge which is the only browser I'm able to use right now. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;startup;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1481953;,sorenkallen05

I have been using for quite a while and become somewhat attached to the theme ""Sidewalk Snowman - by the candy store"" by Poppy.  </p><p>1. Upon the switch of Linux Mint to use Mozilla default settings in Firefox version 96.0 I noticed that all menubar drop down boxes are now dark/black in colour. Also I notice that basically all control option box related menu/dropdown backgrounds now have a dark/black background including their titlebars making labels difficult to read/see (Excluding custom Browser search page). </p><p>2. This is causing the separators in bookmarks and titlebar names quite difficult to now see.  </p><p>3. Disabling ""Sidewalk Snowman"" by the following: Tools &gt; Add-ons and Themes &gt; Themes &gt; Sidewalk Snowman (ticking) disable - does in fact revert Firefox 97.0 to default theme and things are easy to see (separators/labels in titlebars and drop down box windows then have a white background. </p><p>4. For example the ""Top Hat on Snowman"" by MaDonna theme appears with no noticable issues. in Firefox 97.0 (64 bit). </p><p>5. Is there a solution for this to where I can perhaps more comfortably continue to use the ""Sidewalk Snowman by Poppy"" as before but with the newer version of Firefox 97.0 (64 bit) on my desktop computer?  </p><p>-Best Wishes </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-970;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",panorain

Sometimes I try to open the browser and nothing happens (but I somehow end up with something like 7 instances of it running in the background, according to task manager), sometimes I get it to open, but it won't load my homepage or anything, and sometimes it seems to work fine but only for a little while - then it just stops responding. </p><p>I have no idea why this is happening or how to fix it. I tried the browser reset, which helped for a little bit but then the problems came back. I think having a theme installed makes it worse, but now I can't even get settings to open so I can try turning it off to see if that helps. </p><p>Any ideas? Not being able to use the internet on my computer is a pretty big deal.
