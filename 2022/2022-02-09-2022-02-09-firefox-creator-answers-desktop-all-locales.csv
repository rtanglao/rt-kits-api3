Just toolbars and a white main window.  My laptop was running Windows 10 when this happened.  I went ahead and installed Windows 11 and did another re-install.  Same thing.  It worked for a short time and then quit.  It doesn't seem to matter if I sign in and sync or not.  I hope there's a fix for this.  I love my Firefox!  I'm using a different computer to send this.

When I came back and opened Firefox everything was blank. There was a blank open tab, no response to any input in the address bar, nothing. So, I closed the window and tried again - this time it didn't even open. However, Task Manager showed Firefox running with 6-7 entries, all of which I used ""End Task"" on. I rebooted the computer and nothing had changed. It wouldn't open but it showed up a few times in Task Manager. I tried a Refresh - no change. I tried reinstalling - no change. I uninstalled and tried reinstalling - no change. </p><p>Finally, in desperation, I uninstalled, used ""RegEdit"" and deleted every entry I could that had ""Firefox"" in it. Then I reinstalled fresh - Firefix Installer didn't know it had ever been on my computer. Same result. </p><p>Honestly, I'm completely out of ideas. I can't try anything in Firefox because it won't open and I've deleted all the files and reinstalled and still no joy.

This would be beneficial when there are duplicates and deciding which bookmark(s) to keep or how to improve grouping </p><p>2) my workaround was to Export Bookmarks to HTML and use a text editor to search However, the HTML file has a huge overhead of ICON data.  It would be nice to disable ICON data or remove it completely.  I test saved 2 bookmarks to a 16Kb file, after manually stripping the ICON data the file contained 467 bytes. My normal Bookmarks folder is near 400Mb which appears to be held in memory, reducing overall performance when Firefox is running. Removal/exclusion of ICON data would make this closer to 12Mb </p><p>3) the View Cache feature is very helpful but I believe it would be beneficial if the columns could be selected as the Sort By source (instead of just the date). When trying to save cache files like images or videos, sorting by size or type would be a huge benefit. </p><p>I am a retired software developer and would love to look into these things, However I think the overhead of understanding your code and tools could take too long to be beneficial.
