There aren't any sites which work that I am aware of. </p><p>Firefox simply says ""x wants to register an account with one of your security keys. You can connect and authorize one now, or cancel."", a variation of the message is shown when attempting to log in, but the results are the same. </p><p>Simply nothing happens. The key doesn't start blinking, no PIN prompt shows up, touching the key also doesn't do anything. </p><p>I am seeing this issue across two macOS installs, I recently reinstalled macOS and tested it on a fresh Firefox install, same issue. </p><p>I attached screenshot of Firefox (the key is plugged in and NOT blinking) and of Safari (key plugged in, IS blinking and touching it continues to PIN entry.) </p><p><strong>Edit:</strong> I am using a YubiKey 5 NFC which I am connecting directly via a USB-A port on my MBP. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",my_creative_username
