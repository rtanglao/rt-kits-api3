The webpage's tab was at the end of the tab bar, but I accidentally pushed the 'X' on the top bar.  I then attempted to re-open Firebox by pushing the Firebox icon on the taskbar.  I did not get anything restored.  I had many tabs that I was using for my research.  I then remembered that Firefox did not warn me that I was closing an 'x' number of tabs, as it has done in the past. </p><p>I then checked my settings and the box for warning the user that s/he is closing so many tabs was not checked.  I know I had it checked.  Then I remembered that there was a recent update of Firefox, and I had this happen before when there were updates.  I did not think of checking this setting with the recent update, because this was not a problem in recent times.  Indeed, when I went to settings, the check had been removed by Firefox. </p><p>How do I get my tabs back? </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1470875;,wp46
