I have no idea how to bring up my Gettr account on my Android because I don't know where the password that I configured for my Gettr account on my laptop is located.  I know it's inside the Firefox password manager somewhere... then I see Lockwise is no longer being supported. </p><p>Ultimately I want to synch whatever Firefox's latest password manager is to my Android, so that it functions like ""whatever Firefox's latest password manager is"" for my laptop. I'd like to synch my bookmarks, too. Can anyone point me to some simple instructions? Thanks. I'm using a primary password now for Firefox on my laptop.
