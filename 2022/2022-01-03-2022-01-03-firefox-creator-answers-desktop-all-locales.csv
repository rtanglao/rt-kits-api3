Displaying web page when inactive,"<p>I have Firefox on 2 different laptops, both running Windows 10 64-bit with the latest version of Firefox. Occasionally when the computer has been inactive for awhile, Firefox displays a webpage for LocustWare or Aweber. I used to have both of these services years ago but discovered they were scams years ago, but I cannot find where in Firefox it is  getting the info to show these pages?  I have contacted both LocustWare and Aweber about this but they said it is nothing they are actively doing?  How can I get rid of those? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",jonarnold228

Embedded videos work, but sound where the site has a character that tells her what to do - stops working. If I restart the browser it starts working again - however refreshing the page does not. This is something recent, as older versions of firefox did not seem to do this. I'm wondering if there is some change/memory leak that might cause this? </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-950;firefox-9502;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1470955;1470961;,365nice
