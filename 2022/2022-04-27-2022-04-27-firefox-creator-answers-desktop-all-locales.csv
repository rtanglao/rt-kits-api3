In Gmail, I get an error at the top of the main page saying 'Oops... the system encountered a problem (#001) - Retrying....'  at first and then saying 'Not connected.' later.  In Youtube, it starts off as thumbnails not loading but clicking through to the video still works.  Eventually it stops working and clicking through to a video says 'Not connected to the internet'.  Google search will load at first but not go anything when clicking search.  Later it won't load at all. </p><p>Closing Firefox and reloading it will let everything start working again for a little while, but it stops working properly again within 5-10 minutes. </p><p>Loading Gmail in a private window seems to work and stay working.  I haven't tried this with Youtube or any of the other google products. </p><p>I haven't noticed any issues with any of the other websites that I would use normally. </p><p>So far, I've tried disabling hardware acceleration, I've cleared cache, cookies and history.  At the moment, I've manually removed my profile, uninstalled Firefox, reinstalled it without any addons or using Sync and the problem is still occurring. </p><p>This is with Firefox 99.0.1 (64-bit) under Windows 10.  I've been using Edge so far today and haven't run into the issue with Edge.  This is on my work laptop that's connected to a domain and is using Sophos Intercept X endpoint protection. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jonathan.beaver

When I go into the browser settings I see that some other file types have options to choose how they're handled, but there's no entry for ZIP files. I've tried refreshing my Firefox install and yet the issue still persists. </p><p>I used to have this option before I reinstalled Windows a while back (where I kept my files but not programs). I don't know for sure that that's what caused this to start, but the timing would line up. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,customize,en-US,1500438;,nathanb418

The problem appears to be with DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials Extension which apparently *may automatically redirect to the http site. In order to prevent this, I added my development sites to 'Unprotected Sites' and this prevented DuckDuckGo from doing the automatic redirect to https. </p> <ul><li> - Odd thing is that I had multiple domains pointing to the same web instance and only one of the domains was having this issue with the DDG extension. Both were going to the same IP through a HTTP proxy. The proxy and web server were not the issue.  This symptom points to an maybe an issue in Firefox.... </li></ul> <p>In summary, be wary of odd redirects and the DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials extension if you are doing web development work. </p>",linux;desktop;tips;firefox-990;,firefox,tips,en-US,1500401;1500404;1500405;,JavaScriptDude
