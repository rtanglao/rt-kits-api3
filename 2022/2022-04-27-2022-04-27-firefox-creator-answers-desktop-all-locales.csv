I'm not completely sure about that, so thought I ask a second opinion from the browser aka You wise people. </p><p>So, I open a payslip from their site and want to download it straight to my laptop without going through the whole printing procedure. Because why not do that the fast way and not the slow way, right? Problem is that the document's size is Letter and not A4 like I'd wanted it to be (2 pics attached). Is there any way I can change that in Firefox settings, or is the origin of the problem somewhere deep inside the Netvisor? </p><p>My Firefox was downloaded from Finnish site and not example from US site, which might explain the Letter problem. I've checked all the settings in about:config, at least all the ones I've figured might affect this. Everything says now A4 size, not Letter. </p><p>The same problem also occurs while using Chrome, which hints me that it might be website-related thing. Common sense in great use here! </p><p>Biggest thanks in advance if anyone can point me the solution. And please tell it in simple words, I already used all my coding (? not even sure about the right term...) skills with the about:config -stuff that I was able to find onlineÂ :)  </p><p>-Kati </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,customize,fi,"",kati.kumpumaki

In Gmail, I get an error at the top of the main page saying 'Oops... the system encountered a problem (#001) - Retrying....'  at first and then saying 'Not connected.' later.  In Youtube, it starts off as thumbnails not loading but clicking through to the video still works.  Eventually it stops working and clicking through to a video says 'Not connected to the internet'.  Google search will load at first but not go anything when clicking search.  Later it won't load at all. </p><p>Closing Firefox and reloading it will let everything start working again for a little while, but it stops working properly again within 5-10 minutes. </p><p>Loading Gmail in a private window seems to work and stay working.  I haven't tried this with Youtube or any of the other google products. </p><p>I haven't noticed any issues with any of the other websites that I would use normally. </p><p>So far, I've tried disabling hardware acceleration, I've cleared cache, cookies and history.  At the moment, I've manually removed my profile, uninstalled Firefox, reinstalled it without any addons or using Sync and the problem is still occurring. </p><p>This is with Firefox 99.0.1 (64-bit) under Windows 10.  I've been using Edge so far today and haven't run into the issue with Edge.  This is on my work laptop that's connected to a domain and is using Sophos Intercept X endpoint protection. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jonathan.beaver

I've tried refreshing my Firefox install and yet the issue still persists. </p><p>I used to have this option before I reinstalled Windows a while back (where I kept my files but not programs). I don't know for sure that that's what caused this to start, but the timing would line up. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,customize,en-US,1500438;1500464;,nathanb418

The problem appears to be with DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials Extension which apparently *may automatically redirect to the http site. In order to prevent this, I added my development sites to 'Unprotected Sites' and this prevented DuckDuckGo from doing the automatic redirect to https. </p> <ul><li> - Odd thing is that I had multiple domains pointing to the same web instance and only one of the domains was having this issue with the DDG extension. Both were going to the same IP through a HTTP proxy. The proxy and web server were not the issue.  This symptom points to an maybe an issue in Firefox.... </li></ul> <p>In summary, be wary of odd redirects and the DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials extension if you are doing web development work. </p>",linux;desktop;tips;firefox-990;,firefox,tips,en-US,1500401;1500404;1500405;,JavaScriptDude
