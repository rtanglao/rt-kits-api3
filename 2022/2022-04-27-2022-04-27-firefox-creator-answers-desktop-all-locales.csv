I have a desktop and a laptop.  The desktop is FF 85 on Linux Mint (I cannot get a later version due to some querk)  The laptop is 99 on Windows 10 Both are signed in to sync but my bookmarks were scrambled so I signed out the laptop and cleared the profile, cleaned up the bookmarks in the desktop and to be safe I tried just syncing the tabs, not the bookmarks, by opening the fresh firefox on the laptop and signing in again. In the sidebar under my account icon I clicked ""Synchronise now"" and the open tabs from my desktop appeared in a list underneath, jumbled up. (I have 2 separate windows open on the desktop with different tabs in each, but this separation was not followed either, there didn’t seem to be any provision for syncing tabs in two separate windows) </p><p>But the row of tabs didn’t open, all I can do is open them one by one from the list on the right, this is a slow process as every time I click on a tab in the list the  new page opens in the same single tab, not a new one,  but the sidebar closes again. </p><p>Is this what’s supposed to happen? I was expecting the synced row of tabs to open automatically. </p><p>This feature would have been useful as my OS on the desktop, (Linux Mint) tends to crash and  to have the on the laptop would be a good backup. </p><p>Incidentally the other way I try to back up the lost tabs is to select them all and  bookmark them to a new folder which I call “backup” but it seems this doesn’t necessarily duplicate them, which I would prefer, so any of the open tabs that were previously bookmarked risk being removed from the original bookmarked folder, without my noticing, and I am therefore reluctant to delete the backup folder  without checking that it doesn’t contain the only bookmark of a page. </p><p>When I came back to syncing the bookmarks, how do I avoid them getting scrambled again? </p>",linux;desktop;sync;firefox-850;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",benaround3

When I launch Firefox, I know it will ask for my main password. This is what I need, me for I activated ""Sync"" (to synchronize my profile on PC and Android).  My problem is not ""how to prevent Firefox to ask for my main password"" (many people ask for that on the net). It is ""how to prevent Firefox to wait about 30 seconds before asking for my main password"". </p><p>I did read only one thread about the trouble I encounter each time I launch Firefox but I gess many people experiment the same thing. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1312988"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1312988</a> (you can see the source is a very good one :-) ) I entirely agree with the author, who wrote :  </p><p>""The delay in the master password prompt is up to 20 seconds  and is so annoying, it just gets in the way when you are trying to work."" </p><p>So, you launch Firefox, you look for one of your bookmarks to click on it but then, Firefox stops your action and a window asks your password. Worse : you are typing words in the adress bar and after some seconds you discover that you were typing the last words in the password pop-up window. Awfull ! You can then 1/ grumble and type your password 2/ grumble an press the Escape key </p><p>I use sometimes Seamonkey, that asks for the main password within the second you click its shortcut on Windows desktop. An excellent solution ! But after that, I notice that Seamonkey does not have a Sync function (and Firefox asks for the main password 20 or 30 seconds after opening only if Sync is activated). </p><p>To sum up, it would be great if Mozilla / Sync could remove the delay before asking for the main password, even if it has to ask for it right after clicking on the desktop shortcut.

The problem appears to be with DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials Extension which apparently *may automatically redirect to the http site. In order to prevent this, I added my development sites to 'Unprotected Sites' and this prevented DuckDuckGo from doing the automatic redirect to https. </p> <ul><li> - Odd thing is that I had multiple domains pointing to the same web instance and only one of the domains was having this issue with the DDG extension. Both were going to the same IP through a HTTP proxy. The proxy and web server were not the issue.  This symptom points to an maybe an issue in Firefox.... </li></ul> <p>In summary, be wary of odd redirects and the DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials extension if you are doing web development work. </p>",linux;desktop;tips;firefox-990;,firefox,tips,en-US,1500401;1500404;1500405;,JavaScriptDude
