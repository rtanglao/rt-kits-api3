It even happens when I select LOG OFF.  Hence it occurs maybe six or more times whilst I am browsing the website.  I complained to NS&amp;I but they report it is not caused by their system.  I therefore assume it it something within Firefox which is the problem.   Can someone please advise me how to prevent these pop-ups.

When I launch Firefox, I know it will ask for my main password. This is what I need, me for I activated ""Sync"" (to synchronize my profile on PC and Android).  My problem is not ""how to prevent Firefox to ask for my main password"" (many people ask for that on the net). It is ""how to prevent Firefox to wait about 30 seconds before asking for my main password"". </p><p>I did read only one thread about the trouble I encounter each time I launch Firefox but I gess many people experiment the same thing. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1312988"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1312988</a> (you can see the source is a very good one :-) ) I entirely agree with the author, who wrote :  </p><p>""The delay in the master password prompt is up to 20 seconds  and is so annoying, it just gets in the way when you are trying to work."" </p><p>So, you launch Firefox, you look for one of your bookmarks to click on it but then, Firefox stops your action and a window asks your password. Worse : you are typing words in the adress bar and after some seconds you discover that you were typing the last words in the password pop-up window. Awfull ! You can then 1/ grumble and type your password 2/ grumble an press the Escape key </p><p>I use sometimes Seamonkey, that asks for the main password within the second you click its shortcut on Windows desktop. An excellent solution ! But after that, I notice that Seamonkey does not have a Sync function (and Firefox asks for the main password 20 or 30 seconds after opening only if Sync is activated). </p><p>To sum up, it would be great if Mozilla / Sync could remove the delay before asking for the main password, even if it has to ask for it right after clicking on the desktop shortcut. Thanks for any advice, Michel </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-990;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",m.thblt

Should I be worried?","<p>To begin with I fell asleep with my PC on, and I woke up a couple of hours later, and I noticed my computer was running a little rough, so I decided to check task manager, and I saw Firefox using 20 gb's of ram, and 50% disk usage. </p><p>I had a couple of tabs open, and seeing that it was stressing my SSD, I decided to quickly close the process, and I checked through all the tabs, and there was only one tab that had crashed when I had ended the task on it.

It had said that the tab had crashed and I had the option to refresh the tab. Not sure if it really was this or the tab just had some memory attached to that process. I had panic closed the process in task manager and forgot to screenshot anything else sadly. </p><p>Any ideas to what it was? Maybe just a memory leak or bug? My first instinct was to run a virus scan with Malwarebytes, and so far it has nothing, and I did a full scan of everything. </p><p>Have my extensions in the images. I've had these extensions for a long time at this point, I'm not sure if they would be the culprit or not. </p><p>I've never really seen or heard of this before, and this is the first time it's happened, and I don't know if it'll be repeatable either, just a bit worried about it is all. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,other,en-US,"",envoyofthelast

I'm not completely sure about that, so thought I ask a second opinion from the browser aka You wise people. </p><p>So, I open a payslip from their site and want to download it straight to my laptop without going through the whole printing procedure. Because why not do that the fast way and not the slow way, right? Problem is that the document's size is Letter and not A4 like I'd wanted it to be (2 pics attached). Is there any way I can change that in Firefox settings, or is the origin of the problem somewhere deep inside the Netvisor? </p><p>My Firefox was downloaded from Finnish site and not example from US site, which might explain the Letter problem. I've checked all the settings in about:config, at least all the ones I've figured might affect this. Everything says now A4 size, not Letter. </p><p>The same problem also occurs while using Chrome, which hints me that it might be website-related thing. Common sense in great use here! </p><p>Biggest thanks in advance if anyone can point me the solution. And please tell it in simple words, I already used all my coding (? not even sure about the right term...) skills with the about:config -stuff that I was able to find online :)  </p><p>-Kati </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,customize,fi,"",kati.kumpumaki
