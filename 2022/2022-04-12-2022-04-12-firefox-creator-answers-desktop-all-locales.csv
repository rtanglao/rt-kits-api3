I was testing the eicar file download through <a href=""https://www.eicar.org/?page_id=3950"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.eicar.org/?page_id=3950</a>.  When I click on the download, my download is blocked and nothing happens (which is expected). However, if I right-click on the file and select ""Save Link as"" option, I get the block message, I get the pop-up window to save the file, and Firefox creates a file in the specified location. However, the file is invalid (obviously as the download was blocked). If I try the same with another Browser (like Chrome), it gives an error ""Failed - Forbidden"" for the download. </p><p>Trying to understand how Firefox handles such instances, does it first create a file in the specified location, even the file is not retrieved through the proxy? Why is firefox not giving an error message similar to other browsers if it actually fails to download the file. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-990;,firefox,other,en-US,"",mtnetskope2

This https site should have asked to save the password - it did not.  When I went to Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security then click on [Saved Logins] I get a SYNC page that tells me I have to have a SYNC account.  There were no logins found, which is scary because she has 50 (or so) logins to various sites she goes to.  Clicking the [Create New Login]  and entering the data then clicking [Save] freezes (fuzzes out the page) and does nothing. </p><p>This Password problem with Firefox is getting frustrating enough to quit using the product.  One of the primary functions of a browser is to save our passwords.  I do not want to use SYNC and have no interest in using it.  It is atrocious to lose my 200 (or so) passwords every month for the last three months and now my wife's 50 (or so) passwords.  This FF password manager is out of control and SYNC is another technological abomination. </p><p>What in the world is wrong with Firefox.

Since the most recent firefox update, my settings and extensions have been inaccessible to me due to my firefox account profile being ""old."" It has been working perfectly until this update.

I am realizing how very difficult it is to navigate the tabs for this person; actually the whole top of the page takes her a lot of work to find what she needs. Tabs, icons, the bookmarks toolbars, these are all just a bunch of tiny text &amp; icons that have no visual cues to differentiate what is what. It is even hard to tell which tab you are on, the color difference is so slight. I tried searching for themes that would perhaps make a difference but all they do is change the background color.
