This https site should have asked to save the password - it did not.  When I went to Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security then click on [Saved Logins] I get a SYNC page that tells me I have to have a SYNC account.  There were no logins found, which is scary because she has 50 (or so) logins to various sites she goes to.  Clicking the [Create New Login]  and entering the data then clicking [Save] freezes (fuzzes out the page) and does nothing. </p><p>This Password problem with Firefox is getting frustrating enough to quit using the product.  One of the primary functions of a browser is to save our passwords.  I do not want to use SYNC and have no interest in using it.  It is atrocious to lose my 200 (or so) passwords every month for the last three months and now my wife's 50 (or so) passwords.  This FF password manager is out of control and SYNC is another technological abomination. </p><p>What in the world is wrong with Firefox.  We've never had these problems for over 15 years until the end of last year and so far this year? </p><p>Her profile (and mine) reside on a NAS drive with a ""hard link"" from our PCs to this network location. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-990;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",BPaul_H

When it returned, my tabs came back but they all have to be reset. e.g., I have to log back in to by Twitter, Facebook, and all other password protected accounts. This happens frequently and it is very annoying. I'm reporting this hoping that the problem can be fixed.  </p><p>Sincerely, </p>",desktop;crash;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-990;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",metaphysicial

Since the most recent firefox update, my settings and extensions have been inaccessible to me due to my firefox account profile being ""old."" It has been working perfectly until this update. If I try to change my profile to my old one, it forces me to create a new one which does not include my saved addons and settings. I am able to usually manually move my bookmarks to the new profile via the files stored locally. I really need access to the settings and extensions, so it would be great if someone can help me to recover them. I tried to troubleshoot by finding my extensions local folder from my old profile, and I copied it to a new profile, but it didn't work. I am also wondering, if I do copy the extensions successfully, how can I also copy the settings preferences? Any solution is appreciated, thank you! </p><p>I tried this: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/recover-user-data-missing-after-firefox-update"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/recover-user-data-missing-after-firefox-update</a>  And I tried this <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data#w_what-information-is-stored-in-my-profile"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profiles-where-firefox-stores-user-data#w_what-information-is-stored-in-my-profile</a> </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-990;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",36532student

I am realizing how very difficult it is to navigate the tabs for this person; actually the whole top of the page takes her a lot of work to find what she needs. Tabs, icons, the bookmarks toolbars, these are all just a bunch of tiny text &amp; icons that have no visual cues to differentiate what is what. It is even hard to tell which tab you are on, the color difference is so slight. I tried searching for themes that would perhaps make a difference but all they do is change the background color. Is there anything I can change that will make firefox more usable for this person? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-990;,firefox,customize,en-US,1496808;,DB-1
