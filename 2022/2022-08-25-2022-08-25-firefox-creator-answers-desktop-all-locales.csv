How do I unhide it?,"<p>Firefox 104.0 64-bit </p><p>I hid a photo on a webpage to see if its space would collapse and bring the text closer toger so I could make a screeenshot. I right-clicked on the photo and selected ""Block Element"". The photo disappeared, but the space it had occupied remained (outline of photo, filled with background color). I right clicked in the space, but there was no ""Unblock Element"" to select. </p><p>I looked online for an answer to this question, which seems not to have been addressed specifically. One of the results suggested using an add-on called Firebug; another suggested uBlock. I guess another question I might ask would be, why would it require an add-on to unblock an element that was blocked using Firefox? </p><p>It is not vital that I get the photo back, as I can contrive to never visit that particular webpage again, but my inquiring mind wants to know how to unblock an element I have blocked—particularly since it was so easy to block it in the first place. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p><br> DF </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-1040;,firefox,tips,en-US,1529197;,AlphaCat

It ran fine at first, I even managed to sync it over from my old laptop, extensions, history, etc. and all, but after a few openings and closings, it crashed at some point. After that it refused to open, so me and a friend troubleshooted for about 30 minutes to no avail (clean reinstalled multiple times, restarted my laptop, troubleshooted compatability, etc.). At some point after my friend had logged off, I noticed my taskbar refresh and then was able to open firefox, but then it crashed again and I wasn't able to open it. I manually refreshed my windows explorer with task manager and was able to open it, and tried everything firefox says to: cleared my start-up cache, opened it in trouble shoot mode, refreshed it. It still crashed every single time, and I ended up doing all at once, then in different orders, etc. Nothing worked. I decided to time how long I got and it ended up being exactly 30 seconds between restarting my windows explorer and firefox crashing again. Any suggestions? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1529151;1529156;,weitzel.charlotte
