Now, when I'm on Google Drive, whenever I try to make a new folder it has the message ""Working"" in the corner forever &amp; it won't allow me to create a new Google Docs, Slides, Sheets, or Form. I tried making a new folder on my phone &amp; Google Chrome, and they both worked fine. I use Firefox as my default browser, and I want to keep it this way, however, if I can't use Google Drive with your browser, I might have to switch because I'm in college, and need Google Drive for my work.

It ran fine at first, I even managed to sync it over from my old laptop, extensions, history, etc. and all, but after a few openings and closings, it crashed at some point. After that it refused to open, so me and a friend troubleshooted for about 30 minutes to no avail (clean reinstalled multiple times, restarted my laptop, troubleshooted compatability, etc.). At some point after my friend had logged off, I noticed my taskbar refresh and then was able to open firefox, but then it crashed again and I wasn't able to open it. I manually refreshed my windows explorer with task manager and was able to open it, and tried everything firefox says to: cleared my start-up cache, opened it in trouble shoot mode, refreshed it. It still crashed every single time, and I ended up doing all at once, then in different orders, etc. Nothing worked. I decided to time how long I got and it ended up being exactly 30 seconds between restarting my windows explorer and firefox crashing again. Any suggestions? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1529151;1529156;,weitzel.charlotte
