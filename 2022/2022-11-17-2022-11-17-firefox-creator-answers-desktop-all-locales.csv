I have two expired personal certificates issued by SAP, a very large Business Application Company. I also have a current recently issued certificate that doesn't expire until Nov. 2023. Trying to connect to the Support site for the Company, I'm informed that my certificate has expired. I expect that's because the certificates are listed in order of oldest to newest, and the expired certificates are hit before the new one, which is likely not checked.  I go into Privacy and Security Settings, to the View Certificates option, and delete the two expired certificates, then click OK.  I go back to view the certificates, and the deleted certificates are still there.  I still cannot connect to the Company site. When is was using MS IE, i was able to delete expired certificates without any issue.   How can i safely delete expired Personal Certificates in Firefox, without having to delete many other things that I do not want to have to deal with re-establishing, which would be a significant time sink.

I purchased a Macbook Pro M1 Pro 14 inch. Since I purchased a smaller screen model, I wanted to efficiently use the screen space available. I have tested Safari, Firefox, Chrome and Brave. I am glad that only and only Firefox provides a Hide toolbar option which other browsers are not offering. It is a game changer for a 14 inch macbook pro as it offers maximum utilization of the space. For that I applaud Firefox.  </p><p>But the accessibility of tabs takes a serious hit when I enable the option. The place where the mouse pointer has to be for the toolbar to unhide is quite literally a line. Anywhere above or below it will not show the toolbar. if we go too far, the MAC OS close,minimize window option come up. For the toolbars to show up one has to just touch the menubar of MacOS. While switching tabs its a real pain. I have to pause and look at the pointer and slowly move my mouse to touch the menubar at the right speed.  </p><p>Please please please do something about this. Firefox is providing the best utilization of space for a Macbook Pro. I do not know if the Firefox team is aware of this, but its brilliant. But the toolbar accessibility makes the feature unusable. It would be great if we could access the toolbar easily for tab switching. </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,customize,en-US,1548383;,bbharavi
