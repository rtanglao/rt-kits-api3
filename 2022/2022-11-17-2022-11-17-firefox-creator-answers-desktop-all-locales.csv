I purchased a Macbook Pro M1 Pro 14 inch. Since I purchased a smaller screen model, I wanted to efficiently use the screen space available. I have tested Safari, Firefox, Chrome and Brave. I am glad that only and only Firefox provides a Hide toolbar option which other browsers are not offering. It is a game changer for a 14 inch macbook pro as it offers maximum utilization of the space. For that I applaud Firefox.  </p><p>But the accessibility of tabs takes a serious hit when I enable the option. The place where the mouse pointer has to be for the toolbar to unhide is quite literally a line. Anywhere above or below it will not show the toolbar. if we go too far, the MAC OS close,minimize window option come up. For the toolbars to show up one has to just touch the menubar of MacOS. While switching tabs its a real pain. I have to pause and look at the pointer and slowly move my mouse to touch the menubar at the right speed.  </p><p>Please please please do something about this. Firefox is providing the best utilization of space for a Macbook Pro. I do not know if the Firefox team is aware of this, but its brilliant. But the toolbar accessibility makes the feature unusable. It would be great if we could access the toolbar easily for tab switching. </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1060;firefox-10605;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",bbharavi

If I then use Google Chrome its OK. I am not using wifi as I am now wired. Although yahoo email says ""not connected"" other sites are working OK. This fault is Firefox and before the last maybe 6 updates it was OK. I have been with Sky about 25 years and been using Monzilla about at least 10 years.
