It is nothing like Skype. Now and again on the email it tells me the internet has dropped while  I am using it, The PC says its still connected and the modem lights are on. If I then use Google Chrome its OK. I am not using wifi as I am now wired. Although yahoo email says ""not connected"" other sites are working OK. This fault is Firefox and before the last maybe 6 updates it was OK. I have been with Sky about 25 years and been using Monzilla about at least 10 years. I always delete the cookies each day. </p>",windows-7;desktop;website-breakages;firefox-1070;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",jacksonce
