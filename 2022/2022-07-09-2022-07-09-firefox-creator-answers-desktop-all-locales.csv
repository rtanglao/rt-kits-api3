1382412,2022-07-08 20:36:46 -0700,2022-07-08 20:56:46 -0700,youtube suddenly stops loading,"<p>Recently I have been getting an error where after some point in time youtube-related pages will stop loading when I try to open them or if they do load they will tell me I am not connected to the internet despite being connected to the internet. It will have occasional brief windows where it will load the site again before going back to not working but I have no idea what causes this change. I have tried clearing my cache/cookies and disabling my add-ons but neither of those things stop this from happening. Interestingly, if I restart in troubleshoot mode or open a private window, youtube will load perfectly. Any suggestions on what I can do to fix this issue? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1518283;,kai_draws
