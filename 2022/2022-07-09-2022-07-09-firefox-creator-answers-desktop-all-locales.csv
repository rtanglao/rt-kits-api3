But anyway... </p><p>The machine now has 102.0 installed. </p><p>The other day while trying to find what is ""broken"" in it, I am told there is an update and it told me I had 13 days to do it....   Or something like that. Alas I've deleted the screen shot as I need to keep the bin less full to help me if I accidentally delete something I shouldn't. </p><p>So now I have 102.0.1 </p><p>So I'm confused: What is the mechanics of rolling out updates? An update I didn't want (beside the point) but none the less broke firefox was done without my knowledge, and yet another one which was throwing up messages at me when I loaded firefox doesn't? </p><p>I don't really know what either update did. </p>",linux;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",teeny_weeny
