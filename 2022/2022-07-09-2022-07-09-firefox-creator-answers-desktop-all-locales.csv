If any from Firefox's dev team are reading this, please just make this possible. Chrome and Edge do it. Firefox should, too, IMO.

Since firefox is my default broswer sometimes I will open a link thru an app and close it, forgetting that it will delete my previous session. Then it is impossible to open up those tabs again as I keep them open for a while. </p><p>Please let me know if there is an easy solution to this. </p><p>Sincerely, Dylan I </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",dylnki

It will have occasional brief windows where it will load the site again before going back to not working but I have no idea what causes this change. I have tried clearing my cache/cookies and disabling my add-ons but neither of those things stop this from happening. Interestingly, if I restart in troubleshoot mode or open a private window, youtube will load perfectly. Any suggestions on what I can do to fix this issue? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1518283;,kai_draws
