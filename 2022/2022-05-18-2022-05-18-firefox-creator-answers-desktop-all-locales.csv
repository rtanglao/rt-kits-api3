Firefox is not able to open eBay category lists.  Clicking on the drop-down ""Shop by Category"", link or any of the sub-category links within the menu go nowhere except for a gateway timeout error after a number of minutes.  This is incredibly inconvenient, because unless you are looking for a specific item by searching for it, you have no way to browse through categories.  I don't seem to have this problem with any other website that I can think of, but since I use eBay quite regularly (daily), it has long ago gone from annoying to down right intolerable. </p><p>This isn't a problem with Safari, but I seldom use that browser preferring to use Firefox instead. </p><p>I've tried every solution I've come across.  From giving permissions, turning of Firefox Enhanced Tracking, turning off any ad blockers I have. Using Troubleshoot Mode, manually turning off and on extensions, clearing history and all remnants of eBay in case of corrupt cookies or anything else for that matter.  I've even lit black candles while dancing beneath a dark moon in hopes of exercising what seems to be a long resident multi-year demon. And the damn thing isn't even paying any rent!  </p><p>I am on an iMac, using Catalina with everything up to date.   </p><p>So, I have two questions: </p><p>1.)  Does everyone else still have this problem?  I've seen pages of search results on Google for this and similar issues with eBay and Firefox stemming back three or more years. </p><p>2.) If you do not have this problem, what have you done other than fixes I've listed?  And if you happened to include a particular color candle and phase of the moon differing from mine even that suggestion would be appreciated. :) </p>",desktop;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1000;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1506090;,anthonyfasolo

That is still true.  However, on past versions I was also able to make *my home page* appear on every tab I opened.  On the current edition I get a choice of only Firefox Home Page (default) or Blank page.  I cannot get my home page on the new tab.  How can I bypass the restrictions of the settings under Home to get my home page on every tab? </p><p>That the question I need an answer to.  Everything below this is explanation of why I want this and a complaint about how Firefox changes things that I would appreciate being passed on to the developers. </p><pre>                                                                    &lt;----------------------&gt; </pre> <p>If I choose Firefox Home Page (default), I am *forced* to use the address box to put in my search terms.  I have become accustomed to the various search engines with their splash screens - with the nice big search box in the middle of the screen (both horizontally and vertically).  It is absolutely unnerving to me to try to type in the box in the middle and have nothing show up there but up above in the address box. </p><p>I am a project person in a multi-tasking world, which means whether I like it or not, I have to multitask too.  For me to do this successfully, all my tools need to be where I expect and perform as I expect them.  Even putting <a href=""http://duckduckgo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">duckduckgo.com</a> in the current home page/new window setting, doesn't get the duckduckgo splash page, but even though I'm not that technically advanced, I found a way of getting it in my home page window.  However, the tabs section doesn't offer me an opportunity to put my own choice in. </p><p>I wish Firefox would stop tinkering with otherwise minor things.  I understand fixing found vulnerabilities.  I understand providing new services and technology when they're developed.  But why force people to use search and tabs the way Firefox wants them to rather than the way the user is accustomed to. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1000;firefox-10001;,firefox,customize,en-US,1506092;,bdjim

At both the points 1 and 2, marked in blue. there is a change in version, in fact a downgrade from 100.0 to 96.0. How is this possible? I cant seem to find an explanation. And then it jumps back up to 100.0. I also another timestamp where it downgraded to 96.0, and then came back to 100.0 . I'm really worried about the possibility of a hacker on my computer.

Prior to version 100, this worked perfectly with dual scroll bars, one for the main window and one for the ""sub"" window.  Now, with version 100, the ""sub"" window has no scroll bar.  I can control the window by using the keyboard up/down arrows, but the scroll bar for the ""sub"" window is non existent. You cannot have access to my bank account, but you can duplicate the problem with Google.  Simply search for say, a celebrity, click on one of the displayed images, and the window that displays on the right used to have it's own scroll bar, beside the bar that controlled the main window.  Sub window scroll bar is now gone. It seems you folks violated one of the Cardinal Sins of Programming: IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT. Scroll bars worked great before, Not sure whose idea it was to ""improve"" them. Rolling a Firefox update backwards is a logistical nightmare.  Is there a possibility of a fix coming out soon or are we to live with this as a ""feature""???
