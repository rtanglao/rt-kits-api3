No redirection or links. I try accessing the site in another browser and I have to go through the whole setup again which also appears successful, but then nothing happens. I attached the image that shows it was successful. I have no idea what to do since there is no error and I have the same problem across multiple browsers.

At both the points 1 and 2, marked in blue. there is a change in version, in fact a downgrade from 100.0 to 96.0. How is this possible? I cant seem to find an explanation. And then it jumps back up to 100.0. I also another timestamp where it downgraded to 96.0, and then came back to 100.0 . I'm really worried about the possibility of a hacker on my computer.

Prior to version 100, this worked perfectly with dual scroll bars, one for the main window and one for the ""sub"" window.  Now, with version 100, the ""sub"" window has no scroll bar.  I can control the window by using the keyboard up/down arrows, but the scroll bar for the ""sub"" window is non existent. You cannot have access to my bank account, but you can duplicate the problem with Google.  Simply search for say, a celebrity, click on one of the displayed images, and the window that displays on the right used to have it's own scroll bar, beside the bar that controlled the main window.  Sub window scroll bar is now gone. It seems you folks violated one of the Cardinal Sins of Programming: IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT. Scroll bars worked great before, Not sure whose idea it was to ""improve"" them. Rolling a Firefox update backwards is a logistical nightmare.  Is there a possibility of a fix coming out soon or are we to live with this as a ""feature""???
