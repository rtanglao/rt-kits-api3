I have this problem where firefox (version 100) is not rendering the window and i think it's the profile folder.  </p><p>First i was thinking on the graphics. i have installed 'nvidia-driver-510'. I tried this <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/questions/1380600/firefox-occasionally-not-rendering-its-own-window-when-opened"" rel=""nofollow"">Solution</a> with no luck. </p><p>I have: </p> <ul><li> Intel HD Graphics 620 </li><li> Nvidia MX130 </li></ul> <p>I tried : </p> <ul><li> Renaming the folder '.mozilla' to '.mozilla_bak' works perfectly but i have to do this every startup, and firefox creates a new profile where i have to logon in every platform i use. </li><li> Downloading 'firefox-100.0.1.tar.bz2', it's the same, works fine with a new profile. </li></ul> <p>This lead me to the profile folder, running './firefox --profile ~/.mozilla/firefox/&lt;profile_folder&gt;' it's the same, not rendering the entire window. I dont know why my profile is causing this problem, i only use three addons: AdBlock, BetterTTV and FoxyProxy, i have the same problem even if i dont have these installed. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",killuax

Prior to version 100, this worked perfectly with dual scroll bars, one for the main window and one for the ""sub"" window.  Now, with version 100, the ""sub"" window has no scroll bar.  I can control the window by using the keyboard up/down arrows, but the scroll bar for the ""sub"" window is non existent. You cannot have access to my bank account, but you can duplicate the problem with Google.  Simply search for say, a celebrity, click on one of the displayed images, and the window that displays on the right used to have it's own scroll bar, beside the bar that controlled the main window.  Sub window scroll bar is now gone. It seems you folks violated one of the Cardinal Sins of Programming: IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT. Scroll bars worked great before, Not sure whose idea it was to ""improve"" them. Rolling a Firefox update backwards is a logistical nightmare.  Is there a possibility of a fix coming out soon or are we to live with this as a ""feature""???   Thanks for your time. </p>",desktop;customize;firefox-1000;,firefox,customize,en-US,1505928;,don.morse
