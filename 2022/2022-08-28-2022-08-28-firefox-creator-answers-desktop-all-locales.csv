It now plays slideshows automatically.  This feature is called Auto-Rotation, but it has nothing to do with rotating the display on a phone or tablet (although that feature has the same name).  This feature automatically rotates among the slides in a slideshow.  It's incredibly annoying, especially since I typically forget its on (or don't realize I'm looking at a slideshow) and it changes to the 2nd slide just as I have begun reading the 1st.  I then have to turn Auto-Rotation off and go back to the 1st slide to continue.  When I remember, I have to hurry to turn Auto-Rotation off before it moves to the 2nd slide.  Is there any way to turn this off?  I can't find one by looking through Settings, and there's nothing on this subject in Help, that I can find.  For what it's worth, whoever thought this was a good idea was wrong, but if there's a way to change so it's not the default, I'll be content. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1040;,firefox,customize,en-US,1529990;1529993;1529996;,gmsherry

When I place mouse cursor on the Firefox icon on the taskbar all tab previews show up as usual. The thing is the Youtube tab (where video playback is in progress) preview is static like a screenshot. Same goes for the full screen when I place cursor on the Youtube tab without clicking on it. The playback works fine only when I open the tab. Firefox version is 104.0. On previous versions it worked fine. I tried this with the Brave browser and it also works good.

But I didn't even make an username yet because I can't log in after I made an account.

I use several other browsers during my work, as well and the older design of Firefox tab markers (indicating which tab I am on) was much better. Before Firefox ver. 89, the active tab design was more functional as it was immediately clear which tab is the “active tab”. I prepared a visual comparison of how different browsers indicate the active tab. (attached image). Also inserted how it was before Firefox Ver 89. I hope the designers will take this into consideration in the future releases. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1040;,firefox,other,en-US,1529981;1530027;,aferhan
