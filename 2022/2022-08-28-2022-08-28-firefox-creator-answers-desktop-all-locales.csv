I used firefox's auto gen password and selected save password. But firefox is not saving this password, nor is it autofilling or in the saved login section in the settings. I always had this problem. Now i need this password because weibo requires me to use my username instead of my number to get my account back. But I didn't even make an username yet because I can't log in after I made an account. I just need to get this password back. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1030;firefox-10302;,firefox,other,en-US,"",sabrinajia12345

Why?","<p>Under Firefox ""Help"" menu I saw that there is a link for ""Share ideas and feedback"".  I posted today an idea to Mozilla Connect ""Ideas' section to improve Firefox, but it seems to be deleted. My account page shows I posted ""1 post"", but no post is visible. Is it possible that my post is deleted by admins for some reason? In that case, shouldn't I receive a message for why it is deleted? Below is my post and related image as attachment. </p><p>Title: “Active tab” marker design needs to be changed to make it more functional </p><p>Post content: Firefox is my favorite browser. I use several other browsers during my work, as well and the older design of Firefox tab markers (indicating which tab I am on) was much better. Before Firefox ver. 89, the active tab design was more functional as it was immediately clear which tab is the “active tab”. I prepared a visual comparison of how different browsers indicate the active tab. (attached image). Also inserted how it was before Firefox Ver 89. I hope the designers will take this into consideration in the future releases. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1040;,firefox,other,en-US,"",aferhan
