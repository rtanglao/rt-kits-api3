And if I download a pdf or some other file type it would download it to my dedicated Firefox download folder. </p><p>Now No matter what I do it treats all the file types the same as far as where they go when downloaded and it will not remember my last folder for that file type. </p><p>I know there is a section in the settings to tell FF what to do with each file type, but  FF no longer will automatically download jpegs for example to the pics folder I set up, FF always just puts the jpegs in my FF download folder for all other file types.  </p><p>It's been the same way for a long time and it worked fine, no it seems with last update functionality has been broken compared to how it used to be.  </p><p>Is there any way to go back to previous behavior? Just like many FF updates lately, it seems to break things and make things more difficult than they used to be.  </p><p>Windows 10 64 </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-980;v98-download;,firefox,other,en-US,1489514;1489515;1489545;1489548;,BWX232

On certain sites (<a href=""http://taste.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">taste.com.au</a>, <a href=""http://reampedenergy.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">reampedenergy.com.au</a>) their link buttons don't work, usually the login ones but it has been others. They don't click, link, anything. Sometimes the address line at the bottom comes up with the JavaScript void 0 error, sometimes it doesn't come up with anything. I've cleared caches, cookies, turned off ad blockers AND it happens on different browsers and multiple computers, on both windows 10 and 11. However according to them it works fine and it's an issue on my end. I have AdBlocker Ultimate and Ghostery, but it does it on browsers that don't have any add ons. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,websites,en-US,1489469;,e.jenner.1985
