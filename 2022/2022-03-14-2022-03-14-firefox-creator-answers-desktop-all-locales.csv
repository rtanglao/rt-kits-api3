On certain sites (<a href=""http://taste.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">taste.com.au</a>, <a href=""http://reampedenergy.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">reampedenergy.com.au</a>) their link buttons don't work, usually the login ones but it has been others. They don't click, link, anything. Sometimes the address line at the bottom comes up with the JavaScript void 0 error, sometimes it doesn't come up with anything. I've cleared caches, cookies, turned off ad blockers AND it happens on different browsers and multiple computers, on both windows 10 and 11. However according to them it works fine and it's an issue on my end. I have AdBlocker Ultimate and Ghostery, but it does it on browsers that don't have any add ons. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,websites,en-US,1489469;,e.jenner.1985
