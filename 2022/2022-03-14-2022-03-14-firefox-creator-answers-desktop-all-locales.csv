If I try to drag the tabs, it drags the entire window. On what I am calling the location bar (the back, forward, home, address bar, add-on buttons), each thing on it is dragged individually, and when I try to drag the address bar, I cannot drop it anywhere above where it already is.  Pressing the restore to default button on the customize toolbar does not change it to what is was before. </p><p>I think I hit a wrong button on the keyboard accidentally when all this began, are there some keyboard buttons to restore the previous layout?  </p><p>Any help is appreciated. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-970;,firefox,customize,en-US,1489512;,firefox.tedesca

I use Firefox as my browser and it is 'up to date'. </p><p>My homepage is the Sydney Morning Herald, and I am a subscriber of many years. When I open the browser is shows the Home Page of the SMH, and shows my name as being 'logged on'. BUT, when I click on any story within that page to read in depth, it goes to that story, but requires me to 'log in'  the password a second time. </p><p>When contacting Apple Support, they requested I try both Safari and Chrome to see if the same problem exists there. And, it doesn't. I can log on to the SMH site and then click on any story and read it without needing to log in a second time. </p><p>I am 84 years of age and find this rather frustrating... particularly as I do not have the cyber skills of a younger person. I am used to Firefox and prefer it as my chosen browser. </p><p>I hope you can advise me how to rectify this vexing problem. </p><p>Thanks, Frank Arnold I </p>",mac-os;desktop;sync;firefox-980;,firefox,sync,en-US,1489513;1489519;1489525;,charfra38
