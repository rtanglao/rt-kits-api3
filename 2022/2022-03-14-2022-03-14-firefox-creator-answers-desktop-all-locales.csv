I previously had the location bar right below the menu bar, and below it the tabs. However all of the sudden the tabs are now above the location bar. How do I restore it to how it was before? </p><p>I tried View - Toolbars - Customize Toolbar, but the new screen it brings up does not allow me to drag what I want to move. If I try to drag the tabs, it drags the entire window. On what I am calling the location bar (the back, forward, home, address bar, add-on buttons), each thing on it is dragged individually, and when I try to drag the address bar, I cannot drop it anywhere above where it already is.  Pressing the restore to default button on the customize toolbar does not change it to what is was before. </p><p>I think I hit a wrong button on the keyboard accidentally when all this began, are there some keyboard buttons to restore the previous layout?  </p><p>Any help is appreciated. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-970;,firefox,customize,en-US,1489512;,firefox.tedesca

I use Firefox as my browser and it is 'up to date'. </p><p>My homepage is the Sydney Morning Herald, and I am a subscriber of many years. When I open the browser is shows the Home Page of the SMH, and shows my name as being 'logged on'. BUT, when I click on any story within that page to read in depth, it goes to that story, but requires me to 'log in'  the password a second time. </p><p>When contacting Apple Support, they requested I try both Safari and Chrome to see if the same problem exists there. And, it doesn't. I can log on to the SMH site and then click on any story and read it without needing to log in a second time. </p><p>I am 84 years of age and find this rather frustrating... particularly as I do not have the cyber skills of a younger person. I am used to Firefox and prefer it as my chosen browser. </p><p>I hope you can advise me how to rectify this vexing problem. </p><p>Thanks, Frank Arnold I </p>",mac-os;desktop;sync;firefox-980;,firefox,sync,en-US,1489513;,charfra38

And if I download a pdf or some other file type it would download it to my dedicated Firefox download folder. </p><p>Now No matter what I do it treats all the file types the same as far as where they go when downloaded and it will not remember my last folder for that file type. </p><p>I know there is a section in the settings to tell FF what to do with each file type, but  FF no longer will automatically download jpegs for example to the pics folder I set up, FF always just puts the jpegs in my FF download folder for all other file types.  </p><p>It's been the same way for a long time and it worked fine, no it seems with last update functionality has been broken compared to how it used to be.  </p><p>Is there any way to go back to previous behavior? Just like many FF updates lately, it seems to break things and make things more difficult than they used to be.  </p><p>Windows 10 64 </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,other,en-US,1489514;1489515;,BWX232

On certain sites (<a href=""http://taste.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">taste.com.au</a>, <a href=""http://reampedenergy.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">reampedenergy.com.au</a>) their link buttons don't work, usually the login ones but it has been others. They don't click, link, anything. Sometimes the address line at the bottom comes up with the JavaScript void 0 error, sometimes it doesn't come up with anything. I've cleared caches, cookies, turned off ad blockers AND it happens on different browsers and multiple computers, on both windows 10 and 11. However according to them it works fine and it's an issue on my end. I have AdBlocker Ultimate and Ghostery, but it does it on browsers that don't have any add ons. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,websites,en-US,1489469;,e.jenner.1985
