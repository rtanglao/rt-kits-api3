I just need to read them, not to download them.  Please go back to the asking question of what I want to do with the file, open or download so I can select open only.

Faccio una premessa, ho installata l'ultima versione per PC 98.0 su ambiente Windows. Fino a venerdì funzionava tutto correttamente, la gestione dei file avveniva perfettamente: se cliccavo su un pdf mi veniva aperto con Adobe reader, se cliccavo su un file xls veniva aperto con Excel...il tutto senza downloaddare nulla. Oggi le regole sono rimaste, i vari file mi vengono aperti come da regole indicate, ma il file in questione viene comunque scaricato. Questo mi crea diversi problemi dovendo leggere tanti file e ogni volta devo andare a cancellare ciò che viene aperto. Ho provato già a ripristinare le impostazioni cancellando il file handlers.json. ma il problema permane. </p><p>Potete cortesemente verificare e darmi un aiuto? </p><p>Vi ringrazio, cordiali saluti Andrea </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-980;,firefox,customize,it,1489589;1489612;,kuja79
