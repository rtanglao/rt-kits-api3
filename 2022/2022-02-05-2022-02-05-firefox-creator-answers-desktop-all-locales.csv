However, since a recent update any time I type a string that matches the name of a saved search engine, it completely takes over the address bar and won't accept a normal search. </p><p>For instance, I have Wikipedia saved as a search engine (complete with the shortcut ""w"" so entering ""w Firefox"" would take me straight to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox</a>). DuckDuckGo is my primary search engine. But if I type ""w"" into the address bar and hit enter, it does not search DDG for ""w"" as I'd like it to. Instead, it just selects Wikipedia as the search engine of choice and prompts me for another search term - and whatever I put in there, it will search Wikipedia and not DDG. This goes for any string in the name starting from the first character, so it's impossible to search DDG for ""w"", ""wi"", ""wik"", and so on directly from the address bar. (Likewise with ""bin"" --&gt; Bing, ""flick"" --&gt; Flickr, and other plausible search terms). </p><p>This also disrupts bookmarks with their own search shortcuts. For example, say I have <a href=""http://www.example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.example.com</a> saved as a bookmark with shortcut ""e"" and eBay saved as a search engine. Typing ""e"" in the address bar does not take me to <a href=""http://www.example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.example.com</a> as expected, but rather prompts me for an eBay search term. </p><p>Advice on fixing this would be most appreciated, as this is really quite irksome! </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-960;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",quixotic

During this process Firefox is taking all available memory (it is not much, only 4 GB installed and around 3 Gb free) and then crashing with ""out of memory"" exception. I opened about:memory and clicked on the ""Minimize memory usage"" button. It took effect. GC freed unused memory and the script continuing working for some time. Then I had to minimize again. And again... till the end of script running. </p><p>But if I switch to another tab after starting the script (the tab with running script became inactive), memory consumption is not growing and limited about 100 MB.

And yet, Settings &gt; Sync shows my FF account, with ""Syncing: ON"" and all options under ""Choose What To Sync"" enabled.

Youtube videos, for example, play just fine.  However, videos where I just get ""Please wait while the media loads"" include numerous training videos at <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com"" rel=""nofollow"">support.microsoft.com</a>.  (I think I have trouble at other sites as well.) These videos play without any problems on Chrome and Edge.  The problem just occurs with FF.  I have found a work around, but it's a real pain.  It may give someone a good clue as to what the problem is though.  If I clear cached web content and cookies EACH time before playing a video and then reload the page, it works.  Sometimes just clearing the cache will do the trick.  Again, this must be done before each video.  Things I have tried include (but are not limited to: reboot pc(s), refresh FF, turned auto play on &amp; off, mute &amp; unmute FF &amp; plug-ins, allowed cookies and pop-ups, disabled ad blocker and other extensions, loaded a Flash Emulator plug-in, confirmed audio is working fine, turned off and on hardware acceleration.  I love FF, but this is driving me nuts.  I do not consider myself to be terribly tech savvy, but I'm willing to keep trying for a while longer.  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
