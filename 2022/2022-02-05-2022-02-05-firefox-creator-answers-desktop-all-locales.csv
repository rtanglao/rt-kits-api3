Youtube videos, for example, play just fine.  However, videos where I just get ""Please wait while the media loads"" include numerous training videos at <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com"" rel=""nofollow"">support.microsoft.com</a>.  (I think I have trouble at other sites as well.) These videos play without any problems on Chrome and Edge.  The problem just occurs with FF.  I have found a work around, but it's a real pain.  It may give someone a good clue as to what the problem is though.  If I clear cached web content and cookies EACH time before playing a video and then reload the page, it works.  Sometimes just clearing the cache will do the trick.  Again, this must be done before each video.  Things I have tried include (but are not limited to: reboot pc(s), refresh FF, turned auto play on &amp; off, mute &amp; unmute FF &amp; plug-ins, allowed cookies and pop-ups, disabled ad blocker and other extensions, loaded a Flash Emulator plug-in, confirmed audio is working fine, turned off and on hardware acceleration.  I love FF, but this is driving me nuts.  I do not consider myself to be terribly tech savvy, but I'm willing to keep trying for a while longer.  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks, John </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-960;firefox-9603;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jh4850
