I'm starting js script on the web page which creating some canvas elements and saving them as PNG files (do no add them into DOM). All created objects are changing their values to null after save to make them unreachable for GC. During this process Firefox is taking all available memory (it is not much, only 4 GB installed and around 3 Gb free) and then crashing with ""out of memory"" exception. I opened about:memory and clicked on the ""Minimize memory usage"" button. It took effect. GC freed unused memory and the script continuing working for some time. Then I had to minimize again. And again... till the end of script running. </p><p>But if I switch to another tab after starting the script (the tab with running script became inactive), memory consumption is not growing and limited about 100 MB. That is exactly what I need. </p><p>So, looks like GC is not working on active tab or working but not absolutely correctly. But  it is working properly on inactive tab. I hope there are some preferences in firefox (about:config ? ) which can help me to solve this problem. </p><p>P.S. I've tried the same in chrome. It works fine. So, I believe then script is more or less correct. P.P.S. Sorry for my English. It is not my native language. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-910;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1480969;,aleksey.nazarenko

Both are logged in to my FF account.  (I was initially logged in on my computer, then, following various help articles such as <a href=""/en-US/kb/sync-bookmarks-tabs-history-and-passwords-android"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a> this one, set up sync on the phone - and that appears to be logged in as well.) </p><p>1/ I've tried sync'ing a browser tab from the phone, but it never shows up on the computer.  FF on the computer does not show any sync'd tabs. Note: On the phone, at the top of pop-up dialog from the menu &gt; share icon, 2 icons for FF with the same user and computer are shown, along with 4 copies of the same user on a different computer, which hasn't been powered up for about a month.  I have tried sharing to both the entries for the computer that is up; both result in a brief ""Tab sent!"" pop-up, but neither produce any other discernible result. </p><p>2/ I cannot sync tabs from computer to the phone, as there is no ""Send Tab to Device"" entry in the tabs' context menu.  There is also no mention of external devices' tabs or history in the History menu, Manage History (Library) screen, or Synced Tabs list.  And yet, Settings &gt; Sync shows my FF account, with ""Syncing: ON"" and all options under ""Choose What To Sync"" enabled.  Settings &gt; Sync &gt; Manage account shows both the phone and the computer as being signed in.  I have tried re-starting the browser, but the behavior remained the same.  The 3 extensions that are installed are disabled. </p><p>Open for ideas... </p>",linux;desktop;sync;firefox-960;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",don.estabrook

Youtube videos, for example, play just fine.  However, videos where I just get ""Please wait while the media loads"" include numerous training videos at <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com"" rel=""nofollow"">support.microsoft.com</a>.  (I think I have trouble at other sites as well.) These videos play without any problems on Chrome and Edge.  The problem just occurs with FF.  I have found a work around, but it's a real pain.  It may give someone a good clue as to what the problem is though.  If I clear cached web content and cookies EACH time before playing a video and then reload the page, it works.  Sometimes just clearing the cache will do the trick.  Again, this must be done before each video.  Things I have tried include (but are not limited to: reboot pc(s), refresh FF, turned auto play on &amp; off, mute &amp; unmute FF &amp; plug-ins, allowed cookies and pop-ups, disabled ad blocker and other extensions, loaded a Flash Emulator plug-in, confirmed audio is working fine, turned off and on hardware acceleration.  I love FF, but this is driving me nuts.  I do not consider myself to be terribly tech savvy, but I'm willing to keep trying for a while longer.  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
