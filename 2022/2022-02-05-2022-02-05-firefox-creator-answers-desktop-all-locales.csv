For example, when i click to address bar it gets highlighted at first as it should, but typing first letter will remove previous address and will not be registered as first letter of new site, second letter is registered ok. For example if i type <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a> i will get <a href=""http://ozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">ozilla.org</a> in address bar. This is very frustrating for everyday browsing. I am using Gboard keyboard with P30 pro and latest Firefox for android. I don't have problems like this while using Chrome. Think it is related with Gboard but there aren't many tweak options to play with. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",borjanovic

Both are logged in to my FF account.  (I was initially logged in on my computer, then, following various help articles such as <a href=""/en-US/kb/sync-bookmarks-tabs-history-and-passwords-android"" rel=""nofollow"">this one</a> this one, set up sync on the phone - and that appears to be logged in as well.) </p><p>1/ I've tried sync'ing a browser tab from the phone, but it never shows up on the computer.  FF on the computer does not show any sync'd tabs. Note: On the phone, at the top of pop-up dialog from the menu &gt; share icon, 2 icons for FF with the same user and computer are shown, along with 4 copies of the same user on a different computer, which hasn't been powered up for about a month.  I have tried sharing to both the entries for the computer that is up; both result in a brief ""Tab sent!"" pop-up, but neither produce any other discernible result. </p><p>2/ I cannot sync tabs from computer to the phone, as there is no ""Send Tab to Device"" entry in the tabs' context menu.  There is also no mention of external devices' tabs or history in the History menu, Manage History (Library) screen, or Synced Tabs list.  And yet, Settings &gt; Sync shows my FF account, with ""Syncing: ON"" and all options under ""Choose What To Sync"" enabled.  Settings &gt; Sync &gt; Manage account shows both the phone and the computer as being signed in.  I have tried re-starting the browser, but the behavior remained the same.  The 3 extensions that are installed are disabled. </p><p>Open for ideas... </p>",linux;desktop;sync;firefox-960;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",don.estabrook

I tested this and it doesnt happen with Edge. I have seen other articles reporting simlar problems on different platforms that say to edit the  network.http.throttle.enable and version.

Youtube videos, for example, play just fine.  However, videos where I just get ""Please wait while the media loads"" include numerous training videos at <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com"" rel=""nofollow"">support.microsoft.com</a>.  (I think I have trouble at other sites as well.) These videos play without any problems on Chrome and Edge.  The problem just occurs with FF.  I have found a work around, but it's a real pain.  It may give someone a good clue as to what the problem is though.  If I clear cached web content and cookies EACH time before playing a video and then reload the page, it works.  Sometimes just clearing the cache will do the trick.  Again, this must be done before each video.  Things I have tried include (but are not limited to: reboot pc(s), refresh FF, turned auto play on &amp; off, mute &amp; unmute FF &amp; plug-ins, allowed cookies and pop-ups, disabled ad blocker and other extensions, loaded a Flash Emulator plug-in, confirmed audio is working fine, turned off and on hardware acceleration.  I love FF, but this is driving me nuts.  I do not consider myself to be terribly tech savvy, but I'm willing to keep trying for a while longer.  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
