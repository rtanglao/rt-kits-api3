Photos and pictures are notoriously not displayed for me – both on the home page, user pages and in messages (in the latter case they do not load after clicking on them). Sometimes they are replaced with a white, black or colored box with a description of what is in the picture. There are also other errors, such as not being able to display comments under a post (not loading) or opening the message board. I have reported the problem to Facebook and I`ve not received a reply, but I`m sure it is on the browser side because: 1) I have tested FB on other browsers and nothing like that happened, 2) I have tested Firefox on at least three different computers and the same thing happened everywhere. I would like to add that the problem does not occur all the time, and usually appears after a few minutes of use. Then I have to close the browser and turn it on again (refreshing or restarting only the FB card does not help). Due to my habits and preferences, I would like to avoid having to switch to another browser for this reason, so I am asking for help. I attach several screenshots of the problem. </p><p>Greetings </p>",desktop;websites;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",dm_130

On a Windows system this is fluid, but on my macbook (new m1 max) the first click only activates the window, so I need to click twice before anything happens. When the system is lagging it can take over 2s to switch the focus, which leads to me clicking 5x before anything happens. The focus shifting is an unrelated issue, this just highlights the pain caused by requiring separate clicks for activate-window and follow-link. </p><p>The mouse wheel does not suffer from this problem - I can move my mouse over a window and scroll instantly without clicking first. </p><p>I'm hoping that the answer in this stackexchange post is outdated: </p><p><a href=""https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/269622/macos-windows-requiring-an-explicit-click-to-make-active-before-ui-elements-ins"" rel=""nofollow"">https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/269622/macos-windows-requiring-an-explicit-click-to-make-active-before-ui-elements-ins</a> </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-950;,firefox,other,en-US,"",chris.austin

However, since a recent update any time I type a string that matches the name of a saved search engine, it completely takes over the address bar and won't accept a normal search. </p><p>For instance, I have Wikipedia saved as a search engine (complete with the shortcut ""w"" so entering ""w Firefox"" would take me straight to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox</a>). DuckDuckGo is my primary search engine. But if I type ""w"" into the address bar and hit enter, it does not search DDG for ""w"" as I'd like it to. Instead, it just selects Wikipedia as the search engine of choice and prompts me for another search term - and whatever I put in there, it will search Wikipedia and not DDG. This goes for any string in the name starting from the first character, so it's impossible to search DDG for ""w"", ""wi"", ""wik"", and so on directly from the address bar. (Likewise with ""bin"" --&gt; Bing, ""flick"" --&gt; Flickr, and other plausible search terms). </p><p>This also disrupts bookmarks with their own search shortcuts. For example, say I have <a href=""http://www.example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.example.com</a> saved as a bookmark with shortcut ""e"" and eBay saved as a search engine. Typing ""e"" in the address bar does not take me to <a href=""http://www.example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.example.com</a> as expected, but rather prompts me for an eBay search term. </p><p>Advice on fixing this would be most appreciated, as this is really quite irksome! </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-960;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",quixotic

I'm starting js script on the web page which creating some canvas elements and saving them as PNG files (do no add them into DOM). All created objects are changing their values to null after save to make them unreachable for GC. During this process Firefox is taking all available memory (it is not much, only 4 GB installed and around 3 Gb free) and then crashing with ""out of memory"" exception. I opened about:memory and clicked on the ""Minimize memory usage"" button. It took effect. GC freed unused memory and the script continuing working for some time. Then I had to minimize again. And again... till the end of script running. </p><p>But if I switch to another tab after starting the script (the tab with running script became inactive), memory consumption is not growing and limited about 100 MB. That is exactly what I need. </p><p>So, looks like GC is not working on active tab or working but not absolutely correctly. But  it is working properly on inactive tab. I hope there are some preferences in firefox (about:config ? ) which can help me to solve this problem. </p><p>P.S. I've tried the same in chrome. It works fine. So, I believe then script is more or less correct. P.P.S. Sorry for my English.

FF on the computer does not show any sync'd tabs. Note: On the phone, at the top of pop-up dialog from the menu &gt; share icon, 2 icons for FF with the same user and computer are shown, along with 4 copies of the same user on a different computer, which hasn't been powered up for about a month.  I have tried sharing to both the entries for the computer that is up; both result in a brief ""Tab sent!"" pop-up, but neither produce any other discernible result. </p><p>2/ I cannot sync tabs from computer to the phone, as there is no ""Send Tab to Device"" entry in the tabs' context menu.  There is also no mention of external devices' tabs or history in the History menu, Manage History (Library) screen, or Synced Tabs list.  And yet, Settings &gt; Sync shows my FF account, with ""Syncing: ON"" and all options under ""Choose What To Sync"" enabled.  Settings &gt; Sync &gt; Manage account shows both the phone and the computer as being signed in.  I have tried re-starting the browser, but the behavior remained the same.  The 3 extensions that are installed are disabled. </p><p>Open for ideas... </p>",linux;desktop;sync;firefox-960;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",don.estabrook

Youtube videos, for example, play just fine.  However, videos where I just get ""Please wait while the media loads"" include numerous training videos at <a href=""http://support.microsoft.com"" rel=""nofollow"">support.microsoft.com</a>.  (I think I have trouble at other sites as well.) These videos play without any problems on Chrome and Edge.  The problem just occurs with FF.  I have found a work around, but it's a real pain.  It may give someone a good clue as to what the problem is though.  If I clear cached web content and cookies EACH time before playing a video and then reload the page, it works.  Sometimes just clearing the cache will do the trick.  Again, this must be done before each video.  Things I have tried include (but are not limited to: reboot pc(s), refresh FF, turned auto play on &amp; off, mute &amp; unmute FF &amp; plug-ins, allowed cookies and pop-ups, disabled ad blocker and other extensions, loaded a Flash Emulator plug-in, confirmed audio is working fine, turned off and on hardware acceleration.  I love FF, but this is driving me nuts.  I do not consider myself to be terribly tech savvy, but I'm willing to keep trying for a while longer.  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
