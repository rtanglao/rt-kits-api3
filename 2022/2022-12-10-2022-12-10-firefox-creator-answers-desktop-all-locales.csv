But it is still doing it. I also tried going into the site settings and permissions and there the ""Switch to this tab"" is set to the default of Always Ask. I even tried blocking all notifications on the site but it's still switching to it and it gets really annoying. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",dpiglet02

The responses included mention of an addon as well as a new setting added in version 74 that sounded like the perfect solution for me by retaining the ability to detach a tab to a new window if explicitly requested via context menu. </p><p>I configured allowTabDetach to ""false"" but today had a tab unintentionally move to a new window because I clicked on a tab too quickly while the mouse was in motion.  I'm not sure if there was a regression in behavior for this setting or if perhaps it does not combine well with the Tree Style Tab extension. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1070;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1553117;,sbaker53

I thought it was a connection problem but then I realized things work fine with Chrome (which I'm using now to type this). I checked the help articles about the possibility of being blocked by a firewall or anti-virus, and I did add Firefox in the exceptions for both, and I made many reboots, and still Fiirefox is not working and not loading the pages quickly (if at all). I even reduced the security level in Firefox settings and picked the ""No Proxy"" option, and disabled my anti-virus (Avast) completely, but nothing works at all. It was fine just yesterday. </p><p>I use Win7 64bit </p><p>Tips please? Thanks. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",lonelytj

This is my first posting, ever. </p><p>Upon opening my browser, the process is always delayed somewhat by the step of offering to reconnect with all the websites and/or activities of the prior session.  This is all well and good, except that for years now. it just leads to the same conclusion. The program apologies for not being able to reconnect (which I never want to do, anyway). </p><pre>and I prompt it to continue. My computer has eight partitions and a ton 'o junk on it. It is so slow to get going sometimes. I should tell you that I run malware-bytes Prem, and that I physically restart after every session on every partition that I may use on that day. Most of the time I'm on Private Windows, though not always. </pre> <p>My question; is there an election to opt out of this normally useful service (auto widget) offered every time one signs in? And if one does elect to reject this function, would it be somehow harmful or less beneficial? </p><p>Not earth shattering priority I know, just wondering Iustus Dicens </p><p>PS took a look at the ""shared data"".
