Desktops,"<p>I have a Win7 machine, and just bought a new Win10 desktop.  I followed some instructions from a YouTube solution. From the Help&gt;Troubleshoot&gt;Profile Folder, I copied the profile folder (onto an external drive)  and pasted it (from the external drive)  onto the new OS(C:) as per instructions.   </p><p>It did not work, I do not have all my bookmarks and extensions, etc. on the new Firefox browser I have installed on my new machine.   </p><p>I don't know what to do now.  All that was selected and overwritten is still selected on ""This PC&gt;OS(C:)"" I was tempted to just delete all that shows selected...maybe not a good idea. </p><p>I really just wanted to migrate all my bookmarks, but doing the full profile folder seemed like a good idea at the time....

When I do Duplicate Tab instead of adding tab directly in next location I find a large number of tabs copied and moved to end of line. Restarting Firefox has all additional tabs removed and original tab is not Duplicated. I resort to adding new tab at end of line and dragging back to position I want then copy/paste URL.

Why in the world would Mozilla create these multiple instances? I guarantee it effects my performance and downloads.
