I use Sway as a Wayland compositor and I tried activating Firefox by clicking on a link in terminal and by activating a notification. In both cases I get the same error message in logs: </p><p><em>[Parent 30362: Main Thread]: D/Widget [7fd433271800]: nsWindow::SetFocus Raise 1 </em> [Parent 30362: Main Thread]: D/Widget [7fd433271800]:   gFocusWindow [0] [Parent 30362: Main Thread]: D/Widget [7fd433271800]:   mContainer [7fd4475ac4d0] [Parent 30362: Main Thread]: D/Widget [7fd433271800]:   Toplevel widget [7fd44758a660] [Parent 30362: Main Thread]: D/Widget [7fd433271800]:   nsWindow::SetUrgencyHint widget 7fd44758a660 [Parent 30362: Main Thread]: D/Widget [7fd433271800]:   requesting toplevel activation [7fd433271800] [Parent 30362: Main Thread]: D/Widget nsWindow::RequestFocusWaylandWindow(7fd433271800) gFocusWindow 0 [Parent 30362: Main Thread]: D/Widget   missing gFocusWindow, quit.<em> </em> </p><p>What can be causing it? I know for certain that XDG activation works in Sway, because my terminal (foot) activates without any problems (whenever BEL code is received, for example). </p><p>If that's helpful, I tried both Firefox 97 and latest Nightly - no difference. </p><p>Steps to reproduce: 1. In Sway, launch Firefox with `firefox --MOZ_LOG=Widget:4` 2. In another program, click on a link, or use <a href=""https://www.bennish.net/web-notifications.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bennish.net/web-notifications.html</a> to send yourself a notification you can click on. 3. Observe an error that I provided earlier in logs. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1484743;,op7734
