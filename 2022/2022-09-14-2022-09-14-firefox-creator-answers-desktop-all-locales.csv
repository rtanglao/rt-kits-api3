When freshly started Firefox sessions start without the VPN being active, everything runs smooth. When we active the VPN to connect to our own network, it still runs for 99% but will randomly show a blank page when opening a link or a new tab. When this occurs, there is no way to open Firefox's internal tools for troubleshooting, it looks like the tab just crashes. Firefox does still work though because if we keep clicking the link or keep opening new tabs, there will be a tab that becomes responsive again eventually. But the quicker workaround at the moment is to close Firefox completely and open it up again after the processes have been shut down as well. The issue doesn't return until the laptop is rebooted and Firefox is started before the VPN was started. The issue is not reproducible in any other browser. We are using the latest version of OpenVPN and Firefox 102.2.0ESR. We have not found anyone online that has had the same issues so I hope some of you can point me in the right direction to resolve this issue. Thanks. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1022;firefox-10220;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jasperbohm

We therefore wanted to close this tab, but since the other controls were inactive this seemed impossible. We tried closing and restarting Firefox, and restarting the iPhone, neither of which helped. In the end all I could think of was to re-install Firefox, which of course did work. </p><p>Could we have done this better? </p>",linux;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-980;firefox-9801;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",PJTraill
