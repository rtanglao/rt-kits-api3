It had all sorts of configurable options including one that was critical to my free application of Firefox-ESR used by some non-profits. That feature was a timeout such that if the user walked away while not in the ""home"" web page, a configurable parameter returned firefox to that ""home"" page. I have not found this feature anywhere else. Unfortunately, installing 52.X on a standalone current bullseye version for the Raspberry Pi is turning out to be problematic. Is there any way to resolve this issue? </p><p>Some ideas:  1) Find out how to make Firefox accept an obsolete add-on 2) Fins out how to tell with an external program what page Firefox is on and by periodically polling it, kill and restart Firefox if the time on that page exceeds a certain limit. On the old mkiosk, I set 5 minutes. </p><p>Any help here? I'm not a json person so even editing the old mkiosk is beyond me. </p>",desktop;customize;firefox-1040;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",jpezzmobile

When freshly started Firefox sessions start without the VPN being active, everything runs smooth. When we active the VPN to connect to our own network, it still runs for 99% but will randomly show a blank page when opening a link or a new tab. When this occurs, there is no way to open Firefox's internal tools for troubleshooting, it looks like the tab just crashes. Firefox does still work though because if we keep clicking the link or keep opening new tabs, there will be a tab that becomes responsive again eventually. But the quicker workaround at the moment is to close Firefox completely and open it up again after the processes have been shut down as well. The issue doesn't return until the laptop is rebooted and Firefox is started before the VPN was started. The issue is not reproducible in any other browser. We are using the latest version of OpenVPN and Firefox 102.2.0ESR. We have not found anyone online that has had the same issues so I hope some of you can point me in the right direction to resolve this issue.
