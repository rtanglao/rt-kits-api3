I tried deleting my sync account so I can start again but it won't let me do that either. Although I logged in ok (so the password must be correct!), for both of the above it says my current pasword is wrong! </p><p>I've tried deleting a secondary email address (as I no longer use it), using 'private window' mode, 'Troubleshooting mode', and I've also turned off AVG just in case that was interfering, but I still get the same error. </p><p>I want to change my password as it's 8yrs old and I'm setting up a new install of Win 10. I don't care if I lose anything currently saved on firefox sync as I have a local copy. </p><p>Please help. thanks. </p>",desktop;sync;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",general_david

Nem sempre foi assim.  A versão atual é 104.0.2 (64-bit) Mozilla Firefox Snap for Ubuntu canonical-002-1.0.  Procurei na internet mas não achei como habilitar também a impressora.  Não quero deixar de ter a opção de destino ""salvar como pdf"", e sim ter a opção de também imprimir com a impressora.  Atualmente após ""imprimir"" qualquer arquivo pelo firefox tenho que abrir com o meu leitor de pdf (foxit) para então poder usar a impressora.
