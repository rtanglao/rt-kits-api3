This is not the behaviour I would expect but I can't find any information about this specific case in the documentation. Can someone tell me if this is intended behaviour, a bug or a grey zone in the HTML specification. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",seppedejonckheere6363

I went to your website and hit download again. It removed my desktop icon and told me the file was broken. I downloaded from Microsoft store and now the only way I can get to it is through searching for it in my search bar. My widge is gone, and all my previous bookmarks and favorites have been removed. I understand I probably can't get back any of the old stuff, but I at least want my widget back on my homescreen. There is no where to add a shortcut, nor is there any option to add to desktop;. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",alexandranguzzi
