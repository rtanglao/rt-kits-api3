I was having a weird problem with captcha cycling over and over and with Shopify's help I've changed all my passwords, added various authentication steps, including adding Norton and their VPN on top of the Firefox VPN. During all this I noticed a user that is NOT ME on my Shopify login page. Shopify can't figure it out and asked me to uninstall and reinstall Firefox which I did today. Mind you, everything is completely fine and normal on Chrome. After the reinstall, that user was still there! I logged them out, reset my password, checked it in Chrome and logged back in on Firefox. The user is STILL THERE! </p><p>What triggered all this was a random email about my products where the to: was blank. I replied to see which address it went to, which turned out to be a personal address that IS NOT associated to my websites. I actually have 3 on Shopify but only 1 has been weird. That got me worried. So I contacted Shopify and then this user (not me) showed up as I was doing screenshots to send to Shopify via chat. </p><p>Also all the Norton scans say everything is clean. </p><p>I have spent over a week working with Shopify in various capacities and now they have asked for an insane amount of information to ensure I am who I say I am. In fact I got a second round today! I've supplied both sets of information. </p><p>Is there anyone on the Firefox side that could help me troubleshoot this....live...not in chat hopefully!  Could it be a Firefox issue? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1509025;1509029;,caseyannomalley

I cannot using it like there is no connection (my internet is always on and I tried using other browser and it is on). I need to close the mozilla and start again and it become connect again.  </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;windows-8;firefox-980;firefox-9802;website-breakages;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1509032;,gaaauul
