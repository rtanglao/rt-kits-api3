Seveda se lahko še vedno klikne desno tipko miške in izbere ""nov zavihek"", ampak vseeno je bilo prej lažje in hitreje s ""plusom"".  Zadeva je res precej moteča, posebej še zato, ker se tudi v navodilih in v pomoči sklicujete na ta ""+"" znak in se mi zdi res nenavadno, da ukinjate tako uporabno zadevico, ne da bi sploh kje kaj omenjali. Ali pa sem morda kaj spregledal, čeprav sem kar nekaj časa klikal po pomoči (?)  V tem primeru se seveda opravičujem. Je torej možno to kje nastaviti, da se znak ""+"" spet pojavi? </p><p>vnaprej hvala za odgovor &amp; lep pozdrav, Jernej G. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,tabs,sl,"",jgerbic

It began as a profile issue. Everything is okay now, but there was much weirdness. I think this is a worthwhile read and I'm eager to hear any ideas regarding what happened. </p><p>The bottom line: If Firefox changed the name of a mount point, that was/is a bad idea -- developers take note. </p><p>I run Firefox (latest) in a Linux Mint Guest inside a VirtualBox virtual machine with a Windows Host. The Firefox application is installed as usual, but the profile is here: 'FireFox Profile.vhd' -- a virtual USB that, on VM boot, VBox mounts here: '/media/mark/FireFox Profile/'. </p><p>The profile is: '/media/mark/FireFox Profile/mwad0hks.default/'. </p><p>Events: 1 - In a proven Linux Mint VM, today I booted the VM as usual but Firefox apparently lost my bookmarks &amp; history. Why? I'll probably never know. 2 - I created a new profile hoping that in the process, I'd be given the option to use an existing profile -- no dice, FF created a new, blank profile. 3 - I discovered that I now had these: 3.1 - '/media/mark/FireFox Profile/', and 3.2 - '/media/mark/FireFox Profile1/'. 4 - I closed FF, launched Nemo, and tried to delete 'FireFox Profile1' but was refused. 5 - After much fiddling of the contents of 'FireFox Profile.vhd' mounted in Windows (to make it accessable outside the VM) I backed up 'FireFox Profile.vhd' -- good thing I did that. 6 - I realized that the mount point must have been renamed from '/media/mark/FireFox Profile/' to '/media/mark/FireFox Profile1/'. 7 - Sure enough, I launched the VM and deleted '/media/mark/FireFox Profile/' -- remember that '/media/mark/FireFox Profile1/' could not be deleted. 8 - So I concluded that ""something"" must have renamed the Linux VM mount point from '/media/mark/FireFox Profile/' to '/media/mark/FireFox Profile1/'. </p><p>I conclude that FF must have done the renaming in step 2. </p><p>I launched the Linux VM aiming to search how to rename the mount point back to its original name and low and behold, FF now found the correct profile and everything was happiness again. End of story. Or is it? </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-880;,firefox,other,en-US,1509042;,markfilipak
