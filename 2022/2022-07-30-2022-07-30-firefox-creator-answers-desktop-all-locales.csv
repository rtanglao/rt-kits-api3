I am a long-time user and fan of Firefox, and other open source projects.  Firefox is a fantastic internet browser! </p><p>Having said that, I was shocked and dismayed at what I encountered today.  I was doing some tests for screen-reader usability on a website, and I came across the following: </p><p>Image 1 (attached): Advertisement of Screen-Reader Add-Ons for Firefox </p><p>Image 2 (attached): No Screen-Reader Add-Ons for Firefox are Available </p><p>The Firefox team is advertising screen-reader add-ons for Firefox, which don't seem to exist.  I don't think the recommendation here should be: take down the advertisement for the Firefox native screen-reader add-ons/link to them, these seem to be really important for accessibility, and the Firefox team seems to acknowledge this. :)  </p><p>There is some other missing piece - maybe there are Screen-reader add-ons for Firefox, and they aren't being linked to? Maybe the wrong tag is being used? (The auto tag that is used in the link is ""screen reader""). Maybe there aren't any, and this is an area that needs some additional attention? </p><p>Anyway, I just thought I should bring this to your attention as making our internet accessible to people living with blindness and loss of sight is extremely important. </p><p>Sincerely, Katie </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,1523666;,kmcmi046

Being a lazy person such as myself and thinking I would save the headache of having to install it through Microsoft Edge, I opted into having it installed. Upon booting up my computer and opening firefox, I realized that the homepage was set to <a href=""http://originpc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">originpc.com</a>. I figured that wasn't super weird, but I changed it to <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> because I didn't want that website to be my default homepage. It worked when closing out the program from using the main exit button (the one found in the top right corner), however each time I close all of the individual windows I have open in firefox <a href=""http://originpc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">originpc.com</a> is forced back into the default home page once I relaunch the program. For the past two years I've used an adblocker as a lazy-man's solution to this problem, however now instead of a ""this website blocked"" screen, I'm back at <a href=""http://originpc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">originpc.com</a>. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the program, I have tried wiping my default settings for firefox multiple times, I have tried googling answers left and right but I have not found any semblance of a solution to this problem. I can't find anything in my computer's firefox files that has anything to do with Originpc. Is there anything that I can do? Or perhaps something that I am missing?

Looking at the release notes, I realize that this is because Firefox is  now responding differently to the  ""make everything bigger"" setting in Windows.  I typically have this set to 150 to get everything in Windows set to the appropriate sizes. This was fine with the old Firefox behavior, but now everything in Firefox is too large. Can I revert Firefox to the old font scaling behavior? </p><pre> add-on, setting adjustment, or about config switch? </pre>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,customize,en-US,1523530;,anottingham1
