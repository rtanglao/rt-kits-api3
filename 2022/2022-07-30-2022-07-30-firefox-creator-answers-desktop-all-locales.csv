Whilst I can fix this by changing the extention back to a .zip myself, not everyone will know this. Is this some kind of deliberate security fix? </p><p>I have recently sent all my clients a link to download a zip file from my server and now I'm worried that if any of them are using Firefox, they wont be able to open it. </p><p>Has anyone else had this problem? I'm not sure if it started with the latest update or a previous one. It needs fixing. I have checked all the other major browsers and none of them are changing the file extention. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,other,en-US,"",lynn44

Looking at the release notes, I realize that this is because Firefox is  now responding differently to the  ""make everything bigger"" setting in Windows.  I typically have this set to 150 to get everything in Windows set to the appropriate sizes. This was fine with the old Firefox behavior, but now everything in Firefox is too large. Can I revert Firefox to the old font scaling behavior? </p><pre> add-on, setting adjustment, or about config switch? </pre>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,customize,en-US,1523530;,anottingham1
