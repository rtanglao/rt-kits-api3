Being a lazy person such as myself and thinking I would save the headache of having to install it through Microsoft Edge, I opted into having it installed. Upon booting up my computer and opening firefox, I realized that the homepage was set to <a href=""http://originpc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">originpc.com</a>. I figured that wasn't super weird, but I changed it to <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> because I didn't want that website to be my default homepage. It worked when closing out the program from using the main exit button (the one found in the top right corner), however each time I close all of the individual windows I have open in firefox <a href=""http://originpc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">originpc.com</a> is forced back into the default home page once I relaunch the program. For the past two years I've used an adblocker as a lazy-man's solution to this problem, however now instead of a ""this website blocked"" screen, I'm back at <a href=""http://originpc.com"" rel=""nofollow"">originpc.com</a>. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the program, I have tried wiping my default settings for firefox multiple times, I have tried googling answers left and right but I have not found any semblance of a solution to this problem. I can't find anything in my computer's firefox files that has anything to do with Originpc. Is there anything that I can do? Or perhaps something that I am missing? Thank you for your time. </pre>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1523608;,th3n1ghthawk39
