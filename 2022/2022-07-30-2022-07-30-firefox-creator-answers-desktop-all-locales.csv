Looking at the release notes, I realize that this is because Firefox is  now responding differently to the  ""make everything bigger"" setting in Windows.  I typically have this set to 150 to get everything in Windows set to the appropriate sizes. This was fine with the old Firefox behavior, but now everything in Firefox is too large. Can I revert Firefox to the old font scaling behavior? </p><pre> add-on, setting adjustment, or about config switch? </pre>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,customize,en-US,1523530;,anottingham1
