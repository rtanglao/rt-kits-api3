As you can see in the image, all the tabs are 'restored', in some sense, but when you click on the tab itself, only a blank page appears. I have found that if I duplicate the tab, the contents will appear. </p><p>Thanks so much for any help -- this is really annoying! </p><p>Yours - Stuart </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-950;firefox-9502;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",stuart55
