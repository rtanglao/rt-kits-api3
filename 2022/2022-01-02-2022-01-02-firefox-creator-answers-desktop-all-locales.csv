I believe that earlier this wasn't the case: that once I was searching around among bookmarks they would be available to me to mouse around in for as long as I needed. Now they self-retract after a few seconds. </p><p>Is there a hidden pref to remove or greatly increase the time before the automatic withdrawal of bookmark menus while in use occurs? </p><p>I hope I'm being clear about this.
