Everytime Firefox crashes and/or I need to re-start it, I have to sign back in to at least 8 of my social media accounts (tabs) that I use al the time manually -- which has been happening more frequently.  What's the fix? </p><p>Thanks much, </p><p><br> Kelli </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-950;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",kelli2

And the above code that I tried didn't work.  I'm guessing that something changed with Mozilla Firefox in the last 1-1.5 years, and I have a feeling that if I dig into <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors</a> for hours or even days I won't be able to figure out what I need to change.  Anyone know what the new code should be?  Thanks in advance. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,customize,en-US,1470631;,gaveitatry
