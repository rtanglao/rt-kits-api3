And the above code that I tried didn't work.  I'm guessing that something changed with Mozilla Firefox in the last 1-1.5 years, and I have a feeling that if I dig into <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors</a> for hours or even days I won't be able to figure out what I need to change.  Anyone know what the new code should be?  Thanks in advance. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",gaveitatry
