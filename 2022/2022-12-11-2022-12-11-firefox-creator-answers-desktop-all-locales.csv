The synced tabs would then open in new tabs in the background, while the menu would remain open. </p><p>Since an update, the behaviour has changed, and opening a synced tab now automatically closes the menu, which is most annoying, as when I change computers, I most often have several synced tabs to reopen, not just one. </p><p>browser.bookmarks.openInTabClosesMenu=false does not apply to the synced tabs menu, and I was not able to find any other option that would help. </p><p>browser.tabs.loadBookmarksInBackground=true does not help either. </p><p>What am I missing? As far as I can remember, it worked out of the box until a few weeks ago! (the menu would not close upon opening a synced tab in a new tab, holding down the Ctrl key). The issue appeared after a Firefox update on my 4 devices. </p><p>Many thanks in advance! </p>",linux;desktop;sync;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",eric181

I AM SHOCKED AFTER BELIEVING THAT FIREFOX WAS NOT BLOCKING INFORMATION ON THE WEB THAT THEY DIDN'T POLITICALLY AGREE WITH!  NOW I FIND OUT THERE IS NO WAY TO CONTACT FIREFOX AND ALL THEY HAVE IS THE STANDARD ASK A QUESTION FROM THE COMMUNITY!  THERE ARE TOO MANY GLITCHES WITH DOWNLOADING THEIR UPDATES AND COMPLETELY LOSING MY SAVED PASSWORDS AND NOW THIS BROWSER HAS BLOCKED INFORMATION POSTED ON A NEWS ARTICLE THAT SHOWS TWITTER FEEDS BY THE PRIOR TWITTER ADMIN THAT HAS BEEN FIRED.  I HAVE THE STANDARD SECURITY AND DO TRUST THE SITE THAT I AM ON BUT WITHOUT EXPLANATION FIREFOX HAS BLOCKED THOSE FEEDS IN THE ARTICLE.  CERTAINLY NOT INTENDED TO PROTECT MY BROWSING BUT TO BLOCK AN INTENTIONAL POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE!  I NO LONGER WANT TO TRUST FIREFOX/MOZILLA WITH MY BROWSING CAPABILITIES ESPECIALLY KNOWING IT IS ONLY VOLUNTEERS AND NOT SUPERVISED OR ANY CUSTOMER SERVICE TO GIVE ANSWERS! </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,other,en-US,"",lori.wood

This is not ethical behavior and not what I agreed with using Firefox!,"<p>When I read news articles regarding the new ownership of Twitter and the prior emails and conversations regarding their choice to ban certain politicians  from Twitter....I did not expect for FireFox to interfere with those feeds....but they did!  I thought FireFox was one of the honest browsers I could use and not politically motivated and banning information from viewers!?!  This was simply a news article about how the prinicipals of Twitter took actions against the President of the U.S. to ban his Twitter account and yet I can not hear or read the Feeds???  I was on Standard Security settings recommended to keep me safe????  Why was this information blocked from me????
