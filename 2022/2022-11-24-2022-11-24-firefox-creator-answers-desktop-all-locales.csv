Ad-blockers were disabled by Chrome as soon as it was released. There was a transfer of two of my most frequently used accounts, my personal and school accounts. The official department of education email address used by most schools in my area is different from the one used by the majority of schools in my area. The school has switched everything to the school's official email address in recent months, removing the made email. On the about profile page, I clicked the create account button. The process of creating a new account was unsuccessful. There was an error message, but I don't remember it. As far as my school is concerned, it has already been made, I just have to sign in. Signing in required a primary account, according to an error message. I know the email address and reset my password to the default, but it still doesn't work. Is there anything I can do? </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;,firefox,other,en-US,"",aleenm860

I do not want to exit FF but would like to keep all tabs open.  As of now, if the computer sleeps, and upon awaking,  I try access a password protected website FF will fill in the password and will not require a Password Manager Primary password.  I would like FF to require the Primary password up awaking from the sleep state, and also be able turn off the password manager while the computer is in an active state. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1070;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",sunstarry7
