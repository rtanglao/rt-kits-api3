The school has switched everything to the school's official email address in recent months, removing the made email. On the about profile page, I clicked the create account button. The process of creating a new account was unsuccessful. There was an error message, but I don't remember it. As far as my school is concerned, it has already been made, I just have to sign in. Signing in required a primary account, according to an error message. I know the email address and reset my password to the default, but it still doesn't work.
