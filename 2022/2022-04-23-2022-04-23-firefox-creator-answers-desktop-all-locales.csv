If I have Restore last Session enabled, FF will correctly restore all tabs, except pinned ones.  They no longer show up as pinned or regular tabs.   </p><p>On other machines I have, same windows version, same FF version, pinned tabs survive restart as pinned tabs on the left side of all tabs. </p><p>I've looked high and low in options for anything that modifies pinned tabs behavior, and read various help content and such, but no clue.  The only thing I think of is that on my portable this is a new system install, and on the other machines there have been many updates of OS and FF over the years. </p><p>Does this ring any bell with anyone? </p><p>Thanks. </p><p>--Bill Blue </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1499392;,bblue1976
