She sought help because she can no longer login to her online banking account in Firefox. The problem is confined to Firefox. If she uses Edge, she logs in without any problems. </p><p>She is using Windows 10 pro 64-bit. </p><p>I have an account with the same bank and when I tried to login to my account I received the same error. </p><p>I attempted to uninstall Firefox and was prompted to Refresh Firefox instead; this I did and it took some 15 minutes to complete the refresh process. But still the problem persisted. </p><p>I then uninstalled Firefox; downloaded the Firefox install package and installed it. This also started a Refresh process which this time only too about 10 seconds. However, still the failure to login to the bank account persisted. </p><p>The bank error code is CA_500.IDP_402 but this does not provide any clues to the cause of the problem. </p><p>Of course, she could just switch to using Edge but she is familiar with Firefox and would rather not chnage browsers. </p><p>Are there any suggestions to investigate and resolve this issue? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;,firefox,websites,en-US,1499423;,Kullaroo
