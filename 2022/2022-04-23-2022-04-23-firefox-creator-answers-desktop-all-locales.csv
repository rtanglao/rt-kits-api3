Not anymore.  FF will now only save the file.  Even if I choose ""always ask"" it still just saves the file - never asks what to do with it (save or open with).  Please fix this. It's worked fine for decades and now doesn't work at all.   I tried adding images to show what happens but the ones that show what FF is doing and the FF settings won't upload.  Only the banking download page images will upload.

Worse than usual crash, the last page i was viewing is there but unresponsive to mouse or keyboard including contr-alt-delete. Must push and hold the power button on my Dell XPS8940. Windows 10 Home 21H2 OS Build 19044.1586. Windows Feature Experience Pack 120.2212.4170.0. </p><p>There was a window with 7 tabs, 1 playing a youtube video and 5 with videos not playing, one other site with no audio and another window with a website streaming only audio. When the system stopped, the speakers made an odd sort of buzz sound until powered off. I am on the latest version FF 99.0.1 but a similar crash happened on version 98.0.1. Before that this Dell never locked/crashed up this way. </p><p>This Dell PC has Realtek audio just like our HP W10 laptop and they both had issues when new with all sound not working when playing a youtube video only in Firefox (HP Feb 2021 and Dell Oct 2021). Launching Groove Music and playing an mp3 always got the sound working. Problem did not cause any program to crash. Windows updates to drives eventually fixed the problem but it only even happened in Firefox. Current problem is new in the last month or two and only on Dell. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1499583;,MikeZZ
