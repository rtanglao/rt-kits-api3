Before this, FF understood that there are 2 different reasons why a file might be downloaded: </p> <ol><li> Because the User <em>explicitly</em> wants to save a file for later reference - these files were saved to a directory chosen by the User in Settings </li><li> Because the System needs to save a file e.g. in order to invoke an external handler such as a PDF viewer - these files were saved to a TEMP directory, and not controlled by Settings </li></ol> <p>Now under v98 both types of files are saved to the same location - e.g. my Desktop. So my Desktop is now full of files I consider to be temporary and useless! </p><p>Please restore the old behavior of 2 different locations for the 2 different types of download. </p><p>(Reverting to v97 in the meantime) </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9801;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",eddydnospam+addons.mozilla
