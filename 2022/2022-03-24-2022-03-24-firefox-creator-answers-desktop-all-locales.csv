Firefox used to prompt me to open or download every CSV file. Now it only gives me the option to download. I've gone into the settings and there are two CSV file types shown - both are set to ""Ask"" as the default action. This is really slowing down my work and clogging up my computer with unneeded files. I love Firefox but I really need a way to change this new behavior. Is there a Config change I can make or some other fix for this? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",danielle.mead
