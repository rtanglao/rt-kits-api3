Recently I noticed that Firefox changes the location temporary download files are saved. </p><p>For example, I ask Firefox to always ask when downloading a PDF file, then I click on a link to a PDF file. A dialog window pops out and I select ""Open with (application name)"". Then Firefox saves the PDF file in <strong>some location</strong> and opens the file with the application I select. </p><p>The problem is that I want to modify the <strong>some location</strong> above. An earlier version saves the file to `/tmp/mozilla_${USER}0`, where `${USER}` is my username on Linux. However, I recently noticed that this location is changed to `~/Downloads`. For some of reasons I want to keep my Downloads folder manually managed. Is there a way to change the temporary download location back to `/tmp/mozilla_${USER}0`? </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-980;v98-download;,firefox,customize,en-US,1492021;1492022;,lxylxy123456

I had the task manager open, and nothing happened here, either. I waited a while, in case it was just slow, and tried again. Same. I tried multiple times, and the application never even started to load. I haven’t done anything unusual, so I don’t know what’s so special about today as opposed to any other day. </p><p>Some context: </p><p>I often need to stop the Firefox process via the task manager, because FF doesn’t release memory even when I shut it down, and that causes a massive slowdown on my system. Once I shut it down, clear caches (using CCleaner and/or Avast Cleanup), and restart the laptop, it’s much better. I’ve been doing this for a couple of years, and it’s never caused a problem before. (I’m sure this happens because Firefox is too big for Windows 7, but money’s a bit tight for buying a new laptop. </p><p>So I decided to upgrade Firefox to the latest version. First I uninstalled it. That was probably a big mistake, because now I don’t have a browser, and I have no idea how to download software from the internet without a browser. Can anyone tell me how? </p><p>Thank you! </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Bastette54
