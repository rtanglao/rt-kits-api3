Previous tweak is not working","<p>Something has changed in a Firefox upgrade. I previously could change the print preference through about:config by changing  print.tab_modal.enabled from =True to =False. It's not working now, and the default FF print dialogue does not link properly to the printer. I nominate print in Black, and it prints in colour, regardless. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9801;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",sthnmetals

Recently I noticed that Firefox changes the location temporary download files are saved. </p><p>For example, I ask Firefox to always ask when downloading a PDF file, then I click on a link to a PDF file. A dialog window pops out and I select ""Open with (application name)"". Then Firefox saves the PDF file in <strong>some location</strong> and opens the file with the application I select. </p><p>The problem is that I want to modify the <strong>some location</strong> above. An earlier version saves the file to `/tmp/mozilla_${USER}0`, where `${USER}` is my username on Linux. However, I recently noticed that this location is changed to `~/Downloads`. For some of reasons I want to keep my Downloads folder manually managed. Is there a way to change the temporary download location back to `/tmp/mozilla_${USER}0`? </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-980;,firefox,customize,en-US,1492021;1492022;,lxylxy123456

I had the task manager open, and nothing happened here, either. I waited a while, in case it was just slow, and tried again. Same. I tried multiple times, and the application never even started to load. I haven’t done anything unusual, so I don’t know what’s so special about today as opposed to any other day. </p><p>Some context: </p><p>I often need to stop the Firefox process via the task manager, because FF doesn’t release memory even when I shut it down, and that causes a massive slowdown on my system. Once I shut it down, clear caches (using CCleaner and/or Avast Cleanup), and restart the laptop, it’s much better. I’ve been doing this for a couple of years, and it’s never caused a problem before. (I’m sure this happens because Firefox is too big for Windows 7, but money’s a bit tight for buying a new laptop. </p><p>So I decided to upgrade Firefox to the latest version. First I uninstalled it. That was probably a big mistake, because now I don’t have a browser, and I have no idea how to download software from the internet without a browser. Can anyone tell me how? </p><p>Thank you! </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Bastette54

Firefox used to prompt me to open or download every CSV file. Now it only gives me the option to download. I've gone into the settings and there are two CSV file types shown - both are set to ""Ask"" as the default action. This is really slowing down my work and clogging up my computer with unneeded files. I love Firefox but I really need a way to change this new behavior. Is there a Config change I can make or some other fix for this? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,customize,en-US,1491955;1491961;1491980;1491985;,danielle.mead
