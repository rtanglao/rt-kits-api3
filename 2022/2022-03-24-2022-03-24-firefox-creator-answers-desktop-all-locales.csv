I have Firefox on my iPhone XR and MacBook Air. Both devices are up to date and as of today, Firefox is up to date on both. I've never had a problem using the ""send tab to device"" feature from phone to laptop or laptop to phone. After updating Firefox on my phone, I now can send a tab from the phone to my laptop, but not from the laptop to the phone even though it says ""sent"". I've tried signing in and out of Firefox on both, deleting both devices from my account and adding them back again, making sure notifications are on...just from Googling those were the main things suggested but I'm still having the same problem. </p><p>The only thing I can think of is that since the phone update, there is now another device showing in the list of connected devices called ""Firefox iOS 98, iPhone."" In the first image I attached, the circled ""Firefox on iPhone"" is what my phone has always been, but now there's this new one too. Last one is my laptop. As far as I can tell, the top two are the same thing. I tried deleting one or the other though, and both completely signed me out of Firefox on my phone. When I signed back in, both were there again. I can't seem to have one without the other! The second pic is what it looks like when I try to send a tab from my laptop. As you can see, only the ""Firefox on iPhone"" is showing up. The only thing I can think of is that the tabs from my laptop are being sent to this new weird ""Firefox ioS 98, iPhone"" that I can't delete or get to show up when trying to send from my laptop. I have double checked and the browser on my phone still lists ""Firefox on iPhone"" as the correct one for my device. </p><p>Any ideas at all? As I said, I'm not super tech savvy but I've tried all the basic fixes and I just cannot figure out why this is happening unless there's a bug which I hope is the case because at least it's not just me. Any help at all would be so appreciated! </p><p>Thank you!! Caroline </p>",desktop;sync;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",ctroullis

""All"" is pre-selected, but a specific selection of page numbers can be immediately entered in the box to the right of Pages, which is beneath the preselected All button. Y<strong>ou just enter the pages, and the radio button for pages, instead of All, is automatically entered by the system.</strong> Whereas with Firefox's print dialog, I have to go to the drop down, drop down the options, select Custom, and then finally I can enter the pages. This is a lot more time-consuming fuss (extra steps) compared to the Windows system print dialog. If like me you almost always print a selection of pages, and do it fairly often, the point is not a small one. The other problem with the Firefox print dialog is that, despite a large screen at 24"" diagonal, I can no longer see all the Firefox print dialog box. I gotta scroll down. So in both cases, Firefox has deemed it a good idea to make doing fairly simple and often-repeated things harder and more cumbersome, taking more steps. This is why I and others gripe about having no automatic bypass for Firefox print dialog box. But Firefox might make its version easier to use, instead of I suppose just copying the mistakes of the big characters, Google and MSoft. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9801;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",Quenchoo

The result is choppy audio, freezing video, menus and keystrokes that stop responding, etc. I can sometimes get control back by pressing and holding down the touch pad to ""interrupt"" the craziness of this unusual behavior. </p><p>Monterey was designed for Apple Silicon, and then retro fitted to work with Intel i7 processors. Monterey added a lot of new functions, all adding to CPU load. Apple changed the fan curve to go from minimum fan speed to maximum with no stops in between.  </p><p>Here’s an article while a little old (pre-Monterey) describes my issue well. Notice the same throbbing CPU load graphic. </p><p><a href=""https://ozmoroz.com/2020/07/macos-kernel-tasks/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ozmoroz.com/2020/07/macos-kernel-tasks/</a> </p><p>CPU load goes up without good reason, which triggers Core Duet, which turns on Kernel Task to run do nothing cycles on the CPU. Window Server is always using IMHO too much CPU.  </p><p>But what has me concerned is Firefox's CPU use, which is high and stays high, especially when I add in all the enhancements that Firefox has made to offload various processes. </p><p>Please do not suggest the ordinary solutions, they do not work. Resetting the SMC for example does not help. It is not any of my tiny little applets that run in the background. If they were causing any problems, it would show in the Activity Monitor. </p><p>I suspect the problem is in the Apple Monterey Operating System. But I am not an engineer and cannot write code. I cannot prove that there is a problem with Apple's Monterey. Of course, Apple will never consider they are the source of the problem, always blaming the user or the user's setup.  </p><p>I was able to use TG-Pro and iStat to try to isolate the problem. TG-Pro allows me to create my own custom fan curve, which is working well. Fans go up and down with temperature. No sensor is running sustained high temperatures, although there are spikes. But nothing over 100 degrees centigrade, which is the maximum limit of the Intel i7 processors. </p><p>The Apple Support Communities are riddled with hundreds of users reporting overheating behavior when there is not actual overheating. Complaints about Kernel Task and Window Server. Not one has yet provided any useful answer, because in my view, this is a bug in Monterey. I never had these problems in Big Sur. Going back to Big Sur is not an option. </p><p>I did try to create a new Firefox Profile and just loaded the minimum add-ons necessary to stream on geolocked websites to which I pay monthly to subscribe. The Geolocked Websites detected my VPN even with Geolocation spoofed. My current Firefox profile works fine for accessing my streaming accounts. I deactivated most of the add-ons and it didn't solve the throttling. So doing a reset of my profile makes me worried that the new profile will not work in my environment. </p><p>I tried to upload a screenshot of the Google Search of all the people looking for a solution to this Monterey CPU load issue. Unfortunately, your image uploader is stuck in a spinning wheel of death. I uploaded two screen shots of my iStat results, but the third screenshot is not being handled well by your webpage. I can still type and will submit this without the last screenshot. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",NormG1

Like I said, not sure if it's related but I lost all of my cookies, bookmarks, history and passwords right after I clicked a sketchy file, so I would need to input all my passwords again.

I had the task manager open, and nothing happened here, either. I waited a while, in case it was just slow, and tried again. Same. I tried multiple times, and the application never even started to load. I haven’t done anything unusual, so I don’t know what’s so special about today as opposed to any other day. </p><p>Some context: </p><p>I often need to stop the Firefox process via the task manager, because FF doesn’t release memory even when I shut it down, and that causes a massive slowdown on my system. Once I shut it down, clear caches (using CCleaner and/or Avast Cleanup), and restart the laptop, it’s much better. I’ve been doing this for a couple of years, and it’s never caused a problem before. (I’m sure this happens because Firefox is too big for Windows 7, but money’s a bit tight for buying a new laptop. </p><p>So I decided to upgrade Firefox to the latest version. First I uninstalled it. That was probably a big mistake, because now I don’t have a browser, and I have no idea how to download software from the internet without a browser.
