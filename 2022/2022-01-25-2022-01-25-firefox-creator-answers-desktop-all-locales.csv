The by far most convenient way to open these files, which are plain text files, is to just show them as text (either in the same tab, or a new tab). For example if you search for a publication on Google scholar, and click the quotation mark and then BiBTeX, you get the bibliographical information shown as text directly in the browser (see attached screenshot). </p><p>However, many other websites and journals instead give you a link to an actual .bib file, instead of just serving up the text. But since a .bib file is just a plain text file, it should be no problem for Firefox to display this text. However, when I go under settings and try to select default actions for .bib files, my only options are to either save the file, or open it with another application (i.e., not Firefox). For other file types, for example .pdf, it works to select Open in Firefox as the default action, but not for .bib files. </p><p>Is there a way to fix this problem? </p><p>I'm using Firefox 95.0.2 on Mac OS 12.1 </p><p>Thanks, Tor </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-950;,firefox,other,en-US,"",tor.nordam
