But the address bar still redirects to the search engine although I said that that the address bar should be used only for the navigation.  </p><p>Please make the address bar working for the navigation only if the option ""Add search bar in toolbar"" is selected.

Some of these go back years, but it's a new problem for me that coincides with the most recent upgrade. If it's a bug ... Mozilla needs to fix it!  If it's something I'm doing differently, some assistance (from anyone) would be appreciated. Thanks! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,other,en-US,1477816;,warwickm
