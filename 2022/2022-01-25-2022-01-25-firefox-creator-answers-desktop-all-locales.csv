I've been using Firefox as my main browser for many years and since some time I also started supporting Mozilla financially with whatever little I can with recurring payments. To the problem: since some time patch / commit view on HitHub with Firefox is broken. I guess many @mozilla have github accounts so you can open and read <a href=""https://support.github.com/ticket/1318472"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.github.com/ticket/1318472</a> but to summarise: my first entry there was: ``` When viewing Linux kernel style Pull Requests on GitHub, using Firefox, TABs are displayed as 4 spaces, which is confusing, since the default is 8 spaces, which is also what is displayed in chrome and chromium. E.g. <a href=""https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/pull/4747/commits/e9cc9312841a9329797b0b676335c8cb1a0dc779"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/pull/4747/commits/e9cc9312841a9329797b0b676335c8cb1a0dc779</a> ``` then a screenshot (attached) and a clarification to it: ``` As you can see there the patch area between lines 238 and 245 is wrongly indented by 4 spaces, whereas areas above and below are correctly indented by 8 spaces. ``` Then more: ``` No, space isn't used for indentation in that code. They can download raw code and verify, I'm sure they know how to do that. Why don't they just reproduce that themselves? Start Firefox, navigate to any PR commit like <a href=""https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/pull/4884/commits/b19a64df2c2fcd63d7407ef500fd3312287c8995"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/pull/4884/commits/b19a64df2c2fcd63d7407ef500fd3312287c8995</a> and click arrows above and below the diff to display surrounding code. Then navigate to or download the raw patch <a href=""https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/commit/b19a64df2c2fcd63d7407ef500fd3312287c8995.patch"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/thesofproject/sof/commit/b19a64df2c2fcd63d7407ef500fd3312287c8995.patch</a> to see TABs used everywhere.

It's a problem with the way firefox interprets the combination of the tab-size css and the particular markdown we use for our diffs. </p><p>After reviewing the Issue in more detail there it has not been prioritized and will most likely not be addressed in the near future. ``` This is a deal-breaker for me.
