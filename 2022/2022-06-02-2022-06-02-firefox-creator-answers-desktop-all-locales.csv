If I put a video into full screen, or the browser into full screen, the bar disappears, likewise if I take the window out of maximised then it also disappears.  </p><p>The only thing that I can think that might be contributing to this would be the fact that two displays have a different resolution, the main display being 2560 x 1440 and the top display being 1920 x 1080.  </p><p>Any ideas to try to resolve this would be appreciated!  Thank you to whoever reads this, and thank you for any possible advice to attempt to resolve this issue! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,other,en-US,"",emolg111
