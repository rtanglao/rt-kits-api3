1381286,2022-06-29 16:37:08 -0700,2022-06-29 16:37:08 -0700,Firefox NS_ERROR_FAILURE when rendering large number of nodes using flowchart library,"<p>I am testing react applications which draws large number of nodes on Canvas through a flowchart library called <a href=""https://js.cytoscape.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">cytoscape</a> cytoscape. As the number of node gets big, the rendering slows down. This is expected due to performance limitation of the browser. However, there is an unexpected error: the browser breaks with ""NS_ERROR_FAILURE"" whenever we zoom-in too close to the graph that is drawn.  </p><p>As the website breaks with this error, the graph disappears and the user experience is compromised. I want to know if there is a way to prevent this error from happening. Slow rendering is not a critical issue but this breakage is a critical problem for us. Let me know if you know the workaround or you need more context about this issue. </p><p>Here is the error message. I attached what the graph looks like.

At seemingly random times it will freeze for between two and five minutes (roughly). UI elements become completely unresponsive and the cursor does not update when moving over the browser window. The window will not minimize. Yet, Windows Task Manager does not report the application as being unresponsive. While never a common problem, any freezes in the past would eventually cause the Windows Task Manager to identify it as unresponsive. </p><p>I have disabled ""recommended performance settings"" and hardware acceleration to no avail. Everything seems perfectly normal immediately before and after the freezes, and I've yet to identify how I can trigger them. I do not recall having made any changes to my browser before the freezes started occurring, though multiple Windows updates have taken place since then. If I'm too impatient to wait I will end the Firefox processes via Windows Task Manager and restart it so I can return to my tabs without having cookies deleted. I have 13 plugins mainly covering privacy/security concerns. Is there some sort of debug tool I can engage to see what's occupying Firefox while it's frozen? I've just found the Firefox Task Manager, and will see if it can offer any additional information during/after the freezes. </p><p>Thanks, Logan </p>",desktop;tips;windows-11;firefox-1020;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",lteder01
