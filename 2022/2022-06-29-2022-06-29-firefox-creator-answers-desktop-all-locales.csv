At seemingly random times it will freeze for between two and five minutes (roughly). UI elements become completely unresponsive and the cursor does not update when moving over the browser window. The window will not minimize. Yet, Windows Task Manager does not report the application as being unresponsive. While never a common problem, any freezes in the past would eventually cause the Windows Task Manager to identify it as unresponsive. </p><p>I have disabled ""recommended performance settings"" and hardware acceleration to no avail. Everything seems perfectly normal immediately before and after the freezes, and I've yet to identify how I can trigger them. I do not recall having made any changes to my browser before the freezes started occurring, though multiple Windows updates have taken place since then. If I'm too impatient to wait I will end the Firefox processes via Windows Task Manager and restart it so I can return to my tabs without having cookies deleted. I have 13 plugins mainly covering privacy/security concerns. Is there some sort of debug tool I can engage to see what's occupying Firefox while it's frozen? I've just found the Firefox Task Manager, and will see if it can offer any additional information during/after the freezes. </p><p>Thanks, Logan </p>",desktop;tips;windows-11;firefox-1020;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",lteder01
