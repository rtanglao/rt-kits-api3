I would like this exact homepage on all the devices where I sign in with my Firefox account. Instead, every time I sign into a new device and sync, my homepage is completely destroyed and scrambled on all devices, including my main laptop and I have to painstakingly recreate the homepage I want. What is going wrong here? How can I set up one homepage on one device that will be synced to all other devices? </p>",linux;desktop;sync;firefox-1030;firefox-10301;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",johannes.julius
