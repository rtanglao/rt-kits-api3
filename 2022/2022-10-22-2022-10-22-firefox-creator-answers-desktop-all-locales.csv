I can't send a screen shot as nothing shows.  There is no error message.  It is just that I cannot use my Yahoo email account like I could before the download so I have had to use Chrome with my Yahoo email in order to function.  Do you have any suggestions on what I can do to fix things?  Thank you. </p>",desktop;other;windows-81;firefox-1050;firefox-10503;,firefox,other,en-US,1542704;,inwest

I updated my Firefox browser to 106.0.1 (64 bits) today and all of a sudden my 1Password manager stopped filling in my usernames and passwords for me into my logins. How do I get this functionality back so my 1Password manager works with Firefox again? Is there some setting that I failed to update in Firefox? Thanks.

En mi caso no me gusta, me gusta que tanto la navegacion privada como la navegacion normal esten bajo el mismo icono y no como una aplicacion separada. Como puedo volver al anterior estilo de Mozilla Firefox??
