Waiting (5 min) did nothing, so I clicked and the ""... is not responding"" dialogue popped up, and I closed it.  </p><p>Upon starting again, it restored the tabs that were previously open. I could swap between use them normally. However, when I opened a link in a new tab, it froze again. </p><p>After another restart, not even the new empty tab would load, freezing again, and every try afterwards. </p><p>Starting in troubleshooting mode or reseting did nothing (though I may not have waited long enough, an 'Old Firefox Data' folder was created and filled, but no window opened). I ran the installer again, which resulted in me having to redo some Addon settings, but worked fine for a while (~1h maybe?), before freezing again. A PC restart fixed it again for a longer while, but then it happened again, this time while trying to write this.

Let me explain.... I have noticed for a while now that the cursor active position in 2nd, 3rd, and more additional FF browser windows is not placed inside the search box, middle of the page, so when I start typing nothing happens. I have to manually move it to the search box and click it in there, with the mouse. Mildly frustrating? I tried searching on here for some info on why it only happens on extra opened FF windows. Found something about it moving to the URL address bar, but the chosen solution did nothing for my ""extra browser windows, cursor not in search box"" problem. I am on a Win10 laptop, fully up to date software, and am using FF also fully up to date. Some FF add ons, but I don't think they're the problem, because I've had them installed forever, and this problem seems to be a more recent irritant. Couple of months, at least.  So, after doing some testing and trying some modifications in ""about:config"" parameters cursor/search/tab/windows with no luck, I stumbled on a work around. I have my chosen browsers (and some other apps) pinned to the Windows taskbar for quick access. To start my first FF window, I click the FF icon that's pinned to the taskbar. It starts, and the cursor is active/focued inside the search box, which is what I expect and desire.  Now, if I start a second browser window by right clicking the pinned FF taskbar icon, and start a new window by clicking ""Open new window"", when the window opens, and I start typing (expecting the cursor to be focused inside the search box), nothing happens, no typing input, and I have to stop, and manually click inisde the search box to get the cursor in there, and functional.  What I discovered from my casual testing is, if I start a second browser window by right clicking the pinned taskbar FF icon, and select the  ""Firefox"" option to open a new FF browser window, when the new FF window opens, the cursor IS focused and functional inside the search box. I can start typing immediately and the text appears inside the main search box, as expected and desired.  I have no idea why the cursor works when I start secondary FF browser windows using the ""Firefox"" option versus the ""Open new window"" option when I right click the pinned FF taskbar icon, but it works the way I want it to work which is put the cursor inside the search box middle of the page. Maybe it's ""functioning as designed"", I don't know. Maybe the FF developer braintrust can figure out why the 2 methods of opening subsequent FF windows produce a different functionality for the placement and input capability of the cursor?   I'm just posting this up so that if anyone else is getting frustrated with the ""lost cursor in the search box"" problem, maybe try starting extra FF windows using the ""Firefox"" option if you start them by right clicking a pinned FF taskbar icon, like I do.    Just thought I'd post it up, as it all struck me as odd, but the work around is simple. :) </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",MrSensible

I am noticing an alarming number of times, when I come here to ask a question, the pages are shown using a foreign language that I cannot read properly, as well as finding no available options present to translate. Is this intended, or is it something that I am experiencing alone?? Please clarify how to translate the pages to <strong>English</strong> please, or explain why this would be happening, and <strong>Thanks in advance.</strong> </p><p>I have also noticed recently that <strong>Firefo</strong>x is not a very well trusted browser among sites I visit, and that many features of websites will deny you access, when using <strong>Firefox</strong>, but can be used perfectly well in <strong>Chrome</strong> browser, and others. for instance, when  I went to check my refund status at the<strong> IRS</strong> website, it would not work in <strong>Firefox</strong>, and came back with a message that I was <strong>denied access to the server</strong>, but when  I tried the same exact site in <strong>Chrome</strong>, I was able to get my refund status just fine. Also, many sites that offer a chat option will not work in <strong>Firefox</strong>, and if I want to do an online chat session of any kind, I have to do it in <strong>Chrome</strong>, or some other browser for it to work. this is frustrating because as stated above, I have been a <strong>Firefox</strong> user for many years, to see now that it is becoming a second class browser. So I ask, is there a way that I can install an older version of <strong>Firefox</strong>, from maybe a couple of years back, you know when it used ot work well, or will I be forced to upgrade it if I do so?? Again, <strong>Thanks i advance!!</strong> </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-970;firefox-9702;,firefox,other,en-US,"",zlloyd2
