I am noticing an alarming number of times, when I come here to ask a question, the pages are shown using a foreign language that I cannot read properly, as well as finding no available options present to translate. Is this intended, or is it something that I am experiencing alone?? Please clarify how to translate the pages to <strong>English</strong> please, or explain why this would be happening, and <strong>Thanks in advance.</strong> </p><p>I have also noticed recently that <strong>Firefo</strong>x is not a very well trusted browser among sites I visit, and that many features of websites will deny you access, when using <strong>Firefox</strong>, but can be used perfectly well in <strong>Chrome</strong> browser, and others. for instance, when  I went to check my refund status at the<strong> IRS</strong> website, it would not work in <strong>Firefox</strong>, and came back with a message that I was <strong>denied access to the server</strong>, but when  I tried the same exact site in <strong>Chrome</strong>, I was able to get my refund status just fine. Also, many sites that offer a chat option will not work in <strong>Firefox</strong>, and if I want to do an online chat session of any kind, I have to do it in <strong>Chrome</strong>, or some other browser for it to work. this is frustrating because as stated above, I have been a <strong>Firefox</strong> user for many years, to see now that it is becoming a second class browser. So I ask, is there a way that I can install an older version of <strong>Firefox</strong>, from maybe a couple of years back, you know when it used ot work well, or will I be forced to upgrade it if I do so?? Again, <strong>Thanks i advance!!</strong> </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-970;firefox-9702;,firefox,other,en-US,"",zlloyd2

Somehow the two email addresses behave differently regarding msgs in the inbox when double clicking on it.  One opens the msg as ""normal"" and the other does not open the msg, but generates a reply to myself, as if I hit reply and put my own email address in the ""to"" box.  How do I change it to simply open the msg?  Bo </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ncatherine
