Let me explain.... I have noticed for a while now that the cursor active position in 2nd, 3rd, and more additional FF browser windows is not placed inside the search box, middle of the page, so when I start typing nothing happens. I have to manually move it to the search box and click it in there, with the mouse. Mildly frustrating? I tried searching on here for some info on why it only happens on extra opened FF windows. Found something about it moving to the URL address bar, but the chosen solution did nothing for my ""extra browser windows, cursor not in search box"" problem. I am on a Win10 laptop, fully up to date software, and am using FF also fully up to date. Some FF add ons, but I don't think they're the problem, because I've had them installed forever, and this problem seems to be a more recent irritant. Couple of months, at least.  So, after doing some testing and trying some modifications in ""about:config"" parameters cursor/search/tab/windows with no luck, I stumbled on a work around. I have my chosen browsers (and some other apps) pinned to the Windows taskbar for quick access. To start my first FF window, I click the FF icon that's pinned to the taskbar. It starts, and the cursor is active/focued inside the search box, which is what I expect and desire.  Now, if I start a second browser window by right clicking the pinned FF taskbar icon, and start a new window by clicking ""Open new window"", when the window opens, and I start typing (expecting the cursor to be focused inside the search box), nothing happens, no typing input, and I have to stop, and manually click inisde the search box to get the cursor in there, and functional.  What I discovered from my casual testing is, if I start a second browser window by right clicking the pinned taskbar FF icon, and select the  ""Firefox"" option to open a new FF browser window, when the new FF window opens, the cursor IS focused and functional inside the search box. I can start typing immediately and the text appears inside the main search box, as expected and desired.  I have no idea why the cursor works when I start secondary FF browser windows using the ""Firefox"" option versus the ""Open new window"" option when I right click the pinned FF taskbar icon, but it works the way I want it to work which is put the cursor inside the search box middle of the page. Maybe it's ""functioning as designed"", I don't know. Maybe the FF developer braintrust can figure out why the 2 methods of opening subsequent FF windows produce a different functionality for the placement and input capability of the cursor?   I'm just posting this up so that if anyone else is getting frustrated with the ""lost cursor in the search box"" problem, maybe try starting extra FF windows using the ""Firefox"" option if you start them by right clicking a pinned FF taskbar icon, like I do.    Just thought I'd post it up, as it all struck me as odd, but the work around is simple. :) </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",MrSensible
