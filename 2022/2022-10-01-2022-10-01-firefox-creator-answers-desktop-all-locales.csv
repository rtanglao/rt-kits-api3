Receive 404 page not found error.,"<p>Since around Sep. 15 2022 cannot log in Home Depot credit account (Citibank) online  and receive a <strong>404 page not found</strong> error. Since I have paperless billing I need to go online.  </p><p>Today September 30 around 5:15 PM PDT I called Home Depot customer service number 800-677-0232 as imprinted on the back of the card.  (<em>Consumer financial services are provided &amp; processed by Citibank.</em>) </p><p><strong>Long story short:</strong> I was told that they <strong>do not support Firefox since about three years</strong> that I have to use either Safari or Chrome or Edge. When I told them that it worked until September 15 the answer was ignorantly repeated. </p><p><strong>The culprit is Citibank who manages the financial services i.e. credit card for Home Depot. </strong>  <strong>Citibank blocks Firefox</strong> users from accessing their account information with out any kind of notice.  <strong>Only information one gets is a </strong>false and misleading<strong> error message: </strong>404, page not found<strong>.</strong> </p><p>So Citibank decided Firefox browser will not be any longer supported, apparently since 2019 yet I experience it for the first time two weeks ago.  Not the basic courtesy of any kind or form of professionalism and announcement or notice. Just a blank white page and the browser tab ""<strong>404: page not found</strong>"" unless [Sh]Citibank changes that you will no longer can use Firefox to log into your Citibank account. You might have well noticed that all the search result links you find listed ("" Home Depot credit card"") result in 404 error pages when using Firefox. </p><p>It is this proverbial arrogant ""we show you the middle finger"" attitude I have had enough with. Be it either constant ""enforced"" updates or every other year yet another browser that's not supported or another gimmick. </p><p><strong>No word about from Home Depot or Citibank about this</strong>, despite all the communication channels, no email, text message, automated phone call or USPS letter.  But junk, unrequested advertising, that works all the time on all channels. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",dorcom
