We did not used a lot of java script and try to avoid overloading our website with non necessary elements but it is still not working on Firefox. Meanwhile our web designers have chosen light weight themes and optimised the site for browsers so the problem is not from our side.

As I recently switched to FiOS and the issues started at the same time i first thought this was a router problem, however other web browsers have no problems, and it is exclusively Firefox. (I have checked this with Verizon support already and because this is exclusive to Firefox there was not much they could do other than help confirm with other browsers everything seems fine) </p><p>The problem specifically: While browsing any web page, Firefox will seem loose connection to the internet briefly. The best way to describe the problem is: for about 30 seconds Firefox is fine, then for about 10 it will lose connection, then Firefox will regain full connection for another 30 seconds. Some websites like YouTube help me confirm this as I will attempt to open a video. The web page will load part way, then YouTube will say there is no internet connection, and after a few seconds it will then load again with the error page changing back to the video. This happens for any website I visit, trying a google search, browsing social media sites, or even navigating these help pages.  </p><p>Testing: I have tested my router with other devices and there are no problems. I have tested using other web browsers and they do not have any problems. To test further, I have had a stream playing on another other browser (Microsoft Edge) while trying to replicate the problem to confirm it is not my internet connection. There is no interruption in the stream, and I still can replicate the problem on Firefox for any website. </p><p>Problem Solving Attempted: I have tried disabling my firewall, I have examined all of my router's settings, and I have tried clearing my browsing history. None of this worked. I confirmed that I am using the most up to date version of Firefox and have tried using prior versions to no avail. I have also tried following all of the steps in a few of the help topics in Firefox help with no results: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-cant-load-websites-other-browsers-can"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/firefox-cant-load-websites-other-browsers-can</a> and <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/websites-dont-load-troubleshoot-and-fix-errors"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/websites-dont-load-troubleshoot-and-fix-errors</a>. I have also confirmed my drivers are up to date and tried resetting my computers network socket. </p><p>I don't know why Firefox refuses to run properly now, any help would be appreciated. I know I wrote a short novel there, but I wanted to be as detailed as I could because none of the 'typical' fixes have worked, and I have tried many less than typical solutions too. </p><p>Thank you for anything you can offer Michael </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mjurek11

Receive 404 page not found error.,"<p>Since around Sep. 15 2022 cannot log in Home Depot credit account (Citibank) online  and receive a <strong>404 page not found</strong> error. Since I have paperless billing I need to go online.  </p><p>Today September 30 around 5:15 PM PDT I called Home Depot customer service number 800-677-0232 as imprinted on the back of the card.  (<em>Consumer financial services are provided &amp; processed by Citibank.</em>) </p><p><strong>Long story short:</strong> I was told that they <strong>do not support Firefox since about three years</strong> that I have to use either Safari or Chrome or Edge. When I told them that it worked until September 15 the answer was ignorantly repeated. </p><p><strong>The culprit is Citibank who manages the financial services i.e. credit card for Home Depot. </strong>  <strong>Citibank blocks Firefox</strong> users from accessing their account information with out any kind of notice.  <strong>Only information one gets is a </strong>false and misleading<strong> error message: </strong>404, page not found<strong>.</strong> </p><p>So Citibank decided Firefox browser will not be any longer supported, apparently since 2019 yet I experience it for the first time two weeks ago.  Not the basic courtesy of any kind or form of professionalism and announcement or notice. Just a blank white page and the browser tab ""<strong>404: page not found</strong>"" unless [Sh]Citibank changes that you will no longer can use Firefox to log into your Citibank account. You might have well noticed that all the search result links you find listed ("" Home Depot credit card"") result in 404 error pages when using Firefox. </p><p>It is this proverbial arrogant ""we show you the middle finger"" attitude I have had enough with. Be it either constant ""enforced"" updates or every other year yet another browser that's not supported or another gimmick. </p><p><strong>No word about from Home Depot or Citibank about this</strong>, despite all the communication channels, no email, text message, automated phone call or USPS letter.  But junk, unrequested advertising, that works all the time on all channels. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",dorcom
