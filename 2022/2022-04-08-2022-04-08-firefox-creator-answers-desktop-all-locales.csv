It has not been able to complete a successful Time Machine backup since April 1st. Prior to April 1st Time Machine backed-up fine. The error message is on the accompanying image. I called Apple Tech Support and they really did not know the causation, though we did tell Time Machine to skip the mentioned file. The back up was then successful.  </p><p>I, unfortunately, do not remember the version of Firefox, other than esr and that I updated a month or two ago. I am pretty sure the version number was in the 90's. I did update to 91.6 esr tonight.  </p><p>Thank you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-9161;firefox-916;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",gym4jim

When I click on ""Print""  from the Crossword web-page it only allows me to save it as a pdf. I never had this problem until today.  It used to be that clicking on ""Print"" would allow me either to save or send to my printer. Now there is no choice. Everything works fine if I use Microsoft Edge or my tablet (Android), but it won't work with FireFix on my desktop running Windows 10. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9801;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",mark_bridger
