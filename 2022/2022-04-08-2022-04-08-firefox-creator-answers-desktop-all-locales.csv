Eppure, negli ultimi mesi il browser mi ha dato diversi problemi, Desidero sollecitarvi, in modo da poterli risolvere al più presto. </p> <ol><li> 1 Negli ultimi dieci giorni Firefox mi apre tutti i file pdf in una nuova scheda quando desidero scaricarli. Inoltre, mi salva in automatico il file nella cartella Download, sebbene io abbia specificato nelle impostazioni di chiedermi sempre dove scaricare il File. Poiché tali opzioni non sono di mio gradimento, e poiché non sono riuscito in nessun modo a risolverlo autonomamente, pongo a voi la questione. </li></ol> <ol><li> 2 Su un mio pc, una volta caricata un'immagine, questa non viene visualizzata in anteprima. Infatti, nell'anteprima dell'immagine, questa viene vista sempre come una serie di linee verticali colorate, impedendomi di caricare qualunque foto/immagine ecc. Ne è un esempio l'immagine presente in allegato. Tale problema non è presente su Google Chrome o su altri browser. Inoltre, se tale problema era riscontrato su un solo pc, ora che ho fatto la sincronizzazione con il mio account Firefox, ora il problema è presente su ogni dispositivo pc connesso. Ho provato, come consigliato su internet, a cancellare uno per uno le estensioni scaricate, ma il problema non è dato da nessuna delle estensioni del mio browser. Potete risolvere il problema? </li></ol> <ol><li> 3 Negli ultimi cinque giorni Firefox si blocca temporaneamente, per poi chiudersi e riaprirsi in automatico, impedendomi di lavorare. </li></ol> <ol><li> 4 Esiste il modo per unire più finestre in una sola? </li></ol> <p>È possibile risolvere tali problematiche? Potete dirmi in che modo? In attesa di un vostro responso, porgo miei più cordiali saluti. Simone Siccardi </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-990;,firefox,other,it,1495940;,simone.siccardi

Our systems team have relayed me the following explanation: </p><p>“The latest versions of Firefox aren’t compatible with the “Extended Protection” for Windows Integrated authentication (NTLM) security setting that we have set on the Faculty Intranet… </p><p>The reason for using extended protection is that it enhances the existing Windows Authentication functionality to mitigate authentication relay or ""man in the middle"" attacks.

Let me explain (see attached Screenshots (x2)). </p><p>The Tabs, Address Bar &amp; Bookmarks Bar all display horizontally, across the entire display area. </p><p>However the Main Area/Webpage Display Area does not extend fully in both the width &amp; depth. Therefore there you can see a medium grey background that runs around the left, bottom &amp; right hand-side of the  Main Area/Webpage Display Area. </p><p>I would suggest that there is a logical coding error. The coding may simply say hang the Main Area/Webpage Display Area (this box) from the centre of the displayed bars that run the width of the whole page. The coding may have a buffer to the left, bottom and right hand-side. Alternatively, the instruction to expand (this box) may not be written like the display bars above i.e. in relation to how the the width is expressed. Then (this box) needs to be told to expand from it's  top centre, from the above bars, to the bottom of the page. </p><p>I think this is a simple enough fix, but it has been in Tor for at least three updates/builds. I hope that you are using GitHub as you develop this web browser. That way you can see when this element had it's coding changed. </p><p>Best, Dan. </p><p>Tech Specs: </p><p>Device name	Lenovo Processor	Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-3632QM CPU @ 2.20GHz   2.20 GHz Installed RAM	16.0 GB (15.9 GB usable) Device ID	E63B8D18-B16D-47F9-B367-B9C152B24A89 Product ID	00326-10000-00000-AA552 System type	64-bit operating system, x64-based processor Pen and touch	No pen or touch input is available for this display </p><p>Edition	Windows 10 Home Version	21H2 Installed on	‎06/‎11/‎2021 OS build	19044.1586 Experience	Windows Feature Experience Pack 120.2212.4170.0 </p><p>Tor Browser Extended Support Release 11.0.10 (based on Mozilla Firefox 91.8.0esr) (64-bit) </p><p>Application Basics </p> <hr> <p>Name: Firefox Version: 91.8.0esr Build ID: 20220602110101 Distribution ID: Update Channel: release User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0 OS: Windows_NT 10.0 19044 Launcher Process: Enabled Multiprocess Windows: 1/1 Fission Windows: 0/1 Disabled by default Remote Processes: 7 Enterprise Policies: Inactive Google Location Service Key: Missing Google Safebrowsing Key: Missing Mozilla Location Service Key: Missing Safe Mode: false </p><p>Firefox Features </p> <hr> <p>Name: Onboarding Version: 1.0 ID: onboarding@mozilla.org </p><p>Remote Processes </p> <hr> <p>Type: Web Content Count: 3 / 8 </p><p>Type: Extension Count: 1 </p><p>Type: Privileged About Count: 1 </p><p>Type: Preallocated Count: 1 </p><p>Type: GPU Count: 1 </p><p>Add-ons </p> <hr> <p>Name: British English Dictionary (Marco Pinto) Type: dictionary Version: 3.0.7 Enabled: true ID: marcoagpinto@mail.telepac.pt </p><p>Name: Blockchair Type: extension Version: 1.0 Enabled: true ID: blockchair@search.mozilla.org </p><p>Name: DuckDuckGo Type: extension Version: 1.1 Enabled: true ID: ddg@search.mozilla.org </p><p>Name: DuckDuckGoOnion Type: extension Version: 1.0 Enabled: true ID: ddg-onion@search.mozilla.org </p><p>Name: HTTPS Everywhere Type: extension Version: 2021.7.13 Enabled: true ID: https-everywhere-eff@eff.org </p><p>Name: Startpage Type: extension Version: 1.0 Enabled: true ID: startpage@search.mozilla.org </p><p>Name: Twitter Type: extension Version: 1.0 Enabled: true ID: twitter@search.mozilla.org </p><p>Name: Wikipedia (en) Type: extension Version: 1.1 Enabled: true ID: wikipedia@search.mozilla.org </p><p>Name: Yahoo Type: extension Version: 1.0 Enabled: true ID: yahoo@search.mozilla.org </p><p>Name: YouTube Type: extension Version: 1.0 Enabled: true ID: youtube@search.mozilla.org </p><p>Name: English (GB) Language Pack Type: locale Version: 91.0buildid20210823123856 Enabled: true ID: langpack-en-GB@firefox.mozilla.org </p><p>Security Software </p> <hr> <p>Type: </p><p>Type: </p><p>Type: </p><p>Graphics </p> <hr> <p>Features Compositing: WebRender Asynchronous Pan/Zoom: wheel input enabled; scrollbar drag enabled; keyboard enabled; autoscroll enabled; smooth pinch-zoom enabled WebGL 1 Driver WSI Info: EGL_VENDOR: Google Inc.

I'm especially interested in why the developers have added the ability to create your own preferences for Firefox. It seems to be kind of similar to the Microsoft Windows registry, like how you can add your own custom values and suddenly windows behaves differently. But whenever I have configured the registry in windows, I have always had to follow tutorials, and I have always wondered how people were able to discover those registry settings. Did they have to have knowledge of the internals of the windows operating source code? Did they hack windows and discover that altering a certain registry setting, or adding a certain registry value, would cause the behavior to change? How did they come to understand such things? I recently edited the registry to change the right click menu in windows 11 back to the old windows 10 right click menu. I had to add a really long value into the registry, and it fixed it just like what I was used to in windows 10. But I have no idea how the person that wrote the tutorial knew to add that exact value. </p><p>So, I'm wondering if the settings are hidden, and that's why you have to create them on your own? Or if by creating your own preference, one is programming the browser on some level... If so, what's the extent of programming that can be done by altering about:config and creating your own preferences? I have decent programming knowledge of javascript, C/C++, and python and all, but I don't understand something as complex as a browser, and why would you allow the user to create their own preferences, but I would like to. To clarify, I see there are preferences in about:config which are visible and can easily be configured, but I do not understand why there is a feature to add a setting. Is it just for developers of the browser? Is there ever a situation where a normal user like me might need to add their own preference? Can you recommend any manuals, documents, or books that I could read about it? Do you think it's something where I would just have to start reading the source code to eventually understand it? </p><p>One last question: is it possible to disable certain javascript features using the about:config? Could I disable MutationObserver, for example? Or make it be undefined whenever a new tab is opened? Could I make it so that assigning to window.location has no effect? I'm interested to know these things and what is possible. Sorry for the long winded message, I doubt anyone will read it, but thank you if you read it, and thank you even more if you have answers. I have found the source code for firefox, but it seems to be a daunting task to just read the raw source code to get the answers I want. </p>",desktop;tips;windows-11;,firefox,tips,en-US,1495864;,qdirks
1373589,2022-04-07 23:38:34 -0700,2022-04-07 23:38:34 -0700,Privacy Suggestions? Trying to get Browser Privacy to it's limits.,"<p>➤ (1) Webbrowser </p><p>I became tired of changing all Firefox settings manually everytime after reinstalling windows, or the browser itself, or even if the browser gets updated it changes some settings. </p><p>So i did a little research and found that you can import a CFG (config file) that will instantly use all desired settings. I disabled alot of settings that by default are enabled, for example: Telemetry, data collection, pocket, google widevine, history, cookies, do not track off, dns over https, ipv6, and more. I also searched for alternative browsers to firefox because mozilla has changed alot over the years. Every update has extremly cringe disgusting popups showing wired people smiling as if their life deepended on it, also the firefox logo has become super cringe.. it just looks so ugly that i manually had to import the old icon. And ofcourse the default search engine is google, which is a red flag, but i guess mozilla also has to make money somehow. </p><p>So i found this fork of firefox called librewofl, which actually is pretty much the same as firefox just with a stronger focus on privacy. For example by default ipv6 is disabled, do not track is enabled, default searchengine is duckduckgo. I used the browser for a while but the performance is noticable worse than firefox. So what i did was to read the entire CFG of librewolf, then combine it with my own CFG and import it to firefox. I beleve now firefox now has a good privacy quality, however there might be settings which i am unaware of but which are critical key for privacy, you are welcome to share your knownledge on how to improve privacy while browsing the internet, and suggesting your privacy browser choice. </p><p>I heared that using browser extensions is a ""nightmare"" for privacy, is there a thread here that can explain why that is? And if there isn't would you mind to explain it to me or send a URL that explains it well? My guess is, because browser extensions make the browser more unique as websites can track which extensions i'm using, and also the extensions might send information to their developers which puts me at risk of sharing data about my online activites. For the moment im using 3 extensions which i beleve is not that much, those are: • uBlockOrigin (adversting blocker) • CanvasBlocker (to fake fingerprints) • Tampermonkey (to bypass youtube age restriction) </p><p><br> </p><p>➤ (2) Email </p><p>I don't have the money and knownledge to host my own mail server so i have no choice but to ""trust"" an email-provider. When i did my research on privacy email providers i found 2 results which looked somewhat promissing. Protonmail and Tutanota. Note: i was reading an article claiming tutanota was forced by the government to grant them backdoor access. Anyways, i decided to use protonmail and after around 3 years of using that service i can't complain. They have good support that responds within 96 hours, they also have their own free VPN that has enough bandwith for 1080p youtube streaming. They have always helped me with any questions. What do you people think about protonmail, can they be ""trusted"" atleast to a certain point? What other privacy email providers are there and why are you using them? </p><p><br> </p><p>➤ (3) Youtube </p><p>The censorship on Youtube has become ridiculous and it's only getting worse day by day, it's totally out of control and youtube at this point behaves like a mad dictatorship. Good content rarely get's promoted but stupid content with disgusting thumbnails gets promoted alot. For example, if you visit Linus Tech Tips youtube channel right now and look at the thumbnails if that does not make you feel cringe, well i have no words. At the same time while massive youtubers with millions of followers make big money and have way to many views, the good channels which are talking about privacy, security, human rights, are killed and censored by either the youtube algorithm or youtube staff themselfes. For example: • WION (public news sender which is almost neutral) • China Uncensored (channel that exposes the brutality, human rights abuses, and mass surveillance system in china) • The Hated One (guy that shows alot on how to increase privacy and anonymity) • Rob Braxman Tech (guy speaking alot on how to increase privacy on your mobile phone) All these channels have recently been censored and harassed by youtube staff, they are blocking and deleting their content, and for what? For saying the truth. </p><p>This brings me to my final question, you can already guess it. Is there ANY good youtube alternative? I have done my research on that question and sadly i did not find a good solution. There are many alternatives but none of them are ""good"" in my opinion. If you know an alternative please share it, i am so tired of youtube. And let's not forget after all youtube is owned by google, the devil itself. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Firefox_Beginner
