I will start with firefox is NOT in full screen. A number of updates back all tabs but the one currently being viewed has become blacked out.  All that is visible is a firefox symbol or if it's a search page, the google symbol.  Not the page title as before.  Before the update all tab details were visible at all times.  How do I revert to having my tab details being displayed so I don't have to go through all tabs to find the one I want.  I don't want to know another way of finding a particular page I have open, just how to bring back the tab information as it always was.  I'm very close to changing browsers because of this tragic improvement firefox has implemented. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-81;firefox-980;,firefox,customize,en-US,1495829;,box4scams

I find it very frustrating when I'm in the middle of doing something and Firefox pops up a message saying ""Restarting Firefox"" or the patronising ""we just have to do one thing..."", then closing Firefox and restarting. How can I stop Firefox from doing this? Why can't it just give me a notification that an update is available and that I need to restart to activate it? That would be MUCH friendlier. I have read a number of other posts that contain similar issues, but none of the solutions seem to apply to my version, 99.0. There are some options in about:config and about:preferences, but I am not clear on exactly what they do and whether or not changing them would achieve what I want to do without upsetting something else.  Is there an easy way? All advice gratefully received. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-990;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",mogplus8

I also have Trend Micro Internet Security on both. I have gone through the FF settings on both computers the make sure they are set the same. The problem is that on the laptop FF will ask for and save passwords then when I log in to a forum the password is automatically filled in for me. On the workstation that is not the case. I need to open FF Settings scroll to Privacy and security settings and reset the ""Ask to save logins and passwords for websites"" setting. Somehow on the workstation that setting gets deselected but the laptop is does not. </p><p>I found an article that instructs to remove the Trend Micro Password manager but even though it is installed on both computers it is not activated on either and I don't use it. </p><p>So why does the workstation not save passwords with the Trend PW mgr but the laptop does?  </p><p>Thanks for any clues you can give me as it is getting a bit tedious having to reset the Ask to save option every time I want to log in to a forum on the workstation. </p><p>Regards, Harold Lakoduk </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-990;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",hlakoduk
