1373590,2022-04-07 23:44:04 -0700,2022-04-08 00:58:33 -0700,Firefox's about:config preferences and understanding them better.,"<p>I'm interested in learning more about Firefox's about:config configuration settings. I'm especially interested in why the developers have added the ability to create your own preferences for Firefox. It seems to be kind of similar to the Microsoft Windows registry, like how you can add your own custom values and suddenly windows behaves differently. But whenever I have configured the registry in windows, I have always had to follow tutorials, and I have always wondered how people were able to discover those registry settings. Did they have to have knowledge of the internals of the windows operating source code? Did they hack windows and discover that altering a certain registry setting, or adding a certain registry value, would cause the behavior to change? How did they come to understand such things? I recently edited the registry to change the right click menu in windows 11 back to the old windows 10 right click menu. I had to add a really long value into the registry, and it fixed it just like what I was used to in windows 10. But I have no idea how the person that wrote the tutorial knew to add that exact value. </p><p>So, I'm wondering if the settings are hidden, and that's why you have to create them on your own? Or if by creating your own preference, one is programming the browser on some level... If so, what's the extent of programming that can be done by altering about:config and creating your own preferences? I have decent programming knowledge of javascript, C/C++, and python and all, but I don't understand something as complex as a browser, and why would you allow the user to create their own preferences, but I would like to. To clarify, I see there are preferences in about:config which are visible and can easily be configured, but I do not understand why there is a feature to add a setting. Is it just for developers of the browser? Is there ever a situation where a normal user like me might need to add their own preference? Can you recommend any manuals, documents, or books that I could read about it? Do you think it's something where I would just have to start reading the source code to eventually understand it? </p><p>One last question: is it possible to disable certain javascript features using the about:config? Could I disable MutationObserver, for example? Or make it be undefined whenever a new tab is opened? Could I make it so that assigning to window.location has no effect? I'm interested to know these things and what is possible. Sorry for the long winded message, I doubt anyone will read it, but thank you if you read it, and thank you even more if you have answers. I have found the source code for firefox, but it seems to be a daunting task to just read the raw source code to get the answers I want. </p>",desktop;tips;windows-11;,firefox,tips,en-US,1495864;,qdirks
1373589,2022-04-07 23:38:34 -0700,2022-04-07 23:38:34 -0700,Privacy Suggestions? Trying to get Browser Privacy to it's limits.,"<p>➤ (1) Webbrowser </p><p>I became tired of changing all Firefox settings manually everytime after reinstalling windows, or the browser itself, or even if the browser gets updated it changes some settings. </p><p>So i did a little research and found that you can import a CFG (config file) that will instantly use all desired settings. I disabled alot of settings that by default are enabled, for example: Telemetry, data collection, pocket, google widevine, history, cookies, do not track off, dns over https, ipv6, and more. I also searched for alternative browsers to firefox because mozilla has changed alot over the years. Every update has extremly cringe disgusting popups showing wired people smiling as if their life deepended on it, also the firefox logo has become super cringe.. it just looks so ugly that i manually had to import the old icon. And ofcourse the default search engine is google, which is a red flag, but i guess mozilla also has to make money somehow. </p><p>So i found this fork of firefox called librewofl, which actually is pretty much the same as firefox just with a stronger focus on privacy. For example by default ipv6 is disabled, do not track is enabled, default searchengine is duckduckgo. I used the browser for a while but the performance is noticable worse than firefox. So what i did was to read the entire CFG of librewolf, then combine it with my own CFG and import it to firefox. I beleve now firefox now has a good privacy quality, however there might be settings which i am unaware of but which are critical key for privacy, you are welcome to share your knownledge on how to improve privacy while browsing the internet, and suggesting your privacy browser choice. </p><p>I heared that using browser extensions is a ""nightmare"" for privacy, is there a thread here that can explain why that is? And if there isn't would you mind to explain it to me or send a URL that explains it well? My guess is, because browser extensions make the browser more unique as websites can track which extensions i'm using, and also the extensions might send information to their developers which puts me at risk of sharing data about my online activites. For the moment im using 3 extensions which i beleve is not that much, those are: • uBlockOrigin (adversting blocker) • CanvasBlocker (to fake fingerprints) • Tampermonkey (to bypass youtube age restriction) </p><p><br> </p><p>➤ (2) Email </p><p>I don't have the money and knownledge to host my own mail server so i have no choice but to ""trust"" an email-provider. When i did my research on privacy email providers i found 2 results which looked somewhat promissing. Protonmail and Tutanota. Note: i was reading an article claiming tutanota was forced by the government to grant them backdoor access. Anyways, i decided to use protonmail and after around 3 years of using that service i can't complain. They have good support that responds within 96 hours, they also have their own free VPN that has enough bandwith for 1080p youtube streaming. They have always helped me with any questions. What do you people think about protonmail, can they be ""trusted"" atleast to a certain point? What other privacy email providers are there and why are you using them? </p><p><br> </p><p>➤ (3) Youtube </p><p>The censorship on Youtube has become ridiculous and it's only getting worse day by day, it's totally out of control and youtube at this point behaves like a mad dictatorship. Good content rarely get's promoted but stupid content with disgusting thumbnails gets promoted alot. For example, if you visit Linus Tech Tips youtube channel right now and look at the thumbnails if that does not make you feel cringe, well i have no words. At the same time while massive youtubers with millions of followers make big money and have way to many views, the good channels which are talking about privacy, security, human rights, are killed and censored by either the youtube algorithm or youtube staff themselfes. For example: • WION (public news sender which is almost neutral) • China Uncensored (channel that exposes the brutality, human rights abuses, and mass surveillance system in china) • The Hated One (guy that shows alot on how to increase privacy and anonymity) • Rob Braxman Tech (guy speaking alot on how to increase privacy on your mobile phone) All these channels have recently been censored and harassed by youtube staff, they are blocking and deleting their content, and for what? For saying the truth. </p><p>This brings me to my final question, you can already guess it. Is there ANY good youtube alternative? I have done my research on that question and sadly i did not find a good solution. There are many alternatives but none of them are ""good"" in my opinion. If you know an alternative please share it, i am so tired of youtube. And let's not forget after all youtube is owned by google, the devil itself. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Firefox_Beginner

I have read a number of other posts that contain similar issues, but none of the solutions seem to apply to my version, 99.0. There are some options in about:config and about:preferences, but I am not clear on exactly what they do and whether or not changing them would achieve what I want to do without upsetting something else.  Is there an easy way? All advice gratefully received. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-990;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",mogplus8

I also have Trend Micro Internet Security on both. I have gone through the FF settings on both computers the make sure they are set the same. The problem is that on the laptop FF will ask for and save passwords then when I log in to a forum the password is automatically filled in for me. On the workstation that is not the case. I need to open FF Settings scroll to Privacy and security settings and reset the ""Ask to save logins and passwords for websites"" setting. Somehow on the workstation that setting gets deselected but the laptop is does not. </p><p>I found an article that instructs to remove the Trend Micro Password manager but even though it is installed on both computers it is not activated on either and I don't use it. </p><p>So why does the workstation not save passwords with the Trend PW mgr but the laptop does?  </p><p>Thanks for any clues you can give me as it is getting a bit tedious having to reset the Ask to save option every time I want to log in to a forum on the workstation. </p><p>Regards, Harold Lakoduk </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-990;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",hlakoduk
