In FireFox, I don't find the meeting getting launched. The launch meeting page comes up, asks me if it can use zoom app. I give Yes and then the thing happens is it opens the Zoom app. It does not launch the meeting.

The same with FF Standard et al.) </pre> <p>It's tedious to do the renaming but I prefer to know at a glance which is which in my archive folders. . . Been doing this renaming for years.
