However, WHY someone would want to set a particular application of launching magnet links, without having to search on help forums to find something hidden in about:config is because not everyone wants to install a list of 3rd party programs to a Windows installation. Nor CAN everybody install such things. So what some people do is use ""Portable Apps."" When this is done, firefox isn't going to become aware that this type of program CAN be used on the Windows install in question, because it's not actually installed.  </p><p>Why is there not an ""Add"" option for the ""Applications"" list  in the settings panel? That makes no sense. Essentially what's been done here is that Firefox says ""I'll only interface with programs that are fully installed on this machine, and to hell with your portable apps."" </p><p>I realize that there is a growing trend of adding bumpers and safety pads to everything in the world, but people really can take care of themselves.

When downloading directly FF Standard and FFesr for my 32bt and 64bt computers/laptops, I can't tell which is which in the download folder, and so I have to download them all over, this time waiting for each to download so I know which it is, and then rename it, and then downloading the other bt version.  </p><pre>    (For example: the file ""Firefox Setup 91.5.1esr.exe"" could be 32bt or 64bt file, both download with the same name. The same with FF Standard et al.) </pre> <p>It's tedious to do the renaming but I prefer to know at a glance which is which in my archive folders. . . Been doing this renaming for years. Just thought I'd finally make a request. I believe it's the same issue in the Linux and iOS 32bt and 64bt versions--they look identical in the download folder.
