I recently got a new laptop and for some reason ever since then firefox keeps signing me out whenever I restart the computer. It's a big pain because of the puerto rico issues I have to temp undo the 2 factor thing... Which as a company who likes security... I'm sure you can appreciate how much of a pain this is. I'm super sure it's a dumb fix, but how can I make it so google doesn't sign out of firefox specifically everytime I restart my laptop please??? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,other,en-US,1500167;,concerned.biologist.1

I got a new one but I cannot remember what my login info is for firefox.  I had lots of saved passwords and bookmarks that I need to get back.  I tried the two email addresses that I would have used and neither of them can access my old passwords and bookmarks.  In fact, with either login I used I get the same saved passwords and the same bookmarks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,other,en-US,1500168;1500199;,bullseyedisc
