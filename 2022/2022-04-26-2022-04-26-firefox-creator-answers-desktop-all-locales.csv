Questa modalità oltre ad essere scomoda non permette agli utenti senza permessi di amministratore di aggiornare Firefox. Ho seguito anche questa guida <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/attivare-aggiornamenti-silenziosi-firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/it/kb/attivare-aggiornamenti-silenziosi-firefox</a> ma senza risultati.

Firefox opens the txt files directly in the tab, which leads to all kind of unwanted behavior when trying to use the right click save option.  Is it possible just to save the txt files? Looking at previous forum entries, I tried changing the Content-Disposition and Content-Type via plugin, but they did not seem to affect the link given.
