Every time I open it, the ""Password required"" popup appears, which is normal. However, whether I enter my primary password or click ""Cancel"", the popup goes to the background and I cannot close it, nor click on anything in the app. In fact, I cannot even close the app except from the upper menu bar (I'm on OSX). See the attached screenshot to get an idea. Please help!!! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1503602;1503603;,dalle.c.guillaume
