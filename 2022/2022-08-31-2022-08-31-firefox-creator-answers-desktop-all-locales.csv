When I open it some stuff was missing so I shot it down and hit restart. That did not help so after trying a few things I uninstalled and reinstalled. On reinstalling I received message the code execution cannot proceed because vcruntime140_1.dll was not found. Followed instructions to go to MS and download 32bit+64bit to fix problem. I restarted and tried to reload FF again. The same problem happen again. So, I tried to reload 32+64 bit from MS, uninstalled and reinstalled. Tried to reload FF but getting same message. Probably uninstalled FF 5 or 6 times.  Wondering if I screwed up win 11 system by uninstalling so many times.

Some cases the video quality will drop to 720P when i have set it to 1080P. I have attached the screenshot what it looks like as well as the stats for nerds page showing network connectivity stats. </p><p>-I thought it was my computer until i tested this with multiple computers as well as on different network connections ( speeds up to 100mbps and even higher download speeds ) -Firefox has been completely uninstalled and reinstalled -tested in troubleshooting mode + no add-ons installed -Same on Private Mode and Normal Mode -updated to version <a href=""https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/104.0.1/releasenotes/?utm_source=firefox-browser&amp;utm_medium=firefox-desktop&amp;utm_campaign=about-dialog"" rel=""nofollow"">104.0.1</a> but i think this fix was for a different YouTube issue -I even downloaded an older version like version 80 or 90 if i remember and still had it happen -Tried using some YouTube extensions like YouTube enhancer but that seems to just allow you to force the video a specific resolution </p><p>As mentioned above to try and reproduce this issue, open any YouTube Video and just start skipping the video to random timeframes and see if it gets the white loading screen. I understand that when skipping the video it will start to buffer and this normally takes couple of seconds and starts playing. But with this white loading screen it can take up to 10 seconds to load and then starts playing </p><p>Same issue described on Reddit <a href=""https://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/vhbce5/firefox_is_lowering_youtube_video_quality_randomly/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://old.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/vhbce5/firefox_is_lowering_youtube_video_quality_randomly/</a> </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10401;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",constaz
