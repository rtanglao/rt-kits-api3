""Top Sites"" on the homepage has disappeared. I can still choose ""Add to top sites"" from the menu, but cannot see the results of those taps, old sites or newly added sites. The rest of my bookmarks are intact...assuming there is any connection between the two. Is there a low level trick to bring them back, or is this a bug? </p><p>I noticed a very similar thread from 2020, but with no resolution: </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1301109"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1301109</a> </p>",desktop;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1503409;1503411;,tao101

It is not in my recycle bin so renaming it to old hasn't simply deleted it. In another folder there are bookmark backups with dates (JSONLZ4 files) but I have no idea how to get my old links back from them, if indeed that is what they are for. </p><p>Please help. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1000;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1503398;1503400;1503401;1503402;,martinsphotoart

Other browsers on my computer works, only firefox is having this error. I am not sure what may have caused this. I access the internet through WiFi, I don't use VPN and didn't change the DNS settings. I have also updated to the latest version of firefox, but this error still persists.  In the screenshot, I was trying to access <a href=""http://youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com</a>, but this error persists on any other websites that I try to access including <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a>.  Please let me know how to fix this error. Thank you ! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1503406;,davinshah
