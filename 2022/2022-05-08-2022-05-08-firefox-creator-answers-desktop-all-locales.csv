Now I wanted to use this for work also. Previously all my bookmarks and logins were synced via a single email account. It was easy to use across all devices. Now since I want to use this for my work also, I decided to segregate my work stuff to a new windows account. So I created a new windows account. Obviously Firefox created a new profile and it was clean. No problems there.  </p><p>So I wanted to use my original email for this new windows account and new firefox profile to sync across devices. So I created a new email, added it to my firefox account, made it the primary email then deleted my original email from that firefox account so that I can use it to sync firefox in my work user account.  </p><p>But, Firefox is not allowing me to. There is no ""signup"" option for sync. Only ""sign in"". It continually asked me to sign in from my primary account, so I had to sign in from my primary account to make this post. Doesnt firefox offer 2 different ""sync profiles"" for the same device? Or Am I doing something wrong? Please help. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1000;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",axmurdereryahoo
