What is happening here?,"<p>Hello, </p><p>I am learning to look at websites with help of the development tools and the inspector tab and I am trying to get into how the web works and how the different programming languages interact and so forth. When moving the mouse over parts of the website, the relating code is highlighted in the inspector tab. I am having an issue as follows: </p><p>The first image shows a part of the website code. The mouse cursor is on no specific position, I marked its position with a blue arrow.  </p><p>In the second image the mouse is over the red ""free options"" button and in the inspector tab a div appears out of nowhere. It does not appear in the code unless the mouse is moved over the button and disappears as soon as the mouse leaves the button. I have never seen that before (maybe because I am a beginner) and have no clue what happens there. </p><p>Is that done with javascript? Or with php? Or with css? Or anything else? What happens there and how can the actual code change? </p><p>In the inventor tab, does the code have to do with the DOM rather then the sourcecode of the website is that right? </p><p>Please give me some light =) </p><p>regards p3ppi </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1000;,firefox,other,en-US,1503456;1503458;,tabletto2013

Now I wanted to use this for work also. Previously all my bookmarks and logins were synced via a single email account. It was easy to use across all devices. Now since I want to use this for my work also, I decided to segregate my work stuff to a new windows account. So I created a new windows account. Obviously Firefox created a new profile and it was clean. No problems there.  </p><p>So I wanted to use my original email for this new windows account and new firefox profile to sync across devices. So I created a new email, added it to my firefox account, made it the primary email then deleted my original email from that firefox account so that I can use it to sync firefox in my work user account.  </p><p>But, Firefox is not allowing me to. There is no ""signup"" option for sync. Only ""sign in"". It continually asked me to sign in from my primary account, so I had to sign in from my primary account to make this post. Doesnt firefox offer 2 different ""sync profiles"" for the same device? Or Am I doing something wrong?
