It always leaves out the City, State and Zip code, and although they do not show up in Saved Addresses they do appear in the Edit dialog boxes and if I edit the City and save, it will then pop up in Saved Addresses but even after that it still will not fill in that field. Another strange thing is that when I go back to Settings it will have disappeared from SA leaving only the Name and Address lines as it was before the editing.  Besides that and the jumping down 3 pages while scrolling down on long pages like Reddit, Firefox is perfect. It also seems that I may be the only one experiencing this judging by my many fruitless Startpage searches. Also neither of these issues are new to version 100 running on W10e64.

Now since I want to use this for my work also, I decided to segregate my work stuff to a new windows account. So I created a new windows account. Obviously Firefox created a new profile and it was clean. No problems there.  </p><p>So I wanted to use my original email for this new windows account and new firefox profile to sync across devices. So I created a new email, added it to my firefox account, made it the primary email then deleted my original email from that firefox account so that I can use it to sync firefox in my work user account.  </p><p>But, Firefox is not allowing me to. There is no ""signup"" option for sync. Only ""sign in"". It continually asked me to sign in from my primary account, so I had to sign in from my primary account to make this post. Doesnt firefox offer 2 different ""sync profiles"" for the same device? Or Am I doing something wrong? Please help. </p>",desktop;sync;escalate;admin;verificationemail;windows-11;firefox-1000;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",axmurdereryahoo
