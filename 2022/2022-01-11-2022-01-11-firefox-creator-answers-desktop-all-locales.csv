Spesso succese anche quando naviga correttamente: all improvviso smette di collegarsi come se mancasse la linea internet. Se riuscite a darmi una soluzione vi sarei grato: utilizzando Firefox da molti anni l'ho configurato in modo ottimale per la mie necessità e mi dispiacerebbe dover cambiare browser. Grazie mille! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,other,it,"",pa.ste

I installed Firefox Portable and then logged/synced into my Firefox account on this Win computer. I noticed that in the Firefox Portable Windows “about:preferences” page, it says “Your browser is being managed by your organization”, which links to about:policies. In that “about:policies” page, it shows this <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/JmD8nXg.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/JmD8nXg.png</a> Policy Name: DisableAppUpdate Policy Value: true. Now I’m back on my Linux desktop computer and it also has this “managed by your organization” message in “about:preferences” and the same “about:policies” stuff.   In other words, it appears that this policy was copied from the Windows  public computer to my personal Linux computer. I don’t want that. </p><p>How can I undo this?
