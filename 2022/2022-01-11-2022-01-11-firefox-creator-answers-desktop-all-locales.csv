It does this with no rhyme or reason and usually for around a minute at a time. It just hangs until it abruptly starts working again. Occasionally (like if I try to log out while this is happening), it will give me an error saying I'm ""offline"", even though I am most definitely not offline. During this time, all other websites (Google, Wikipedia, Hulu, etc) work fine, so I know it's not my Internet. Other than that, it doesn't give me any errors. </p><p>I am using a MSI laptop on Windows 10. Oddly enough, YouTube loads properly in incognito mode and in Windows Edge, but clearing my cache and cookies, disabling my extensions, and updating Firefox to the latest version didn't solve the problem. I even enabled each of my extensions separately in incognito mode while YouTube wasn't loading in a normal window, and each time YouTube loaded properly in the private window while simultaneously not loading in the normal one, so I know none of my extensions are causing the problem. Restarting my computer also didn't do anything. This problem persists when logged in or out of YouTube, no matter the account. </p><p>I reported this issue to YouTube back on December 29, but it hasn't been fixed. I also made a post on the YouTube Community a few days ago, but I didn't get any helpful answers.
