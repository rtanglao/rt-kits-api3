Normaly when you click the url bar you can type ""@wikipedia"" or ""@google"" to change the search engine to wiki, while typing anything else will prompt a google search. BUT when you use the shortcut ""ctrl + e"" or ""ctrl + k"" a box appears in front of the url bar with ""Google"", just like it would whe you typed ""@google"". This actually blocks ""@wikipedia"" from being registered making the whole feature almost useless and forcing me to invent workarounds to things that should be VERY simple in a browser. Any ideas how to fix this? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-950;firefox-9502;,firefox,customize,en-US,1472751;,m4.glinski
