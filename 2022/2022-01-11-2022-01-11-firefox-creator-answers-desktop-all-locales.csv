I don't want that.","<p>I normally use Firefox desktop on my Linux computer. </p><p>Last week, I started using it on a public computer running Windows. I installed Firefox Portable and then logged/synced into my Firefox account on this Win computer. I noticed that in the Firefox Portable Windows “about:preferences” page, it says “Your browser is being managed by your organization”, which links to about:policies. In that “about:policies” page, it shows this <a href=""https://i.imgur.com/JmD8nXg.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://i.imgur.com/JmD8nXg.png</a> Policy Name: DisableAppUpdate Policy Value: true. Now I’m back on my Linux desktop computer and it also has this “managed by your organization” message in “about:preferences” and the same “about:policies” stuff.   In other words, it appears that this policy was copied from the Windows  public computer to my personal Linux computer. I don’t want that. </p><p>How can I undo this? And how can I block this sort of policy syncing? </p>",linux;desktop;sync;firefox-950;firefox-9501;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",msupp.9a

It take a lot of time to open, move from one page to an other. Disabled Add-ons one by but no avail. Firefox Consuming too much memory. I have tried acceleration,refresh, add-ons disable, only safe mode works.  Therefore using mostly safe mode but that is not a solution.  Due to this problem I started using MS Microsoft Edge (which I do not want).  </p><p>Any guidance/help/suggestion/will be appreciated. </p><p>Thank you in advance. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-950;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Ari94

I've read some article that say if these 2 difference version using 2 seperate different profile, but it seems they're not. For  example, when I change the theme to light for firefox and dark for firefox devedition, they always syncing each other so it use the theme the last set regardless where is set. </p><p>My question, is firefox and firefox devedition really using 2 seperate different profile? Can I use different setup like themes, addons for only one version? Where I can read the official documentation? </p>",linux;desktop;beta;sync;firefox-960;,firefox,sync,en-US,1472792;,reteehee

Normaly when you click the url bar you can type ""@wikipedia"" or ""@google"" to change the search engine to wiki, while typing anything else will prompt a google search. BUT when you use the shortcut ""ctrl + e"" or ""ctrl + k"" a box appears in front of the url bar with ""Google"", just like it would whe you typed ""@google"". This actually blocks ""@wikipedia"" from being registered making the whole feature almost useless and forcing me to invent workarounds to things that should be VERY simple in a browser. Any ideas how to fix this? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-950;firefox-9502;,firefox,customize,en-US,1472751;,m4.glinski
