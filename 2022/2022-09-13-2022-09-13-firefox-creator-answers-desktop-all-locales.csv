I'm currently using Firefox Browser version 104.0.2 (64 bit) and Windows 11 Home (64 bit). When in the browser, all actions are delayed. This includes typing, scrolling, hovering/highlighting, selecting, etc.  The delay appears to be a cyclical process. For example, as I'm typing a sentence one or two letters appear, then it pauses for a second or two, then more letters appear, then a pause again, etc.  The same type of cycle happens with scrolling and other functions. I have tried two other browsers on the same system without any similar delay. I have seen posts of similar problems dating back many years, and while some fixes were recommended, either the underlying problems were corrected in subsequent versions or the fix action is to a setting that is no longer part of the Firefox system. Please help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1040;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",wbus11

I enabled Metamask but it won't open so that I can sign in to it. When I went to add-ons, Metamask was set to run in Private windows. I changed that before I enabled it.

The first image shows up, but not the other ones (not the second image) - see screenshot.  Also: The browser doesn't load the correct site: It's supposed to show the light grey sweatshirt that it is clicked on - that's the url that is in the address bar. (with my mouse I'm on the black shirt (mouseover)). - See screenshots. Only when I reload the page it will show the correct site (still with images missing). On a private window on Firefox (where no addons are run) I still have the same problems </p><p>Assumption and things I tried: I can imagine it has to do with some settings in about:config.
