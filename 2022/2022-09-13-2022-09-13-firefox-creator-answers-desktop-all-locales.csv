Why is ""default"" not the default?","<p>Today I stumbled on an issue that seems to have affected a number of users who care about profiles. The issue is <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/1507251/firefox-has-two-default-profiles-default-release-and-default-which-one-sho"" rel=""nofollow"">articulated well here</a>. It appears that a clean installation of Firefox results in the creation of two profiles, one called ""default-release"" and another ""default"" where ""default-release"" is the default. Ugh. </p><p>Can any user safely delete the ""default"" profile and rename the ""default-release"" profile to ""default"" to restore a simple, uncomplicated configuration? Why wouldn't Firefox do this by default? </p><p>I understand from <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/gl/questions/1264072"" rel=""nofollow"">question 1264072</a> that Firefox did this intentionally to support multiple installs and release channels, but why shouldn't the ""default"" profile be used by default? Surely a user who is not performing multiple installs or dealing with multiple release channels shouldn't have their profile names polluted by unaffected concerns. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jaraco

Attualmente funziona, ma non ho la possibiltà di modificare il numero di colonne. Quando la cartella ha decine di sottocartelle, è necessario scorrere giù per la pagina. E' possibile personalizzare la visualizzazione in 2 o 3 colonne ?  Allego screenshot per capire meglio la situazione. </p><p>Grazie mille </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,tips,it,"",stefanomara85

I'm currently using Firefox Browser version 104.0.2 (64 bit) and Windows 11 Home (64 bit). When in the browser, all actions are delayed. This includes typing, scrolling, hovering/highlighting, selecting, etc.  The delay appears to be a cyclical process. For example, as I'm typing a sentence one or two letters appear, then it pauses for a second or two, then more letters appear, then a pause again, etc.  The same type of cycle happens with scrolling and other functions. I have tried two other browsers on the same system without any similar delay. I have seen posts of similar problems dating back many years, and while some fixes were recommended, either the underlying problems were corrected in subsequent versions or the fix action is to a setting that is no longer part of the Firefox system. Please help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1040;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",wbus11
