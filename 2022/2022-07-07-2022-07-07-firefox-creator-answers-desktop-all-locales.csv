Since the update to 102.0 my Win10 PC has problems with the page update. When the scroll slider gets near the bottom the page, new images begin to load. This reload results in 3-15+ newly loaded Fb posts scrolling past so fast as to be invisible.  I have to keep my cursor on the scroll slider and, when the loading begins, start scrolling up if I want to have any chance to easily find the last post I was reading. I have seen this behavior, grossly exaggerated, when I was viewing a video. The reload caused the viewing to pause and upwards of 15 newly loaded posts scrolled past in this rapid manner. My work requires that I am able to view pages of Facebook posts and this is now massively time-consuming and intolerable. I may have to change browsers in spite of my reluctance to do so. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Helium2

Apparently I had gotten a danish IP address there, since <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> thereafter was in danish. </p><p>Now, I sit in a different Espresso House, also in Denmark; however, here, captive portal does not work; in the sense that: </p><p>As shown on first screenshot, first I get ""You must log in to this network before you can access the Internet."", and I get a ""Open network login page"" button. </p><p>I click on the ""Open network login page"" button, I can see browser wants to load <a href=""http://detectportal.firefox.com/canonical.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://detectportal.firefox.com/canonical.html</a> - but in the end, I do not get the Espresso House login page, but instead I get a redirect to <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/captive-portal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/captive-portal</a> , where the ""You must log in to this network before you can access the Internet."" still stands, but there is no more ""Open network login page"" button (as shown on the second screenshot) </p><p>If I restart the browser in this shop, I think I get the exactly same process - Espresso House wi-fi login page never gets shown, only the <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/captive-portal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/captive-portal</a> ... </p><p>Strangely, at this point, I do get access to the internet through a browser - but <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> is then in swedish, which I guess means, that there is some sort of a VPN of that shop's wi-fi to Sweden. On the other hand, I don't get internet elsewhere on my computer - for instance, if I want to do `sudo apt update` from the command line, I get errors like ""Clearsigned file isn't valid, got 'NOSPLIT' (does the network require authentication?)"" - which is what I otherwise get in (the first mentioned) Espresso House, before I've connected to wi-fi via captive portal (once I connect to wi-fi via captive portal there, `sudo apt update` or any other network access from command line is fine). </p><p>(Note: my android phone in the same shop, does indeed show Espresso House Wi-Fi login prompt upon Wi-Fi connection, and I can login there fine). </p><p>Why does this happen, and how can I force Firefox to show me the actual captive portal so I can login to Wi-Fi - instead of redirecting me to <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/captive-portal"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/captive-portal</a> ? </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-1020;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",nanomir

Cliccando sul collegamento di un pdf, Firefox mi ha sempre chiesto se scaricare (di default nella cartella Download) od aprire immediatamente - e senza download nella relativa cartella - il documento pdf stesso. Poi sceglievo se aprirlo in Firefox o, come effettivamente preferisco, con il software di mio gradimento: PDF-XChange Viewer. Non saprei se sia il termine corretto, un po tipo una apertura ""flash"": ovvero vedo il pdf, lo leggo, chiudo, resterà per un po (immagino) nella Temp e quando sarà, si cancellerà automaticamente. Mentre invece ora me lo scarica tutte le volte. Niente di che, apro periodicamente la cartella Download, e cancello manualmente: ma mi pare una perdita di tempo. Evidentemente chissà cosa devo aver ""pasticciato"" affinché ora sia così, ma mi piaceva di più come era prima. </p><p>Posso fare qualcosa per ripristinare quella precedente funzione? </p><p>Grazie mille. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1020;,firefox,download-and-install,it,"",20811maderno

Internet Explorer works well - new proxy configuration usually become effective in 1 or 2 minutes after the change.  However, each time after my script changes the registry proxy address (without FF restart), I have to go to Firefox Tools-&gt;Settings-&gt;Proxy to manually change it to another value (in my case it's from ""Use system proxy settings"" to any other value), confirm it, and then change it back. Then FF is able to reload the autoconfiguration script to make it work. This is really a headache.  </p><p>I just wonder is there a way to notify FF to reload the proxy autoconfiguration script address from registry from command line so that my script can trigger it automatically after the registry is modified?  </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,tips,en-US,1517744;,wjdingdev
