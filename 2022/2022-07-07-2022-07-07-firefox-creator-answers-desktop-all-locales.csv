Internet Explorer works well - new proxy configuration usually become effective in 1 or 2 minutes after the change.  However, each time after my script changes the registry proxy address (without FF restart), I have to go to Firefox Tools-&gt;Settings-&gt;Proxy to manually change it to another value (in my case it's from ""Use system proxy settings"" to any other value), confirm it, and then change it back. Then FF is able to reload the autoconfiguration script to make it work. This is really a headache.  </p><p>I just wonder is there a way to notify FF to reload the proxy autoconfiguration script address from registry from command line so that my script can trigger it automatically after the registry is modified?  </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-1010;firefox-10101;,firefox,tips,en-US,1517744;,wjdingdev
