Some time back I got a java  script that fixed it.  I had to do an F12 and paste it in somewhere and then I got a little rectangle at top left which said something like 'volume'. Click on that and up went the volume. Click again,  up more and so on.  It was good. Sometimes on things like perhaps Bitchute it wouldn't work.  It would actually switch all the volume off. I'd refresh the page to fix that. Anyway:  it suddenly disappeared today.  The little rectangle is gone. I can't up my volume on Youtube any more. I got something from the web, a javascript, and pasted it into 'console' after F12 but i got error messages. I'm clueless. Don't know where to look for my original, see if it still there.  Don't know how to troubleshoot. Don't know any other way to get the volume up. See error message on the console whenever I go there, don't know what to do about them.
