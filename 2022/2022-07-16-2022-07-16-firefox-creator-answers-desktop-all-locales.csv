1383078,2022-07-15 19:42:27 -0700,2022-07-15 19:42:27 -0700,Problems with Instagram,"<p>Up until some time last week, Instagram was working fine for me on the PC.  I could pull up pages and scroll through the pictures and videos just fine....and I still can.  However, I used to be able to click on a picture and the picture would sort of pop forward and I could see all the comments and there were direction arrows on either side so I could move to the next or last image.  That is no longer the case.  If I want to see the image a bit bigger, or read or add comments, I have to right click on the image and open in a new tab.  The new tab will show the image and comments but there are no arrows to move to next or last image.  Not sure what has happened.  If it is something to do with Firefox or if it is a problem on Instagram's end.  I can still use instagram and view images etc, but a lot of the ease of using it has disappeared. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1020;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",Ashkevron
