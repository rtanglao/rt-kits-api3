No matter what I search for, or how I word it I get ""results"" from 3 - 5 websites (2 of which are usually amazon &amp; youtube - even though I'm not shopping or looking for a video).  None of the non-results are remotely relevant, but they are the only results I get...   Duplicated...  Until I hit the ""no more results"" brick wall. And speaking of youtube...   When I am looking for a video (audiobooks usually) my ""results"" consist of 3 or 4 channels (always the same 3 or 4).  I get several videos from each of the channels &amp; duplicates of those same videos then I slam up against the ""no more results"" brick wall. </p><p>I've cleared caches &amp; cookies &amp; stored data.  I've deleted search history, cleared search history, paused search history, etc...  Those things produce no changes whatsoever.  I searched (at a friend's house on her computer) for information.  The results might or might not have been relevant.  It involves inserting great huge heaps of java-script into my machine.  In spite of being computer illiterate, I'm not stupid.  So, no I didn't copy or paste any script or download anything. </p><p>Everything I know about computers I had to figure out for myself.  The most important discovery I made is that the way computers function is perfectly logical - frequently unreasonable, but always logical.  That's why although I am computer-illiterate, I'm not computer-dysfunctional. I've been able to make laptops, tablets &amp; android phones do things the experts &amp; professionals said were impossible.  But if people try to explain stuff to me by speaking computer code, all I hear is whah, whah, whah (like in the way grownups talk in the Charlie Brown cartoons). </p><p>I sincerely appreciate any information or suggestions anyone can offer.  Just give it to me in plain english.  I'm an intelligent adult who grew up in a socially-insignificant school district. </p><p>Thanks in advance to all! </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-870;,firefox,other,en-US,1520043;,kris_the_ghost

It opens and loads and you can open an email but you can't do anything with it. You can't look at attachments, delete, move, star, or anything. I've reloaded yahoo, created a new password and signed back in, closed Firefox and opened back up, restarted my laptop and opened back up, cleared cache - NOTHING WORKS.  It works just fine on Chrome and my phone. I noticed that yahoo mail url is the only one that has a cross site cookie symbol. But when I take it out, it still doesn't work.

I could pull up pages and scroll through the pictures and videos just fine....and I still can.  However, I used to be able to click on a picture and the picture would sort of pop forward and I could see all the comments and there were direction arrows on either side so I could move to the next or last image.  That is no longer the case.  If I want to see the image a bit bigger, or read or add comments, I have to right click on the image and open in a new tab.  The new tab will show the image and comments but there are no arrows to move to next or last image.  Not sure what has happened.  If it is something to do with Firefox or if it is a problem on Instagram's end.  I can still use instagram and view images etc, but a lot of the ease of using it has disappeared. </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1020;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,"",Ashkevron
