Some time back I got a java  script that fixed it.  I had to do an F12 and paste it in somewhere and then I got a little rectangle at top left which said something like 'volume'. Click on that and up went the volume. Click again,  up more and so on.  It was good. Sometimes on things like perhaps Bitchute it wouldn't work.  It would actually switch all the volume off. I'd refresh the page to fix that. Anyway:  it suddenly disappeared today.  The little rectangle is gone. I can't up my volume on Youtube any more. I got something from the web, a javascript, and pasted it into 'console' after F12 but i got error messages. I'm clueless. Don't know where to look for my original, see if it still there.  Don't know how to troubleshoot. Don't know any other way to get the volume up. See error message on the console whenever I go there, don't know what to do about them. FYI I'll post the first few lines of them: Unknown property ‘-moz-osx-font-smoothing’.  Declaration dropped. screen.4472f725724c6a0a.css:1:3751 Unknown property ‘zoom’.

No matter what I search for, or how I word it I get ""results"" from 3 - 5 websites (2 of which are usually amazon &amp; youtube - even though I'm not shopping or looking for a video).  None of the non-results are remotely relevant, but they are the only results I get...   Duplicated...  Until I hit the ""no more results"" brick wall. And speaking of youtube...   When I am looking for a video (audiobooks usually) my ""results"" consist of 3 or 4 channels (always the same 3 or 4).  I get several videos from each of the channels &amp; duplicates of those same videos then I slam up against the ""no more results"" brick wall. </p><p>I've cleared caches &amp; cookies &amp; stored data.  I've deleted search history, cleared search history, paused search history, etc...  Those things produce no changes whatsoever.  I searched (at a friend's house on her computer) for information.  The results might or might not have been relevant.  It involves inserting great huge heaps of java-script into my machine.  In spite of being computer illiterate, I'm not stupid.  So, no I didn't copy or paste any script or download anything. </p><p>Everything I know about computers I had to figure out for myself.  The most important discovery I made is that the way computers function is perfectly logical - frequently unreasonable, but always logical.  That's why although I am computer-illiterate, I'm not computer-dysfunctional. I've been able to make laptops, tablets &amp; android phones do things the experts &amp; professionals said were impossible.  But if people try to explain stuff to me by speaking computer code, all I hear is whah, whah, whah (like in the way grownups talk in the Charlie Brown cartoons). </p><p>I sincerely appreciate any information or suggestions anyone can offer.
