I keep asking this question but the responses are not helpful.","<p>EVERY time Firefox does an update just about everything changes for me, including my homepage, my icons for add ons are gone, now my link to my email is gone,   I always wonder if I'm on the correct version or not. It says I am but what happened to all of my settings. I cannot tell you the number of times I've had to find my THEME and since there is no rhyme or reason as to how the themes are categorized it takes me forever to find the one I want.  It doesn't seem to matter what settings I have entered because they are changed along with everything else. I have asked this question before and the answers I have received do not work. And another question. I do not like the background in ""black"" with the titles highlighted in yellow when I am searching. Very difficult for me to read, I've attempted to change that many times but can't seem to figure that out either.  Oh, Lord where is Microsoft 7 when I need it? An OS that even I could figure out. </p><p>Perhaps finding the glitch in the changes that always take place after an update should be your next update. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-990;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",Rhonda_89
