I suppose those pages are not correctly coded, but as said, FF first shows the scrollbar, then only it vanishes, so I think FF could do something about it? No need to say that for the same pages, other browsers do NOT have that problem. If I want to scroll down the page, I thus have to press the PgDn key several times within the very first second after the page builds (new or by F5), and then, I can see that fixed part of the page further down to which the multiple presses of PgDn key will have got me, but only that part, since even after pressing PgDn, the vertical scroll bar vanishes, and further PgDn presses have no further effect. Since it's just 1 second or even less (perhaps 700, 800 milliseconds, or perhaps even just 500 milliseconds, I don't know precisely) that after loading or renew-loading (F5), the vertical scroll bar is displayed (and PgDn key works), for most pages of such type, I can never reach any parts further down. Is this problem known, does anybody address this problem? ONE example, among dozens: <a href=""https://www.bauhaus.info/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bauhaus.info/</a> i.e. www dot bauhaus dot info, the home page and any given page of the site. Instead of fiddling around with all sorts of ""enhancements"", most of them totally unwanted by 3/4 of the user base, wouldn't it preferable to make sure the CORE functionality of this browser would be maintained to work as expected? I have been using FF for more about 15 years know (automatic updates), but I just see decline. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-990;,firefox,other,en-US,"",frqariszxtizknjvnc
