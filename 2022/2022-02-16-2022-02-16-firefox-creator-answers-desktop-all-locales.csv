I've enjoyed Firefox for a long time, and I've gotten a lot of use recently of the Picture In Picture window to watch YouTube while I play Black Desert Online. One issue is, though, that while I'm in the game, because it uses mouse to aim, and left click for some attacks, it will pick up the window and move it, which is very inconvenient, as you may imagine! Is there any way that there could be an option or hotkey to disable interactivity with the Picture In Picture windows? No worries if not, I hope you have a fantastic day! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,customize,en-US,1484006;,RichardSoft
