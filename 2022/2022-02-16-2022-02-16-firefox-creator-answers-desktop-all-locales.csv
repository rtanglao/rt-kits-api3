Erasing the interim version enabled a pristine download to be substituted. Then re-installing both the new Firefox and the previously associated DuckDuckGo add-on overcame the previous bug.  It is not known whether the upgrade to OS 10.15.7 itself caused the password entry bug directly with Firefox operation or whether the problem was a combination with the  Mac version of DuckDuckGo processing.  </p><p>It should be noted that 17 other 64 bit third party apps were broken by this MacOS upgrade and had to be reinstalled using previously saved or newly downloaded .dmg files.  Most of these other broken apps would not even boot at all. Accident or Planned ?  </p><p>Either way, thanks for allowing me to vent my fury at Apple on your platform.  -D.

Simply put I opened the application and all I saw was a blank screen, I still had the basic format/layout but nothing was coming up including error messages. The weird thing is is that I am experiencing the same issue on both my computer and laptop, both run windows 10 and are up to date on software.  I verified that the antivirus/firewall isn't interfering with the application, other web browsers are functioning properly, I have uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox, cookies have been cleared, Firefox has been refreshed, computer restarted, new Firefox profile created, and verified by Webroot and Windows Defender that no malware is present.  </p><p>I tried troubleshooting more today and I was able to at least get a webpage to load, but if I tried visiting another webpage in that same tab, Firefox would hang up. What allowed me to get a webpage to load (at least the first one) was by disabling the webroot extension. I've attempted to run Firefox with all extensions disabled but I am still having the same issue.  </p><p>Other features that wont work are tools under the more tools tab, I was able to get the browser console open and took a screenshot of that, hopefully that may shed some light on the issue, any help would be great appreciated, thanks! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1484020;,michaljunik99

Today I downloaded the latest ""security"" update for Apple for OS 10.15 but since I do not have any ""devices"" that run IOS, etc. , I declined the accompianying  device update. My copy of Firefox for the Mac was regenerated and the same server error was observed. Yet when I used the ""new"" Safari I could get through to my Hughesnet account information. I hate Safari and have not used it for years, but this is obviously Apple's way of trying to force all Apple users to use it in preference to other browsers. I am hoping you can track this problem down. I would have contacted Hughes support, but since Safari got through, I am sure Hughes support could not help. What is strange is that other than being unable to sign on the account, Firefox behaves normally getting into other sites. You may also be interested to know why I upgraded to 10.14 in the first place when 10.14 was working just fine (again without an iPad or an iPhone (I have neither) associated with the iMac. I was considering switching  from Turbotax to HR-Block, but found out that H-R Block's program demanded using Safari ! So after using turbotax for nearly 15 years I went back and found 2021 required an upgrade to OS 10.15. Thus I got caught in a dominoe effect trying to avoid Safari  and then Safari comes back to haunt me. How is that for irony ? Anyway best wishes and thanks for whatever you can do if anything. -D.
