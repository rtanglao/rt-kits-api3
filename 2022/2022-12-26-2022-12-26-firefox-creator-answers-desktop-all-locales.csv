Is it possible for Firefox to have an in-built collections feature, similar to the one in edge? I really like the Firefox browser but i've used other browsers as well such as Chrome and Edge and their in-built collection and also the group tabs function is very convenient when we want to refer to tabs from previous sessions grouped into their respective categories... I've tried some extensions available in Firefox to replicate the same function but they don't work as well </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ydyeo13
