I don't always remember to save them when updates come through. This browser updates more than any other one I use. I'm an elder who has to juggle tons of internet details. I can't tell what folder they came from, but there are at least 150 bookmarks skewing the view of my folders. </p><p>I tried to delete all of them, and if I reopen it, all the ones I deleted are back in the way. Why won't they go away? What is getting confused here? One thing is that I'm afraid Firefox won't reopen all the tabs &amp; windows I have open, so I kill it using my Task Manager, instead of just closing Firefox windows. Why? Because it has lost one of my windows before, with multiple tabs open and I couldn't find any of them.  </p><p>Yes, I'm the one who maintains 3 separate Firefox windows with multiple tabs open. Please do <strong>not</strong> tell me not to do that, when I've been doing this for years &amp; years. This thing's limitations shouldn't become mine. Everybody uses products differently; doesn't mean you get to judge when I'm not using it the way you do. </p><p>I hate that this happens, because I'm not expecting Firefox to make a mess and don't know where they're pulling all these bookmarks from. Nothing is missing from my folders. It's like they're duplicated and show up when I click 'Bookmarks'. They keep reappearing under the 'Bookmarks Menu' with Manage Bookmarks, but obviously not coming from there or they wouldn't reappear when I delete them. </p><p>Any ideas what's going on?  </p><p>Again, don't tell me how to use my computer. I've been doing this since PC's were invented. If you know what's happening, great. If not, mind your manners &amp; don't let your ego take pot-shots.
