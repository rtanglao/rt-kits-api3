See attachment image.  It has a decay timer so it doesn't stay up long.  Goes away if I touch anywhere else.  The problem spreads via firefox-sync, so my other PC's home and work.  See it too. </p><p>I don't think it's from FF, but maybe an addon. I just disabled Download Manager (S3).  It's the only sketchy addon from Russia (no clear terms of privacy).  It's also one of the few addon's I have still doing updates. This is something not happening in the pass just started like 1 month ago. Maybe I got the handle on the problem. </p><p>Has anybody seen this before ? Doing a google search is fruitless for ""aliexpress"" term.  It just shows up too much. </p><p>Since the problem is so random at startup, it will take many days to determine if the problem goes away. Unless I can force it to happen.  Can't think of a way. </p><p>Thank-you for any guidance. </p><p>Here is a list of my current active addon's: AdBlocker for YouTube™ Feedbro Greasemonkey TWP - Translate Web Pages uBlock Origin </p><p>I really depend on these addon's hope it not one of these. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,other,en-US,"",inkythecat

1400564,2022-12-26 02:06:26 -0800,2022-12-26 02:06:26 -0800,Desktop Bookmark MESS!,"<p>Twice in a year, maybe in 2, Firefox updates have completely hosed my bookmarks. I don't always remember to save them when updates come through. This browser updates more than any other one I use. I'm an elder who has to juggle tons of internet details. I can't tell what folder they came from, but there are at least 150 bookmarks skewing the view of my folders. </p><p>I tried to delete all of them, and if I reopen it, all the ones I deleted are back in the way. Why won't they go away? What is getting confused here? One thing is that I'm afraid Firefox won't reopen all the tabs &amp; windows I have open, so I kill it using my Task Manager, instead of just closing Firefox windows. Why? Because it has lost one of my windows before, with multiple tabs open and I couldn't find any of them.  </p><p>Yes, I'm the one who maintains 3 separate Firefox windows with multiple tabs open. Please do <strong>not</strong> tell me not to do that, when I've been doing this for years &amp; years. This thing's limitations shouldn't become mine. Everybody uses products differently; doesn't mean you get to judge when I'm not using it the way you do. </p><p>I hate that this happens, because I'm not expecting Firefox to make a mess and don't know where they're pulling all these bookmarks from. Nothing is missing from my folders. It's like they're duplicated and show up when I click 'Bookmarks'. They keep reappearing under the 'Bookmarks Menu' with Manage Bookmarks, but obviously not coming from there or they wouldn't reappear when I delete them. </p><p>Any ideas what's going on?  </p><p>Again, don't tell me how to use my computer. I've been doing this since PC's were invented. If you know what's happening, great. If not, mind your manners &amp; don't let your ego take pot-shots.

Is it possible for Firefox to have an in-built collections feature, similar to the one in edge? I really like the Firefox browser but i've used other browsers as well such as Chrome and Edge and their in-built collection and also the group tabs function is very convenient when we want to refer to tabs from previous sessions grouped into their respective categories... I've tried some extensions available in Firefox to replicate the same function but they don't work as well </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1080;firefox-10801;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ydyeo13

I am having to redo my pc OS etc and I am needing to swap over my app data to the temporary backup pc. I know how to do that but it won't even let me start firefox as it is an older version. I install a newer version and that is one of the new version disasters I hate. I have no time to figure out how to make it look to where it is usable. I got the old pc running and found the version it had. I install that, which is an esr but it still gives me the same problem. I need my firefox working so I can use it with my original tabs and bookmarks. Or you can be like some and tell me to just go elsewhere as a fix for the mess which is todays firefox. I used to have about zero of these kind of problems. How do I get myself to my original setup on the temp pc? </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,1555739;,helpful55
