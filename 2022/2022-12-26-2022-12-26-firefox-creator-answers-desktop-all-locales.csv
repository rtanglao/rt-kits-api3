I am having to redo my pc OS etc and I am needing to swap over my app data to the temporary backup pc. I know how to do that but it won't even let me start firefox as it is an older version. I install a newer version and that is one of the new version disasters I hate. I have no time to figure out how to make it look to where it is usable. I got the old pc running and found the version it had. I install that, which is an esr but it still gives me the same problem. I need my firefox working so I can use it with my original tabs and bookmarks. Or you can be like some and tell me to just go elsewhere as a fix for the mess which is todays firefox. I used to have about zero of these kind of problems. How do I get myself to my original setup on the temp pc? </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",helpful55
