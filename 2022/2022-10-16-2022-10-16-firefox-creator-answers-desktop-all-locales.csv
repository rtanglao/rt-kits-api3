I never asked myself why, until I reinstall my OS from zero and install a new clear FF. </p><p>There is an addon: ""New Tab from Location Bar"" It is iniatily build for opening in new tab when you write in url bar. And in addon page on mozzila it say it's no more usefull since we can do it with about:config (browser.urlbar.openintab)... that's why I don't reinstall it. Then I lost the history in new tab, can't understand why, and don't find help on web (looking for many hours). </p><p>So I try my olds, not reinstalled, addons and find it come from this one. I don't  know how it work (don't ask me how), but it's work. Ok on 105.0.3 (actual version of FF) and since many years. </p><p>Hope this will help alll those who was looking for a tips. </p> <dl><dd>-) </dd></dl> <p>PS: I tried to reply to olds asks on supports mozilla, but all archived... can't post in so. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1050;firefox-10503;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",poissonrougelechat
