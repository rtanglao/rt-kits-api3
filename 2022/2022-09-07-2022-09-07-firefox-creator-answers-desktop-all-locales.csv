I'm happy with my PC security settings and have good protection software running - but this pop-up listing Trackers is becoming a nuisance. </p><p>Is there a way to stop Firefox displaying the Tracker notification pop-ups whilst still intercepting and blocking them in accordance with my security settings? </p><p>I see that other users have asked the same question, but it does not seem to have been answered yet. </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>Peter </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",PeterKinloch

Cliccando poi sulle ulteriori informazioni compare un'altro pop-up da cui pare che il sito non supporti la connessione crittata (per maggiori dettagli vedi le immagini allegate). Con Microsoft Edge invece non ho il minimo problema e posso accedere al sito normalmente con connessione crittata (vedi ultima immagine). Ho già provveduto a modificare i parametri di IPv6 e prefetch del dns secondo quanto consigliato dalla pagina di aiuto ""I siti web vengono caricati con altri programmi ma non con Firefox"" così come ho provato l'avvio in modalità provvisoria ma in entrambi i casi senza risultato.  Il problema è particolarmente seccante perché su android anche l'app (che probabilmente si appoggia al browser predefinito ovvero Firefox) segnala erroneamente che non sono connesso ad internet. Resto in attesa di una soluzione, grazie. </p><p>PS: per cortesia evitate di fare riferimento alle pagine di aiuto perché le ho già consultate senza risultato </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,website-breakages,it,1532196;1532197;1532198;1532200;,antonio.chiari
