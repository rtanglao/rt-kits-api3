Some I am asked &amp; put on desktop to move later while some are automatically sent to Downloads folder. In Help, it says to go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Applications to get this to happen but under PDF I have it set to ""Always ask"". And Firefox is not doing this. Will this be fixed in future versions? There seem to be a lot of people that have this problem, which is basically creating work. I understand it only takes seconds to get them but over the course of time it's not efficient. I've been using Firefox for years &amp; do not always agree with some of the changes but this one is really frustrating because it is not consistent. I only want to be able to have the where to/save as box show up when I attempt to download a PDF. Any other or real suggestions would be appreciated.

Currently this feature doesn't work with Firefox, the menu item is grey, but fine with MS Edge. But I can still paste picture from clipboard by pressing Ctrl+V. I cannot tell which side is the source of problem so I asked this question on both Firefox and MS Community. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1040;,firefox,other,en-US,1532179;,543685015

When attempting to log into my Edward Jones financial account, every item on the web page responds to me except secure login. It worked properly yesterday 9/5/2022. I restarted my computer, cleared cache, etc and I am running a VPN.  When I could not login I contacted Edward Jones and they said that issue happens once in a while.  I am able to get the site to work with a VPN and Chrome without issue.  Why am I having problems on my Firefox browser?  Any help would be appreciated. </p><p>Brett Fairchild </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",brettbrendablake
