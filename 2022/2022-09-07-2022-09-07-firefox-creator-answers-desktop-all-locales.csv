It worked with Firefox before. I can copy a picture from a webpage to clipboard and change existing picture with it from clipboard. Currently this feature doesn't work with Firefox, the menu item is grey, but fine with MS Edge. But I can still paste picture from clipboard by pressing Ctrl+V. I cannot tell which side is the source of problem so I asked this question on both Firefox and MS Community. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1040;,firefox,other,en-US,"",543685015

When attempting to log into my Edward Jones financial account, every item on the web page responds to me except secure login. It worked properly yesterday 9/5/2022. I restarted my computer, cleared cache, etc and I am running a VPN.  When I could not login I contacted Edward Jones and they said that issue happens once in a while.  I am able to get the site to work with a VPN and Chrome without issue.  Why am I having problems on my Firefox browser?  Any help would be appreciated. </p><p>Brett Fairchild </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",brettbrendablake
