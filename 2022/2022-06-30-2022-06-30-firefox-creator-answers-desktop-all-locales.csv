This is happening with websites that provide transportation information and ticketing, including <a href=""http://www.amtrak.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Amtrak</a> and <a href=""http://www.peterpanbus.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Peter Pan Bus Lines</a> . It is also happening with a genealogical website, <a href=""http://www.familytreedna.com"" rel=""nofollow"">FamilyTreeDNA</a>, on pages that should be displaying family tree information. Illustrations of two pages are attached. I have been able to access the information by using Opera on this same computer and operating system, and by using the same version of Firefox installed on a different computer with different operating system. I am not sufficiently proficient with website development to know or understand what type of dynamic content is being generated by these websites, or how Firefox interprets the content. My suspicion is that some Firefox setting has been enabled or disabled, but I do not know which one it would be. </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",lhughes0

Was NOT experiencing this issue (or any other issues) till today.   That is, I've been able to download PDFs attached to Yahoo email for years, including recently (till today). </p><p>Trying to get Firefox to be DEFAULT instead of MS Edge, I changed some 'Apps associated with File Types', selecting Firefox as default for all file types that seemed appropriate, BUT, this issue then began.  </p><p>Feeling I went too far, and should go step at a time,  I reset All File Type settings back to default (MS recommended settings).   Still can't open attached PDFs.

I used MS Edge with Yahoo email and PDF attachment downloaded fine. Also, btw, CAN view a PDF attachment with Yahoo email.  Just now download.    </p><p>I CAN ""open it in a new window"" as the error suggests, than print to PDF, but don't want to live the rest of my life doing that. </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help that can be offered!! </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1020;,firefox,other,en-US,1515684;1515690;1515691;1515692;1515697;,mschrock72
