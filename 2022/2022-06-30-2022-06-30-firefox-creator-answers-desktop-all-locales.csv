Some of these strings are unique and session-specific, and the server will never allow them to be used again. Other query string variables are used for session-specific navigation, like a page number or a record ID, and we may never have interest in trying to get back to that exact same spot within an application, but we might want to save some higher-level entry point. As a simple example, look at your history and see how many entries there are for '<a href=""http://www.google.com/url'"" rel=""nofollow"">www.google.com/url'</a>. </p><p>To reduce the size of my history, I'd like to filter what gets logged. Actually I don't mind ""History"" for history's sake as a record of places we've actually been. The problem is that the same database is used for autotype and other purposes. The current implementation is not ideal for going back and visiting ""applications"" versus ""specific web addresses"". Maybe it's better to state that History should track URI's but when we are navigating back through History to go back to a specific page we're more interested in a less-specific URL. Using Google as an example again, it's OK for History to record the fact that I've visited a hundred Google search pages, or page 2,3,4 for a specific search, but ultimately I might only want to save the part of the query string that is relevant to a specific search. The next time I go back to some page there might not be a page 4, so if I'm going through history again for the purpose of revisiting pages, I just want to see page 1 of the results. </p><p>Can anyone recommend a plugin that allows regex filtering of history, or recording of page visits into a different database in addition to Firefox History? From there of course it would be convenient to filter that data by time and otherwise, just like History. </p><p>From a developer perspective, History gets written to a specific database/file - can someone tell us exactly which file and format that is? I might be able to write a post-processor that filters out underable records. </p><p>Is there a better approach to managing history? Is History just an automatic Bookmark, meaning I should be looking for a bookmark manager for this? Or maybe we should do a mass copy of History into a dedicated Bookmark folder, manipulate records there, and use that for back-navigation? </p><p>Time to create an Enhancement request? </p><p>Should I write a plugin? :) </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1010;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Starbuck

So instead of saving let's say, <em>73sz92dz.ica</em>, it's just saving <em>73sz92dz</em> - if macOS tries to open this file, it defaults to ""Text Editor.app"", and all normal Citrix workflows are broken. So to explain, why broken: these files are generated automatically from Citrix, after login in the browser; then downloaded and normally opened by ""Citrix Workspace.app"", if it's installed &gt;&gt; then the remote Desktop opens, and you can work in Windows. </p><p>I didn't notice this behavious (saving files without file extensions) for .dmg files, .xlsx, .zip etc., apparently all regular known file-types are saved as expected. Even for files with the .ica file extension, it doesn't always happen; maybe for 30-50% of the Macs. All the same, I'm pretty positive it's <em>not</em> a Citrix problem: if I downgrade Firefox on the clients affected to Firefox v. 101.0.1 for Mac, everything works like a charm again. By the way, we have a couple of hundred of Macs here, and I do distribute some Firefox-settings with our MDM (Jamf) - but it's not related: it happens on unmanaged macs (private, or machines not managed by MDM, etc.) as well, and everything I tried reg. settings to create ""automated"" workarounds up to now, is more / less unsuccesful (only manual workarounds, like downgrading Ffox or adding the file extension by hand...). </p><p>I suspect, it may have to do with the Mime type definitions / handler config files in Firefox: I also noticed there's some older Firefox-bugs reg. this topic. It's not entirely clear for me yet, how these handlers, MIMRE type definitions etc. work in Ffox; I'll post an update, if I make progress, which might be useful for fixing this. By the way, I might just as well post this via Bugzilla, I guess (I'm new to the Firefox community)? </p><p>Many thanks for hints! </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-1020;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",klaxmbappleid
