(Macbook user)  I am using the web version of Youtube TV through Firefox.  Youtube TV starts, allows me to select channels but then i get the never ending spinning wheel.  I have disabled ad blockers, cleared the cache.  Restarted Firefox, Restarted Macbook Pro.  Restarted router and modem.  Youtube TV is playing fine using Safari which uses the same ad blocking software.   </p><p>My question:  What have I overlooked?  Youtube TV was working fine prior to the Firefox 102.0 update. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1020;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",roslansky

Was NOT experiencing this issue (or any other issues) till today.   That is, I've been able to download PDFs attached to Yahoo email for years, including recently (till today). </p><p>Trying to get Firefox to be DEFAULT instead of MS Edge, I changed some 'Apps associated with File Types', selecting Firefox as default for all file types that seemed appropriate, BUT, this issue then began.  </p><p>Feeling I went too far, and should go step at a time,  I reset All File Type settings back to default (MS recommended settings).   Still can't open attached PDFs.  I tried an Excel attachment and it opened fine.   </p><p>Error I get is:  ""Firefox Can’t Open This Page  To protect your security, <a href=""http://dl-mail.ymail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">dl-mail.ymail.com</a> will not allow Firefox to display the page if another site has embedded it. To see this page, you need to open it in a new window."" </p><p>The emails I used to recreate the error, were sending an email to myself, and attaching a PDF. </p><p>Other things I tried: I used Firefox with gmail email and the PDF attachment downloaded fine. I used MS Edge with Yahoo email and PDF attachment downloaded fine. Also, btw, CAN view a PDF attachment with Yahoo email.  Just now download.    </p><p>I CAN ""open it in a new window"" as the error suggests, than print to PDF, but don't want to live the rest of my life doing that. </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help that can be offered!! </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1020;,firefox,other,en-US,1515684;1515690;1515691;1515692;1515697;,mschrock72
