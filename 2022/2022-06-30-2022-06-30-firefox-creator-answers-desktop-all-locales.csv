(Here's the  main article: <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com</a>.) Here's the situation. Say I go to a website's Contact page and click the button to contact someone, a window appears and asks me what app I want to use to open the email. Gmail is my default email, and Firefox is my default browser, and I use Windows 10. When I open the window of options (see attached screenshot) to open the email, and I then click ""Choose Other Application"" (other than Firefox), I don't see the Gmail app anywhere. I then followed the directions in that link above to check my Windows settings, per its suggestion, which I did ... but in those settings, too, I got to a point where the directions no longer matched what I'm seeing on my screen. I didn't see the Gmail app anywhere. Could you let me know in simple layperson's terms how to open Gmail links in Firefox? I don't have a PhD in computer science, so please keep it very simple. Thanks in advance! Best wishes, Bill </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1020;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",BillSiever

But i have been using same sites earlier too without any issue. Also those sites are just articles on site without any personal information. From last 2 days i am also getting redirecting issues. First site to redirect to during google search is bestbonusprize.life then if i disable adblocker it just keep redirecting. I don't have any issue accessing same site in google chrome. I just have firefox installed till 4 days earlier, but when i start getting issues i installed chrome to test if i am getting same issue but all work good in chrome. One of the main change from earlier is i was in different location using different wifi provider. It could be one of the issue  but i am not sure as other people using same wifi don't have much issues. Plus things work fine in chrome. I tried using anti-malware but malwarebyte is only available for window and i don't know any thing about anti-virus and malware removal for ubuntu as never needed it.

So instead of saving let's say, <em>73sz92dz.ica</em>, it's just saving <em>73sz92dz</em> - if macOS tries to open this file, it defaults to ""Text Editor.app"", and all normal Citrix workflows are broken. So to explain, why broken: these files are generated automatically from Citrix, after login in the browser; then downloaded and normally opened by ""Citrix Workspace.app"", if it's installed &gt;&gt; then the remote Desktop opens, and you can work in Windows. </p><p>I didn't notice this behavious (saving files without file extensions) for .dmg files, .xlsx, .zip etc., apparently all regular known file-types are saved as expected. Even for files with the .ica file extension, it doesn't always happen; maybe for 30-50% of the Macs. All the same, I'm pretty positive it's <em>not</em> a Citrix problem: if I downgrade Firefox on the clients affected to Firefox v. 101.0.1 for Mac, everything works like a charm again. By the way, we have a couple of hundred of Macs here, and I do distribute some Firefox-settings with our MDM (Jamf) - but it's not related: it happens on unmanaged macs (private, or machines not managed by MDM, etc.) as well, and everything I tried reg. settings to create ""automated"" workarounds up to now, is more / less unsuccesful (only manual workarounds, like downgrading Ffox or adding the file extension by hand...). </p><p>I suspect, it may have to do with the Mime type definitions / handler config files in Firefox: I also noticed there's some older Firefox-bugs reg. this topic. It's not entirely clear for me yet, how these handlers, MIMRE type definitions etc. work in Ffox; I'll post an update, if I make progress, which might be useful for fixing this. By the way, I might just as well post this via Bugzilla, I guess (I'm new to the Firefox community)? </p><p>Many thanks for hints! </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-1020;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",klaxmbappleid

Was NOT experiencing this issue (or any other issues) till today.   That is, I've been able to download PDFs attached to Yahoo email for years, including recently (till today). </p><p>Trying to get Firefox to be DEFAULT instead of MS Edge, I changed some 'Apps associated with File Types', selecting Firefox as default for all file types that seemed appropriate, BUT, this issue then began.  </p><p>Feeling I went too far, and should go step at a time,  I reset All File Type settings back to default (MS recommended settings).   Still can't open attached PDFs.  I tried an Excel attachment and it opened fine.   </p><p>Error I get is:  ""Firefox Can’t Open This Page  To protect your security, <a href=""http://dl-mail.ymail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">dl-mail.ymail.com</a> will not allow Firefox to display the page if another site has embedded it. To see this page, you need to open it in a new window."" </p><p>The emails I used to recreate the error, were sending an email to myself, and attaching a PDF. </p><p>Other things I tried: I used Firefox with gmail email and the PDF attachment downloaded fine. I used MS Edge with Yahoo email and PDF attachment downloaded fine. Also, btw, CAN view a PDF attachment with Yahoo email.  Just now download.    </p><p>I CAN ""open it in a new window"" as the error suggests, than print to PDF, but don't want to live the rest of my life doing that. </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help that can be offered!! </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1020;,firefox,other,en-US,1515684;1515690;1515691;1515692;1515697;,mschrock72
