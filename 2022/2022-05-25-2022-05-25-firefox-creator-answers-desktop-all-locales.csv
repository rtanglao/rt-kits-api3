I often use this because my vision is not as good as it used to be, and I can listen while I perform other tasks (e.g., cook).

I tried everything I can think of and tried the print scaling, adjusting the print factor as suggested to another user. I don't have this issue with chrome or edge. Please help ! I like FIREFOX !!","<p>I tried printing in FIREFOX while using PDF and receipts from Amazon and  HP. each time the fonts are HUGE, but not if I use Chrome or Edge. Tried your suggestions and that didn't help. I see another user has had the same exact issue with no avail. I'd really like to get this issued fixed. I like FIREFOX and want to use it whenever possible, but being unable to print makes it a problem. I would appreciate a real solution.
