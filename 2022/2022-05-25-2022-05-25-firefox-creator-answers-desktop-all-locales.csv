Have refreshed Firefox and also tried a clean install - problem still exists. Have done a scan using HouseCall - no gremlins found. For the last few weeks my browser has been playing up. After a few minutes pages would basically stop loading, clicking on a new link would open a new window but nothing would load. Disabled my Ad Blocker extensions (I had two) and issue resolved itself. Re-enabled Ad blocker (AdGuard AdBlocker) and problem returned. Disabled it, problem went, tried Ghostery (not used before), issue returned.  Both extensions are recommended. Similar issue exists on my work computer - one ad blocker and after a few site visits pages no longer load, and links no longer react to a click, home button no longer works. I close and open and I get told firefox is already running and do I want to close it before opening again. Pretty sure it's not just my home computer. Any help would be welcomed. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1507689;,glynrpalmer

Non sono riuscito a rimuoverle il blocco, nonostante abbia reinstallato Firefox sia come amministratore locale che come utente, nonostante abbia impostato una password principale e, ovviamente, la sincronizzazione e l'accesso all'account. In questo modo, di fatto, sono costretto ad usare altri browser, per i quali, finora, non esiste un blocco analogo. Come posso fare per evitare il blocco e continuare ad usare Firefox?
