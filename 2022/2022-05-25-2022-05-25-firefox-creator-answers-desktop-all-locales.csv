A solution is to clear my history and restart the browser. It only happens on my windows 10 laptop. I think happens when I have logged off or the device has slept and then firefox has restarted and opened previously open tabs. Other devices on the same network don't get effected. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",oldmanofgammgamma
