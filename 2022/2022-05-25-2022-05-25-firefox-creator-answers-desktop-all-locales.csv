When the browser is first started, all google domains work fine.  After a few minutes though, a dialog at the top of G-mail (multiple accounts) appears stating it wants to re-connect, and will try and reconnect indefinitely with no success until the browser is closed and reopened.  Also, calendar will stop working, and attempting to connect to any other google service (search, keep, drive, etc.) results in no DNS resolve, with sometimes the search bar URL changing to ""about:blank.""  I have tried resetting the browser and re-installation (both at a user and administrative permission level) with no avail.  Is this a known problem, or is it suspected there is another culprit here?  It is worth noting that this is my company laptop, and that my coworker has also recently began running into this issue. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",cjcullen4

I then discovered that FF had unchecked the “Startup Open previous windows and tabs” box, which I had previously religiously monitored to be sure it was checked.  So I lost all my previous tabs. </p><p>In my sessionstore-backups folder I found the file upgrade.jsonlz4-20 as last in a list of three more recent file names.

If so, how?  Or is there a better way to use the Scrounger – or another – tool? </p><p>Otherwise if I delete the three more recent file names in the list above the upgrade.jsonlz4-20 file, and restart FF will I recover the missing tabs?

It will only store one session, the last session, and any stored sessions that are still stored when the client crashes again becomes corrupt. I used to rely on sessions to save large amounts of tabs. However, my client just crashed due to a power outage, I was quickly skimming through my tabs in order to reduce cpu usage and weed some out... when the client suddenly crashed again before I could restore them. I lost them all.  </p><p>All of a sudden I find myself without an incentive to keep using firefox. Why have you made your client worse? Everything I had was gone, and due to an accident. There is nothing loaded on my computer. And yet it crashed for no reason and everything is gone. If I had an older version of firefox, this would not have happened.  </p><p>Can you please tell me what happened to your restore session feature and why its total garbage now? Please fix it. I really hate losing weeks worth of research. And no, looking in my history wont help. I have reviewed thousands if not tens of thousands of websites over the several weeks it took to accumulate that research. Finding it all again in my history is impossible. That's why I rely on tab storing services.  </p><p>How about you make a restore session library tab that stores all your stored sessions securely.

The website does not seem to allow anyone to go here. </p><p><br> I am on a holy quest to purge this unwanted autocomplete suggestion, but nothing seems to work. It is not appearing because of a bookmark or search history- I can delete places.sqlite to start fresh but the problem resurrects as soon as I first successfully visit the desired URL: <a href=""https://solutions.sciquest.com/apps/Router/Login?OrgName=MIT"" rel=""nofollow"">https://solutions.sciquest.com/apps/Router/Login?OrgName=MIT</a>. </p><p>When I use SQLite to look at places.sqlite, I don't find the shortened URL anywhere in ""moz_places"" but I do find it in ""moz_origins"". It appears there with a much greater ""frecency"" than the lengthier URL for some reason. ID #10 has ""<a href=""http://solutions.sciquest.com/apps/Router/Login?OrgName=MIT"" rel=""nofollow"">solutions.sciquest.com/apps/Router/Login?OrgName=MIT</a>"" with frecency 2100, and ID #11 has ""<a href=""http://solutions.sciquest.com"" rel=""nofollow"">solutions.sciquest.com</a>"" with frecency 16100. </p><p>If I try to delete #11, I'm not able to for reasons likely related to my lack of understanding/proficiency with SQL databases. The DB Browser I am using says ""Error deleting record, foreign key constraint failed"". But my suspicion would be that even if I did delete it, it would be re-generated whenever I login successfully. What I am able to do is edit the ""frecency"" field. When I change it to zero, and write the database, the option goes away.  I fear that frecency will simply be reset next time I close and reopen however. </p><p>Thanks in advance!
