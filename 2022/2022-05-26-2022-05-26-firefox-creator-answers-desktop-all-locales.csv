The problem is - if my experience is a guide to the rest of the world - VTT files (which are used to caption HTML video) are no longer read/loaded by Firefox when it is viewing the HTML file locally (i.e. file://).  On the web they are loaded as expected. Presumably there's a security setting somewhere in Firefox that now refuses to load the VTTs locally. Maybe under Help &gt; More troubleshooting information there is a setting to change to fix that? </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",roberto32
