I could be blocking Google content too much within my Firefox browser? </p><p>My wife is a long-term Chrome fan and says, ""I don't know why you bother with Firefox, Chrome is much better"", but I rebuke and say, ""No! It's been great over the years, I've been using it since 2003"". </p><p>Do I need to change my settings somewhere? At times certain pages don't load - it'll say 'Click Verify; or something similar and the 'Verify' button doesn't appear - I load the same page in Chrome, and boom, it's all there. </p><p>Am I doing something wrong with Firefox? I have version 100.0.2 (64-bit). Or is it time to give in to the mighty Google and go to Chrome after loyally using Firefox/Mozilla since 2003? (A daft thing to ask on a Firefox forum, I know!). </p><p>Many thanks if you can help or advise. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;mac-os-x-1014;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",electronic78

Egyszerűen hiába állítom világos módra és hiába telepítem újra és hiába állítom be alapértelmezettre, egyszerűen a háttér még mindig sötét. A ""kiegészítők és témák"" és a ""beállításoknál"" is világos van beállítva, tehát nem tudom hol lehetne még átállítani, hogy végre tudjam használni a Firefox-ot weboldalak készítésére. Szóval minden lehetőséget végig zongoráztam, de semmi (a fiók törlés és új létrehozása nálam nem opció). Erre szeretnék valamilyen megoldást kérni. </p><p>A segítséget előre is köszönöm. </p><p>Tisztelettel: Pál Dániel </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,customize,hu,1507921;,pal.daniel.79
