Example, shortcuts to notepad, word, calc etc... on a toolbar (like the firefox [CTRL]+[SHIFT]+[B]-toolbar) </p><p>There  are launchers and such to launch applications, but I just want a dedicated toolbar for this where I can place shortcuts to firefox tools/utilities on there. </p><p>10+ years ago there was an addon for firefox that was a simple toolbar which could handle url's, local applications...anything as long as it could be created as a shortcut on the desktop. But I can't find it anymore it probably got dis-continued. </p><p>Any suggestion is very welcome. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-11;firefox-1000;firefox-10002;,firefox,customize,en-US,1507908;,ron_r
