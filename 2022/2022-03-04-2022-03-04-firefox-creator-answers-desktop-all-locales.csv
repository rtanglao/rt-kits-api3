Used MiniTool Pro 12.6 to attempt recover to new Installed new mSATA, new copy of Win7Pro, no joy. Put mSata into USB enclosure, copied all 423GB to 5 TB drive, to use as source for profile.  READ many versions of support pages here, copied whole ""old"" profile from \Roaming\profile  to new drive \profiles folder. No Joy. Created NEW profile, shutdown FF, copied 'old"" folder to new, restarted, no joy. Deleted NEW profile, tried copying just the logins.json, key4.db overwriting default profile files, no joy.  Tried copying profile from original 500GB mSATA in case the copying to 5TB was corrupt ( used Total Commander copy with verify) I think I have tried almost all the various solutions, still no joy.  Anybody have any solutions to try ( both very recent FF versions ( last two weeks) ?

Just all of a sudden it just repeats the sign-in page over and over.  I can not use my norton account.  I type in <a href=""http://My.norton.com"" rel=""nofollow"">My.norton.com</a> and firefox will take me to the sign in web page. I click on sign-in and my saved info appears.  Its the right info.  But,  when I click on  sign-in all I get is the same sign in page. OVER AND OVER AND OVER.  I have spent over 2 hours with norton support twice.  They have done a great job.  Tried many different things.  Scanning and reinstalling and running SFC, DISM, clearing cache, changing settings and other things.  So I am here asking you if know why firefox will not let me in to my norton360 account. </p><p>please help.

Just installed Ubuntu 20.04.4 on my laptop and now find that I'm not able to watch some YouTube videos on Firefox 97. It seems mainly just live streams that I can't watch. When I go to one it shows ""Your browser can't play this video...Learn more"" in the video window. Clicking Learn More takes me to a page that doesn't explain what the problem is. Any idea what the fix might be? The same videos play just fine on other devices on my network. Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-970;,firefox,other,en-US,1487141;,kdpryor
