Just installed Ubuntu 20.04.4 on my laptop and now find that I'm not able to watch some YouTube videos on Firefox 97. It seems mainly just live streams that I can't watch. When I go to one it shows ""Your browser can't play this video...Learn more"" in the video window. Clicking Learn More takes me to a page that doesn't explain what the problem is. Any idea what the fix might be? The same videos play just fine on other devices on my network. Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-970;,firefox,other,en-US,1487141;,kdpryor

Then, 1 hour ago, Firefox did not start, all I was able to do was to exit (option inside a small Firefox Problem Window). </p><p>I downloaded the installation files, and re-installed Firefox. It started with the two Firefox Start Pages. But I expected to see all my tabs and browsing history and plugins. </p><p>So I copied the files from my previous profile into the folder of the newly created profile after I deleted the new profile files. But now, when starting Firefox, I get again a small window with the option to create again a new empty profile or just to exit. It says I would use an ""older"" version of Firefox and this could destroy my profile. </p><p>What must I do to get back all my tabs and plugins and all that? </p>",windows-7;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-970;firefox-9701;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1487122;1487138;,SvenLittkowski
