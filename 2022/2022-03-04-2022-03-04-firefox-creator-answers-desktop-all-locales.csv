Firefox no longer runs on my Windows 7; in fact it does not even open.  That is as of your last update when the crashing began, almost two months ago though it seems longer.  As for this Mac Catalina, the only system I have where I can access these pages, Firefox looks like garbage.  Pages do not download entirely.  Check-off boxes, click buttons and drop down menus often do not work.  For all the updating on Catalina this Firefox underwent, these problems never get fixed. </p><p>I do not understand the relationship Mozilla has with SeaMonkey; but I can no longer log into my Account there on MozillaZine; and there is no alternative way to contact them.  My Profile does not show when I login.  It will not allow me to establish a new Account with other email addresses I use.  It constantly crashes on Windows 7.  The SeaMonkey browser will not open these pages on attempts to login.  Since these problems with Firefox are persistent, I was going to post about them on MozillaZine, which I cannot do any longer.  There is no means of reporting login problems there.  Additionally, some Apple commentators on their forums believe that SeaMonkey is a storage hog.  I have kept it here because it works reasonably well despite the Account problems. </p><p>SeaMonkey has the reputation of not getting rigorous support.  Between that and Firefox I do not know which is worse.  As I stated before in a previous thread, the check off box below does not show a check when I click on it.  I hope it is clear that I am posting this through Firefox on my Mac.  The Submit button is faint. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-970;,firefox,other,en-US,"",tightpurchaser

I've noticed that files downloaded through the Firefox browser very often come out corrupted. Just to keep in mind, I'm always on the latest version. </p><p>Nowadays, I download the same file multiple times and compare their checksums to see if any two or three are identical matches to be more certain that it turned out as it should. This is an extremely tedious and troublesome task and a waste of bandwidth and time, especially when some files like video footage shot from a high-end camera for film production can be extremely large (25-100 GB per file) and it needs to be shared and downloaded multiple times by a number of group members that are working on the film project to compare checksums to see if they match. In our case, we provide the checksums for the files before uploading to the cloud, so our members can check against it after they've downloaded the file to ensure none of frames in the footage are corrupted. </p><p>However, in most cases, the problem arises when Firefox users download something online that often doesn't have checksum they can check against. Even if they downloaded the same file two times with their checksums matching, it doesn't 100% guarantee that they aren't corrupted, since the same piece in each of the two files could be corrupted at the same spot, although very unlikely but still a possibility. Everyone in our group has very stable internet connections via ethernet cable, and not WiFi. </p><p>Could this issue be looked into to figure out what the problem is? </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-970;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Prezal
