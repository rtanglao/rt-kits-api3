Just all of a sudden it just repeats the sign-in page over and over.  I can not use my norton account.  I type in <a href=""http://My.norton.com"" rel=""nofollow"">My.norton.com</a> and firefox will take me to the sign in web page. I click on sign-in and my saved info appears.  Its the right info.  But,  when I click on  sign-in all I get is the same sign in page. OVER AND OVER AND OVER.  I have spent over 2 hours with norton support twice.  They have done a great job.  Tried many different things.  Scanning and reinstalling and running SFC, DISM, clearing cache, changing settings and other things.  So I am here asking you if know why firefox will not let me in to my norton360 account. </p><p>please help. It was working and nothing has changed so it must be something with firefox. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-970;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",jpet7305

Just installed Ubuntu 20.04.4 on my laptop and now find that I'm not able to watch some YouTube videos on Firefox 97. It seems mainly just live streams that I can't watch. When I go to one it shows ""Your browser can't play this video...Learn more"" in the video window. Clicking Learn More takes me to a page that doesn't explain what the problem is. Any idea what the fix might be? The same videos play just fine on other devices on my network. Any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-970;,firefox,other,en-US,1487141;,kdpryor

Then, 1 hour ago, Firefox did not start, all I was able to do was to exit (option inside a small Firefox Problem Window). </p><p>I downloaded the installation files, and re-installed Firefox. It started with the two Firefox Start Pages. But I expected to see all my tabs and browsing history and plugins. </p><p>So I copied the files from my previous profile into the folder of the newly created profile after I deleted the new profile files. But now, when starting Firefox, I get again a small window with the option to create again a new empty profile or just to exit. It says I would use an ""older"" version of Firefox and this could destroy my profile. </p><p>What must I do to get back all my tabs and plugins and all that? </p>",windows-7;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-970;firefox-9701;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1487122;1487138;,SvenLittkowski
