It would state that Firefox had crashed and needed to be restarted or closed. It would transmit error information first in either case. Firefox has sent updates a few times since, and if I had the browser closed it would update upon being opened. The original problem is still there and now I have an additional problem. The first problem was a nuisance but the second is not acceptable. My email service is fastmail which I have used for many years. Sometimes I will open an email and need to click to go to another location. My problem is that I will click to do so and I get left with a blank screen and I never arrive where i am trying to go. It never reports any kind of an error. If I use Microsoft Edge everything executes as it should. That tells me there is no problem with the emails. the email provider, and takes the problem back to Firefox. When you sent an update you may have reset my settings. It seems like it sees opening the new page I am going to is likened to blocking a popup window. I am going to guess it is treating every page I attempt to open via the page I am on like a popup window. This problem is somewhat inconsistent. Sometimes it executes just fine. I get 80 to 100 emails each day and this feature not working properly is very aggravating. Example: I open a Kohls ad email or a Sam's Club ad email and click on the object I am interested in. However, all I get is a blank page and no errors reported. It may or may not execute properly if I go directly to the retailer and not through the email service. Yet it works fine if I use Microsoft Edge for the same procedure in the same email or even if I go to the retailer's webpage directly rather than through an email. Same results, Edge works fine, Firefox doesn't work. Help me out here please. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1080;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1553921;,Hotwheels65
