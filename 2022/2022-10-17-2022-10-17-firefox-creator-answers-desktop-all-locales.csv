I downloaded the source but have run into the fact that this version of Firefox demands I use the obsolete 2.13 version of autoconf. I don't understand why and I'm not someone who regularly uses project binary builds with anything, much less autoconf (it didn't exist to my knowledge when I first used Unix in the mid '80s). The Firefox source code is too big for me and too complicated to be spending the rest of my few years left trying to update this volunteer project. Can someone tell me why autoconf was required and how to get around it? It appears, the build can be done with the more modern python2 in lieu of autoconf but even with that old software installed, the build insists upon going back and using the ""old"" autoconf method as best I can figure out. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1050;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jpezzmobile

Went finished I was able to open Firefox and found the shortcut that was the guily party.  It was Titled - clownfish-app-nx84d with a URL https://clownfish-app-nx84d with what appeared a million ofter letters to long to get.  I went to the browser settings to play with the shortcut functions but to no avail.  Surely there is some way to only allow for personally programed  shortcuts and no auto placement by the browser.
