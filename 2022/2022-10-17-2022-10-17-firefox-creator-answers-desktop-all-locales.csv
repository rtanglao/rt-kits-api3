Haven't used the computer for couple of days. When I started firefox yesterday all tabs were gone and firefox only shows one tab with a weird page trying to sell me sth.

Starting the computer today the situation is worse: again all tabs gone and as soon it starts firefox only shows me one homepage and two seconds later it crashes... Tried updating my windows security, searched for viruses, installed cccleaner, installed latest version of firefox again - nothing helped. </p><p>What else can I try? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1541463;1541472;1541475;1541488;,Orpheums

I really didn't understand his question at the time and wasn't sure what he was referring to.  Fast forward to last week and my friend's Mac was stolen. The question he asked in passing now became crystal clear - I had logged onto my Firefox account from his Mac and didn't log out.  I have been searching for a way to ""Log out of all devices"" but have not found a solution.  I've read that I can go to that computer I would like to un-sync and log out OR change my Firefox password then change ALL of my other saved passwords.  Certainly there must be a simple way to force any device using my account to input the new password next Firefox is accessed. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1050;firefox-10503;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1541445;1541448;1541450;,drcperez
