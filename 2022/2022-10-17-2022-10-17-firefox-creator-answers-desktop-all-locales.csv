If I have multiple Firefox windows and I close a tab in a window, I have to have that window selected to restore the tab, I can't restore it from another window. If I close an entire window by accident with multiple tabs I can't restore them with the shortcut. Chrome lets you restore an entire group of tabs and restore from other windows, not only in the current window. Is there any way to modify the behavior so it acts like chrome? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-1050;firefox-10503;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",Dddsasul

And I'm facing similar issues with Reddit. </p><p>I've tried running the troubleshooting steps listed [<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-and-diagnose-firefox-problems#w_6-create-a-new-firefox-profile|here"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/troubleshoot-and-diagnose-firefox-pr...</a>] , but to no avail. And for what it's worth, everything works fine in Chrome. I've had Windows 11 updates as well as a Firefox update within the last 2 weeks. I don't remember when exactly things started to go wrong, but it's possible that there's something with the updates that's causing it to act up. I'm using Firefox version 105.0.3 (64 bit). </p><p>Any help is appreciated! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1050;firefox-10503;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ravi.kumarj04
