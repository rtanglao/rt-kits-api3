The screen comes on for about 0.5 of a second and then goes dark for a second and this repeats. The only way to stop it is to restart the computer. When I disable Widevine I can navigate the Netflix site but I can't play anything. As soon as in enable Widevine with the Netflix website open the off and on flashing starts. Even closing the browser does not stop it. I'm a windows 11 PC. </p><p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! I have chatted to Netflix twice. They suggested I speak to my IT department..... </p>,desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",gyfabitt

They are usually in ""Other Bookmarks""; this tab now says ""(Empty)"". Tried opening a second profile (created without my knowing it), but the bookmarks are not there either. Tried restoring them from backup, and it tells me this will replace the existing bookmarks. I'm OK with that, since anything's better than ""(Empty)"", so I click OK, and nothing happens, no bookmarks, no nothing. There are four bookmark backups, and none of them work. I tried going into my Time Machine and getting an older copy of the bookmarks file, and this doesn't work. I tried restarting Firefox and this doesn't work. I tried rebooting and this doesn't work. I tried uninstalling Firefox and reinstalling it and this doesn't work. </p><p>It's 14 bookmarks, so it's not exactly the end of the world, but I find this behavior puzzling and, frankly, not very impressive.
