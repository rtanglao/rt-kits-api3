1372498,2022-03-28 03:29:36 -0700,2022-03-28 08:21:45 -0700,Yum SSL Connection Problem,"<p>I am attempting  a yum EOL upgrade on a 5 year old Centos 6.5 server. I have performed the same upgrade procedure on 4 other Centos 6.5 servers without any problems. ""yum"" is the Centos utility used to download and install system packages from Centos repositories. This is a Catch 22.   Since yum on this server is after End-Of-Life for the operating system, yum is not working on this server.  Since the current yum installation on this server is not working, I am not able to use yum to download any Centos 6.5 system packages.  There are yum servers that are made available to support yum after the operating system End-Of-Life.  This requires manually modifying the yum configuration files in yum.repos.d to point to the Centos 6.5 End-Of-Life yum repositories.  I have made this change on a number of Centos 6.5 servers without any problems, but one very important server is failing to connect to the Centos 6.5 End-Of-Life repository.  Since yum is not working on this server, I can not upgrade Firefox.  When I attempt to manually upgrade Firefox with a Firefox RPM, the upgrade fails because of a large number of library dependencies.  This makes upgrading Firefox on the server manually almost impossible.  A simple solution would be to perform a full operating system upgrade on the computer, but that would wipe out all the files on the computer.  My only option is to fix the yum EOL SSL connection problem with the version of Firefox installed on this computer.

The screen comes on for about 0.5 of a second and then goes dark for a second and this repeats. The only way to stop it is to restart the computer. When I disable Widevine I can navigate the Netflix site but I can't play anything. As soon as in enable Widevine with the Netflix website open the off and on flashing starts. Even closing the browser does not stop it. I'm a windows 11 PC. </p><p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! I have chatted to Netflix twice. They suggested I speak to my IT department..... </p>,desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1493178;,gyfabitt

They are usually in ""Other Bookmarks""; this tab now says ""(Empty)"". Tried opening a second profile (created without my knowing it), but the bookmarks are not there either. Tried restoring them from backup, and it tells me this will replace the existing bookmarks. I'm OK with that, since anything's better than ""(Empty)"", so I click OK, and nothing happens, no bookmarks, no nothing. There are four bookmark backups, and none of them work. I tried going into my Time Machine and getting an older copy of the bookmarks file, and this doesn't work. I tried restarting Firefox and this doesn't work. I tried rebooting and this doesn't work. I tried uninstalling Firefox and reinstalling it and this doesn't work. </p><p>It's 14 bookmarks, so it's not exactly the end of the world, but I find this behavior puzzling and, frankly, not very impressive.
