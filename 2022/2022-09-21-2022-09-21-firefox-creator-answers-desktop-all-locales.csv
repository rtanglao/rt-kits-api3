And I don't even know if there is any upgrade for them. I looked in internet but didn't find anything suitable for my case.

I had to ask here for advice and help. </p><p>The device I use is a MacBook, running the official version of Firefox, and as far as I know this problem has been there for at least half a year. I'm used to keyboard operations, usually I use Cmd+T to create a new tab, then the cursor is focused on the address bar, and I type the URL. Since I'm typing an address that I visit often, maybe I just type the first few letters, the URL gets autocompleted, and then I just hit enter and the page opens in my new tab. But sometimes I hit enter twice (eg not English input method). At this time, I noticed that in addition to the URL I wanted to open, there's an additional tab. This tab was blank, or the page I just visit. </p><p>From my personal understanding, I may have performed the above operations to create a new tab or clone a tab at the same time. But I don't think my operations will cause these to happen concurrently. </p><p>Below are the extensions that I have installed, in my impression I don't get this bug in Windows, but I don't use Windows a lot.

Nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary until I decided to watch a few YouTube videos. The best way I can describe this problem is that every time I decide to scroll down to see the description or read a few comments, the entire screen on my laptop goes black regardless if it's on default view or full screen. </p><p>Even though that does sound like a crash, the audio still plays, and if I power the computer to sleep mode and log back in, the window of the video automatically scrolls up and everything is back to the way it was (but I did had to restart the laptop once because it also visually broke my mouse pointer). The only way I can get around this problem is to pause whatever video I watch and then scroll down, and no black screen occurs. </p><p>I don't know if I'm the only one who has this problem, but I've never had this issue happen in past versions of FireFox. If there is another way to fix this problem, I'll be glad to take anyone's possible suggestions/solutions. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1050;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1535304;,dashoobi
