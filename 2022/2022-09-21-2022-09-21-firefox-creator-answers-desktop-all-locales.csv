I have two installed java versions, 1.8 (one of latest of this branch) and 1.6. Problem is the AHU site is not working with anything newer than 1.6. I can't find proper solution for opening site with version 1.6 without much issues or much asking from browser. I need version 1.8 of java for daily use, and 1.6 is only for mentioned device. I tried to disable java 1.8 in java control panel but it doesn't seem to have any influence. I try to open site in Firefox 52ESR because for my knowledge is it one of latest browser which supported java. The problem is, Firefox each time is asking me what version to select for each class which must be loaded, and these classes are many for one page. It makes working with AHU a pain in azz. Everything because java is out-of-date. I know it is, but I don't have any option - these devices are not mine, and I can't upgrade firmware on myself, and can't force customer to do this. And I don't even know if there is any upgrade for them. I looked in internet but didn't find anything suitable for my case. Is there anything I can do with java or firefox 52ESR settings to make this site works flawless? I set applet in Firefox to not asking when activate java, but it still nagging me with questions and requires confirmations. I can't bypass it. I tried to use Internet Explorer 11 but there it is even worse, because out-of-date java is not allowed to run, no matter what settings i made in application.

Since I've run into this problem a limited number of times and I can't reproduce it. But it does appear frequently and is very annoying. I had to ask here for advice and help. </p><p>The device I use is a MacBook, running the official version of Firefox, and as far as I know this problem has been there for at least half a year. I'm used to keyboard operations, usually I use Cmd+T to create a new tab, then the cursor is focused on the address bar, and I type the URL. Since I'm typing an address that I visit often, maybe I just type the first few letters, the URL gets autocompleted, and then I just hit enter and the page opens in my new tab. But sometimes I hit enter twice (eg not English input method). At this time, I noticed that in addition to the URL I wanted to open, there's an additional tab. This tab was blank, or the page I just visit. </p><p>From my personal understanding, I may have performed the above operations to create a new tab or clone a tab at the same time. But I don't think my operations will cause these to happen concurrently. </p><p>Below are the extensions that I have installed, in my impression I don't get this bug in Windows, but I don't use Windows a lot. In addition, my MacBook keys may be sticky, or it may be a system problem. </p>",desktop;tabs;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",462913276
