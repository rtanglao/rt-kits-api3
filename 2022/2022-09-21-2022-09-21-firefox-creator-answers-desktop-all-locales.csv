Nothing seemed to be out of the ordinary until I decided to watch a few YouTube videos. The best way I can describe this problem is that every time I decide to scroll down to see the description or read a few comments, the entire screen on my laptop goes black regardless if it's on default view or full screen. </p><p>Even though that does sound like a crash, the audio still plays, and if I power the computer to sleep mode and log back in, the window of the video automatically scrolls up and everything is back to the way it was (but I did had to restart the laptop once because it also visually broke my mouse pointer). The only way I can get around this problem is to pause whatever video I watch and then scroll down, and no black screen occurs. </p><p>I don't know if I'm the only one who has this problem, but I've never had this issue happen in past versions of FireFox. If there is another way to fix this problem, I'll be glad to take anyone's possible suggestions/solutions. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-1050;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",dashoobi

Edge and Chrome open the websites fine. Last time I downloaded earlier manual install Firefox and it would open the websites fine, but it would not update when prompt came up saying update available.  Windows just updated and most of the websites I need/use will not open in Firefox, even the federal government websites like <a href=""http://USPS.com"" rel=""nofollow"">USPS.com</a>.  It is getting to be too much hassle and I am considering to change main browser, even though I like Firefox (when working properly) better than the others.  ""Fixes"" I found with internet searches do not work.  Firefox was upgraded to 105.0 (64-bit), the latest version according to website. (Note: Had to download using Edge, Firefox gave Secure Connection Failed error when clicked on download button.) </p>",desktop;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1050;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1535271;1535279;1535281;1535291;1535296;,MajicEagle
