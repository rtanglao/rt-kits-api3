Edge and Chrome open the websites fine. Last time I downloaded earlier manual install Firefox and it would open the websites fine, but it would not update when prompt came up saying update available.  Windows just updated and most of the websites I need/use will not open in Firefox, even the federal government websites like <a href=""http://USPS.com"" rel=""nofollow"">USPS.com</a>.  It is getting to be too much hassle and I am considering to change main browser, even though I like Firefox (when working properly) better than the others.  ""Fixes"" I found with internet searches do not work.  Firefox was upgraded to 105.0 (64-bit), the latest version according to website. (Note: Had to download using Edge, Firefox gave Secure Connection Failed error when clicked on download button.) </p>",desktop;needsinfo;windows-10;website-breakages;firefox-1050;,firefox,website-breakages,en-US,1535271;,MajicEagle
