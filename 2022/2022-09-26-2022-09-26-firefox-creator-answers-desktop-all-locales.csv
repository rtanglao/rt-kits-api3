This was all working fine until I updated to 102.3.0esr. Now, the data shrinks to a tiny part of the page when I go to print it. (See screenshots of what it looks like prior to going to the print dialogue and then when I actually go to print it). I've checked various settings suggested on previous posts that sound like the same problem but none of these work (Scaling, shrink, printer margins, clearing the cache etc.). If I choose a different printer and select A4 paper, the data looks to be the correct size (i.e. set for a 2x1 label), albeit on a much larger page.  </p><p>I downloaded Chrome and I can get it to display and print ok from there. I just don't know what's happened in Firefox. Also, it's not just my system - one of my colleagues had a problem with a standard release. We changed him to the esr version (prior to the 102.3.0 update) and it worked ok then. Obviously something has happened in this update. Any help would be appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",dnm1978

It wasn't intuitive to my not techie brain,  but found out how to open all the tabs on the new computer.

Is that it?  I am certainly no computer expert-- still using Win 7 which does everything I need.  But I am going on my observations; and from the last 30 min reading people's issues wth accessing history, it seems that Firefox has gone backweards in this area.  As there used to be a way to access 'All History' </p><p>Chrome has an excellent History setup - it retains all history since it was last cleared, and which I have often used to my great delight. Could go back many months. </p><p>Can FF only access the last 7 days of History? </p><p>Thanks </p><p>PS, I tried clicking on Share Data for this post but it says it cannot access it.  Then I tried clicking on the link that it suggested but I went to it and not only lost all my typing (this is the second attempt) but I don't have a fault as that page may suggest. My FF, which is the lastest one, seems to be working normally, it's just the limited History I have an issue with. And the reason for this Post.

I like it, but the font thing is about to send me packing. I just cannot get a decent automatic display of all websites. I never had an issue with Safari. Example: Gmail's body section is way too small, no matter how much I try to enlarge it, it just doesn't want to enlarge. I mean, this is really a hassle. Is there a simple setting in Firefox that can duplicate Safari's handling of text/fonts? I really would like to use it as my default browser, but it's really getting annoying. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1040;firefox-10401;,firefox,other,en-US,1536521;1536523;,hikerwest2014
