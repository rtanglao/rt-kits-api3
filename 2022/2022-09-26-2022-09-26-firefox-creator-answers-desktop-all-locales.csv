I like it, but the font thing is about to send me packing. I just cannot get a decent automatic display of all websites. I never had an issue with Safari. Example: Gmail's body section is way too small, no matter how much I try to enlarge it, it just doesn't want to enlarge. I mean, this is really a hassle. Is there a simple setting in Firefox that can duplicate Safari's handling of text/fonts? I really would like to use it as my default browser, but it's really getting annoying. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1040;firefox-10401;,firefox,other,en-US,1536521;1536523;,hikerwest2014
