I like it, but the font thing is about to send me packing. I just cannot get a decent automatic display of all websites. I never had an issue with Safari. Example: Gmail's body section is way too small, no matter how much I try to enlarge it, it just doesn't want to enlarge. I mean, this is really a hassle. Is there a simple setting in Firefox that can duplicate Safari's handling of text/fonts? I really would like to use it as my default browser, but it's really getting annoying. </p>",desktop;other;mac-os-x-1015;firefox-1040;firefox-10401;,firefox,other,en-US,"",hikerwest2014

Using other browsers, I would be able to just print the first page but I do not have the option in Firefox. I would like to be able to just print the first page and not the combined page 1 and 2.

The only way I can get back that window is to right click the icon in the taskbar and click <strong>Restore</strong> on the rightclick pane. I would have to do this everytime this happens. </p><p>I don't know what caused this, it was fine most of the day and just started late afternoon. Anyone have a clue to the root of this issue and what's your advice? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1050;firefox-10501;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",deepmidorisea
