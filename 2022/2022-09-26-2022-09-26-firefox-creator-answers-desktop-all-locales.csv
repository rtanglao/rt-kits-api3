They are not not the old Firefox folder (my most recent entry was 2019,) and not in the places Firefox has suggested looking.  I will backup my current 5 days worth of bookmarks, when all of the downloads are current, and try to download the Microsoft suggestion.  My question is; why are they NOT automatically saved?
