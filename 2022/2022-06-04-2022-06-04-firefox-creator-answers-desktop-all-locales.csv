Occasionally, when I open Firefox a message will appear informing me that a new version is available, and it gives me a choice to download it or not.  I normally select not to download it, and instead go to Help/About which then automatically checks my version to determine whether or not it is up to date.  Lately, that has not been working properly, or at least not the same as it used to work. </p><p>Today the message opened to tell me a new version was available.  I closed that message, and went to Help/About which showed my current version, 100.0.1, is ""up to date"".  So I then went to the mozilla website, and found that there is a later version, 101.0, available.  As you can see by that the auto check in Help/About seemed to not have worked correctly.  So, wanting to be up to date, I attempted to download the new 101.0 version.  When I clicked on Download it immediately displayed the message, ""Your download was interrupted. But all is not lost. Your system may not meet the requirements for Firefox, but you can try one of these versions."" </p><p>No matter how many times I tried, it continued to give me that message without allowing me to download the 101.0 version.  So I went back to Help/About to try that again.  It still said my version 100.0.1 is ""up to date"".  I started over on <a href=""http://Moxilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Moxilla.org</a>, and instead of immediately trying to download I clicked on ""See Release Notes"".  That displayed the release notes for 101.0, and when I clicked on ""Windows 64 Bit"" in that screen it did download the Firefox installer which I saved to my hard drive. </p><p>I then ran that Firefox installer which informed me that Firefox was already installed, and suggested I update it instead which I accepted.  The installer supposedly did it's thing, but now when I go to ""Help/About Firefox"" it shows that I still have version 100.0.1 installed AND it is still ""up to date"".  </p><p>So what gives?  Is there really a new, 101.0, version?  If so how do I update to it? </p><p>Respectfully, James Belkiewitz jabelkiewitz@att.net </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-11;firefox-1000;firefox-10001;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1510043;,jabelkiewitz

For example, if I lower my brightness from 100 to 80 while Firefox is open, once I close Firefox, the brightness of my screen increases back to 100 after a few seconds. Similarly, when I reopen Firefox, my brightness drops from 100 to 80 as that was the setting the brightness was set at when Firefox was closed. This does not happen with any other program, especially other browsers, that I have on my computer. Do any of you experience or know of this problem and do you have any advice on how to fix the issue? </p><p>(I have tried booting Firefox in Troubleshooting Mode, refreshing Firefox and reinstalling Firefox. My computer is also up to date on the latest Windows updates. This issue was not always present with Firefox and only began recently, within the last two weeks.) </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-11;firefox-1010;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1510038;,Jaseun

So I'll stick with older version (9) until I decide to get new computer. Firefox  is my preference, but if I update, it's likely to break again. Please tell me how to stop all update notices. It is maddening. Or, if you can do it, please do. I don't want to use the others. It has crashed twice, just FF, in the last few days. A system restore saved me, but I updated and lost it.
