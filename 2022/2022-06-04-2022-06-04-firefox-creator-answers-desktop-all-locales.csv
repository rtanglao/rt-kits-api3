I did talk to GD support and it worked fine with Chrome and Chromium. So whatever is causing this problem, it's in Firefox. I tried with a clear Firefox (one with no extensions by deleting /.mozilla) but it's still the same - the upload starts but then stops within the first 30 seconds. Ping and traceroute are all perfectly fine to google servers, no losses, so it's not the connection either. </p><p>Firefox is the latest stable version: 101.0. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-1010;,firefox,other,en-US,"",rado84

Similarly, when I reopen Firefox, my brightness drops from 100 to 80 as that was the setting the brightness was set at when Firefox was closed. This does not happen with any other program, especially other browsers, that I have on my computer.
