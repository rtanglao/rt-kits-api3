Please stop update notices.,"<p>Just paid $150.00 for a remote session from my computer store. Advice is: My older computer (2004)and it's graphic capabilities aren't compatible with newest FF. So I'll stick with older version (9) until I decide to get new computer. Firefox  is my preference, but if I update, it's likely to break again. Please tell me how to stop all update notices. It is maddening. Or, if you can do it, please do. I don't want to use the others. It has crashed twice, just FF, in the last few days. A system restore saved me, but I updated and lost it.  Can you help this not wealthy person?  I thank you for your fine product, and your help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-910;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1509906;,ratguard
