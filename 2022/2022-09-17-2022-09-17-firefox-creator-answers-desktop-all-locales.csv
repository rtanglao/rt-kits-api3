Not sure if this happened after a Firefox crash, Firefox update or Windows update. Unfortunately after reviewing the information on recovering the file I found that none of the methods worked for me. Also since I had no idea this had happened I had already done some password resets on web sites and Firefox had saved them which most likely wiped out the backup logins file. This is a real black mark for Firefox. If the logins.json file is corrupted you should display a prominent warning on startup so that users have a fair chance to recover before inadvertently wiping out the back up file. I do not use mobile devices (and you should NOT assume that everyone does) so there is no other device to recover the logins from. Fortunately I save some passwords in a password manager so not all is lost. But its hard to have confidence in your browser if this can happen without warning or notification. Very sloppy work. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,other,en-US,"",pdagosto1

As a privacy focused person i do not see any reason why any website would be interested in the timezone of my operatingsystem. This information is most likely not even necessary for functionality. From my knownledge the android browser named bromite (source: <a href=""https://www.bromite.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bromite.org/</a>) does block timezone detection by default, since firefox is a privacy browser i fail to understand why this feature is not included to the settings tab. </p><p>PS: I'm not interested to making any suggestions anywhere, i want to modify firefox to block both system font and system timezone detection, any help is welcome... </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Firefox_Beginner
