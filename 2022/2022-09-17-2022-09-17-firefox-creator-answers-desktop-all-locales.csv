Other strange behaviour on that site since the update: most of the images don't appear. For example on this page : <a href=""https://letterboxd.com/films/#"" rel=""nofollow"">https://letterboxd.com/films/#</a> all the movie covers are just blank. </p><p>The website does work properly when using Firefox in private mode though (both login and images work fine), so this makes me think it's related to my other issue mentioned above. </p><p>OS: Ubuntu 22.04 Firefox 104.0.2 </p><p>EDIT after posting this question: I just found out that I can't login on Google either.
