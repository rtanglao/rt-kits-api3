But recently I noticed this Windows key + Spacebar combination can change Firefox's scrolling behavior. </p><p>Steps to reproduce: 1. Add one more language to Windows (I am using Win10 ... not sure about Win11 though) so that Windows key + Spacebar shows the language selecting popup 2. Turn OFF ""Use smooth scrolling"" in Firefox settings 3. Find a long webpage to test scrolling -- it should be ""jumping"" 4. On the same page, make sure Firefox is at focus, press Windows key + Spacebar to show that popup 5. Try scrolling again -- it's now scrolling very ""smoothly"". To my eyes, it's even much smoother than turning on ""Use smooth scrolling"" 6. Now click somewhere outside of Firefox(i.e. Taskbar) to lose focus then focus back to Firefox and scroll again, the smoothness is lost ... until switching language again. </p><p>I personally found it quite annoying... Is there something I can do to stop it from happening? </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>J </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Jerouy
