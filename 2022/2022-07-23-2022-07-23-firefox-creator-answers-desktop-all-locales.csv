When I click a precise location in the URL or Search field (where some text already exists), I expect the text cursor to locate at this exact spot, NOT the existing text to be entirely selected! With this ""new"" default behaviour, it now requires 2 clicks to achieve the same task (not what I'd call an improvement) and makes it really PAINFUL to construct a list of search terms (one by one) by copying/pasting them from the current web page (funnily, it proves to be less painful when copying text from another application, since the automatic selection of previously pasted search terms does NOT happen when pasting an additional term -&gt; this is exactly the behaviour I'm expecting). </p><p>Historically, whenever I was willing to have the existing text SELECTED (I agree this can be useful from time to time), I used keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+L or Ctrl+K to move the text cursor to the URL or Search field (respectively). </p><p>All in all, the historical behaviour of FF on GNU/Linux was just fine (at least to me). </p><p>So my QUESTION today is: how to get this historical behaviour back? How to prevent the existing text from being selected when I just CLICK in the URL or Search field? </p><p>I've not been able to find a hidden option to configure this behaviour since FF on Linux changed the rule. So I'm afraid it doesn't exist... But if so, would it be possible to add such an option? </p><p>Thank you :) </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1020;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",gnu_v

This then sends me to a folder to open a PDF.  </pre> <p>I experimented with making Edge my default browser to see if it did the same. No, it simply printed the document (as Firefox always did in Windows 10). No messing about with a PDF. </p><p>I can't see any settings anywhere, in Firefox, Printer, or Word that address this. I don't want to default permanently to Edge but I can see these extra steps becoming an annoyance. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",lynnuttall

But recently I noticed this Windows key + Spacebar combination can change Firefox's scrolling behavior. </p><p>Steps to reproduce: 1. Add one more language to Windows (I am using Win10 ... not sure about Win11 though) so that Windows key + Spacebar shows the language selecting popup 2. Turn OFF ""Use smooth scrolling"" in Firefox settings 3. Find a long webpage to test scrolling -- it should be ""jumping"" 4. On the same page, make sure Firefox is at focus, press Windows key + Spacebar to show that popup 5. Try scrolling again -- it's now scrolling very ""smoothly"". To my eyes, it's even much smoother than turning on ""Use smooth scrolling"" 6. Now click somewhere outside of Firefox(i.e. Taskbar) to lose focus then focus back to Firefox and scroll again, the smoothness is lost ... until switching language again. </p><p>I personally found it quite annoying... Is there something I can do to stop it from happening? </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>J </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1020;firefox-10201;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Jerouy
