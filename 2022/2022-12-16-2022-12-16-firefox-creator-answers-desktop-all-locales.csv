When I receive a notification to Firefox it stays shown for 5 seconds and then goes to the Action Center. If I click on it within the first 20 seconds of up receiving it, it opens the link from that notification. If I click it after those 20 seconds the notification just dissapears. So, they are pretty much useless. I don't have this issue with Chrome. I had this similar issue back in Windows 7. I can't believe Mozilla haven't find a way to solve this.

Any ideas? Here are a few more details: 1. All other items, like, Bookmarks, Tabs and History are syncing across all devices, no problems. 2. I deleted all old login IDs, bookmarks and everything stored in my FF account previously, then imported new and updated ones from Microsoft Edge. 3. Login IDs and Passwords are all showing up and working with Auto-fill in FF for desktop. Just that these IDs and Passwords are not showing up in FF for iPhone and Android despite manually syncing multiple times and ensuring that Login check box is ticked on. 4. New passwords created on FF for either iPhone or Android are syncing across all devices (including desktop), but the vice-versa (imported and new ones saved on desktop) are not syncing with mobile devices. 5. I have tried re-installing FF on all 3 devices and still only passwords remain to be synced. Rest everything syncs perfectly. 6. I have tried importing from Google Chrome as well, but the same problem ensues. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-11;firefox-1070;firefox-10701;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",gary199301

Scrolling is choppy in firefox for Linux vs Windows on same computer.,"<p>Hey there I am a long time Firefox user, and a new Ubuntu user. Dual booting Ubuntu &amp; Windows on a single laptop. When I use the touchpad to scroll on Firefox in Ubuntu, the scroll behavior automatically jumps several lines at a time, instead of a smooth, fine adjustment that I get everywhere else. The scrolling on the rest of Ubuntu doesn't jump lines like this, and on the fresh Windows install I just did, the scrolling is smooth, fine, and normal as well. Even when I use autoscroll on Firefox in Ubuntu, the scrolling is smooth and infinitely/finely adjustable/normal.  </p><p>I have played with all of the settings that contain the word ""scroll"" in about:config to no avail. I have been able to make the scrolling less jarring by turning on and adjusting the scrolling physics options, But it's still a workaround because I can't just scroll a hair if I want to. I essentially just slowed the ""spring weight"" and acceleration action down. Changing ""mousewheel.system_scroll_override.enabled"" to ""false"" made the minimum scroll distance less by a couple of lines. But did not get rid of it; Still, the minimum amount I can scroll up or down is several lines.  </p><p>How do I change this? Is there a setting that I am unaware of? </p><p>Thanks!! </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-1080;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",supertown07
