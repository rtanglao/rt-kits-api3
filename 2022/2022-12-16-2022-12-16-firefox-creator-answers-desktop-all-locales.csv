One is running the current updates for Windows 11 Pro, the other is running the current updates for Windows 10 Pro.  As soon as Firefox updated to its latest version on both machines, it will no longer start, even in safe mode.  I cannot call up the profile manager on either machine.  The software is simply dead even after shutting off my Norton anti-virus and firewall.  When I open Task Manager is does not even show it is running.   The only way I know Firefox is even installed is that the icon is on my desktop and it is listed in the Control Panel to uninstall.   I did a refresh on both to no avail.  On the Windows 10 machine I did a clean install to no avail even going as far as deleting all the profile folders and starting over from scratch....still it will not start.  I never had any issues until Firefox installed their latest update.  Can anyone enlighten me as to how I can resolve this situation other than dumping Firefox for good and going to Chrome? </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;,firefox,other,en-US,"",mz.artguy

Scrolling is choppy in firefox for Linux vs Windows on same computer.,"<p>Hey there I am a long time Firefox user, and a new Ubuntu user. Dual booting Ubuntu &amp; Windows on a single laptop. When I use the touchpad to scroll on Firefox in Ubuntu, the scroll behavior automatically jumps several lines at a time, instead of a smooth, fine adjustment that I get everywhere else. The scrolling on the rest of Ubuntu doesn't jump lines like this, and on the fresh Windows install I just did, the scrolling is smooth, fine, and normal as well. Even when I use autoscroll on Firefox in Ubuntu, the scrolling is smooth and infinitely/finely adjustable/normal.  </p><p>I have played with all of the settings that contain the word ""scroll"" in about:config to no avail. I have been able to make the scrolling less jarring by turning on and adjusting the scrolling physics options, But it's still a workaround because I can't just scroll a hair if I want to. I essentially just slowed the ""spring weight"" and acceleration action down. Changing ""mousewheel.system_scroll_override.enabled"" to ""false"" made the minimum scroll distance less by a couple of lines. But did not get rid of it; Still, the minimum amount I can scroll up or down is several lines.  </p><p>How do I change this?
