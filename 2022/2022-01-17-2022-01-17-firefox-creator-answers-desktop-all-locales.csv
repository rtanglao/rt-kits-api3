I get an error message which is basically the same as if the page did not exist. It does exist though. I tried a different browser and there it works. I also created a new Firefox profile and I can access the sites without issues this way. So the problem must be with my original standard profile. Can you suggest me how to fix this? I already selected these specific websites and had Firefox forget about them in my browsing history, but sadly this does not solve the issue. They are still unavailable. </p><p>I don't mind losing pretty much everything attached to this profile in order to solve the issue and be able to open the sites again. Saved logins would be cool to keep, but I can sacrifice those too if there is no other option. The only exception is my browsing history. I do need that one and cant afford to lose it, which is why I do not simply switch over to a new profile. Of course if there is a way to export my entire history to another new profile, then I'd happily take this path too. Just no idea how. Thanks for reading! I hope all is clear, I am not an English native speaker. </p><p>I have Firefox 96.0.1 and Windows 11. </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,cookies,en-US,1475162;1475234;1475239;,thomas-buetow

However, I appreciate that's how it is, so I'm simply hoping there's a solution :)</em> </p><p>Before anyone says: 'just use tabs instead', I normally do, however, for reasons I won't go into (related to a very popular 3rd party plugin) some things open in a new window by default - there is no option to open them in a new tab, so I regularly end up with more than one Firefox window, and it would be nice to know that one false move doesn't decimate all the pinned tabs I've made. </p>",desktop;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",Zedr
