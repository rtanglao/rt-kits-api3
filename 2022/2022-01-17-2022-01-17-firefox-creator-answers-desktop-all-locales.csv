I've hated it ever since they smoothed everything out, and tabs just look like some sort of continuous amorphous mess.  I want the lines between tabs so it is easier to distinguish between them.  I know that changing the ""browser.proton.enabled"" to false gets rid of this garbage new look, but for some reason, whenever I switch this over, the setting doesn't save.  Every time I reopen FireFox, it reverts back to this ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE layout.  (can you tell I hate it? FIX IT MOZILLA!!!!) </p><p>Please help...? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",oblic008

My laptop has a long list of bookmarks and a dozen or more open tabs.  I would like to get this same setup on the new computer.  I thought I followed directions but since it does not work I guess I have missed something important. </p><p>Go to the menu in upper right, then the &gt; next to my account, which brings up Manage Account, Syncing, several other items, then a list of tabs on my phone, another list of tabs on my laptop, and a third list of tabs on an old computer that no longer exists.  It has been syncing for 2-3 hours without evident progress.  I would like to delete the dead computer to avoid confusion but see no way to do it.  Mainly I want to sync with the laptop or, failing that, import the bookmarks from it. </p><p>I also copied the FF profile from the old computer into the new one.  The files and directory structures are identical but FF cannot read the profile.  I do not know what to do about any of this. </p>",desktop;sync;firefox-960;firefox-9601;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",jrsva

I have been with ffirefox since I started using laptops which is 7-8 years back. I never thought of switching browser or finding an alternative of firefox until for some months the issue is occurring. Now I am really annoyed to open up task manager every time and close firefox which is running in the backgroud. I have seen nothing unusual in the ""about:performance"" tab of firefox. </p><p>Please help me to continue my journey with firefox. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-960;firefox-9601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",senanindya21
