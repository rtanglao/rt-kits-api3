I have been with ffirefox since I started using laptops which is 7-8 years back. I never thought of switching browser or finding an alternative of firefox until for some months the issue is occurring. Now I am really annoyed to open up task manager every time and close firefox which is running in the backgroud. I have seen nothing unusual in the ""about:performance"" tab of firefox. </p><p>Please help me to continue my journey with firefox. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-960;firefox-9601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",senanindya21
