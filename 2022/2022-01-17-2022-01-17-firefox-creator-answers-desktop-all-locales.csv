Da un pò di tempo ho un problema con la visualizzazione di video su PrimeVideo (Amazon). Il browser è aggiornato all'ultima versione disponibile (Firefox 96.0) e anche i plugin richiesti (Widevine). Contattando la loro assistenza riporto quanto detto: ""L'errore 7235 significa che il lettore HTML5 ha bisogno di un componente chiamato “modulo di decrittografia contenuto” fornito dal browser per supportare DRM mancante. Questo errore è dal tuo browser senza questo il video non verrà riprodotto. È necessario abilitare questo componente o installarlo."" Consigli?

I've hated it ever since they smoothed everything out, and tabs just look like some sort of continuous amorphous mess.  I want the lines between tabs so it is easier to distinguish between them.  I know that changing the ""browser.proton.enabled"" to false gets rid of this garbage new look, but for some reason, whenever I switch this over, the setting doesn't save.  Every time I reopen FireFox, it reverts back to this ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE layout.  (can you tell I hate it?
