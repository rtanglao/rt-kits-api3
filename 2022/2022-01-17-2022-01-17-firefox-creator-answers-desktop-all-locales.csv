Basically, I trust both devices due to full-disk encryption, but it's possible to steal my laptop while powered on and unlocked. Hence my laptop approach is strict while adding a few exceptions that rely on successful authentication without remembering passwords. </p><p>I find it quite hard to manage exceptions. I've spend a couple of hours reading through this forum as well as numerous FAQs and guides, yet it appears there are a lot of conflicting options that override certain settings. The entire process is pretty counterintuitive and could use an overhaul from a UX perspective, where a simplification of the process might also result in the resources becoming more useful. </p><p>Anyway, one of my issues is that it appears I can't use asterisk * when defining URL exceptions for cookie settings. Second, unless explicitly defined, the protocol defaults to http and not https. I guess I should ask what happens before complaining too much. Example time: </p><p>1: I add the URL '<a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">example.com</a>' 2: Firefox converts it to '<a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com</a>' 3: I add the URL '<a href=""https://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://example.com</a>' </p><p>How will each of these exceptions work for the following: <a href=""https://www.example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.example.com</a> <a href=""https://this.example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://this.example.com</a> </p><p>And how can I mitigate this without a regex or similar, short of manually adding an extensive list of possible variations in between https:// and .example.com? To clarify, I'll need an exception for something like https://*.example.com  </p><p>Finally, how is this affected by individual settings in the sections Enhanced Tracking Protection, Cookies and Site Data, and History?

I've hated it ever since they smoothed everything out, and tabs just look like some sort of continuous amorphous mess.  I want the lines between tabs so it is easier to distinguish between them.

Every time I reopen FireFox, it reverts back to this ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE layout.  (can you tell I hate it?
