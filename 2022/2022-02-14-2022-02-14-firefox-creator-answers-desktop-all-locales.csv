Did a little research beforehand and it could be a few things - but themes and extensions seem to be where to start. Also searched a few keywords on support, but it's more of the same - with resetting Firefox being the last resort. Sorry if it comes across as a bit lazy, it just seems like a simple answer that I can’t manage to find. </p><p>Pretty straightforward..  whenever I launch Firefox for the first time after restarting [Big Sur 11.6.3], it just lags. There's a lot of scrolling and input delay, everything’s down to a crawl...  This is only after a restart, and on the first launch. So then I'll close FF, open it back up, and good. </p><p>I’m kind of confused because - even if I briefly open it, mere seconds, then close and reopen, it’s back to normal. So it doesn't seem as though there’s a process in the BG that hasn't completed, or something that hasn’t loaded. But, at the same time, I don’t know the intricacies of these things. </p><p>Extensions: Bitwarden, Cookie Autodelete, Decentraleyes, ExpressVPN, Ghostery, Grammarly, idontcareaboutcookies, Prettier Lichess, Privacy Badger, Tabliss, Tampermonkey, Translate Web Pages, Tree Style Tab, uBlock </p><p>It's a lot I know, most seem credible though. My guess is - maybe there's a conflict with all the ad blockers?? Maybe having Ghostery, uBlock <em>and</em> Privacy Badger is overkill? Outside of 'Enable Right Click’, 'Prettier Lichess' (which is excellent btw; customization options), and 'Tampermonkey'.. I’m just not really sure any of these would be the cause, but again, that’s why I’m here.  Please help if you can, thanks for your time. - jazz </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-970;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",serialdesigner
