I would refresh the pages, they would load properly &amp; I could browse without a problem.  About 4 or 5 days ago, web pages stopped loading altogether, nor could i navigate to another page from my initial pages.  When I launched Firefox, 5 home page tabs would load (my usual #) but they were either blank or the url was displayed with an error message.  I did not record the message, but instead tried to refresh my browser.  Once I refreshed my browser, it would not launch at all - at least in a usable fashion.  No window would display. but there would be anywhere from 5 to 7 instances of Firefox displayed in the task manager.  I tried completely uninstalling Firefox &amp; reinstalling, but I would get a message that I already had a version installed &amp; the installer would only allow me the option to refresh - which created the same problem.  I uninstalled the browser again, did a search for all Firefox &amp; Mozilla files, found quite a few, &amp; manually deleted all but 2, which I was prevented from because I needed permission from ""Trusted Source"".  The result is the same when I try to reinstall after going through this process. </p><p>At this point, I am at a loss.  I really like Firefox, but it looks like i am going to be forced to move to Chrome or Edge (both of which I hate).  I hope that there is a solution out there. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",robert.brown13p
