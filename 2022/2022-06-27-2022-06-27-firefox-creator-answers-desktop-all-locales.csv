He's been getting along on MS Edge since then.  He wants to get back to Firefox for his bookmarks that are there.  His problem is that Firefox doesn't start.  When he tries to start it, a gray window appears briefly with a rotating blue circle and then disappears in less than a minute.  While it's up, Firefox shows up in Task Manager with ""not responding"" or ""suspended"" or nothing. I note that the last Firefox update was 6/14/2022 according to the date modified on the file in Crash Reports, InstallTime2022060832.  This is about the time he began having problems. </p><p>During the brief time it's up, there is no menu button (3 short lines), so Refreshing or Troubleshooting are not options.   I believe my only option is to Uninstall (without removing user data) and then reinstall Firefox, ie a ""Clean Install"".  I see an option to Refresh during the Uninstall dialog.  Might that work?

I don't clear the cache, to keep these references from disappearing. I have to move computers now. My longtime mac is not working well anymore.
