I looked up how to get any kind of information on this, and saved networking logs. They indicate that the moment Firefox tries to send the first UDP packet for the HTTP/3 connection, it gets ""ErrorAccordingToNSPR [in=-5987 out=80004005]"", the connection fails, and the server is added to an exclusion list so that no further (futile) attempts at using HTTP/3 will be made (which makes reattempting a HTTP/3 connection by hand that much harder). The initial platform was Windows 11, with Firefox 98.0.2, but afterwards I reproduced the issue on another PC running Windows 10, and with a nightly version on Windows 11, which I also used to save some logs which I can publish, as they don't reveal the sites I visit (though I can always provide the logs from my everyday instance of Firefox, should you find the information insufficient). </p><p>I also confirmed that HTTP/3 works with Chromium on the very same system and network, and also with Firefox on another machine running Linux. </p>",desktop;other;windows-11;,firefox,other,en-US,"",aldwulf
