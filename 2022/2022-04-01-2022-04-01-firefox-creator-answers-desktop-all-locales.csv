Before, typing the RSS feed link into the browser would at least produce some results. Now, it just asks to save file. I only want to preview it. </p><p>I've read around and can't find much on the actual feed reader side of firefox. On wikipedia, it says firefox still has a feed reader built in. Firefox support pages say live bookmarks were removed, etc. I just want to view the feed in browser.  </p><p>I downloaded an addon ""Feed Preview"" or something similar, now I can view the feed in browser again. The thing is, this addons says it has access to ALL of my firefox data. I already feel some kind of way about downloading this app and then after asks for perms. So I'd prefer not to just use any ""addon"". RSS feed reader should come basic for browsers.  </p><p>What is the best way around this? or is my browser just bugged? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,customize,en-US,1494146;,awleach05

I'm running Firefox 98.0.2 on Mac 10.14.6 - I've followed all the 'help' advice: I opened firefox profiles, it only shows one. I rebooted Firefox (I was left with bare bones) and still no bookmarks and still only one profile. I've looked in the computer 'library' and I can find nothing compressed (the bookmarkbackups folder has 15 items but all are dated 2022). Can someone please help me retrieve them, I'm in the middle of a project and NEED the bookmarks. Thank you in advance! </p>",desktop;bookmarks;mac-os-x-1014;firefox-980;firefox-9802;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",artcreeping
