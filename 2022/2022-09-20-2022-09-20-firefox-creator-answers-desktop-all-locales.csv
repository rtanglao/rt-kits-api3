Can this be done with firefox or with the operatingsystem itself? After all i know for a fact that the bromite android browser has this feature and it works. I noticed that disabling javascript blocks systemtimedetection, but it also basically renders the browsers useless for my purposes.. are there specific javascript config settings regarding systemtimezone detection? I really feel that when a website spys on my systemtimezone this is a breach of privacy as this goes beyond the browsers im using to view the website but instead directly access information about my system, im not ok with that... Using a virtualmachine just to fake systemtimezone cannot be the solution, this is ridiculous. </p><p>By the way, i hope Mozilla won't let down support for Manivest v2 ever, there is a chance firefox will gain a boost in users after google pushing Manivest v3 that hard... making adblock useless, what a shame. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1030;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1535143;,Firefox_Beginner
