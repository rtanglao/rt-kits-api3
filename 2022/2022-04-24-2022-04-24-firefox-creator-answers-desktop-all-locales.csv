I understand it has to do with Microsoft, but I don't use any of their products because I don't like them. In settings/search I can restore the default search engines &amp; delete Bing, but it always reverts back to insisting on using Bing again. I have followed several threads about this issue without permanent resolution. Help?? </p>",desktop;customize;mac-os-x-1014;firefox-990;firefox-9901;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",kathycasey

When I tried to sync Firefox on new phone with my PC, old phone and tablet I was asked to type in the authorisation code. No matter how I have set my e-mail accounts no e-mail is received in my spam folder or in-box. There is no way to contact Mozilla to resolve this. I have not received any e-mail to state that my sign in was blocked for security reasons nor have I received an error code. I setup a bugzilla account and tried to request that my account be unlocked but there was no way to do this. All it has done is to create an entry that I reported ""Zarro Boogs found"". How do I get my account unblocked as the advice on the help pages is no advice. Please reply to robert@goodhart.info </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;,firefox,other,en-US,"",robert148

Eu esqueci a password. A *cada* tentativa, é preciso acessar o email e colocar um código grande de autorização. A cada tentativa. A seguir, quando tento colocar uma senha que consiga lembrar, a qual tem: letra maiúscula, símbolo e número, ainda assim não atende às exigências de segurança do Firefox, que eu considero um browser - e uma proposta - excelente. Uma pena. Todas as minhas senhas consigo configurar em todas as plataformas, absolutamente todas, exceto no Firefox. Mas o que me fez desistir é o alerta de que posso perder meus favoritos, colecionados durante ANOS, organizados por assuntos, e são centenas. Desisto. O sync parece ser para os profissionais. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;mac-os-x-1011;firefox-7815;firefox-78150;,firefox,privacy-and-security,pt-BR,"",fabionin
