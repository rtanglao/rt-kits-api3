When attempting to launch, got message ""Profile Missing Firefox profile cannot be loaded. It may be missing or inaccessible."" However the profiles folder had not been moved: (Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles). I tried reinstalling Firefox. But got the same message when attempting to launch (""Profile Missing Firefox profile cannot be loaded. It may be missing or inaccessible."") even though the profile folder was still there (Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles) and containing all of the usual files. I then removed all Firefox files from my hard drive before reinstalling again. Still no luck (and still the same ""profile missing"" message). However, this time the Library/Application Support/Firefox/ folder only contained two subfolders: ""Library/Application Support/Firefox/Crash Reports"" and ""Library/Application Support/Firefox/Pending Pings""  The ""Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles"" was now missing.  I don't know why a new Profiles folder (and profile) would not be created, but in any case, I had saved my old Profiles folder on a separate hard drive before uninstalling Firefox previously. I copied this old Profiles folder into the ""Library/Application Support/Firefox"" folder but I'm still getting the message ""Profile Missing Firefox profile cannot be loaded. It may be missing or inaccessible."" when attempting to run/launch Firefox. This is a mystery. I have read all of the ""Working with Profiles"" articles on this forum as well as the ""Install and Update"" articles but have not been able to find a solution.
