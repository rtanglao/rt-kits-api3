The primary monitor is where I do all my browsing, but the secondary one I only have a tab with some type of static page. (Documentation, media, or auto-refreshing page on localhost for web-dev, etc..). </p><p>My issue is that sometimes I alt+tab to the second Firefox window by mistake, then tab to e.g. Discord and open a link in it before I have tabbed back to my main Firefox window. Windows/Discord/Firefox will then choose to open the link in the Firefox window that was last active/brought to the front, instead of my main Firefox window on my primary monitor. </p><p>Possible solutions: </p> <ul><li> UI Setting in the settings menu when you have more than 1 window open, to toggle if the window is the main window. </li><li> Figure out what is the active window by logging time it has been active compared to other window(s) - probably not ideal, in case you go AFK with the ""wrong"" window switched to the front. </li><li> Ability to set main window by drawn screen size. In my case, my main window is on a 2560 x 1440 monitor, while secondary monitor is just a 1920 x 1080. </li><li> Query the OS what monitor number is the primary, secondary etc - then assign Firefox window to the applicable monitor number. </li></ul>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1050;firefox-10503;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",platypus.pedersen
