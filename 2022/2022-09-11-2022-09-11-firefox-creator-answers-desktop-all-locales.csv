I know this is a very minor problem, but it really bugs me. Can this be changed from preferences or any other way? Thanks in Advance </p><p>Edit: I copied this issue from someone who already raised because this exact thing annoys me too even if it's small one. Is there any solution to this problem? </p>",linux;desktop;tabs;firefox-1040;firefox-10401;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",isamamedov95

I had 2 windows with a multiple tabs open in each and Firefox will successfully reopen both windows until it doesn't. I tried all the methods with going into history or using the previous.json file in sessionrestore-backups but that file only had 1 window. Now I'm trying to use my browser history to see which websites I visited but all that shows up are the closed <em>tabs</em> - not the windows or the websites I was on before the tab was closed. </p><p>Where can I find full browsing information to restore my lost tabs? Alternatively I heard before Firefox updates it creates a snapshot of tabs/windows. How can I access this as a backup? </p><p>I dislike Chrome, but it honestly is much better at saving previous sessions. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1040;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1533100;,bonetfreedle

EG: I have a Greenie page with a tree icon - a Space page with a Rocket icon - and a home renovation page with a hammer icon. I'm a bit OCD about using the bookmarks toolbar with tiny icons and no text labels for efficiency. Icons are <em><strong>important to me</strong></em>. </p><p>In Chrome I can just drag any Notion page and the icon for that page works! Tree, Rocket, Hammer - they're all there.  </p><p>But the problem is in FF it only drags down hammers. I think it is something to do with the fact that my home renovation page with the hammer is the TOP PAGE - and FF seems to think the icon for that is the icon for the whole website I use? The icon should be enough - I shouldn't have to write text to explain what a page is. But in FF - I can't have 20 something Notion icons. I just get hammers. Any ideas? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",eclipsenow1

If I initiate a password change then, as the image warns, I may lose some, possibly of my passwords, etc. (Note: I did not have a master password setup). </p><p>If I wanted my browsers synced then I would have.

I'm signed in to Mozilla support, but then I'm not permitted to sign-in to my FF account. Unless you're going to tell me that Mozilla Support is in no way associated with FF, the rationale behind a SSO needs to change. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",ca_cleveland
