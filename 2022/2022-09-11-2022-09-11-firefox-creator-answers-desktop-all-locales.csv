How do I do that? I never want any tab to open as anything other than private. </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1533075;,dfosterpta

I cannot access my passwords because I don't recall my password. If I initiate a password change then, as the image warns, I may lose some, possibly of my passwords, etc. (Note: I did not have a master password setup). </p><p>If I wanted my browsers synced then I would have. To force me to sync is poor business practice. It's like going to McDonald's and ordering black coffee and what you get in black with sugar. </p><p>Now, before I leap to, gawd forbid, G___, what do you suggest I do??  </p><p>Lastly, let me say that I don't understand why password syncing is supposed to allow a SSO across all Mozilla accounts. I'm signed in to Mozilla support, but then I'm not permitted to sign-in to my FF account. Unless you're going to tell me that Mozilla Support is in no way associated with FF, the rationale behind a SSO needs to change. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10402;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",ca_cleveland
