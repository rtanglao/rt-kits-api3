OS is Windows 11.  On my laptop which is running the same OS it does not ask for the master password, even though they are both pointing to the same homepage of <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a>    </p><p>I have tried disabling the password and re-enable, that does not work.  If there is another setting I haven't found it yet. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-11;firefox-1000;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1504650;,cameron_fetty

I've set my firefox theme to ""light"" as recommended in another thread, restarted my computer, but to no avail.  I now have a light background/black letter tab bar but every site is black where it used to be white.  Thanks for a simple answer, I'm not highly technically skilled. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1000;,firefox,other,en-US,"",bob122eight
