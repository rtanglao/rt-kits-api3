I develop video games; I am attempting to download a zip file from Steam Workshop containing a player-created mod. I have this file on my other computer--it is not malicious. It contains nothing more than XML files and a jpg. Every time I attempt to download this file using Firefox, Firefox blocks the download as a potential security risk. I then click the download manager and tell it to download anyway; Firefox then pretends to complete the download, but in actuality the file remains at 0 bytes and a ""part"" file is created containing what I can only assume is the actual data. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1000;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1504682;1504683;,cstern

I've set my firefox theme to ""light"" as recommended in another thread, restarted my computer, but to no avail.  I now have a light background/black letter tab bar but every site is black where it used to be white.  Thanks for a simple answer, I'm not highly technically skilled. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1000;,firefox,other,en-US,1504651;1504654;1504655;1504668;,bob122eight
