I can't get it to show up, no matter what. </p><p>I even refreshed firefox, still didn't help, sadly. The only thing left is to uninstall FF but that's a headache I don't want to do. and there's no guarantee that it would work. </p><p>Tried disabling all my extensions except for the most obviously fine ones like momentum. Didn't seem to help. &lt;<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1176553"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1176553</a>&gt; This guy had the EXACT same problem I had. So I followed through these suggestions. Didn't help. </p><p>1. Does anyone know what the right keywords for this would be if I want to google others who have similar issues? Looks like I can only just hope other people have the solution. But I've googled things like firefox not suggesting history in omnibox search. Hasn't come up with anything that worked yet. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-960;,firefox,customize,en-US,1476565;,marshall929

There is no author link or a homepage link. When I search the mozilla add-ons website I can't find the add-on anymore.  </p><p>This is the add-on name and version: </p><p>Downloader for Instagram™ 1.0.4 June 3, 2020 </p><p>I don't know why the Mozilla add-ons website doesn't detect what add-ons the user has installed when you search. That would be very helpful and why it isn't a default feature is dumb.  </p><p>You have users sign in to the add-on account, why not include that feature to make things easier. </p><p>I'm guessing the solution is remove the add-on and hope another one can do what I installed the other add-on for. </p><p>I noticed the icon for this add-on appears in the overflow area of the toolbar. When I click on the icon it opens a link to a page that no longer exists when I search Google and the wayback machine archive site. </p><p>Firefox should find out if this happens and notify users that an add-on is defunct. </p><p>Anyway, here's the website associated with the add-on. </p><p><a href=""https://www.igsave.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.igsave.net/</a> </p>",desktop;customize;windows-81;firefox-840;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ScandalMac
