The last time I went to buy a new desktop computer, I wasn't a member of Camp Cow!  What I'm tryin' to say is, I'm no programmer, but I'm quite 'puter knowledgeable.

Whaddaya mean, 'Bad command or file name?  ...Doesn't make any sense..."".  I sat down to watch him try &amp; fix the computer, I told 'em I was bored, he said, ""Bored, huh?  Yeah,....that'll happen sometimes.""  Gets up from his chair, plants his hand on the backrest, stands up and does this sorta,...two and a half step, 'walk' across the room to the closet, which is like, two feet from me....  Still with his one hand on the chair's back rest, with the other, he reaches up into the closet to the little book shelf in there, grabs a book I've seen him use a number of times before, takes it down, half pulls * half 'back steps' back into his chair, playfully flings his book holding hand toward me.  It lands in my lap with a sh-mack! of my pants, and my dad being completely serious, he's not joking in the least says to me, ""Here. Read this.  It's good to know.""  The infamous book?  The user's manual for MS-DOS 5.  ...Hmm,...it might of been 6.2.  My dad was teaching me DOS commands when I was 8.  Heh!....  I'm sorry, that went a bit longer than I had imagined.  Well, I guess I'll chalk it up to, 'Taking the opportunity to tell a 'I remember when' story about my dad.  He died last year.  November 8th.  He was 86.
