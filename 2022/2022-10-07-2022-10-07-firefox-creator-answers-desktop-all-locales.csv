V poslední době od doby kdy vyšla verze 102 se začalo stávat, že některé webové stránky nejdou načíst celé. Načte se pouze jejich část a zobrazí jen to co načetl. Stránky by měli být naprogramovány správně. Problém se objevuje u více osob ve firmě a pravděpodobně to souvisí s nastavením proxy serveru. S naším proxy serverem se nějaké změny nekonaly. Když změním nastavení ve FireFoxu na ""Automatické zjištění konfigurace proxy serverů"" objeví se chyba uvedená výše. Když měním nastavení na """" tak se objevují zase jiné problémy, třeba nenačítají se externí fonty z Google API, aj. Žádná z dostupných položek proxy neřeší daný problém. Ve verzích nižších než 102.x.x se tento problém nevyskytuje a prohlížeč načítá stránky v pořádku.
