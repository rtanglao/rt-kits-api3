With Firefox, I can't figure out how to disable the history mixed in with the pinned links, or change the number of links displayed. All I can find is changing the number of rows, not columns per row which would at least be good, because I could just set the grid to fill to 1x5, instead of having the current minimum count of 1x8 links. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-1050;firefox-10502;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1539058;1539079;,dnjinwi
