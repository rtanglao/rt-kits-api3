Installed Firefox (104), runs fine but as soon as I sign into my Firefox account it immediately crashes. Continues to crash if I start in safe-mode, so I don't think the problem is an extension. After some online research and some trial and error I seem to have determined that I can sign into my Firefox account as long as password sync is disabled. But as soon as I enable password sync, Firefox immediately crashes. </p><p>Error message in terminal is always about GPU, which maybe isn't properly set up or maybe Firefox has a problem with it, but if I use the software renderer it doesn't cause a problem (MOZ_ENABLE_WAYLAND=0 firefox). Hard to imagine that this has anything to do with crashing when syncing passwords? </p><p>Crash Annotation GraphicsCriticalError: |[0][GFX1-]: No GPUs detected via PCI (t=2.77546) [GFX1-]: No GPUs detected via PCI Crash Annotation GraphicsCriticalError: |[0][GFX1-]: No GPUs detected via PCI (t=2.77546) |[1][GFX1-]: glxtest: process failed (received signal 11) (t=2.77573) [GFX1-]: glxtest: process failed (received signal 11) Missing chrome or resource URL: resource://gre/modules/UpdateListener.sys.mjs Exiting due to channel error.
