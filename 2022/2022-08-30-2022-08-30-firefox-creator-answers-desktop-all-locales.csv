We install Firefox on all of our PCs across campus. After a recent update, when our instructors try to launch Zoom using the integration setup in Blackboard, the meeting fails to launch. We have found that disabling Enhanced Protection fixes this issue. Is there a way to add this exception to an install file that can be sent across many PCs on our campus? We have hundreds of PCs and going from one to another to install this exception would not be practical. </p><p>Do you have any suggestions?

After start up (about 2 full minutes), everything works normally.  The hardware is an ASUS A88xm-A MB, A10-6800K processor, 16G DDR3, runs OS and programs off an SSD. I worked through all the slow startup suggestions, ran memtest (0 Errors, 1 Pass), disabled all add ons, (even the OpenH264 video codec (I use the onboard HDMI, no graphics card)), turned off hardware acceleration, etc. When starting in troubleshoot mode, less than 30 seconds, (acceptable), but I really don't know where to begin with the ""More Troubleshooting Information"" when I look at the table generated by it. There have been no other problems to date with the system, and the long start-up time began with 20.04 Ubuntu (about a minute), then got worse when I upgraded to 22.04 to try to solve THAT problem. Currently running FF 104.0, and the update page says wait for a distro update if that is how it was installed. I believe 104.0 is the latest Linux 64b version though. All updates to the system are done as soon as I'm notified of them. there have been none since the upgrade a few days ago. </p><p>Any suggestions? Gotta get some sleep now...
