So Firefox is the obvious choice.  But it hasn't gone well. </p><p>1) Having imported my browsing data from Chrome I have a website showing up in suggestions when I type ""pl"" that no matter what I do will not delete or go: <a href=""http://planning.highpeak.gov.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">planning.highpeak.gov.uk</a>.  This suggestion will not die no matter what I do.  I've followed every support article I can find on deleting suggestions and it just won't go. Basically I wanted to get to a point like on Chrome where ""pl"" would prompt me for plex.  But that URL for <a href=""http://planning.highpeak.gov.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">planning.highpeak.gov.uk</a> which I probably visited once about 3 years refuses to die. Yes I could reinstall Firefox and not import my Chrome data but that's worse than Google's MV3 plans. To be clear, moving the cursor down and pressing delete (or shift delete, or ctrl-delete) hides the suggestion but the moment I go back to the URL box and type pl, its straight back.  Even after deleted history its there!?! </p><p>2) Log out from Firefox just not working for me.  I press burger menu, then my username, sign out.  Doesn't sign me out.  I stay signed in. </p><p>3) Trying to sync phone by QR code not working:  burger menu -&gt; my account -&gt; Connect another device -&gt; I'm ready to syncronize devices.  Immediately shows the graphic ""Pairing unsuccessful Try again"".  With a reload icon that does nothing. </p><p>I want to like Firefox but these issues are doing my head in  </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1040;firefox-10401;,firefox,other,en-US,"",rick.kelsall
