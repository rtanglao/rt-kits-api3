Thinking it was fine, I proceeded as an idiot to install.  At the last moment, it stated it will be the homepage or some such thing,  So, I hit ""cancel"".  But, no sooner than clicking it, Bing installed itself.  But, now when I start Firefox, it opens FOUR separate tabs every single time, including my email home page and Bing related pages, including the one that asks me if I uninstalled by mistake.  I can never get rid of these tabs unless I close them one by one every time.  I even tried refreshing Firefox by getting rid of all my add-ons.  But, even that only worked for about literally 2seconds or less as Firefox restarted without Bing pages and, then, just like virus, all three pages loaded themselves again.  Is there anyway to get rid of this hijacking function, that is, OFFICIAL  Microsoft Bing extension???  <a href=""https://browserdefaults.microsoft.com/extensions/feedback_v2/index.html?extnID=%7b3e06d96e-26f5-4a68-ac64-2b6bc583a35d%7d&amp;mkt=en-us&amp;mid=C6C4A3866D8ACFCA49ED3C14E3031E0D&amp;br=mf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://browserdefaults.microsoft.com/extensions/feedback_v2/index.html?extnID=%7b3e06d96e-26f5-4a68-ac64-2b6bc583a35d%7d&amp;mkt=en-us&amp;mid=C6C4A3866D8ACFCA49ED3C14E3031E0D&amp;br=mf</a>    Sorry, I couldn't upload photos for some reason. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-1010;,firefox,other,en-US,"",misosiru
