More advanced info to help guide users deciding whether to enable this or not. </p><p>To what extent does trusting this cert place more trust than installing Kaspersky in the first place does?  My understanding: When it's installed and in use, web traffic still goes directly between my <em>machine</em> and the normal web server at its normal IP over HTTPS.  But it goes thru part of the Kaspersky software <em>on my machine</em>, where it is unencrypted. It's decrypted and re-encrypted between Firefox and my computer's network interface, and there's relatively little preventing that software from doing nefarious things.  I wonder what difference using an OS configured-by-default or managed to only allow applications to run with limited permissions makes.  My first guess is that the core Kaspersky software installs with root access/ties into the kernel anyway, although if it was exfiltrating data, someone using an external tool like Pi-Hole would probably see something fishy, and be yelling about it and the media would cover it.  So trusting this cert has a fairly small marginal downside.  And of course it enables some security functionality, so there's an upside. But exfiltration could be set to trigger only in very limited circumstances... </p><p>I'm also wondering if Firefox should display a different UI for Antivirus company certs.  I also suspect it makes sense to ship Firefox with these certificates by default, BUT <em>untrusted</em>, instead of not at all.  (The same may go for Let's Encrypt certs too!?) </p><p>I note: jscher2000's advice (copied from [<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1295569"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/que.../1295569</a>] here) is spot on: </p><p>Kaspersky software includes a feature to intercept and filter all of your web browsing. As a ""man in the middle"" the software needs to generate fake site certificates but Firefox is not fooled. </p><p>If you want to keep this feature enabled, you can set Firefox up to trust Kaspersky's fake certificates.

I'm not particularly tech savvy but I've looked and I haven't created any exceptions that would allow opening my email to be bypassed from the PP. Longer version: I use MF as my preferred browser and I have many websites bookmarked to which my passwords are autofilled. I work from home but I am my replacement at her office location. I was alarmed to find that when I brought up an MF browser on desktops at the office location, there were my bookmarks along with the ability for anyone to effortlessly login to a given website since the passwords were saved. to remedy, I tuned off Sync, but that didn't seem to solve the problem as my bookmarks were still exactly and easily accessible. Then I created a Primary Password on the two desktops at the remote office location, as well as several devices in my home. The puzzle is that Yahoo opens with no problem when I select that bookmark. I don't get prompted for the PP until I open another browser page. Also of concern: when I select a password protected bookmark, I can manually enter my login and see my sensitive account information if I just keep clicking on Cancel when the PP prompt appears. Is that because knowing the password ""overwrites"" the security of the PP? </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-810;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1357336;,cheryl711
