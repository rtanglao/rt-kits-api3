Optimally, the user would be allowed go back to an older release, but with downgrades come the loss of profile ... etc, which is why I chose to simply stop updating FF completely. Not an ideal situation, but there's no telling what else Mozilla is going to f up in the next hour, week or months.  </p><p>I thought my troubles were over, except there's now the added nag message, it shows up every few minutes, every time i start the browser, even starting private browsing window will activate the update prompt message. it's tedious having to press ""dismiss"" 20 times a day, the message itself imposes on page content, and can't be disabled by clicking outside the message box. I've already went into configuration, and activated the silent update message option, but to my amazement, the message came back again in a few hours, and the option was flipped back off. </p><p>how do i get rid of this message once and for all?  and before mozilla staff clarifies how stupid it is to turn off updates, i understand the risks of my own stupidity, i just don't want to put up with mozilla's. </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,1730641;,abem77

When opening some sites where there are videos or broadcasts, I use the mouse wheel to open the necessary videos or broadcasts in new tabs. The situation is as follows. If you slowly open several tabs, for example 5, and then go to them, then you need to click ""play"" in the video/broadcast center to make the video work. HOWEVER, if you open the tabs (also 5 or more) and switch to them immediately, the video will start automatically. Previously, this was the case when adding several tabs with videos, and after switching to them, the video immediately opened. Not anymore. I didn't change anything in the settings anywhere, I checked both on the PC version of the browser on 133... and on the latest 138... I disabled all add-ons and gave permission for auto-playback of audio and video in the site settings. I would like to point out that this is a problem on many websites. For some, everything works as before. I also note that I reinstalled the browser with a complete cleanup. The hardware on the PC is good </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",max-22-01-93
