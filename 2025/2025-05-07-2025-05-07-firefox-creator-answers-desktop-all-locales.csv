My groups are still there, but I can't create any new ones and if I delete one, I can't get it back. I can't find anything about the groups in settings either. </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",ravenmysttattoo

It seems like it's gotten worse over time. According to Perplexity AI it probably has to with Mozilla's incessant updates; I have no idea if that's true or not, I just know it doesn't work very well anymore. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",m2ndgmun

I can not fix this and I know it might not be a number of things. 1. It isn't Mal-ware or an add-on as I've checked and only used add-ons with a known good reputation. 2. It isn't something in settings as I've not clicked on clear cookies or private browsing. 3. I know it isn't a profile as I've already created a new profile entirely. Please help me with this issue I've been looking everywhere and it all points to a solution that hasn't worked. This all started when I was on the clear history page and it was frozen so I closed Firefox using Task manager and ever since this issue has prevailed. </p>,firefox;accounts;,firefox,accounts,en-US,"",magebreadsticks29

I do not see the value in taking up so much screen real estate.,"<p>My sidebar kept disappearing when opening a new window. After asking the internet, I learned that this was part of the latest UI update. This is a horrible update (sorry programming team) because if you always want your sidebar to show up, all that extra stuff has to show up as well. See first image. The second problem is that the Hide Sidebar button is too close to the Back button. I keep clicking on the Hide Sidebar button when I really want the Back button. </p><p>Is there a way to hide these controls? I know you can move them to the right, but so does your sidebar. I don't have a lot of screen real estate. Can we have an option to go back to the ""classic"" settings for sidebars? </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",BTW.I.hardly.ever.contact.Firefox
