When opening some sites where there are videos or broadcasts, I use the mouse wheel to open the necessary videos or broadcasts in new tabs. The situation is as follows. If you slowly open several tabs, for example 5, and then go to them, then you need to click ""play"" in the video/broadcast center to make the video work. HOWEVER, if you open the tabs (also 5 or more) and switch to them immediately, the video will start automatically. Previously, this was the case when adding several tabs with videos, and after switching to them, the video immediately opened. Not anymore. I didn't change anything in the settings anywhere, I checked both on the PC version of the browser on 133... and on the latest 138... I disabled all add-ons and gave permission for auto-playback of audio and video in the site settings. I would like to point out that this is a problem on many websites. For some, everything works as before. I also note that I reinstalled the browser with a complete cleanup. The hardware on the PC is good </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",max-22-01-93

I can not fix this and I know it might not be a number of things. 1. It isn't Mal-ware or an add-on as I've checked and only used add-ons with a known good reputation. 2. It isn't something in settings as I've not clicked on clear cookies or private browsing. 3. I know it isn't a profile as I've already created a new profile entirely. Please help me with this issue I've been looking everywhere and it all points to a solution that hasn't worked. This all started when I was on the clear history page and it was frozen so I closed Firefox using Task manager and ever since this issue has prevailed. </p>,firefox;accounts;,firefox,accounts,en-US,"",magebreadsticks29

I do not see the value in taking up so much screen real estate.,"<p>My sidebar kept disappearing when opening a new window. After asking the internet, I learned that this was part of the latest UI update. This is a horrible update (sorry programming team) because if you always want your sidebar to show up, all that extra stuff has to show up as well. See first image.  </p><p>The second problem is that the Hide Sidebar button is too close to the Back button. I keep clicking on the Hide Sidebar button when I really want the Back button. </p><p>Is there a way to hide these controls? I know you can move them to the right, but then, so does your sidebar. I don't have a lot of screen real estate. Can we have an option to go back to the ""classic"" settings for sidebars? </p><p>By the way... In the previous versions of Firefox, I was able to click on a link (example: Google search) and my sidebar (in my case with my bookmarks) was always there in the new window or tab. Now when I click on a link, the sidebar with my bookmarks disappears in the new window. I have to keep enabling it if I want to see my bookmarks. I'm 100% sure that this is causing frustration with over 87% of Firefox users. Can we please bring back that old functionality? </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",BTW.I.hardly.ever.contact.Firefox
