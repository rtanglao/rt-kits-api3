AI does not need to be in a browser. At all. Period. I don't want a chatbot giving me bullcrap answers to everything I search or say. Nobody wants this, nobody likes it. Not only is it annoying to deal with, but it is actively harmful and dangerous to online safety and gives rampant misinformation- and that's not even talking about how it can steal your passwords with prompt injection. If Mozilla goes ahead with this, I'll make sure to never touch this damn browser ever again. Rethink your choices. </p>",firefox-1460;windows-10;firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",foveiin

Deleted on one device, but they're still on the others","<p>Hello,  </p><p>How can I remove all my saved passwords from Firefox Sync? On my desktop, I went to Menu &gt; Passwords &gt; Three Dots &gt; Remove all passwords, and they're gone. However, on my mobile phone, they're still there. So the sync functionality is borked. The question is, are the passwords still on Mozilla servers, or is just the sync to my mobile buggy? </p><p>Even if I were to delete my FF Sync account, for good measure I'd like to manually delete all passwords from it first though. </p><p>Any help welcome. </p>",firefox-1460;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;sync-failure;,firefox,sync-failure,en-US,1787196;,firefox2340

The vast majority of firefox users, many of whom transferred to get away from AI, would agree. What for, anyway? To name tab groups? How is that worth spiking the use of my CPU and power? I switched to firefox *years* ago for one reason: it runs much better than chrome and it was committed to privacy and such. I know there are options to turn off these and the other AI features but with the CEO's desire to make firefox a ""modern AI browser"" I fear it will only get worse. How long will it stay optional? I might as well leave now and get used to waterfox, before firefox becomes utterly enshittified and unusable. </p>",firefox-1460;windows-10;firefox;undefined;ai-feedback;,firefox,undefined,en-US,"",tequilasunset
