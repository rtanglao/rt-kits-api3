The vast majority of firefox users, many of whom transferred to get away from AI, would agree. What for, anyway? To name tab groups? How is that worth spiking the use of my CPU and power? I switched to firefox *years* ago for one reason: it runs much better than chrome and it was committed to privacy and such. I know there are options to turn off these and the other AI features but with the CEO's desire to make firefox a ""modern AI browser"" I fear it will only get worse. How long will it stay optional? I might as well leave now and get used to waterfox, before firefox becomes utterly enshittified and unusable. </p>",firefox-1460;windows-10;firefox;undefined;,firefox,undefined,en-US,"",tequilasunset

Firefox is my default browser.  </p><p>For quite some time now, whenvever I'm attempting to make an online purchase, once my payment information is entered, it just hangs, and either takes as much as 10 minutes for the purchase to go through, or it never goes through, it just keeps spinning. This is the case regardless of what website I'm ordering from, and regardless of what credit card i use. </p><p>When I switch browsers to Chrome (which i prefer not to do), it all works seamlessly and immediately. </p><p>My Firefox browser is up to date. My OS is a little out of date, deliberately, because of many reports that the current update can actually slow things down. But in spite of this, I have no trouble with anything except trying to make a purchase. </p><p>Can anyone help?
