I have used Firefox for years and have financially supported Mozilla in the past. For the time being, I am sticking with Firefox because the Al integrations can currently be turned off. I believe these options should be opt-in NOT opt -out. I feel loyal and dedicated to Mozilla's valves of privacy and a free-internet. But I will not think twice about jumping ship to another browser if Mozilla continues on this path of full-throated support and opt-out AI integration into Firefox. And I refuse to continue my financial support of the Mozilla foundation while this is the current direction of Mozilla leadership. I sincerely hope leadership will take the feedback of the community seriously and alter the current direction for the browser. </p>",firefox-1460;linux;firefox;undefined;,firefox,undefined,en-US,"",jessie.alexander78
