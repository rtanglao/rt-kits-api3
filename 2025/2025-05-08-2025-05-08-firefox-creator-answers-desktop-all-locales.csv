Once it did, Firefox was changed.  Some of the shortcuts on the windows were missing and I couldn't get them back with the command to ""Dismiss"" the substitutes.  More serious was my new inability to log onto any sites besides Mozilla's.  I have tried restarting the computer and turning off my router and turning it back on again.  All the while, my Android phone account is able to login to some of these sites without difficulty.  I need to diagnose this problem and fix it.

I search for an image, select the ""tools"" tab and I attempt to click on any of the options (like image size, for example). The tabs simply don't work. I opened Microsoft Edge and did the same exact thing and it worked. Guys, if Google doesn't work on this browser reliably - you guys are officially in last place for quality. I've cleared my cache, cleared cookies, FireFox is up-to-date, I restarted my PC. I shouldn't have to go through a hassle for something this *simple*. I used to love Mozilla, but y'all keep breaking things. Chrome is no issue, Edge is even faster now. What's the point of using this junk? YouTube pages have been freezing as well. Ima have to switch browsers and I'm definitely going to make sure no one I know sticks with FireFox. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",MadManAbraham
