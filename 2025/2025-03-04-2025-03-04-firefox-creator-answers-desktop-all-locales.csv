The default instant menu closure that happens when the mouse pointer strays a bit means that the user needs to be very slow and deliberate to be able to burrow down to the required folder (eg in Bookmark folders). This is a nightmare when burrowing down a couple of levels.  Having the menu tree stay open until the drag 'n drop or menu item selection is complete is much faster and more user friendly. </p>,firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",crossk

MacOS and Firefox are up to date.  When logging in to Firefox sync, I enter my email address and then password.  I'm then prompted to enter the code sent to my email.  I enter the code.  I'm then prompted to enter the MFA code from my authentication app.  I enter the code.  An error shows up that says unable to process.  I also deleted the Firefox app and the app data and reinstalled several times.  I've tried logging in via Private Browsing.  Nothing seems to work. I don't have any extensions installed or other applications or unnecessary processes running. </p><p>I have successfully logged into a MacBook Pro, a gaming PC desktop, an HP Windows 11 laptop, and a couple Linux devices and VMs...so I'm familiar with Firefox - been using it for forever.  This is the only computer I can't seem to log into.  Any suggestions for troubleshooting would be helpful.

Puzzled and eager to regain access to my password-protected accounts, I remembered logging into LinkedIn via Firefox just moments earlier. Obviously, Firefox had my passwords. I used MS Wallet to import my passwords from Firefox, back to my Microsoft Wallet. </p><p>But how did all my passwords end up in Firefox in the first place? Even if I imported them, does that mean the MS Wallet needs to be wiped? I'm extremely disappointed in Firefox. This is terrible programming. </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,1715945;,kaushik.vyas
