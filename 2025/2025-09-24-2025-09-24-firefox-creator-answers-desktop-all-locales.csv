Since the thumbnails don't shrink, the last windows opened disappear off the edge of the screen and I can't find a way to drag them back into view.  In the past if I opened too many thumbnails they used to shrink, then turn into a list.  I can't find anything in settings to fix this.  Please help. </p>",firefox-14301;firefox-1430;windows-11;firefox;browser-appearance;,firefox,browser-appearance,en-US,"",dshutchin
