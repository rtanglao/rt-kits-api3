Search tools did not yield what I was looking for. </p><p>TOPIC: Extended Support for Firefox 115 ESR </p><p>First, let me extend a hearty thank you to everyone on the Mozilla team and in the community that is continuing work on 115 ESR. This is helping a number of people that cannot upgrade for various reasons. </p><p>115 ESR is the last hope for many who are stuck on macOS 10.12-10.14 or Windows 7-8.1. While these systems are considered *very* out-of-date (users who are still on them are often chastised) they have a place. macOS for example, completely removed any and all support for 32-bit software as of macOS 10.15 (""Catalina""). I have encountered people with needs for 32-bit to run older apps and so they often keep a system running 10.14 (""Mojave""). </p><p>Now, can old 32-bit configurations be kept around and isolated offline? Yes. But for some out there who cannot afford to upgrade, or cannot be with out specific 32-bit software, they would be forced offline completely (assuming they follow best security practices, which many do not). I have personally deployed 115 ESR on a number of systems to help people in this situation. </p><p>For the time being, ESR 115 is permitting these users to stay online with some degree of security, at least where web browsing is concerned. </p><p>QUESTION: Besides active user count, what other factors are keeping 115 ESR in active security-only support mode? </p>",firefox-1430;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;esr;,firefox,esr,en-US,"",macguyver
