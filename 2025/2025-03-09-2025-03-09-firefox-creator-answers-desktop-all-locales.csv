I've set 'media.volume_scale' to 0.1 as a temporary fix, but adjusting it frequently is a hassle. I've tested this on my laptop with Linux Mint, and the issue is there as well. A user on Discord referred to this as intended behaviour, but I find it inconsistent and impractical for Firefox to be the only software that behaves this way and would like to change it. </p><p><a href=""https://imgur.com/a/rAFfHq6"" rel=""nofollow"">Here's an example.</a> </p>",firefox;settings;linux;linuxmint;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",freddiecarlsson
