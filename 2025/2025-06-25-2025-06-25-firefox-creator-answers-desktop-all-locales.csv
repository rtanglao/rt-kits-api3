I didn't lose bookmarks, but everything else was different.  So I left it that way. </p><p>Earlier today, Firefox wanted me to do another update.  I thought maybe by agreeing to that, things might return to normal.  Noooooooo.  It's no better whatever.

Every time I launch Firefox, the inspect element tab will open and close itself repeatedly for about 3-10 seconds, stop for a bit, and then start again. CPU usage by Firefox skyrockets whenever the glitch occurs. </p><p>I have tried Troubleshoot mode, I have tried a clean install, I have tried to refresh Firefox, all to no avail. This doesn't seem to have anything to do with a Firefox update, as the last update to my Firefox was well over a week prior to the start of this issue. </p><p>I am running several extensions: uMatrix uBlock DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials DecentralEyes PrivacyBadger BetterTTV Facebook Container Firefox Multi-Account Containers TTV Ad-block Wikipedia Context Menu Search Redirect AMP to HTML </p><p>However, none of these seem to be the cause of this issue as it persists in Troubleshoot mode and after a Firefox Refresh.  </p><p>The only reasonable lead I have regarding this issue is that the browser console spams the error messages as can be seen in the image attached to this post. A recurring element is ""server0.conn0.watcher2.process16"". I'm afraid I know only enough about coding to understand that this is probably the root of the issue, but am completely lost on how to fix it. </p><p>Another tidbit of information, whose relevance I doubt but am including nonetheless, is that I recently transferred my C:/ drive from an SSD to an NVMe. I'm wondering if perhaps the application is trying to call on a process stored on the other drive. I find this unlikely, as similarly to the point on the Firefox version this only started occurring a week or two after I transferred the drive over. </p><p>Any assistance on this matter would be greatly appreciated! </p>",windows-10;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1744600;,jesusthevelociraptor
