It looked like a popup with a button, if that helps. I then try to open it again, realizing that I've got <em>that</em> bug, the one that causes browsers to open for a split-second and then close immediately, so I try to fix it how I fixed Opera GX before I stopped using that. Restarting? Nothing.  Looking online for answers? Found some! I try starting it in Troubleshoot Mode, I can see down in my taskbar that Firefox is <em>trying</em> to open in Troubleshoot Mode but isn't. Okay, let's try something else, the Profile Manager. I use the Windows+R key to open the Run window and type in <strong>firefox.exe -p</strong> which according to aa couple of websites, -This one included- should have opened the profile manager in a popup, but all I get is a flash of a window and nothing else. Then, I finally try uninstalling and reinstalling the app, upon reinstallation it asks if I want to keep my settings and whatnot, I say yes, problem persists. I uninstall and reinstall <em>again</em>, only this time declining the ability to keep my settings, <strong>the problem persists.</strong> </p><p>I'm extremely confused as to why nothing is working, and I don't want to have to reinstall Windows itself like I saw a comment on Reddit recommend, so if anybody has a slight idea of a solution, I'd be grateful, thank you in advance. </p>",firefox;launch-failure;,firefox,launch-failure,en-US,"",silva.chariot27

For example, during regular usage, I usually open a great number of tabs. When I am done with browsing, I close them, by repeatedly clicking the cross button on the tabs. It used to be that the tab under the cursor would immediately close, then the next tab would slide under the cursor, and I would click again to close that one, etc. </p><p>But now, when clicking the cross button, the tab is not closed, and when I click again after a small delay (because of muscle memory), the tab is still there. This cause the two single clicks to be treated as a single double-click, which for some reason puts the window in full-screen mode (but only with the snap version; I'm not sure what's going on here). </p><p>When using CTRL+w when closing tabs, the delay is still there, but the inputs are correctly handled. If I press CTRL+w three times at the usual rate, I can see the three key presses, then nothing happens for a few instants, then the three tabs close at the same time (i.e. the delay is from input to tab close, not from tab close to other tab close). </p><p>This behaviour is completely absent on Firefox (also version 140) on my windows computer. </p><p>This delay does not appear when creating tabs, and it does not occur either when closing the window or when closing the last tab in the window (leading to an amusing situation where shutting down Firefox is actually faster then closing a tab). These operation keep going at their previous speed, immeasurably fast to the human eye. </p><p>Navigation does not appear to be meaningfully slower than before the update, and the CPU/memory usage is very reasonable. </p><p>Curiously, this appears to be a fixed delay. Closing an empty tab takes the same time as closing a very busy one. Closing a tab when there are five takes the same time as closing a tab when there are thirty. </p><p>This issue makes browsing feel incredibly sluggish. </p><p>Is there a solution for this problem&nbsp;? </p><p>Edit 1&nbsp;: I have tried to run Firefox in troubleshoot mode, but there was no difference in behaviour.

I left for most of the day and when I got home Firefox no longer worked at all.  Everything on my home page was gone and when I typed in websites - such as my e-mail program or Facebook, nothing ever came up.  I'm not super browser savvy, but I opened the menu and under help was ""trouble shooting mode"".  I didn't know what that was but figured nothing much more could go wrong with Firefox, so I chose that.  I had to rebuild the websites I had in a row on the middle of the page.  I didn't lose bookmarks, but everything else was different.  So I left it that way. </p><p>Earlier today, Firefox wanted me to do another update.  I thought maybe by agreeing to that, things might return to normal.  Noooooooo.  It's no better whatever.  Now I don't know how to get out of troubleshooting mode to know if anything will work normally again.   </p><p>I am seriously considering switching browsers, but I have a LOT of stuff bookmarked and that would be very intensive to build all those book marks in another browser. </p>",firefox-1400;firefox;app-responsiveness;,firefox,app-responsiveness,en-US,1744596;1744611;1744617;,clmcda63

Every time I launch Firefox, the inspect element tab will open and close itself repeatedly for about 3-10 seconds, stop for a bit, and then start again. CPU usage by Firefox skyrockets whenever the glitch occurs. </p><p>I have tried Troubleshoot mode, I have tried a clean install, I have tried to refresh Firefox, all to no avail. This doesn't seem to have anything to do with a Firefox update, as the last update to my Firefox was well over a week prior to the start of this issue. </p><p>I am running several extensions: uMatrix uBlock DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials DecentralEyes PrivacyBadger BetterTTV Facebook Container Firefox Multi-Account Containers TTV Ad-block Wikipedia Context Menu Search Redirect AMP to HTML </p><p>However, none of these seem to be the cause of this issue as it persists in Troubleshoot mode and after a Firefox Refresh.  </p><p>The only reasonable lead I have regarding this issue is that the browser console spams the error messages as can be seen in the image attached to this post. A recurring element is ""server0.conn0.watcher2.process16"". I'm afraid I know only enough about coding to understand that this is probably the root of the issue, but am completely lost on how to fix it. </p><p>Another tidbit of information, whose relevance I doubt but am including nonetheless, is that I recently transferred my C:/ drive from an SSD to an NVMe. I'm wondering if perhaps the application is trying to call on a process stored on the other drive. I find this unlikely, as similarly to the point on the Firefox version this only started occurring a week or two after I transferred the drive over. </p><p>Any assistance on this matter would be greatly appreciated! </p>",windows-10;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1744600;,jesusthevelociraptor
