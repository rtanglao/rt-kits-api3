I was under the impression that once I had the new computer I could just sign into my account and my synced data would be there. This is not the case, because I can't even get my bookmarks and what not back on the device that I originally signed out of. I'm pretty sure I am on the right account so why is everything gone even though it said that synced data will not be deleted? Am I cooked? Losing all my keys and bookmarks is going to suck so if anyone could help me, that would be much appreciated. </p>",firefox-1460;windows-10;firefox;sync-and-backup-confusion;,firefox,sync-and-backup-confusion,en-US,"",micahjrusso
