For example I type 's' and <a href=""http://speedtest.net"" rel=""nofollow"">speedtest.net</a> pops up. I'd like to type 'g' and get google like I used to. Now, instead, <a href=""http://global.americanesxpress.com"" rel=""nofollow"">global.americanesxpress.com</a> auto-populates and cannot be ""removed from history"". I have disabled anything with the word suggest. I've unchecked everything under Address Bar except Browsing History and nothing removes this offensive site from the url bar. So I disabled Browsing history and just type the full URL. Is there any way to remove this site or is it now a part of the browser itself? </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1712841;,yraegel
