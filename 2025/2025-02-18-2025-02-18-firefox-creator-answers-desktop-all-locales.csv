I tryied used cmd console and powershell to fix it, but nothing works fine. I run my antivirus, no more result. Tried to trash this file using external programs, same issue. Tryied to change the rights of that file, to reinstall completly FF, nothing seems to be useful. <em>Possible way to solve it </em>: I clean up my C: last week because I wanted more space and a better organization (moment from which that problem began).
