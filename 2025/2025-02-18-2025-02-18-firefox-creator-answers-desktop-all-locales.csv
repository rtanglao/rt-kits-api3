No amount of rebooting/restarting, closing browser, clearing caches, removing temp files, etc. appears to affect the issue. Turning off Enhanced Protection doesn't help. Issue is that I can dial a number, call connects, I can hang a call up, but the dial pad becomes unresponsive during the call. Using keyboard numbers vs. clicking the dial pad numbers makes no difference; no response either way. This happens with normal local calls, MS Teams calls from New York &amp; other places for work, all of them. But, again, seems to happen after noon/lunch time. Very odd. The latter was why I thought it was more than 1 tab open, system resources, temp files, RAM allocation, etc. Happens whether I have only Google Voice open in 1 tab, have multiple tabs running alongside it, doesn't seem to matter. </p><p>Very perplexed. I shifted away from Brave to use FF for Google Voice &amp; now the situation is reversed. Now, I can normally open Brave when this happens &amp; get a responsive dial pad in Google Voice.  </p><p>Using Windows 10 Professional, 64-bit on a big powerful workstation replacement category notebook. </p>",firefox;site-breakages;seg-bug-performance-issue;,firefox,site-breakages,en-US,"",doug135
