However, I am experiencing lot of problems with Firefox , including: -	Freezing pages -	Images are not fully displayed -	No internet connection at pick times -	Hanging on certain pages -	Delay opening various web pages  -	etc The above issues have become more prevalent recently forcing me to use Google Chrome.  I have now learnt that when FireFox goes down due to one of the above issues, I have to switch to Google Chrome for access to the relevant pages and generally the WWW. I have no option but to abandon the failing FireFox, if the failures continue. Thanks Harry Elm London </p>",firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",buizuse

This file was created time ago by myself (so its name does not matter much and it contains only a small empty branch). I can't delete it as far as I don't have the rights to do it. I tryied used cmd console and powershell to fix it, but nothing works fine. I run my antivirus, no more result. Tried to trash this file using external programs, same issue. Tryied to change the rights of that file, to reinstall completly FF, nothing seems to be useful. <em>Possible way to solve it </em>: I clean up my C: last week because I wanted more space and a better organization (moment from which that problem began). It is like Firefox was needing a file in the Windows tree and as he couldn't find it, he creates it because he need that this file exists.
