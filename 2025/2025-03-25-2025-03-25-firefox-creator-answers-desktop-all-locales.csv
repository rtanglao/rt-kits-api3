I am using Firefox browser Ver. 136.0.2 (64-bit). According to you (in the browser) and to internet information it is the latest/the current version. An example of such a refusal from a website is from the DB/Deutsche Bahn official website, dated 24-03-2025: See uploaded image. As with other websites, they recommend other browsers or ""the current version"" of Firefox (even though I already have it installed).  I then switch to Chrome  and continue working without further problems. I would like to use Firefox though, but apparently cannot. I need advice. What am I doing wrong? Why is my current version of Firefox described as outdated?

After i was done, i made sure i have signed out my Firefox account before leaving. The next day, when i used Firefox again on that pc, i noticed that all my saved passwords (from syncing my Firefox account) were still in that Firefox browser, even though i haven't signed in my Firefox account. Now i feel like i am at the mercy of fate because anybody who used that pc after me yesterday could have gained access to all my passwords. So far, nothing bad happens and i hope it stays that way. </p><p>I don't know if anyone has brought this up. Since Firefox does not erase any saved password after a user signs out, I think Firefox should, or rather, MUST give a warning message after a user signs out of Firefox to manually erase any saved password on Firefox, so that any stupid user like me will not make that stupid mistake so easily. </p>",windows-10;firefox-13602;firefox-1360;firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",tsudiyanto
