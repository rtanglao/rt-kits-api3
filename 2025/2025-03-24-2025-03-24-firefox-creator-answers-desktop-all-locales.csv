I use Chrome for work stuff. I use Firefox for personal stuff. I installed the new Firefox as I was supposed to, and it closed all my tabs. I usually have the option to restore my previous session, but not this time. So I started going back through my history (grrrrr....) and my history is full of all the sites/tabs I visited with Chrome. I DO NOT want work stuff mixing with my personal stuff. Besides the fact that it is making it harder for me to restore my lost tabs, there is a reason I have two different browsers. I wish Firebox weren't trying to change my organizational scheme. I DO NOT WANT FIREFOX TO IMPORT HISTORY OR BOOKMARKS FROM CHROME. How do I turn this off? </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",staceyffalls
