I have noticed in the last few months that some functions on some web sites are not able to be accessed. Such as submit, place an order, and the like.  I have to use another browser. Is there any reason for this as I really don't like to use any other browser other than Firefox but it seems to be that I have to. Is there some way that I can get around this? </p>",firefox;blocked-application-service-website;needsinfo;,firefox,blocked-application-service-website,en-US,1710612;,teeshcoulton
