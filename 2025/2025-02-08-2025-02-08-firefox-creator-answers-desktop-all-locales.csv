Mozilla Support has guidelines that must be followed to ensure content quality and relevance. If your article doesn't meet these standards or if it lacks sufficient detail, it may be rejected. Additionally, the community moderators prioritize existing contributors with experience, so new submitters may face difficulty getting their articles reviewed and published. Another challenge is ensuring your article addresses common issues that align with Mozilla's audience needs, making it hard to stand out among many other contributions. <a href=""https://cheetahlinkz.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Click here for further Knowledge</a> </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",iqbalkhan9450

On Re-installing Firefox I installed as a fresh install..... But when I open it, Firefox, all my recent sites are still there???

In the second installation i removed ALL passwords in Firefox. I then logged into Facebook on Chrome and made sure I do not have @FA in Facebook which I do not, so I'm really stymied.
