I have been having this issue recently with Firefox where, when I Google things and open up Google Images, I am unable to open any photos. No matter how many times I press on the mousepad, I cannot open up an image in Google Images unless I go to the website that image is linked too. Something else is that I cannot open an image in my Google Drive. I am resorted to download the file. I trouble started Firefox today to see if that would work, and it did, but I noticed this problems started up again. I just need some help or direction of what to do from here. </p>",firefox;browse;macos;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",udietz
