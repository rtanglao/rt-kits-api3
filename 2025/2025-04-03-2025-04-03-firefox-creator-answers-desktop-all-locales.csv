If I want to attach a file to my email, I click on the classic paper clip, it opens a windows dialog box to browse my files and folders. Up to now, if I did double-click on a shortcut (a .lnk file) it would follow the shortcut (like if it was a folder shortcut it would open the corresponding folder) for me to choose a file ... As of 137 it attaches the shortcut, and tries to attach the whole content of the folder&nbsp;! I tried the same operation on Chrome, it works ok. I tried the same operation on a different service on Firefox (Mattermost) I have the same problem, so my guess is that the problem is with Firefox 137. (this has been working properly for the last 10 years at least). And I made the test on MacOS, no problem, it's really with Firefox 137 on Windows. Anybody else seeing this&nbsp;? </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",pierrot2
