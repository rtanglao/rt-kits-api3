Up to now, if I did double-click on a shortcut (a .lnk file) it would follow the shortcut (like if it was a folder shortcut it would open the corresponding folder) for me to choose a file ... As of 137 it attaches the shortcut, and tries to attach the whole content of the folder&nbsp;! I tried the same operation on Chrome, it works ok. I tried the same operation on a different service on Firefox (Mattermost) I have the same problem, so my guess is that the problem is with Firefox 137.
