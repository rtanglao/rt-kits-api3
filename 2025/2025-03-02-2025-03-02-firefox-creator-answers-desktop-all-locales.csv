Is there a problem with an extension or security issue that would cause this?  Did an update cause this?  It's frustrating.  It's been happening to my husband on his desktop also.  It will tell us we're not connected but when I go the the router it shows connected.  I have to exit out of the browser and reload and everything is fine for about 30 minutes and then I have to exit and reload which requires me to sign in again.  Just wondering if an update caused this. </p>,windows-11;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",vgmiller100
