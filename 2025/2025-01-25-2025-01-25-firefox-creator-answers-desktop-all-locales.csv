Right now, I have it set up so only google and duckduckgo are available and show up as options in the firefox search bar. </p><p>However, when I am on a youtube page, suddenly the search bar has a little green plus circle on the magnifying glass in the search bar, and then offers to ""add search engine youtube"" to my search engines. </p><p>How can I stop this from happening? It only seems to happen when I am on the youtube page, and I have adjusted settings multiple times but it continues to appear. </p><p>Thank you very much for your help and guidance. </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",ailibaba40

This doesn't happen on YouTube, nor does it happen when I use other browsers like Edge. I'm on Windows 11, using the latest Firefox version, with Strict privacy settings and a reliable and simple adblock. Had the same setup on a previous Windows 10 laptop and did not have these issues. It's getting frustrating and is impacting my experience with this browser across multiple websites. I refuse to switch back to sketchy, predatory browsers like Chrome and Edge, so I hope this can be fixed, either on my end or on Mozilla's. Thanks! (Attached a screenshot of the visual glitches.) </p>",firefox-13402;firefox-1340;firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",artisticnerd93
