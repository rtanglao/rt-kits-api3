This doesn't happen on YouTube, nor does it happen when I use other browsers like Edge. I'm on Windows 11, using the latest Firefox version, with Strict privacy settings and a reliable and simple adblock. Had the same setup on a previous Windows 10 laptop and did not have these issues. It's getting frustrating and is impacting my experience with this browser across multiple websites. I refuse to switch back to sketchy, predatory browsers like Chrome and Edge, so I hope this can be fixed, either on my end or on Mozilla's. Thanks!
