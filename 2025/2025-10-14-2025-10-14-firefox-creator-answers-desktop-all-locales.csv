I started getting the Subject message: ""The bookmarks and history system will not be functional"" error message this evening.  I started to ""Fix"" this error based on the Mozilla Support page.  Actually, I first tried restarting my computer and that didn't correct the problem.  I then noticed I could ""sign off"" Firefox which I thought I'd do and sign back in.  I didn't notice until after the fact that my Firefox account was tied to a very old email address I once used that is no longer active ""commish3@bellsouth.net"".  When I tried signing back into Firefox using that old email account, it said a security code would be sent to that old email address.  Problem is I no longer have access to that email account.   </p><p>1)  Is there a way I can sign back in and have a security code sent to my current email address: tad3.dickinson@gmail.com&nbsp;? </p><p>2)  Can you assist with restoring my bookmarks.  Again, years of building these bookmarks that I'm very dependent on. </p><p>Thanks, Tad Dickinson </p>",firefox-1430;windows-10;firefox;recover-data;,firefox,recover-data,en-US,"",tad3.dickinson

While helping customers I saw that it was throwing error codes while restarting. After getting it fixed by power cycling the pc. When I would open Firefox it would start loading tabs but when I clicked on anything it would freeze then crash. I tried to power cycle the pc again to no avail. Everything else along with other browsers worked fine. I then uninstalled and reinstalled and it would get to the end of the install and would pop up with hmm for some reason, we could not install Firefox. I have updated all drivers along with windows and nothing has worked. The weird thing is that it makes a desktop short cut that I can open with a get started tab but when clicking on anything it freezes and crashes. I also uninstalled the old Firefox folder to make sure nothing was conflicting and it still doesn't work. </p>",windows-11;firefox;install-failure;,firefox,install-failure,en-US,"",cetchckelly
