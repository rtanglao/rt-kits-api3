I want it to back to Lght Mode.,"<p>Hello Firefox Representative, </p><p>I came across an issue that been bothering me and I am hoping somebody can help me with it, or at least give me viable options on how to resolve it. Recently on October 13, 2025 I open up my Firefox browser like I always have. But this time in particular my main Google search screen that have as my default is automatically set to dark mode. I did not make this change, I did not wanted this change, and I want to be able to resolve this issue. </p><p>The main issue is when I open my default Google search page and its in dark mode, but the moment I search up anything it automatically reverts back to my light mode that I always set it to. I just want my main Google search page to just be a plain white page. </p><p>And please before anybody here gives me any ""help"" please acknowledge what I have already done, before giving me generic answers. </p><p>I went into Firefox settings and have it set to Light Mode and I turn off Dark Mode. I went into the setting and turn off and on Graphic Acceleration to see if that does anything. I even went into the About:Config and selected 1 (which is force light mode). </p><p>Now the ""only"" thing that somewhat work and this is the strange part. When I clear my cookies, the main Google Search screen reverted back to the way it was. So I thought the problem was fix, but the moment I log into my Google Account it instantly reverse back to the Dark Mode. Somebody here is thinking I turn on my dark mode and have it set that way, but I have all the proof I set everything is set to light mode. Basically if I sign out of my Google Account, it magically goes back to the way it was. But I want to be log in, and that is the problem. Does anybody know where in the settings I can fix this, or am I doing something wrong, do I have a cookie somewhere that is doing this, do I have some unknown extension that is being activated that I am not aware of. </p><p>Any help you can provide for me will be appreciated. </p>",firefox-14304;firefox-1430;windows-10;firefox;browser-appearance;,firefox,browser-appearance,nl,1772004;1772006;,shadowvoid369

I started getting the Subject message: ""The bookmarks and history system will not be functional"" error message this evening.  I started to ""Fix"" this error based on the Mozilla Support page.  Actually, I first tried restarting my computer and that didn't correct the problem.  I then noticed I could ""sign off"" Firefox which I thought I'd do and sign back in.  I didn't notice until after the fact that my Firefox account was tied to a very old email address I once used that is no longer active ""commish3@bellsouth.net"".  When I tried signing back into Firefox using that old email account, it said a security code would be sent to that old email address.  Problem is I no longer have access to that email account.   </p><p>1)  Is there a way I can sign back in and have a security code sent to my current email address: tad3.dickinson@gmail.com&nbsp;? </p><p>2)  Can you assist with restoring my bookmarks.

When I would open Firefox it would start loading tabs but when I clicked on anything it would freeze then crash. I tried to power cycle the pc again to no avail. Everything else along with other browsers worked fine. I then uninstalled and reinstalled and it would get to the end of the install and would pop up with hmm for some reason, we could not install Firefox. I have updated all drivers along with windows and nothing has worked. The weird thing is that it makes a desktop short cut that I can open with a get started tab but when clicking on anything it freezes and crashes.
