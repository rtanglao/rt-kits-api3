While helping customers I saw that it was throwing error codes while restarting. After getting it fixed by power cycling the pc. When I would open Firefox it would start loading tabs but when I clicked on anything it would freeze then crash. I tried to power cycle the pc again to no avail. Everything else along with other browsers worked fine. I then uninstalled and reinstalled and it would get to the end of the install and would pop up with hmm for some reason, we could not install Firefox. I have updated all drivers along with windows and nothing has worked. The weird thing is that it makes a desktop short cut that I can open with a get started tab but when clicking on anything it freezes and crashes. I also uninstalled the old Firefox folder to make sure nothing was conflicting and it still doesn't work. </p>",windows-11;firefox;install-failure;,firefox,install-failure,en-US,"",cetchckelly
