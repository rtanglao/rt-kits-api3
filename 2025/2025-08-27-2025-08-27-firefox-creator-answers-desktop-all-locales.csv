I'm experiencing slow webpage opening (all webpages) with Firefox, and the problem persists after disabling the doh setting on Firefox as described on Firefox support. So I tried to change the doh settings on the OS (my OS is Windows 11, which supports doh settings on the OS), when I tried to use only the doh provider (alidns) in mainland China, Firefox could open web pages very fast, but after I added the doh provider (opendns) outside of mainland China. Firefox becomes very slow in loading web pages. This problem only occurs in firefox, not in chrome or edge (I currently use both alidns and opendns, alidns as first choice and opendns as backup).       So I would like to ask if Firefox has a logic that determines the priority of dns usage, prioritizing one of the dns providers when there are more than one at the same time. If so, can I change this logic. Because using dns services from other regions in mainland China will encounter problems such as very high network latency, packet loss, etc., I set up different regional dns providers at the same time as a backup, and I mainly use the mainland China dns provider.       My temporary solution for now is to actively enable doh service on firefox and customize alidns as the service provider. This gets Firefox working, but I think it adds complexity.       Best regards        someone </pre> <p>The above is machine translation, the original Chinese text is as follows </p><pre>      火狐支持团队，你好       我是中国大陆的火狐浏览器用户。我在使用火狐浏览器时遇到了网页打开缓慢的问题（所有网页），根据火狐支持上的描述关闭火狐上的doh设置后问题依旧。于是我尝试更改了操作系统上的doh设置（我的操作系统是Windows11，支持在操作系统上设置doh），当我尝试仅使用中国大陆的doh提供商（alidns）时，火狐可以很快的打开网页，但我加入中国大陆之外的doh提供商（opendns）后。火狐加载网页就会变得非常慢。这个问题仅在火狐浏览器出现，在chrome和edge上不会出现（我当前同时使用alidns和opendns，alidns作为首选，opendns作为备用）。       所以我想询问火狐浏览器是否有判断dns使用优先级的逻辑，在同时有多个dns提供商时优先使用其中某一个。如果有，我能否更改这个逻辑。因为在中国大陆使用其他地区的dns服务会遇到网络延迟很高、丢包等问题，我同时设置不同地区的dns提供商是为了备用，主要使用的是中国大陆的dns提供商。       目前我的临时解决办法是主动开启火狐上的doh服务，并自定义alidns为服务提供商。这样能使火狐正常工作，但我认为这样增加了复杂性。       谨致问候       someone </pre>",firefox-1420;windows-11;firefox;loading-speed;,firefox,loading-speed,en-US,"",someone
