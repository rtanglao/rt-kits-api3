It works with exiting trought shortcut or meniu, but it little annoying, I tried solutions provided in the treads but is there no way to revert back to just using X for exiting and have your previously closed tabs saved and restored upon opening app again?  </p><p>There was no updates installed or any other changes made to my pc today. So it is very strange why out of the blue its like this right now. </p><p>I tried:  1. Troubleshoot mode (did not work)   2.I tried exiting trought shortcut/meniu exit (worked but not prefered solution as it will be very easly forgotten for split second and all tabs open will reset)  3. Tried unchecking reseting firefox and checking the box again (did not work) </p><p>Lost at this stage as I really loved using Firefox. </p>",firefox-1460;windows-11;firefox;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",iceasxp
