And then when I tried to restore the theme back to the original it said, add-ons are disabled by safety, and I don't know what that means, and it's not explaining how to undo it. And now everything looks different and I'm not happy with it, and it's not really letting me add any other themes, and if I add them, they don't seem to fully load, the page still looks all white </p>",firefox-1430;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;themes;,firefox,themes,en-US,"",anne963

I've checked in the about:config section of firefox but I don't know which of these options is for this function, if it's even in here.
