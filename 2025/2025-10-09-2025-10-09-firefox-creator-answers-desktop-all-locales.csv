This never happened before and I'm not sure how to go about disabling whatever function this is. I've checked in the about:config section of firefox but I don't know which of these options is for this function, if it's even in here. Any advice or help would be appreciated! </p>",firefox-1430;windows-10;firefox;customization;,firefox,customization,en-US,"",itsmeyourduke
