When opening a new tab, the shortcuts and recently visited websites are also gone and no longer being collected. My CCleaner recently updated itself to a new version but I unchecked the delete history for Firefox (which treacherously is clicked by default - I fell into that trap before). Happy to blame the new CCleaner but that would not explain why history is not being collected now - to me the fault seems to lie with Firefox instead. Another possibility that went through my mind: Is Microsoft sabotaging users of Windows 11 to force them to buy new? PS: Under ""Privacy"", ""History"", the setting is ""Firefox will remember history"", as it always has been and should be. But it has forgotten all previous history and it is no longer collecting any new history either! </p>",firefox-14304;firefox-1430;windows-11;firefox;history;,firefox,history,en-US,"",w.preiser

And then when I tried to restore the theme back to the original it said, add-ons are disabled by safety, and I don't know what that means, and it's not explaining how to undo it. And now everything looks different and I'm not happy with it, and it's not really letting me add any other themes, and if I add them, they don't seem to fully load, the page still looks all white </p>",firefox-1430;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;themes;,firefox,themes,en-US,"",anne963
