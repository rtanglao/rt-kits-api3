While watching YouTube videos in Chrome or Edge, I occasionally see a brief (0.1 second) black-and-white glitch near the top of the screen — but only when the video quality changes (e.g., auto-switching or manual resolution change). It never happens during regular browsing or local video playback. I’m testing Firefox now and wondering: - Does Firefox handle video stream transitions differently than Chromium-based browsers? - Is hardware acceleration in Firefox less prone to triggering such micro-glitches? - Any recommended settings or flags to optimize video playback stability in Firefox? - I was hoping to see an option to turn of AV1 video codec (if possible) I’m not gaming or doing heavy rendering — just casual productivity and media use. And I have switched on the default performance settings from my firefox browser setting. Would love to know if Firefox is better suited for this kind of smooth, glitch-free experience. Thanks in advance! </p>",firefox-1440;windows-11;firefox;audio-and-video;,firefox,audio-and-video,en-US,"",gagandeep.mandal01
