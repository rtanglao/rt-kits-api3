I didn't open it, i uploaded it to VirusTotal which came out safe and then i instantly deleted it and ran a virus scan with Windows Security which also came out clean. i tried to recreate this by opening the same website again both on Firefox and other browsers like Zen(Firefox based) and Chrome but nothing happened. </p><p>is this a harmless bug or should i worry that it could be a virus that didnt get detected? </p>",firefox-1450;windows-11;firefox;browser-security;,firefox,browser-security,en-US,"",xyefuh
