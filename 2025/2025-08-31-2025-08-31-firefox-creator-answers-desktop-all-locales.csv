I use Firefox for iOS for a long time now and the latest version has the most annoying bug I have ever encountered on a browser: it erases all of my cookies. FF 142.0.1 on iOS 18 first did this last Friday, when the loading of a web page was slowed down because of a network issue. When it resumed, my connexion to the website’s session was lost because the cookie was gone too. But it not only erased this website’s cookie, it erased ALL of the cookies contained in FF. Which is fucking annoying. And it did it again ten minutes ago, without any reason. I would also like to mention that the browsing is quite slow and the app tends to freeze way faster than before. It’s not the first time FF upsets me because of bugs, but such a mismanagement of something as fundamental as a cookie is not acceptable and I would very much like this bug to get fixed quite promptly. Thank you for your attention. </p>",firefox;cookies-history;,firefox,cookies-history,en-US,"",gary.dagorn

Since I updated the tab groups still work, but now, sometimes, when I click on the tab group tab to close the group I see the title tab, one of the tabs included in the group, and a ""+2"" or however many tabs are hidden. This pretty much defeats the whole idea of having the tab groups in the first place, which to me, was to hide ALL THE TABS under ONE tab to clean up my work area.  </p><p>The image below shows an example. Note the ""eBay"" tab group is closed, and yet it shows the tab group tab (eBay), a tab in that group (eBay icon and ""Order"" with the X to close the tab), and then ""+2"" meaning there are two hidden tabs. In contrast, the ""Simple"" and ""Web Work"" tab groups are also closed and contain 4 and 9 tabs respectively, all neatly tucked under the one tag group tab for each group. </p><p>Why is this happening only on some tab groups, and only some of the time?
