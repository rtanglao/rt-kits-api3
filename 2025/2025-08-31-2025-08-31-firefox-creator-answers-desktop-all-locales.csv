The first thing I disabled was restoring tabs because I never need it/find it annoying. I noticed that every time I would restart my computer with Firefox open it would restore the session. I understand that this happens because Firefox sees it as a crash so I changed the following settings: </p> <ul><li> browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash from `true` to `false` </li><li> browser.sessionstore.max_windows_undo from `5` to `0` </li><li> browser.sessionstore.max_tabs_undo from `25` to `0` </li><li> browser.sessionstore.max_resumed_crashes from `1` to `0` </li></ul> <p>I changed those according to this guide: <a href=""https://kb.mozillazine.org/Session_Restore#Completely_disabling_session_store"" rel=""nofollow"">https://kb.mozillazine.org/Session_Restore#Completely_disabling_session_store</a> </p><p>Unfortunately any time I restart my computer with Firefox open it resumes my session. Is there any other way to turn this off? Theres no way all of these settings do nothing. </p><p>I also deleted the contents of sessionstore-backups in the profile folder but it just recreates the files after a while. </p><p>My goal is to be able to restart and shutdown with Firefox open and not have to worry about it restoring tabs. </p>",firefox-14201;firefox-1420;linux;firefox;customization;,firefox,customization,en-US,"",elcalzado
