Since I updated the tab groups still work, but now, sometimes, when I click on the tab group tab to close the group I see the title tab, one of the tabs included in the group, and a ""+2"" or however many tabs are hidden. This pretty much defeats the whole idea of having the tab groups in the first place, which to me, was to hide ALL THE TABS under ONE tab to clean up my work area.  </p><p>The image below shows an example. Note the ""eBay"" tab group is closed, and yet it shows the tab group tab (eBay), a tab in that group (eBay icon and ""Order"" with the X to close the tab), and then ""+2"" meaning there are two hidden tabs. In contrast, the ""Simple"" and ""Web Work"" tab groups are also closed and contain 4 and 9 tabs respectively, all neatly tucked under the one tag group tab for each group. </p><p>Why is this happening only on some tab groups, and only some of the time? How can I stop this from happening? </p>",windows-11;firefox;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1760983;1761060;,fleasales.help

I understand that this happens because Firefox sees it as a crash so I changed the following settings: </p> <ul><li> browser.sessionstore.resume_from_crash from `true` to `false` </li><li> browser.sessionstore.max_windows_undo from `5` to `0` </li><li> browser.sessionstore.max_tabs_undo from `25` to `0` </li><li> browser.sessionstore.max_resumed_crashes from `1` to `0` </li></ul> <p>I changed those according to this guide: <a href=""https://kb.mozillazine.org/Session_Restore#Completely_disabling_session_store"" rel=""nofollow"">https://kb.mozillazine.org/Session_Restore#Completely_disabling_session_store</a> </p><p>Unfortunately any time I restart my computer with Firefox open it resumes my session. Is there any other way to turn this off? Theres no way all of these settings do nothing. </p><p>I also deleted the contents of sessionstore-backups in the profile folder but it just recreates the files after a while. </p><p>My goal is to be able to restart and shutdown with Firefox open and not have to worry about it restoring tabs. </p>",firefox-14201;firefox-1420;linux;firefox;customization;,firefox,customization,en-US,"",elcalzado
