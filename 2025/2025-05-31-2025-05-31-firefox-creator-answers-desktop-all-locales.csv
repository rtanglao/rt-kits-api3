It was updated mid march 2025 (when mozilla surely knew they were shutting down pocket) and ironically it recommends for more articles to visit pocket. </p><p>1) this FAQ really needs to be updated to reflect pocket ceasing </p><p>2) it could reflect what is happening with the ""thought-provoking stories"" feature within firefox browser </p><p><br> </p><p><strong>My questions:</strong> </p><p>1) will the ""thought provoking stories"" feature aka curated articles of interest continue in firefox in any capacity after pocket ceases? </p><p>i don't know given i believe they're sourced from pocket. </p><p>EDIT: i've just discovered about ""pocket hits"" (or ""ten tabs"" as reportedly it's being renamed to) email newsletter. I knew nothing about this. Might the content / curated articles replace those from pocket on the new tab page? </p><p><br> 2) if not, can people suggest alternatives to pocket's curated articles (i'm less fussed about saving the articles because i've seen many recommendations on that)? </p><p><br> </p><p>thanks, </p><p>Gary </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1738175;,gazzawazza

Never seen this before. Closed it down and it seemed to have no issues shutting down at least.  I haven't had Firefox crash in recent months, so I'm assuming that this cropping up might be a glitch of some kind? I looked this up to see if anyone else had this issue, and it seems someone on Reddit did encounter this, on Linux, and another on Windows also seems to have run into it. How do we stop this from coming up whenever we start up the browser? </p>",windows-10;firefox-13901;firefox-1390;firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,1738070;,Marc7

After the restart, my bookmarks have all disappeared.  The instructions to restore them are useless.  I go through Menu/Bookmarks/Manage Bookmarks/Import and Backup/Restore/Choose File.
