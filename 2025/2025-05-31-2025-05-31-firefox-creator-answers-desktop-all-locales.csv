Never seen this before. Closed it down and it seemed to have no issues shutting down at least.  I haven't had Firefox crash in recent months, so I'm assuming that this cropping up might be a glitch of some kind? I looked this up to see if anyone else had this issue, and it seems someone on Reddit did encounter this, on Linux, and another on Windows also seems to have run into it. How do we stop this from coming up whenever we start up the browser? </p>",windows-10;firefox-13901;firefox-1390;firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,1738070;,Marc7
