After the restart, my bookmarks have all disappeared.  The instructions to restore them are useless.  I go through Menu/Bookmarks/Manage Bookmarks/Import and Backup/Restore/Choose File.  THERE ARE NO FILES TO CHOOSE FROM.  According to the instructions, there should be some dated entries.  Nada. </p><p>I tried the Troubleshooting blahblah and that was equally useless. </p><p>I'm panicking that I've lost years of carefully organized bookmarks. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",mwhite139

One thing happening now is that some websites take forever to load in, and others won't load at all. With other sites there's no problem. I have a fiber optic connection. The speed test indicates that all is good. I did reboot recently.  </p><p>I'm wondering if some sites are using advanced scripts that my older machine doesn't like, or perhaps recent updates from Firefox just don't work as well on this machine. Any suggestions?? </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",rop_nga
