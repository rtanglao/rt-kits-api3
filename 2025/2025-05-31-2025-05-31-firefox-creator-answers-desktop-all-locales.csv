Never seen this before. Closed it down and it seemed to have no issues shutting down at least.  I haven't had Firefox crash in recent months, so I'm assuming that this cropping up might be a glitch of some kind? I looked this up to see if anyone else had this issue, and it seems someone on Reddit did encounter this, on Linux, and another on Windows also seems to have run into it. How do we stop this from coming up whenever we start up the browser? </p>",windows-10;firefox-13901;firefox-1390;firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",Marc7

After the restart, my bookmarks have all disappeared.  The instructions to restore them are useless.  I go through Menu/Bookmarks/Manage Bookmarks/Import and Backup/Restore/Choose File.  THERE ARE NO FILES TO CHOOSE FROM.  According to the instructions, there should be some dated entries.  Nada. </p><p>I tried the Troubleshooting blahblah and that was equally useless. </p><p>I'm panicking that I've lost years of carefully organized bookmarks. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,1738017;1738027;,mwhite139

One thing happening now is that some websites take forever to load in, and others won't load at all. With other sites there's no problem. I have a fiber optic connection. The speed test indicates that all is good. I did reboot recently.  </p><p>I'm wondering if some sites are using advanced scripts that my older machine doesn't like, or perhaps recent updates from Firefox just don't work as well on this machine. Any suggestions?? </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",rop_nga
