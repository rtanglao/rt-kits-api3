I am a web developer reaching out for assistance with a puzzling performance issue that appears to be unique to the Firefox browser. </p><p>I have implemented a fairly standard modern layout technique on my website, [ <a href=""https://chipotlmenu.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chipotlmenu.com/</a> ], utilizing complex CSS Grid and subgrid definitions, along with will-change properties for minor animations. </p><p>While the site loads and runs smoothly on all Chromium-based browsers and Safari, I have observed a dramatic and consistent drop in frame rate, often leading to temporary freezing, specifically in Firefox (latest desktop version) when interacting with the main navigation area. </p><p>The issue seems to be tied to how Firefox is handling the repainting or compositing of the elements nested within the CSS Grid structure. Disabling the will-change properties does alleviate the issue, but this compromises the intended user experience. </p><p>I would be incredibly grateful if members of the community, particularly those with expertise in Firefox's rendering engine (Gecko) or CSS performance profiling, could visit the site and help diagnose the specific bottleneck. </p><p>To reproduce the issue: </p><p>Access the <a href=""https://chipotlmenu.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">website</a>, using the latest stable version of Firefox. </p><p>Navigate the main menu or hover over the interactive components on the homepage. </p><p>Check the Firefox Performance Profiler (via DevTools) to see if you can isolate the specific layout/rendering task consuming the most time. </p><p>Any insights into whether this is a known Gecko behavior, a bug, or an optimization I'm missing would be extremely helpful. </p><p>Thank you for your valuable time and expertise. </p><p>Best regards, </p><p>Shahzain shahzainsajid12@gmail.com </p>",seg-spam;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",shahzainsajid12

I have not changed anything in my firewall or antivirus and have used them for years with Firefox. I refreshed and nothing. I actually uninstalled Firefox, cleaned out the registry entries, and installed 143.0.3 today. And yes, I did set it to not auto-update. Still misbehaving. I don't know if I missed a reg key that might be the culprit. I'm currently using Chrome Canary - although it's not my favorite, it is working normally on the same sites I've tried with Firefox. I even opened Edge for the first time in ages - it's working fine as well! I love Firefox, but I don't know what to do at this point!
