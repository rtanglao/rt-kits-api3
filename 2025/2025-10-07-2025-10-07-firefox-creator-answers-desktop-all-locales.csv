I have not changed anything in my firewall or antivirus and have used them for years with Firefox. I refreshed and nothing. I actually uninstalled Firefox, cleaned out the registry entries, and installed 143.0.3 today. And yes, I did set it to not auto-update. Still misbehaving. I don't know if I missed a reg key that might be the culprit. I'm currently using Chrome Canary - although it's not my favorite, it is working normally on the same sites I've tried with Firefox. I even opened Edge for the first time in ages - it's working fine as well! I love Firefox, but I don't know what to do at this point!
