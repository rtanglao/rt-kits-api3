Since a Mozilla upgrade earlier this year, I have been unable to create a reply to certain posts made by folks I follow on Threads social media. It occurs about 20% of the time, intermittently yet consistently. When I seek to create a reply, the response window opens with a restricted field that does not allow me to enter any text. Please see the attached screen shot. It's just a box with no cursor. The restriction has never occurred when I'm on Edge or Chrome, only on Firefox. But I prefer Firefox. I am a senior who uses an IBM-clone desktop running Windows10 (contemplating Win11, but that's another story). I use standard Mozilla security settings for browser privacy. Firefox browser is current. I have attempted shutting down all ad blockers in isolation and in combinations attempting to rectify with no results. I am guessing I possibly have some setting out of whack, but I have no clue what this is called or how to fix this. Not a major issue but a continual annoyance and a puzzlement. Am I the only person who has this problem? Is it a Threads issue perhaps? (their help is non-existent). However the issue does not occur when I use Threads on my Android phone, and it has never occurred on Bluesky, Reddit, Facebook, YouTube or any other platform I access. Can anyone help figure this out please? Thank you! Regards, Lorraine the Inkenheimer Lorraine@inkenheimer.com </p>",windows-10;firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",Lorraine4
