It used to be somewhat instinctive to use in comparison to the current version. That's about 20 years ago. It now seems to have a minuscule amount of instinctual usability.  My question / statement is where is the Tutorial. Like many products including Microsoft, make what they think are brilliant ""improvements,"" and what they primarily do is cause confusion, frustration, greater difficulty in using the product and for many a wish they fervently pray for: ""I I want my old thingamajg back."" </p><pre>I hadn't used Thunderbird since February of 2024 - LAST YEAR. Currently it is unrecognizable from then. I had  been hospitalized with 3 stents, a pacemaker and heart valve, I'm back functioning and love life. However - It would have been simple to make a dozen short tutorials on enough things to easily do the basics. Pleading for donations and not making it simpler to use the product doesn't attract new users &amp; make current users happier. I would be grateful if anyone can point me to some simple tutorial. In my opinion what Thunderbird offers is too cryptic for me to process, I hope my post is noticed by a ""Solver"" Don't misunderstand me. I liked using Thunderbird for these many years because it was incredibly flexible, usable, and partially simple &amp; instinctive. Today few people have the will or time to spend hours poring through help sheets that are a challenge and confusing to use. </pre> <p>Would appreciate your help. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1726396;,Cyborg119

Since a Mozilla upgrade earlier this year, I have been unable to create a reply to certain posts made by folks I follow on Threads social media. It occurs about 20% of the time, intermittently yet consistently. When I seek to create a reply, the response window opens with a restricted field that does not allow me to enter any text. Please see the attached screen shot. It's just a box with no cursor. The restriction has never occurred when I'm on Edge or Chrome, only on Firefox. But I prefer Firefox. I am a senior who uses an IBM-clone desktop running Windows10 (contemplating Win11, but that's another story). I use standard Mozilla security settings for browser privacy. Firefox browser is current. I have attempted shutting down all ad blockers in isolation and in combinations attempting to rectify with no results. I am guessing I possibly have some setting out of whack, but I have no clue what this is called or how to fix this. Not a major issue but a continual annoyance and a puzzlement. Am I the only person who has this problem? Is it a Threads issue perhaps? (their help is non-existent). However the issue does not occur when I use Threads on my Android phone, and it has never occurred on Bluesky, Reddit, Facebook, YouTube or any other platform I access. Can anyone help figure this out please? Thank you! Regards, Lorraine the Inkenheimer Lorraine@inkenheimer.com </p>",windows-10;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",Lorraine4
