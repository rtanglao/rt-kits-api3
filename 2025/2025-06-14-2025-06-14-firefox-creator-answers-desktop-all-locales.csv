I didn't and don't trust an extension like this with my browsing data. So I was concerned today when I pulled up a Firefox window on my desktop PC (same Firefox account) and a second tab opened up automatically with the Uninstall Survey for this extension. I filled that out yesterday when I uninstalled the extension. I checked, and the extension has been uninstalled--it no longer appears on my extensions list on any device. I assume that it's just that this is the first time I've opened Firefox on the same account on a different device, and Firefox is somehow repeating the prompt to open the survey tab. But I've never had this happen before and I don't love that it's a tracking extension that did it. Do I have anything to be concerned about here? Or is this a normal fluke of Firefox accounts on multiple devices and not the fault of this extension? </p>",firefox;extensions;,firefox,extensions,en-US,"",mhatlen12

If not, I would like to suggest that it be seriously considered. I realize that some people could take this kind of capability to the extreme, with hundreds of tabs organized using multiple ""sub-tiers"" &amp; trying to develop something to support the extreme cases would be a nightmare.

I have each of these email accounts bookmarked on my Firefox page. It used to be all I had to do was click on the bookmarked tab and the email account opened immediately. But, lately, each of these three accounts requires a sign-in before it will open my email account. One even requires a two-step process requiring I list a different email to receive a code to open the current email account I'm trying to open. This is a recent occurence and I wondered if it was something Firefox included in their more recent version of Firefox? If so, please tell me how to get rid of this sign-in process!  I have many security processes to protect my accounts and do not need this additional required sign-in process! Please tell me how I can get rid of this requirement. It is a pain to have to re-sign-in each time I try to access my email which I do several times a day.  Thank you for any help you can give me to fix this problem.
