I wanted to know how to turn my Firefox Tools icons back from just having icons at the bottom to the list of icons with their names like before. I've attached both images, one from another computer running an older version of nightly which is what I want to return back to. </p><p>If there isn't a way to change it back, I would like to suggest this as an option to be able to easily turn back to a list type. </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",mooshyrocks

I have each of these email accounts bookmarked on my Firefox page. It used to be all I had to do was click on the bookmarked tab and the email account opened immediately. But, lately, each of these three accounts requires a sign-in before it will open my email account. One even requires a two-step process requiring I list a different email to receive a code to open the current email account I'm trying to open. This is a recent occurence and I wondered if it was something Firefox included in their more recent version of Firefox? If so, please tell me how to get rid of this sign-in process!  I have many security processes to protect my accounts and do not need this additional required sign-in process! Please tell me how I can get rid of this requirement. It is a pain to have to re-sign-in each time I try to access my email which I do several times a day.  Thank you for any help you can give me to fix this problem.
