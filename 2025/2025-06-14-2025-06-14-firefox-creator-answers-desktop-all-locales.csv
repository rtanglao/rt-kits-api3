I have each of these email accounts bookmarked on my Firefox page. It used to be all I had to do was click on the bookmarked tab and the email account opened immediately. But, lately, each of these three accounts requires a sign-in before it will open my email account. One even requires a two-step process requiring I list a different email to receive a code to open the current email account I'm trying to open. This is a recent occurence and I wondered if it was something Firefox included in their more recent version of Firefox? If so, please tell me how to get rid of this sign-in process!  I have many security processes to protect my accounts and do not need this additional required sign-in process! Please tell me how I can get rid of this requirement. It is a pain to have to re-sign-in each time I try to access my email which I do several times a day.  Thank you for any help you can give me to fix this problem.
