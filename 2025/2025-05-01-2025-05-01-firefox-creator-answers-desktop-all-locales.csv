This is affecting my fullscreen viewing experience. </p><p>Before updating to version 138.0.1, the Windows taskbar would hide correctly when entering fullscreen video. </p><p>I was wondering if anyone else has encountered a similar issue with the Windows taskbar not hiding, or if there are any suggested solutions to help resolve this problem. </p><p>Thank you for your help! </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1729539;,krave

I recently installed Firefox Developer to do my website work on, mostly so I could shut down regular FF when FB calls my name too persistently. haha </p><p>I discovered yesterday when working on a client's site that FF Dev and FF Regular render some CSS differently. I have CSS that will thicken a border line around an image when you hover over it. It's done using a combination of padding-width and border-width. </p><p>In FF Dev it's fine and in other browsers it's also fine (Edge, Chrome), but in FF Reg it jumps. I've tried fiddling with the CSS but if I get it so that it works in FF Reg, it's messed up and jumpy in FF Dev. So it seems the two FFs render CSS differently, which seems very odd. Wouldn't they use the same rendering engine? </p><p>Is there a way to get around this? It's really frustrating because most visitors will be using FF Reg if they use FF at all. </p><p>You can see the effect when you hover over the intro images in the Featured and Suggested Article sections on the Home page of my <a href=""https://www.uraniatrust.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">client's site</a>. </p><p>Many thanks in advance for the help. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",forums7381
