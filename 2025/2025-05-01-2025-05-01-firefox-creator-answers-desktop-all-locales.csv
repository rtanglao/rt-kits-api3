However when I click on any video it does the same thing as the included picture, however I can play the video, but I cannot click on anything. This only happens on Firefox, any other browser and I have no issue. I have also disabled my plugins and it does the same thing. I have tried multiple different suggestions from your help page and other solutions on the internet. If I could have some insight would be extremely welcomed, thank you and have a wonderful week. </p>",firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,1729349;1729360;,epsorks
