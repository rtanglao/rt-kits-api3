I thought it was an issue with the formatting of the images (PNG, JPG), but this happens with every single image, no matter what, including GIFs. It also glitches the images on certain sites, but I don't know why. I tried all the troubleshooting suggestions I found, but it is not a problem with my extensions, my antivirus, or my VPN. I also cleared the cache and restarted the browser.  </p><p>I attached some images so you can see how the corrupted image looks. This does not happen with the same files on Firefox for Android or iOS, just on my desktop browser.  </p><p>Basically:  - I download an image, which can be outside of Firefox, and the image displays perfectly everywhere. - When I try uploading the image to edit online or to simply set it as a profile picture, it corrupts and shows a bunch of colorful lines.  - Nothing I have done has solved this issue, and I'm starting to get sad&nbsp;:( </p><p>Sorry if this has been asked before, and thank you. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",carolinabm.com

However when I click on any video it does the same thing as the included picture, however I can play the video, but I cannot click on anything. This only happens on Firefox, any other browser and I have no issue. I have also disabled my plugins and it does the same thing. I have tried multiple different suggestions from your help page and other solutions on the internet. If I could have some insight would be extremely welcomed, thank you and have a wonderful week. </p>",firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,1729349;1729360;,epsorks
