The bookmarks sidebar has disappeared and can't be brought back in its previous form.  Selecting <em>Bookmarks toolbar - always show'</em> does nothing. There is no 'Back' arrow to return to a previous screen. I'm finding this new version almost impossible to use.  Have I done something wrong? Can I go back to the previous version of Firefox?

I need to restore them. </p><p>I went into the profile folder, but there was no session store file. Inside the backup sub folder i saw two large files, ""previous.jsonlz4"" and ""restore.jsonlz4"", and made a copy of both and placed them inside a new sub folder that I made, inside that profile folder. </p><p>An expert from the ""Tech Support Guy"" website (""Nader"") told me, to open ""about:support"" and there to use the ""Refresh"" feature.  I did this, but no tabs were restored. So I went into the profile folder again, just to see that it had disappeared and been replaced by a new profile folder! And therefore my two copies of the PREVIOS and RESTORE json files were gone, too, as they were inside a sub folder within that disappeared profile folder!  </p><p>Now I need to know, URGENTLY, how to restore that folder and the files and sub folders within that profile folder. Thanks! </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",SvenLittkowski

I reloaded an exported HTML and no problems.   About a month ago Several groups of bookmarks disappeared over several days. A folder with say 20 bookmarks in would now have only 5. then none a day or two later. this happened across ALL but one of the default bookmark files and ones I created. I also noticed Firefox was not creating backup bookmark files so I removed Firefox, reloaded Firefox so everything was up to date and in the new I reloaded the older bookmarks HTML in the new installation.    Now it is happening again as of the 16th of May 2024 only this time Again no backup bookmark file are being created and Firefox is not creating manual backup file or HTLM Exports. 2)  I have gone though the Troubleshooting instructions and I am at a loss on what the issue is. I have used Firefox since the early 2000s and have never had this issue before but in the past year it has happen 3 times. 3) UNRELATED ISSUE - MAYBE- I found on the setting page at the top IS THIS NOTE -- Information Your browser is being managed by your organization.-- This is a personal computer.
