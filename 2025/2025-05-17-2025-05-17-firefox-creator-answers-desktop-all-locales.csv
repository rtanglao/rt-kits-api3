I am a lawyer and i keep a TON of tabs open at the same time. I might be working on a case, and I can create all the tabs related to that case together, come back to it a day or more later. </p><p>I also open up a zillion news articles every day. Some are fun (Fun Articles Group), some are about our declining society (Rule of Law Group), some are about AI (AI Articles To Save), some are Case Law I save for my internal library (Case Law to Save Group).   </p><p>The problem I am having is that each of the Windows where these various tabs are kept is are not seen by the Tab Names.  So, if I go to my pinned Taskbar icons across the bottom of my screen, and toggle across the Firefox icon, the many different labels that pop up are ONLY the tab names.  </p><p>That is, there is nothing reflecting the Group name to which the tab belongs.  I just spent all this time grouping my tabs together in separate windows, and when I want to go quickly to one of those Windows (each Window has a Separate Group Name in my personal system), I cannot tell which one is which.   </p><p>So, my recommendation is that Mozilla designate in the taskbar prompted tab items which Group each tab belongs to (if it is assigned to a Group).  It would make toggling between the tabs sooooooo much easier and efficient. </p><p>Additionally, I love that when I assign a new item/tab to a Group, it automatically groups them with the other members/tabs in the Group.  However, after a certain point, it gets ridiculous. Perhaps there can be an option where you can separate the Groups into two or more Windows (eg Group named Case Law to Save, if I have 10 different ones open, put the 11th one in a new Window, instead of just adding another tab to the ever-burgeoning Window full of tabs). </p><p>Maybe I am the only idiot who has so many tabs open that these issues are a problem. But the mere fact that Mozilla created the organizational tool of Groups suggests to me that I am not the only one who keeps a lot of tabs open at the same time. </p><p>I have no idea how to suggest this improvement to them. I am not a coder. I cannot contribute in this way. </p><p>Thanks to those who contribute to the improvement of this product!
