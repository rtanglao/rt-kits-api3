I reloaded an exported HTML and no problems.   About a month ago Several groups of bookmarks disappeared over several days. A folder with say 20 bookmarks in would now have only 5. then none a day or two later. this happened across ALL but one of the default bookmark files and ones I created. I also noticed Firefox was not creating backup bookmark files so I removed Firefox, reloaded Firefox so everything was up to date and in the new I reloaded the older bookmarks HTML in the new installation.    Now it is happening again as of the 16th of May 2024 only this time Again no backup bookmark file are being created and Firefox is not creating manual backup file or HTLM Exports. 2)  I have gone though the Troubleshooting instructions and I am at a loss on what the issue is. I have used Firefox since the early 2000s and have never had this issue before but in the past year it has happen 3 times. 3) UNRELATED ISSUE - MAYBE- I found on the setting page at the top IS THIS NOTE -- Information Your browser is being managed by your organization.-- This is a personal computer.
