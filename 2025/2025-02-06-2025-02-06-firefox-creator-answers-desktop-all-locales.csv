I have had copies of Thunderbird both on my Windows 11 desktop and on my Windows 11 laptop.  When I am at home I use the desktop and when I travel I use the laptop.  When I leave home I copy the entire Profile directory from Appdata /Roaming  directory to the Laptop and then reverse when I return home. Last week I returned home and no matter what I tried I couldn't get the Desktop to use the Profile transferred from the Laptop.  It poped up a message that the version was wrong.  Upon checking the Thunderbird version on the Laptop I saw it was newer than Desktop.   So I uninstalled Thunderbird and reinstalled only to find out that downloaded version was still behind the Laptop.  So today I finally was able to install the newest version on the Desktop but now I get the popup titled Profile missing with the following message ""Your Thunderbird profile cannot be loaded. It may be missing or inaccessible."" </p><p>Any help appreciated getting Thunderbird working on my Desktop. </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",gbechthold

Since then my blog WP will not open and the browser freezes on many sites and will not even fill out, takes forever to access some links.. interestingly the links from  Greece and France both work much better than more local ones.  I did a full system restore and was able to access some sites as noted but I need to access all my data on EQ and Volcanoes and Solar activity since I post 2x a day and being located with the home office in N CA you know how important this information is to be prepared.  So I have been using Windows 7 and Word 3 and doing fine till the last update.  I thought doing a restore point to January would fix it but it didn't when my husband passed I lost my computer guru he built computers so he knew about all this stuff. Its been hard to keep this one going. But so far I am able to use my laptop Toshiba for Windows 7 . Thank you, any help will be appreciated.   WP is the most important link that I can't access anymore. Just leaves a blank page. The N CA USGS is another one that does not work properly.  </p><p>PS: the laptop is fine since I switched over to Chrome temporarily till I can fix this problem Chrome is working well.  But I want Firefox and I understand you do not support Windows less than 8.1  But it was fine till the last update and I was always taught to go back to the last time it worked. </p><p>Charlotte King </p><p><a href=""http://www.thecharlottekingeffect.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.thecharlottekingeffect.com</a> </p>",firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",charking
