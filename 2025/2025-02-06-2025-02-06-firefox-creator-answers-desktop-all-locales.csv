I am still not happy how Firefox is working since the last update. </p><p>i have to use Windows 7 due to special circumstances and everything was fine till the last automatic update a few days ago. Since then my blog WP will not open and the browser freezes on many sites and will not even fill out, takes forever to access some links.. interestingly the links from  Greece and France both work much better than more local ones.  I did a full system restore and was able to access some sites as noted but I need to access all my data on EQ and Volcanoes and Solar activity since I post 2x a day and being located with the home office in N CA you know how important this information is to be prepared.  So I have been using Windows 7 and Word 3 and doing fine till the last update.  I thought doing a restore point to January would fix it but it didn't when my husband passed I lost my computer guru he built computers so he knew about all this stuff. Its been hard to keep this one going. But so far I am able to use my laptop Toshiba for Windows 7 . Thank you, any help will be appreciated.   WP is the most important link that I can't access anymore. Just leaves a blank page. The N CA USGS is another one that does not work properly. the laptop is fine since I switched over to Chrome temporarily till I can fix this problem Chrome is working well.  But I want Firefox and I understand you do not support Windows less than 8.1  But it was fine till the last update and I was always taught to go back to the last time it worked. </p><p><br> </p><p>Charlotte King </p><p><a href=""http://www.thecharlottekingeffect.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.thecharlottekingeffect.com</a> </p>",firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",charking
