It worked absolutely fine when I was using it before 7-8 months earlier. Even the ""Firefox 99.0.dmg"" absolutely works fine but it feels laggy because it is older (this is not an issue).  But when I download the latest Firefox from the Firefox site, it just keeps on loading the taskflow infinitely and taskflow does not get loaded.  </p><p>Steps to replicate: 1. Create a account using <a href=""https://dm-us.informaticacloud.com/identity-service/home"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dm-us.informaticacloud.com/identity-service/home</a> 2. Create a new taskflow (<a href=""https://docs.informatica.com/integration-cloud/data-integration/current-version/taskflows/taskflows/creating-a-taskflow.html"" rel=""nofollow"">steps</a>) 3. It will keeps on loading. </p><p>However, when I use edge, chrome, brave, it works fine. Not sure what is blocking the taskflow to load.
