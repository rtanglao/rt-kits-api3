It allows me to generate background noise generators to cover-up the distracting noises from my neighbours when working at home on my desktop computer. The audio on the website worked the last time I opened Firefox ~2 July ... but today, when I opened the browser, the audio no longer works. I cannot get the website audio to load at all - I added the website to additional exception lists &amp; shut down some content blocking extensions, but no joy. The website was already listed in multiple exception lists &amp; I do not know or understand what change(s) occurred with the browser that would prevent this site from properly functioning - since it literally worked a week ago. I would appreciate any assistance and/or guidance with this issue, otherwise I will be eliminating Firefox as one of my browser options. I have provided a screenshot of the site that shows the perpetual ""now loading"" screen.
