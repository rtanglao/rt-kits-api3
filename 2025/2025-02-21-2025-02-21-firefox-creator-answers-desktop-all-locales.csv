I have already troubleshot this issue with NordPass and they are passing it off as a Firefox problem.  </p><p>Issue:  When logging into the NordPass browser extension, my username and password are accepted, then Cloudflare does a human verification, then the extension throws error 1004 (Something went wrong) [screenshot of error attached].  </p><p>Troubleshooting:  - Tried updating Firefox to latest version - Tried clearing cache/cookies - Tried uninstalling/reinstalling browser extension - Tried uninstalling/reinstalling firefox </p><p>Additional:  - Dell Optiplex 7090 running Windows 10 Pro - Issue is specific to this computer only - Extension was working as recently as 2 weeks ago - Currently, NordPass allows me to sign in successfully on my phone, in Chrome browser extension on affected computer, and in Firefox browser extension on different computer. </p><p>Latest answer from NordPass team: [Please note that our developers have investigated provided logs and traces, however, there is nothing wrong with the backend flow - it looks like there is an issue with localStorage or cookies as the NordPass extension is not able to fetch properly the token obtained from NordAccount login flow. As this is not reproducible on other platforms and traces do not show anything else, we can only suggest the verification of extension/firefox browser configuration, especially in terms of cookies, local storage and session.] </p><p>Any suggestions on root cause, or settings changes to fix this issue are appreciated. </p>",firefox-13501;firefox-1350;firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",jaredpberger

My last work around no longer works less than a month later.,"<p>This is from a reply I posted to one of the many others who are having this problem. They couldn't get the bookmarks to restore. It would say unable to process. </p><p>"" I'm not technical so I apologize for my response. Maybe someone can make it more user friendly.  </p><p>This is like the 4th time this has happened to me in the last year. Just long enough for me to forget what I did to get them back, but I think it has been different every time. Last time I think it just randomly processed after many attempts. I should probably try saving them myself. They aren't actually gone. I was able to remember some of the pages I bookmarked and when I went to those pages via the browser the little blue bookmark star was there and when I click on it the folder(now missing) I had it in was named. I just didn't have access to the list of folders. I also couldn't make new bookmarks. </p><p>Now this time I had already tried a PC restart and refreshing Firefox so I'm not sure that they are required steps.  I opened Old Firefox Data folder. This was already on my desktop from previous issues I believe. The names of the folders inside are jumbled. I opened the one with the most recent date. Then opened the Bookmarkbackups folder.  I selected the file with the most recent date (also the largest file because I'm terrible at deleting the old ones). I was asked what to open the file with, I double clicked on Firefox and a browser page opened and a window asked if I wanted to open with (application) or save the file. I chose to save the file. This process took a few minutes and locked windows up for a bit but when it was done my bookmarks were back. I am able to make new bookmarks as well but you'll have to search for where you want to save it instead of their being a drop down of the most recent folders. </p><p>I hope this works for you. </p><p>Just want to add that every time this has happened to me I was using Youtube. Now I've used Youtube a lot without this happening but every time it did happen I was there. &lt;/blockquote&gt; </p><p>This NO LONGER WORKS. Not even a month later! </p><p>Apparently refreshing FireFox is required to see the latest bookmarkbackups file. However instead of saving to FireFox it now is a download to FireFox. So if I try to open the download it just goes back to the source and is a circular death loop that accomplishes nothing. Honestly seems kind of intentional at this point. </p><p>I did manually back up my book marks before this happened again for the 5th time now. However, when I tried to import them FireFox tells me the folder is empty. If I open the folder myself I see the long list of my bookmarks with corresponding links. </p><p>Like I said, I'm not technical, so I have no interest in continually finding a way to get the bookmarks to display again. </p><p>I've gone elsewhere. When I imported my book marks from FireFox most of them were there but some of the sub/sub folders were missing. So instead of their being 20 sub/sub folders theirs just a list of the hundreds maybe thousands of bookmarks that were in them. I have no interest in trying to reorganize that.  </p><p>So I tried importing the manual back up I made that Firefox said was empty. That imported successfully and it appears all my book marks to the date I created the back up are there.  </p><p>So FireFox get your %&amp;$* together!
