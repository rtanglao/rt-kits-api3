My last work around no longer works less than a month later.,"<p>This is from a reply I posted to one of the many others who are having this problem. They couldn't get the bookmarks to restore. It would say unable to process. </p><p>"" I'm not technical so I apologize for my response. Maybe someone can make it more user friendly.  </p><p>This is like the 4th time this has happened to me in the last year. Just long enough for me to forget what I did to get them back, but I think it has been different every time. Last time I think it just randomly processed after many attempts. I should probably try saving them myself. They aren't actually gone. I was able to remember some of the pages I bookmarked and when I went to those pages via the browser the little blue bookmark star was there and when I click on it the folder(now missing) I had it in was named. I just didn't have access to the list of folders. I also couldn't make new bookmarks. </p><p>Now this time I had already tried a PC restart and refreshing Firefox so I'm not sure that they are required steps.  I opened Old Firefox Data folder. This was already on my desktop from previous issues I believe. The names of the folders inside are jumbled. I opened the one with the most recent date. Then opened the Bookmarkbackups folder.  I selected the file with the most recent date (also the largest file because I'm terrible at deleting the old ones). I was asked what to open the file with, I double clicked on Firefox and a browser page opened and a window asked if I wanted to open with (application) or save the file. I chose to save the file. This process took a few minutes and locked windows up for a bit but when it was done my bookmarks were back. I am able to make new bookmarks as well but you'll have to search for where you want to save it instead of their being a drop down of the most recent folders. </p><p>I hope this works for you. </p><p>Just want to add that every time this has happened to me I was using Youtube. Now I've used Youtube a lot without this happening but every time it did happen I was there. &lt;/blockquote&gt; </p><p>This NO LONGER WORKS. Not even a month later! </p><p>Apparently refreshing FireFox is required to see the latest bookmarkbackups file. However instead of saving to FireFox it now is a download to FireFox. So if I try to open the download it just goes back to the source and is a circular death loop that accomplishes nothing. Honestly seems kind of intentional at this point. </p><p>I did manually back up my book marks before this happened again for the 5th time now. However, when I tried to import them FireFox tells me the folder is empty. If I open the folder myself I see the long list of my bookmarks with corresponding links. </p><p>Like I said, I'm not technical, so I have no interest in continually finding a way to get the bookmarks to display again. </p><p>I've gone elsewhere. When I imported my book marks from FireFox most of them were there but some of the sub/sub folders were missing. So instead of their being 20 sub/sub folders theirs just a list of the hundreds maybe thousands of bookmarks that were in them. I have no interest in trying to reorganize that.  </p><p>So I tried importing the manual back up I made that Firefox said was empty. That imported successfully and it appears all my book marks to the date I created the back up are there.  </p><p>So FireFox get your %&amp;$* together!
