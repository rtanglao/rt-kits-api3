I have used Firefox as my primary browser for 10 years. If I reboot the computer this solves the problem, but I am not going to do this every day. All the other browsers work.

No other changes to the SW or machine. This computer works great every day. Fully up to date with Microsoft. The ""upgrade"" that I did not ask for, lost my license and switched me to the ""free version of CCleaner. I uninstalled it and started over from CCleaner website. Worked fine with old version. It upgraded itself again and now Firefox is dead. Microsoft Edge does open. I never use this.

I don't seem to have any trouble on other browsers (currently on Microsoft Edge to post this), and it only seems to be on my home laptop. </p><p>I don't get an error message or anything like that.  It just takes its sweet time loading any links or URL's.  Sometimes, the tab or page acts like it's buffering.  Sometimes, the address bar doesn't even show that I've typed in a URL after I've hit Enter.  Most of the time, I just have a blank white screen. </p><p>I have tried refreshing Firefox, I tried restarting my device once or twice, I've put Firefox in Troubleshoot Mode more times than I can count at this point.  I've even un-installed and re-installed Firefox twice now in the last few days.  Nothing seems to solve the issue. </p>",windows-11;firefox;loading-speed;,firefox,loading-speed,en-US,"",jasonmadrid
