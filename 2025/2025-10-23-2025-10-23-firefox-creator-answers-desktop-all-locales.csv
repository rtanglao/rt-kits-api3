My job requires the use of multiple websites throughout the day and the extension used to stay open until I closed it. There are options in the extension to set it to not close until I log out. Right now, it is set that way, but continues to log off after 15 minutes. Here's what I've done so far to try to solve this problem. 1. Uninstalled and reinstalled the Last Pass extension. 2. Cleared all data from Firefox. This was recommended by Last Pass when I contacted them. 3. I uninstalled Firefox on my laptop. When I reinstalled it, it automatically recognized that I had previously used it and it zipped through the setup. Maybe still held on to the old settings? </p><p>Firefox and Last Pass are on the latest versions. I'm using Windows 11.

Fortunately, I made a copy of the old Firefox data folder from my previous installation and saved it on a secondary drive. However, I’ve encountered an issue — the copied data appears to be encrypted, and Firefox is now treating me as a new user. As a result, I’m unable to access my previous bookmarks, browsing history, and other saved information. Could you please advise me on how to recover and decrypt this data, and how to transfer it to my current Firefox profile or sync it with my Mozilla Firefox account?
