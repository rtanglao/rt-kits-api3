I've had them and the program open for days, with my conputer turned on and off multiple times with no issues. </p><p>Today I booted a game I installed yesterday on my computer and played for a few hours, after closing the game, both my Firefox windows became completely inaccessible. </p><p>I've tried closing firefox, restarting my computer, letting Firefox create a new xulstore file and nothing has worked. I can't see the window, I can't make it active. It's permanently minimised. </p><p>It spikes Desktops Windows Manager to 100% GPU usage, it makes my PC lag and run slow, and I can't do anything in the browser cause the window won't stay open or up. I can't even open the old window and then a new one, it stays minimised and I can only see the preview by hovering my mouse over it. </p><p>I've tried GPU driver updates, I tried anti virus scanning, and I've tried opening another browser which did work. But Firefox is the one with all my saved settings and preferred browser. I also can't see the Firefox window at all when using the window key + TAB to check my desktop, but it does show up on Task Manager as running. </p><p>Please help me restore my program.
