At first I thought it was just a bug, but after I closed and restarted Firefox, it was still disabled, installing various other ad blocking extensions was thwarted by Firefox. I tried other approaches, including installing from github and from third party extension library; all are unsuccessful. Apparently, Firefox do not allow Chinese users to use ad blocking extensions, and they went to great lengths to stop them. You hateful racist scums! Firefox was once very popular, but now its share of the browser market shrink to almost 0%. I see why now, I hope Firefox die a quick demise, and nobody remembers it thereafter. </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",lionheartwon

For instance, Chrome and Edge typically complete their review within two hours, whereas Firefox takes considerably longer. </p><p>When issues arise with our extension, we need to release an updated version as soon as possible. Sometimes, these situations are urgent, and the prolonged review time makes it difficult to provide users with the latest fixes and improvements promptly. This delay negatively impacts the user experience. </p><p>We kindly request that you consider optimizing the review process to help developers deliver timely updates and ensure a smoother experience for Firefox users. </p><p>Thank you for your time and support. We appreciate your efforts in maintaining the Firefox ecosystem. </p><p>Best regards, Coupert Development Team </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,1720244;1720253;,service205
