At first I thought it was just a bug, but after I closed and restarted Firefox, it was still disabled, installing various other ad blocking extensions was thwarted by Firefox claiming these extensions are corrupt! I tried other approaches, including installing from github and from third party extension library; all are stopped by Firefox. I checked Firefox update, it claims that the latest version I can upgrade to is v127 (I'm using v126), so I think it's not due to Firefox not up to date. I spent a lot of time figuring these out, most pointing to Firefox banning Chinese users from using ad blocking extensions.  After all these frustrations, I updated Firefox to v127, thinking updating to the latest version won't hurt, and these extensions are still disabled, installing ad blocking extension is still not successful. But somehow I checked whether I'm using the latest version, and BAM, I can now upgrade to v136. After the update, all these problems were solved. IF ONLY Firefox can provide some useful info of why my extension is now disabled, and why installing extensions are not successful, it would save me a lot of time and trouble. You dumb lazy people! </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,1720278;1720283;,lionheartwon

For instance, Chrome and Edge typically complete their review within two hours, whereas Firefox takes considerably longer. </p><p>When issues arise with our extension, we need to release an updated version as soon as possible. Sometimes, these situations are urgent, and the prolonged review time makes it difficult to provide users with the latest fixes and improvements promptly. This delay negatively impacts the user experience. </p><p>We kindly request that you consider optimizing the review process to help developers deliver timely updates and ensure a smoother experience for Firefox users. </p><p>Thank you for your time and support.
