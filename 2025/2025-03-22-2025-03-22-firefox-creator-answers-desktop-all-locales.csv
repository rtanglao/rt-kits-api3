I realize tab groups are oddly new for FF, but I'm trying to get setup and running into two main issues. 1. I cant seem to freely reorder the tab groups, I can move the individual book pages no problem but not the groups as a whole. I would expect to be able to left hold click drag the order of the groups just like individual tabs. 2. Tab groups don't seem to exist across clients (or maybe I'm missing the how). If I open FF on my mac I would expect to see or at least be able to reopen the same tab groups as my windows PC, not just the individual pages from history on other device. Is there a way to do this? 3. can't import tab groups from edge?

I appreciate the innovative solutions introduced in your products, so I would like to propose adding a new functionality to the browser's home page. I propose implementing the option of displaying news directly on the home page. Users could easily select news categories that interest them, which would allow for better personalization of the presented content. What's more, it would be possible to set the refresh rate of the displayed news - for example, every 3, 5 minutes or at any selected time intervals. </p><p>I am convinced that such a feature would significantly increase the usability of the browser and could attract more users who expect quick and personalized information on a daily basis. </p><p>Thank you for your time and for considering my proposal.

At first I thought it was just a bug, but after I closed and restarted Firefox, it was still disabled, installing various other ad blocking extensions was thwarted by Firefox claiming these extensions are corrupt! I tried other approaches, including installing from github and from third party extension library; all are stopped by Firefox. I checked Firefox update, it claims that the latest version I can upgrade to is v127 (I'm using v126), so I think it's not due to Firefox not up to date. I spent a lot of time figuring these out, most pointing to Firefox banning Chinese users from using ad blocking extensions.  After all these frustrations, I updated Firefox to v127, thinking updating to the latest version won't hurt, and these extensions are still disabled, installing ad blocking extension is still not successful. But somehow I checked whether I'm using the latest version, and BAM, I can now upgrade to v136. After the update, all these problems were solved. IF ONLY Firefox can provide some useful info of why my extension is now disabled, and why installing extensions are not successful, it would save me a lot of time and trouble.

Sometimes, these situations are urgent, and the prolonged review time makes it difficult to provide users with the latest fixes and improvements promptly. This delay negatively impacts the user experience. </p><p>We kindly request that you consider optimizing the review process to help developers deliver timely updates and ensure a smoother experience for Firefox users. </p><p>Thank you for your time and support.
