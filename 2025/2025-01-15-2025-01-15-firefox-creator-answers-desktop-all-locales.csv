They give you a choice of ""<a href=""http://Login.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">Login.gov</a>"" I forgot the other, both telling you that you have to set up a 2nd type of authentication that it's you. So I purchased and installed a fingerprint scanner. I love it. I created an acct with <a href=""http://login.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">login.gov</a>. After logging in the next step is the fingerprint.
