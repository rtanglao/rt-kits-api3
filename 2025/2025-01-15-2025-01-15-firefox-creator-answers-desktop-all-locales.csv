I have tried various ways on pages of what I think is Mozilla and nothing. Where can I find information about version 115.19.0esr? Or has your browser in my unit been taken over by a malware type situation and I am in danger? </p><p>BTW, when I clicked on the ""What's New"" link I saw nothing about that ""New"" version I am being asked to update to. Oh yes, I am constantly seeing that 'Please Update' window, too. </p><p>So if this is a true version from your company/orghanization, where is the information about it? </p><p>Just in case you wish to know, I do have about ten screenshots of all that I have been running into as I have tried to find information about 115.19.0esr. And if you are going to inform me that you don't support Windows 7 so you aren't showing any information about an update your browser keeps asking me to update to, I am going to send a letter to some regulator and explain that somebody is not doing there job properly. If you keep nagging me to update, then you should be informing as to why! </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,1703629;,V-Michael

I turned 65 this year so I had to sign up for medicare. You have to go to the Social Security web site to sign up for medicare. I've had an acct with SS for a long time. When you log in it, it now gives you a choice. It tells you the normal log in ""My SS"" will eventually be stopped. They give you a choice of ""<a href=""http://Login.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">Login.gov</a>"" I forgot the other, both telling you that you have to set up a 2nd type of authentication that it's you. So I purchased and installed a fingerprint scanner. I love it. I created an acct with <a href=""http://login.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">login.gov</a>. After logging in the next step is the fingerprint. You click on it the color things start swirling around trying to pick up the scanner but this box at the same time appears over it preventing login from seeing it. It says ""this is a request from firefox"" I've been using Turbotax for a year or two. Last week I logged into my acct with them and right away it popped up it see's the scanner and let me sign in with the fingerprinrt. So I know it works, and other sites do see it. Please Help! I'm not very technical with this stuff. Is it from Firefox or is it my PC? Attached is a pic of what I get trying to log in. You can zoom in on it. </p>",windows-10;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",mhelm2359
