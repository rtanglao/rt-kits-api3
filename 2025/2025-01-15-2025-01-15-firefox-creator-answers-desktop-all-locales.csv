This behavior clutters my Downloads folder with randomly named files I only need to view briefly. </p><p>I have already checked and adjusted the download settings, but the problem persists. Is there a way to revert to the old behavior where files are opened in a Temp folder and not saved permanently to the Downloads folder? </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",raul.mariano

I turned 65 this year so I had to sign up for medicare. You have to go to the Social Security web site to sign up for medicare. I've had an acct with SS for a long time. When you log in it, it now gives you a choice. It tells you the normal log in ""My SS"" will eventually be stopped. They give you a choice of ""<a href=""http://Login.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">Login.gov</a>"" I forgot the other, both telling you that you have to set up a 2nd type of authentication that it's you. So I purchased and installed a fingerprint scanner. I love it. I created an acct with <a href=""http://login.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">login.gov</a>. After logging in the next step is the fingerprint. You click on it the color things start swirling around trying to pick up the scanner but this box at the same time appears over it preventing login from seeing it. It says ""this is a request from firefox"" I've been using Turbotax for a year or two. Last week I logged into my acct with them and right away it popped up it see's the scanner and let me sign in with the fingerprinrt. So I know it works, and other sites do see it. Please Help! I'm not very technical with this stuff. Is it from Firefox or is it my PC? Attached is a pic of what I get trying to log in.
