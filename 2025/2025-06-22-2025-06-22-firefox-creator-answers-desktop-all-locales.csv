I got a message that the warranty was expired... I went to the Epson support site on Firefox and Malwarebytes blocked the site as malware... It said I could add the site as approved, but I don't know how to do that. ""<a href=""https://www.epsoncom.com/my-account/home"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.epsoncom.com/my-account/home</a>"". The Epson site said I already had an account but my password was incorrect. I had an Epson printer more than ten years ago; I don't remember the password and they don't provide an option to reset it.
