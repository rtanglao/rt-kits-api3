It concerns YouTube videos ""autoplay""ing on YouTube. Many have asked this question and most responses state to shut off Autoplay. These are two separate issues. AotuPlay means the next video on YouTube will advnace automatically requiring no user input. If Autoplay is off, streaming stops at the end of the video. The issue I am having is when I open a YouTube video to a new tab (but do not switch to that tab), the video WILL start playing as soon as that tab is in focus. This never used to happen and indeed, on two other computers with the settings and extensions all sync'ed, this doesn't happen, except for on this one computer. Today I found someone that posted the exact same problem 5 years ago and didn't get an answer. He seems to describe it well: </p> <ol><li> <em>Okay, so before, when I loaded up 100+ Youtube videos, they stayed when switching tabs - no autoplay. Suddenly they decide to autoplay when switching tabs - note, I've not done anything to my settings or plugins. Fair enough, maybe you changed something (which you often do, without informing). So I check the options. It was on ""Block audio"", which obviously didn't work, so I tried ""Block Audio and Video"" - which WORKS, but now both the video is paused (which I want) AND the audio is set to mute (which I DON'T want) - so... what does it take to have Youtube wait for a click to start playing a video loaded in a background tab, but KEEP AUDIO ACTIVE, so I don't also have to unmute the damn video?</em> </li></ol> <p>One person posted a possible solution: <em>Maybe check this pref on the about:config page. </em> </p><pre>   media.block-autoplay-until-in-foreground <em> </em> </pre> <p>This setting describes the issue kind of. If you have this set to false, the moment you send a link to a new tab, YouTube starts playing in the background. Setting it to false keeps the video paused until that tab is in focus. That is how mine has always been set. What I am looking for is a setting that would say something like: ""block autoplay until play is pressed"" </p><p>Thanks in advance and sorry for being so long-winded </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",majbach68

Earlier today, after the same procedure there were 315 bytes of data! So Firefox is not clearing data as it used to. I use Norton AntiVirus and Nord VPN and have just done a disc clean-up but there is still the same problem when they are turned off.

The screen goes white and then returns and it happens again if you leave the cursor over the short. After a few of these, the message comes up that the GPU (nvidia in this case) acceleration has blocked access to firefox. This will happen every time. The issue doesn't occur in chrome. The issue doesn't occur if firefox is started in troubleshoot mode. If I run in regular mode and manually disable my one extension (keeper) and the two plugins - widevine codec and cisco openh264 codec, the issue will still occur. I have no other add-ins. I have updated firefox and the nvidia drivers to the most current. The gpu is nvidia geforce 940mx with intel hd graphics 620. I am running 64bit windows 10 home on an hp envy laptop with i7 chip.
