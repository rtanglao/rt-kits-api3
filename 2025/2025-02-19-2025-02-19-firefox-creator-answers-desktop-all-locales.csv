I need simple terms to stop my pages from jumping behind what ever that stupid thing is that hides them.

The screen goes white and then returns and it happens again if you leave the cursor over the short. After a few of these, the message comes up that the GPU (nvidia in this case) acceleration has blocked access to firefox. This will happen every time. The issue doesn't occur in chrome. The issue doesn't occur if firefox is started in troubleshoot mode. If I run in regular mode and manually disable my one extension (keeper) and the two plugins - widevine codec and cisco openh264 codec, the issue will still occur. I have no other add-ins. I have updated firefox and the nvidia drivers to the most current. The gpu is nvidia geforce 940mx with intel hd graphics 620. I am running 64bit windows 10 home on an hp envy laptop with i7 chip. Any ideas? Thanks. </p>",windows-10;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",niteowl01
