This never used to happen before. Why is this? For example, just before sending this message it stated 0 bytes. When closing and opening F. again there were 76 bytes. Earlier today, after the same procedure there were 315 bytes of data! So Firefox is not clearing data as it used to. I use Norton AntiVirus and Nord VPN and have just done a disc clean-up but there is still the same problem when they are turned off. Where is this data coming from if I am not using any programs, the internet, nothing; only opening Firefox? Please advise as I suspect there may be hackers sniffing around my computer.  I have changed the Browser Privacy to Strict. </p><p>Nord VPN also has a security option like Firefox. Is it okay to keep both on simultaneously or will they conflict? What is the best option out of the two if you recommend using only one? </p><p>I look forward to your assistance. </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>BA </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",razzamatazz819

The issue doesn't occur if firefox is started in troubleshoot mode. If I run in regular mode and manually disable my one extension (keeper) and the two plugins - widevine codec and cisco openh264 codec, the issue will still occur. I have no other add-ins.
