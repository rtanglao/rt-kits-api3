Earlier today, after the same procedure there were 315 bytes of data! So Firefox is not clearing data as it used to. I use Norton AntiVirus and Nord VPN and have just done a disc clean-up but there is still the same problem when they are turned off. Where is this data coming from if I am not using any programs, the internet, nothing; only opening Firefox? Please advise as I suspect there may be hackers sniffing around my computer.  I have changed the Browser Privacy to Strict. </p><p>Nord VPN also has a security option like Firefox. Is it okay to keep both on simultaneously or will they conflict?
