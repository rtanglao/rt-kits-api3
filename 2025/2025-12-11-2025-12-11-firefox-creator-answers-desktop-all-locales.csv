My Win7_64 water cooled platform is overclocked, stable, and just as fast as most affordable new chipsets from Intel. I have third party security apps and firewall. I'm not downgrading to Windows X whatever later version that is and I'm considering other browser options, if anybody has ideas? </p><p>Although I'm on the ESR channel, I've been using User Agent Switcher for a while, which seems to work well on most sites. I also notice DuckDuckgo browser claims to support Win 7.  I will miss Firefox, but switching to a Win7 supported browser would be my first option, then Linux if I have to dump Windows 7 for something else. </p><p>Developers will moan and say switch to Win X with the favorite phrase 'Upgrade' when my experience has been the opposite, but what do others feel who are using older versions of Windows? </p>",firefox-115310;firefox-11531_1;windows-7;esr;,firefox,esr,en-US,"",Jimbo100
