The main symptoms are my mouse goes spastic and my X Windows session goes rogue. </p><p>I was running an old version of firefox and updated to 142.0.1, I think, and that started all my problems. Successive updates to  </p><pre>       firefox-144.0.2.tar.xz,        firefox-145.0.2.tar.xz, and        firefox-145.0.tar.xz </pre> <p>have not solved the problems. </p><p>I have it change the number of work spaces in my panel workspace switcher, ""roll up"" any number of my windows, even those hidden, cause the buttons on the panel to not be responsive to clicks so I cannot log out, cause the mouse to jam up against the top of the screen and get stuck there, like the mouse is disconnected. </p><p>Other times it's like the keyboard is disconnected. I cannot type anything anywhere, especially in the terminal windows I have open where I can get focus on the terminal window, but the insertion point cursor is shadowed out like the window does not have focus. When this occurs, I can still close programs by clicking with the mouse on the ""close"" box in the upper-right corner of windows. </p><p>At this point, I can type ctrl-alt-F2 and get to an alternate console and log on as root. I have tried selectively killing processes, but the only thing this accomplishes is stopping my X session and leaving a black console screen. The only ways I have found to get back an X session logon is by executing ""shutdown -h now"" or ""init 1"" followed by ""init 5"". </p><p>Yesterday, after cold booting my Linux computer and logging on with only two terminal windows running, I started OpenOffice's spreadsheet program and my mouse pointer disappeared. I had to switch to a text console and restart my computer -- certainly something I never had to do before updating firefox. </p><p>I am running: </p><pre>           libxfce4ui-4.12.1-3.el7.x86_64          libxfce4util-4.12.1-2.el7.x86_64        xfce4-settings-4.12.1-1.el7.x86_64 xfce4-session-engines-4.12.1-8.el7.x86_64           xfce4-panel-4.12.1-4.el7.x86_64 </pre> <p>xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin-0.2.5-2.el7.x86_64 </p><pre>             xfce-polkit-0.2-8.el7.x86_64       xfce4-terminal-0.8.7.4-2.el7.x86_64         xfce4-session-4.12.1-8.el7.x86_64       xfce4-appfinder-4.12.0-4.el7.x86_64    xfce4-power-manager-1.6.0-2.el7.x86_64 </pre> <p>on: </p><pre>     CentOS 7 with the 3.10.0-1160.119.1.el7.x86_64 kernel </pre> <p>It appears I will have to reload my operating system and start over. I do know CentOS 7 is EOL and have been thinking about changing to Rocky Linux. I was happywith Red Hat Linux 5.11 and Gnome 2, which is what a secondary computer is running and have even thought of getting Gnome 2 sources and compiling them under a new version of the OS. </p><p>Any other suggestions to stop the wierd behavior to get a little more time out of my existing installation? </p><p>Thank you, </p><p><br> Craig </p><p>P.S. I am submitting this on a Windows 10 laptop since I now cannot trust my main computer. </p>",firefox-1450;windows-10;firefox;update;,firefox,update,en-US,"",CWM50

My Win7_64 water cooled platform is overclocked, stable, and just as fast as most affordable new chipsets from Intel. I have third party security apps and firewall. I'm not downgrading to Windows X whatever later version that is and I'm considering other browser options, if anybody has ideas? </p><p>Although I'm on the ESR channel, I've been using User Agent Switcher for a while, which seems to work well on most sites. I also notice DuckDuckgo browser claims to support Win 7.  I will miss Firefox, but switching to a Win7 supported browser would be my first option, then Linux if I have to dump Windows 7 for something else. </p><p>Developers will moan and say switch to Win X with the favorite phrase 'Upgrade' when my experience has been the opposite, but what do others feel who are using older versions of Windows? </p>",firefox-115310;firefox-11531_1;windows-7;esr;,firefox,esr,en-US,1785206;1785207;,Jimbo100
