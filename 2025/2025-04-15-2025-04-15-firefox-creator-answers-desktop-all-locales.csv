1506248,2025-04-15 14:26:55 -0700,2025-04-15 14:26:55 -0700,Question About AccuWeather,"<p>Hi all, </p><p>I’m a longtime Mozilla supporter, and I really value the organization’s commitment to openness, transparency, and user-first principles. That’s why I was surprised to see that Mozilla continues to partner with AccuWeather, and I wanted to open a respectful conversation about it. </p><p>AccuWeather’s CEO, Barry Myers, has a long and well-documented history of lobbying for the privatization of weather data. Under his leadership, AccuWeather pushed for legislation like the National Weather Service Duties Act, which would have prevented the National Weather Service (NWS) from offering public forecasts if private companies like AccuWeather were already doing so. Critics including meteorologists and open-data advocates warned that this would effectively limit public access to life-saving weather information. </p><p>Myers was later nominated to head NOAA during the Trump administration, despite his deep ties to AccuWeather and multiple ethics concerns. To make matters worse, in the present day, we’re seeing reports that NOAA is being actively dismantled from within—through budget cuts, leadership changes, and political pressure that favor privatization. These efforts echo the same ideology AccuWeather has historically supported: turning essential, public-facing weather data into a for-profit model. This is especially alarming in a time of increasing climate instability, where equitable access to accurate forecasting should be a public right, not a premium service. </p><p>Given Mozilla’s dedication to transparency, public interest, and open access to information, I’m genuinely curious how this partnership with AccuWeather aligns with those values. Has this relationship been re-evaluated recently? Or are there specific factors that Mozilla considers when forming or continuing partnerships with companies whose practices may not reflect Mozilla’s core mission? </p><p>This isn’t meant to be combative—I really do want to understand the reasoning behind this decision, and whether the Mozilla community has discussed these concerns internally. I’d also welcome thoughts from other community members who may have more insight. </p><p>Thanks for reading. </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",evergreenfae19
1506245,2025-04-15 14:15:21 -0700,2025-04-15 14:15:21 -0700,Can't sign in to bellsouth.net/att.net email,"<p>OK, this is getting to the point where I no longer want to use Firefox. I have had trouble in the past where if I went on Edge for some reason and logged in to my email, when I returned to Firefox I was logged out of all my Yahoo powered email accounts. When trying to log on I would receive the attached message and it would take hours, and sometimes days to be able to log on. Even when I was logged on to my main mail account, I would not be able to log on to the other two accounts. The last time this happened is when I realized it coincided with me logging into my email on Edge, so I have not logged into my email using Edge since then. Unfortunately that was just a coincidence, because it happened today and I hadn't been on Edge since I posted my previous question in February. </p><p>I am always logged into all three accounts, but since this happened two months ago, I only logged into my main account and one other on Firefox, but I have only accessed the main account since logging in to both of them. I only accessed the other two accounts on my phone, which was fine, but I sent my phone to get the fingerprint sensor repaired so I'm using my wife's old iphone now. Don't get me started on how this phone sucks, but I needed to access one of the other accounts today and I don't have either of them set up on the Yahoo app, and I didn't want to take the time to set up the one now when my phone should be back in my hands in a couple of days. I came in the house and fired up my computer again opened my email and switched to the account I needed and surprise! I was logged in. I did what I needed to do and tried to switch back to my main email when surprise again! I received that same dreaded message. </p><p>I have been trying to log in to my account on and off for about five hours now, and I'm about to toss my notebook across the room. That would leave me without a PC though, so I am forced to use Edge, but for how long? I have posted on Mozilla support many times in the past for different things, but I have never actually had anyone from Mozilla provide an answer to any of my issues. Is that because this is only a community forum? Does anyone that works for Mozilla or Firefox actually access this forum and see these questions? If it's only a community forum, where do I get post my issue to be able to receive answers from the people that make Firefox work? My last post in February had 17 views, seven others that have the same issue, (so I'm not the only one), and no replies other than my posts adding content because you can't edit your original post. Evidently the people that have an answer to my problems haven't seen it.  </p><p>Maybe I selected the wrong topic? I don't remember what topic I selected two months ago, but I selected passwords and sign in today, so hopefully it's not the same topic and maybe I'll receive some input this time. </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",firefox-13702;firefox-1370;firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",zx9r170

Am I mistaken here?  Every time I try to click on the tab group to close it, the tab group just changes color (i.e., goes from blue background with white text to blue text on a white background) and none of the tabs are collapsed into the group (i.e., they just stay on the tab bar, and I'm shifted to a different tab). </p><p>Is this happening for other people? Is this what is supposed to happen?  Is there some setting that I need to enable?  I've tried seeing if it's conflicting with any my add-ons, and I haven't found anything just yet.  I'm awfully confused, so I'm hoping someone can help explain what might be amiss here.  Thanks in advance. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1725837;1725888;,jaysilverman1

При открытии некоторых сайтов, где есть видео или транляции, колесиком мышки открываю нужные видео или трансляции в новых вкладках. Ситуация следующая. Если не спеша открыть несколько вкладок, например 5, после перейти к ним, то нужно нажать в центре видео/трансляции ""плей"", чтобы видео стало работать. НО, если открыть вкладки (так же 5 или более) и сразу же переключаться на них, то видео будет автоматически стартовать. Раньше так и было при добавлении нескольких вкладок с видео, а после переключения на них, видео сразу открывалось. Теперь - нет. В настройках ничего нигде не менял, проверял как на версии браузера для пк на 133..., так и на последней 137... Отключал все дополнения, в настройках сайтов давал разрешение для автовоспроизведения аудио и видео. Хочу отметить, что такая проблема на многих сайтах. На некоторых же всё работает как и раньше. Также отмечу, что переустанавливал браузер с полной очисткой. Железо у пк хорошее, озу 32 гб. Никогда проблем такого рода не было. Прошу помочь с решением проблемы. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1725739;1725842;1725909;,max-22-01-93

If I click on an email preview in my email client it proceeds to try and open that content in an almost infinite set of windows. If instead I click on a web link in that content it proceeds to attempt to open an almost infinite number of tabs of copies of this content in Firefox, I'm not saying this is the fault of the browser but it's a weird problem. Finally if I try and open the website that I need to use to manage  the memory usage of this limited memory cable provider email account, the website no longer processes that correctly either so after a short  time I will run out of memory entirely and lose usage of the account so you can see why solving this is an urgent matter for me. (I already contacted the cable provider tech support and their considered opinion was I ought to pound sand since they no longer provide email accounts any more for anyone. I have a peculiar feeling that one possible answer involves doing complex editing in the Registry, I think I'd rather back out the update (although MSC wil probably just overwrite it again in 6 months anyway) but I guess either would be acceptable, I'm just wondering how come I'm the only person in the known universe who has seen this weird issue? </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1725834;,jlawton
