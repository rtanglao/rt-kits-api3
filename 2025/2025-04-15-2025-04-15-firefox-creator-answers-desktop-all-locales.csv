НО, если открыть вкладки (так же 5 или более) и сразу же переключаться на них, то видео будет автоматически стартовать. Раньше так и было при добавлении нескольких вкладок с видео, а после переключения на них, видео сразу открывалось. Теперь - нет.

Отключал все дополнения, в настройках сайтов давал разрешение для автовоспроизведения аудио и видео. Хочу отметить, что такая проблема на многих сайтах. На некоторых же всё работает как и раньше.
