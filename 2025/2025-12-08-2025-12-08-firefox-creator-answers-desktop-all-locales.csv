So I went to sign in and it asked me to authenticator myself but Firefox wasn't in there. Then I saw the Google botton and thought that maybe I used that the last time I logged in because my main address was in the authenticator. So I went through Google to sign in, entered my password and when it asked me to authenticate I used the Google address code. Not happening. In truth I don't even remember setting up 2 factor but I must have because I have the 10 digit codes. Anyway, I removed 2 factor and I'm going to charge my password and probably re enable it but as I was about to do that I see the thing that says my Google is now linked to my Firefox. My instinct is to unlink it, in fact, I want to distance myself from as much of those people as I can. However, the thought occurred that maybe it would be advantages somehow to keep them linked. As I write this I'm thinking no, I don't see it, but I'm old and not current on best practices. BTW, I have been using Brave as my primary browser and duck duck go as my search my real purpose for revving up Firefox is that I need a us phone number because I'm an American living abroad and I hate my bank. I have an address in California but no phone number and I need to get one that's not overly observable. My friend in Cambodia sent me a link to the new Firefox and said it was available in the extensions. I had just gotten started when the whole signing in thing happened and now I'm going to see if anyone has any thoughts before I carry on. Appreciate you. BTW I'm on my galaxy s20fe Android 13 ui 5.1 but I'm going to be concentrating my efforts on my S23FE running Android 16 UI 8 </p>",firefox;accounts;,firefox,accounts,en-US,"",zipless101

But of course I have a much higher rez screen. So I'm looking at many more bookmarks across the menu bar, and they are all very small. As are the tabs at the top of the window. I can not find a way to make these larger in Settings. Grok tells me to work with CSS in the profiles folder, but that doesn't seem to work. (And I bet that every time a new version came out, I'd have to move or remake that CSS file and/or folder.) Is this just the way it is on the high-rez screen, or can someone point me to a solution? </p>",firefox-1450;windows-10;firefox;browser-appearance;,firefox,browser-appearance,en-US,"",robow1
