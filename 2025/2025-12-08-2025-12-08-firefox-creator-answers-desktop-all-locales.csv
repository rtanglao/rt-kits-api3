So I went to sign in and it asked me to authenticator myself but Firefox wasn't in there. Then I saw the Google botton and thought that maybe I used that the last time I logged in because my main address was in the authenticator. So I went through Google to sign in, entered my password and when it asked me to authenticate I used the Google address code. Not happening. In truth I don't even remember setting up 2 factor but I must have because I have the 10 digit codes. Anyway, I removed 2 factor and I'm going to charge my password and probably re enable it but as I was about to do that I see the thing that says my Google is now linked to my Firefox. My instinct is to unlink it, in fact, I want to distance myself from as much of those people as I can. However, the thought occurred that maybe it would be advantages somehow to keep them linked. As I write this I'm thinking no, I don't see it, but I'm old and not current on best practices. BTW, I have been using Brave as my primary browser and duck duck go as my search my real purpose for revving up Firefox is that I need a us phone number because I'm an American living abroad and I hate my bank. I have an address in California but no phone number and I need to get one that's not overly observable. My friend in Cambodia sent me a link to the new Firefox and said it was available in the extensions. I had just gotten started when the whole signing in thing happened and now I'm going to see if anyone has any thoughts before I carry on. Appreciate you. BTW I'm on my galaxy s20fe Android 13 ui 5.1 but I'm going to be concentrating my efforts on my S23FE running Android 16 UI 8 </p>",firefox;accounts;,firefox,accounts,en-US,"",zipless101
