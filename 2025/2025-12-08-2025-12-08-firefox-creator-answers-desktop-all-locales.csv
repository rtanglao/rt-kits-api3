But of course I have a much higher rez screen. So I'm looking at many more bookmarks across the menu bar, and they are all very small. As are the tabs at the top of the window. I can not find a way to make these larger in Settings. Grok tells me to work with CSS in the profiles folder, but that doesn't seem to work. (And I bet that every time a new version came out, I'd have to move or remake that CSS file and/or folder.) Is this just the way it is on the high-rez screen, or can someone point me to a solution? </p>",firefox-1450;windows-10;firefox;browser-appearance;,firefox,browser-appearance,en-US,"",robow1
