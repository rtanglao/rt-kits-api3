I searched the internet and found many so called fixes and most are very complicated and many contradict others. A lot of them say to disable DNS and reset network stack (using the command prompt) which I do not know how to do even though I worked in the tech business for 40 yrs (mainly data networking)...I retired 20 yrs ago...so I'm old...so I'm not as savvy with computers as I used to be. I tried changing a few Firefox settings, but nothing worked, so I changed them back to the original settings that worked before the update. If someone could give me detailed (and hopefully simple) instructions to resolve this issue, I would greatly appreciate it. I'm am in a bind, so a timely response would be great.

So I went to sign in and it asked me to authenticator myself but Firefox wasn't in there. Then I saw the Google botton and thought that maybe I used that the last time I logged in because my main address was in the authenticator. So I went through Google to sign in, entered my password and when it asked me to authenticate I used the Google address code. Not happening. In truth I don't even remember setting up 2 factor but I must have because I have the 10 digit codes. Anyway, I removed 2 factor and I'm going to charge my password and probably re enable it but as I was about to do that I see the thing that says my Google is now linked to my Firefox. My instinct is to unlink it, in fact, I want to distance myself from as much of those people as I can. However, the thought occurred that maybe it would be advantages somehow to keep them linked. As I write this I'm thinking no, I don't see it, but I'm old and not current on best practices. BTW, I have been using Brave as my primary browser and duck duck go as my search my real purpose for revving up Firefox is that I need a us phone number because I'm an American living abroad and I hate my bank. I have an address in California but no phone number and I need to get one that's not overly observable. My friend in Cambodia sent me a link to the new Firefox and said it was available in the extensions. I had just gotten started when the whole signing in thing happened and now I'm going to see if anyone has any thoughts before I carry on. Appreciate you.
