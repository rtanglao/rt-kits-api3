This issue didn't happen with earlier versions of Firefox - at least since the Proton UI changeover. And this issue doesn't exist on other software on my system. I haven't changed my Firefox settings. </p><p>As a result of this I haven't been able to update my installation of Firefox. I'd like to try to track down what changed around that time and see if I can find a workaround or possibly submit a bug? Is anyone familiar with graphics related changes that occurred around that time? How might I go about figuring this out? I'd like to keep up with the new features and security updates. </p>,firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",arosenbl
