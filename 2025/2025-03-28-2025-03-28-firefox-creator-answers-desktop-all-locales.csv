Utilizzo Firefox su un computer con Windows 10, e oggi il browser si è aggiornato alla versione 136.0.4. Purtroppo si verificano dei problemi con le estensioni che ho installato: - l'icona di Ghostery è presente ma invisibile nella barra degli strumenti (accanto all'icona ""Estensioni""): in ogni caso riesco ad aprire il menu a tendina per gestirla, è attiva e sembra funzionare regolarmente (ma dovrei controllare meglio); - nell'estensione Redirector (che uso molto spesso) tutti i ""redirect"" che ho impostato sono spariti: forse ho sbagliato io e non ho importato correttamente i dati (nelle finestre di dialogo apparse quando ho aperto il browser per la prima volta). Fortunatamente avevo gli stessi ""redirect"" sul Firefox del mio smartphone e li ho importati senza problemi. Però, anche se ora l'estensione sembra attiva e programmata regolarmente, i reindirizzamenti non funzionano! Non so se la Modalità risoluzione problemi sia utile, visto che a quanto leggo disattiva le estensioni per controllare se persistono altri problemi. Mi servirebbe una mano soprattutto per ripristinare Redirector.

Luckily I had the same redirects on my smartphone and could easily import them. However, now the extension appears to be enabled and properly programmed, but redirects don't work.
