I want to open one profile at times, but the other at different times. I can only specify a default profile for initial browser start, or to have the browser make me choose each time. Either of these options mean that I have to go through extra steps to launch any profile beside the default. This effectively makes the new profiles less useful to me than the profile manager that has been around for much longer. </p><p>Searching for help online has led me to several suggestions to create shortcuts that use the -P ""profile name"" switch for each profile. This is out of date because the profiles I can access from the command line bear no connection to the ones I have created as described in the above paragraph. They are only the ones I have created using the (old) profile manager from the profile manager in about:settings. </p><p>Did I miss something, in other words is it possible to do something similar with the new container profiles as I can with the original config profiles? </p>",firefox-1460;windows-11;firefox;profiles;,firefox,profiles,en-US,1785941;,andre6180
