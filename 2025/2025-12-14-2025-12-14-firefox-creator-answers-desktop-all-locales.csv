I want my main output (device A) to stay as the default, but have Firefox play out of the other (device B). There is no option within the browser's settings to change the output device, so I am controlling them through Windows' Volume Mixer. If I set device B as the system default, it works, and it allows me to change Firefox to play from any output. However, if anything else is set as the system default and I set Firefox to play from device B, it doesn't work. It seems like it ignores only specifically that one device, and only when it is set at an app-specific level. It works on all my other outputs no matter which is the default. Even if I have device B as the system default, then at the app-specific level, set FF to any other device, then select device B, it ignores this and continues to play out of whatever device it played from last. The ONLY way I can get Firefox to play audio from device B is with device B as the system default. It's already disappointing that I can't control this directly from FF settings, but the fact that it's also ignoring my OS settings is really frustrating. I've already contacted Windows support, and they say the problem is with Firefox since all my audio devices are working fine. If anyone can tell me a way to just manage this setting properly in Firefox, some way to get Firefox to recognize the device, or some way to allow my windows settings to take priority over whatever FF is trying to do, that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. </p>",firefox-1460;windows-11;firefox;audio-and-video;,firefox,audio-and-video,en-US,"",loganwyborn
