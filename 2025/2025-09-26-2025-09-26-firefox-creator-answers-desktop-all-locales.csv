How do I sync this? I hit sync and nothing changed. I am signed in and I can not figure out how to get the browser profile to sync with this new profile under one browser. I really hate how Firefox named both of these Profiles because it is extremely hard to explain this situation. </p>",firefox-14301;firefox-1430;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;sync-failure;,firefox,sync-failure,en-US,1767673;1767715;,caitiec23

I like many people I live with many tabs open at once.  Since the 143 update I come back to my computer the next morning and many of my tabs, specifically my gmail tab and many others will not work. (Oddly I've noticed some random tabs will still work, I have no idea why)  I can close the tab and try to reopen gmail in a new tab and it just sits there trying to open but it will not.  I've waited 20 minutes.  Not until I close firefox and restore my last session will it again work properly.  Is there a bug/glitch or is there some setting I need to adjust.  I don't want to have to close my firefox everyday.  Edge is not having this same issue, so I'm pretty sure it's not a problem with my specific machine.  It's like Firefox just decides to quit when I go to bed.

I added the form to the official document to streamline some processes, for example, by avoiding having to enter the same data in the second block, as the data is replicated from the first. The form has an intuitive navigation sequence, so that the sender and recipient data are entered, all the sender fields are entered, and then the recipient fields are entered, followed by the shipped goods fields, as shown in the attached image (pdfscr.png). The problem is that Firefox alone doesn't recognize the tabbed navigation order, instead using line-level navigation (pdfscr2.png). </p><p>It's really annoying having to manipulate the PDF in Firefox because of this implementation flaw. Another point to note: The form fields are also formatted in the ""Century Gothic"" font, but in Firefox, they display in the default font and only appear correctly when printing. It could display the correct font during editing, as in all other browsers and programs. </p><p>Thank you for your attention. </p>",firefox-14301;firefox-1430;windows-11;firefox;pdfs;,firefox,pdfs,pt-BR,"",emersonsalmeida
