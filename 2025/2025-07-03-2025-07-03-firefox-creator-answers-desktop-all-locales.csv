My browser now works, and I don't have any issues downloading new documents, but every document I'd downloaded on my first browser that was labelled a Firefox PDF document is now corrupted.  I can work around it on my own computer, but if I try to email the documents to someone else they just get the corrupted file.  I've tried converting the PDFs into a different type of document and then reconverting them to PDFs, but the PDF version is still corrupted.  Is there any way to fix this?  Or is my only option converting everything to a different type of document? </p>",firefox-14002;firefox-1400;windows-11;firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",jackson_taylor120
