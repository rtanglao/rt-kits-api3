It only appears to blank screen until mouse is moved or lid moved.  This happened on 3 year old dell and now on new lenovo.  I've gotten around it by going into task manager and killing firefox before hibernating.  This doesn't happen on a newly opened window.  I've noticed that as you use it, in the task manager, (not sure of correct term) the amounts of firefox tasks/threads? increases but does not decrease when tabs are closed.  Eventually hibernate stops until I kill the firefox program.  I thought this might go away with new lenovo with twice the ram, but happens at same rate.  If I forget to kill firefox, I end up with a dead battery.  This doesn't happen with edge or other browsers I've tried. </p>",firefox-14502;firefox-1450;windows-11;firefox;app-responsiveness;,firefox,app-responsiveness,en-US,"",pmtrebs
