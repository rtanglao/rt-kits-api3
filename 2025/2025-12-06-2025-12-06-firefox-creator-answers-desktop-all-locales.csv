After installing the 145 update, it just keeps asking me to sign into with my admin credentials to install ""a new helper tool"" over and over. After entering my password nothing happens and when I try to relaunch, the FF icon just bounces. (""Force Quit"" shows that the application is not responding.) After multiple attempts, I rebooted my laptop, but it didn't help, as I still get the request for installing the helper too. I'm in the midst of multiple project deadlines and this is very frustrating! Thanks in advance for your help. </p>",firefox;launch-failure;,firefox,launch-failure,en-US,"",gecko840-internet
