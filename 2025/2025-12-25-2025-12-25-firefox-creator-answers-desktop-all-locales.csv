At each stage the entered characters are indicated in the red box with a writing underneath that it is wrong. All the above parameters are securely stored in my computer and a notebook. </p><p>Mozilla, how are you going to solve this problem. Just as you Firefox updated you do not check well to see whether they work well or not, and you push them out to the public. Besides you also force to update my versions which I have not given you permission.  </p><p>Regards. </p><p>DR CLEMENT AKATENG MD </p>",firefox-14601;firefox-1460;windows-10;firefox;sign-in;,firefox,sign-in,en-US,1788868;,DRCLEMENTAKATENG1
