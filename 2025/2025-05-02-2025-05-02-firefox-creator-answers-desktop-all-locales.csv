In our tests, DuckDuckGo’s settings were preserved when this option was disabled. It would greatly help to narrow this down. </p><p>Here for any further questions!

If DuckDuckGo saves its settings internally, there may be no way to keep <a href=""http://duckduckgo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">duckduckgo.com</a> out of exceptions while preserving those settings elsewhere. </p><p>You might want to look into third-party tools that support this kind of setup, or consider reaching out to Mozilla’s support team with this request. </p><p>Here for any further questions!

Everyone else can get the videos to play except me (the teacher) form my Lenovo computer.  It used to work as I created the course with videos working.  I can however see them operate on Internet Explorer!  I have tried every setting, cookies, cache, etc.  Nothing changes! This happened suddenly after an update about a year ago, it's been that long that I've been trying to get videos going again!   </p><p>I called Thinkific and they can not recreate the video problem on their end - it's just my computer it seems. Other students using FireFox can see the videos as well - just not ME!   It can't be my computer since I have been able to see the videos with no problems for years using this same computer. Now, I have to switch over to Edge or Internet Explorer in order to see the videos in my class program.  Even if I uploaded new ones, they just won't play for me on my desktop.  Thank you.

""access denied"" errors that settings don't seem to fix","<p>Need help with this problem, and need it desperately and quickly!  So much so, that I bothered to actually make an account here to beg for help.  I've been getting an ""access denied"" error on some websites.  First it was mouser, and I had to phone in an order.  They claimed that there were no problems with the website, and no other customers were reporting issues at the time.  Started researching the problem, and discovered various ""fixes"" seem to revolve around the various security and privacy settings.  NONE of these alleged ""fixes"" actually work!  Continued to research the problem, and still haven't found a solution that actually works.  Next it was lowe's website, so can no longer comparison shop with them (at least they have plenty of competitors).  Now, it's ups, and did not discover this until I just ordered a bunch of stuff and have almost a dozen packages to track!  HELP!  PLEASE!  Mail theft is a HUGE problem in this area, and I need to know exactly when all these deliveries are arriving!  Here's all my info, as best as I have it or know it: Linux OS FF was updated to v137, this was one of the first things done in attmpting to solve the problem when it first happened.   Cookies, cache, history, etc are always cleared, I only go to one website at a time, and clear all this stuff out, close, and then reopen FF before I go to another website.  Clearing this stuff out and then refreshing the page (a commonly mentioned ""solution"") doesn't work. Privacy and tracking protection was changed from ""custom"" (with everything checked), to ""standard"". ""Do not track"" was changed, and turned off (unchecked) ""Website advertising preferences"" was not changed from the unchecked setting, since none of the affected websites contain advertising. ""Certificates / query OCSP responder servers"" was left checked. ""Don’t enable HTTPS-Only Mode"" was left checked. ""DNS over HTTPS"" was changed from ""max protection"" to ""default"". ""Use your default DNS resolver"" was changed from unchecked to checked. ""Play DRM-controlled content"" was left unchecked. ""No proxy"" is checked in the ""network settings"". </p><p>Generally speaking, the various ""solutions"" proffered seem to involve turning off or minimizing any privacy protections.  No one specific thing I've seen mentioned has solved the problem.  And attempting to ""open up"" all of these settings hasn't worked at all.  So, first, am I somehow missing something?  Is there some privacy protection buried in the settings that I haven't been able to find and ""open up""? </p><p>Secondly, WHY is this happening?  (This question is being asked on a technical level, I'm trying to understand this and learn something here)  In my understanding of attempting to research the problem, it is somehow something that some websites are doing to protect themselves against bots and DDOS attacks - OR (and?) - is a way of forcing tracking and datamining onto those who still attempt to cling to some notion of privacy.  What exactly are these websites doing, that causes this error with FF, but not other browsers?  Why does this error occur with FF, and not other browsers? </p><p>Right now, the urgent need is being able to track these deliveries so that hundreds and hundreds of dollars worth of merchandise and supplies don't get stolen!  Somebody, PLEASE HELP!  TIA! </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1729590;,none
