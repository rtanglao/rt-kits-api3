I managed to transfer everything over to the new install, except for the URLs in <a href=""https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reading_list/"" rel=""nofollow"">Reading List</a>. The extension itself made it over; just not any of the URLs I stored in it. </p><p>In theory, I know that I can scrounge through the Firefox install on my old hard drive and grab the necessary files, but I have no idea how I'd go about doing that. I can't rely on folder names, since those are based on extension IDs that are generated when I install the extension, and the files themselves are too opaque to glean anything useful from (Notepad++ didn't turn anything up, so I'm assuming the extension data's compressed). </p><p>Other than that, I've tried: </p> <ul><li> Running <a href=""https://www.jeffersonscher.com/ffu/extensionsjson.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this tool</a> to see if there was anything I could use. There wasn't. </li><li> Trying Load Temporary Add-ons to identify the Add-on I wanted.
