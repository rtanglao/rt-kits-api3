I shift tabs around a lot to keep them organized, yet for the first time ever, shifting a tab has caused a permanent glitch on Firefox. </p><p>The preexisting workarounds are to try moving a tab to ""unfreeze"" the address bar and toolbar, or to move the window to another monitor and letting the issue fix itself, but both options have not done anything. </p><p>Additionally, as shown in the image attached, the ""moved"" tab winds up being a floating tab that is unclickable and floats ""above"" the other tabs. That tab can be accessed only through the CMND + tab option, which is also another inconvenience. </p><p>Really hoping the community has a solve because I transferred from Google Chrome due to Ublock becoming obsolete on that browser, and I would prefer not having to find another browser. Thank you! </p>",firefox-14402;firefox-1440;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;app-responsiveness;,firefox,app-responsiveness,en-US,"",elizabethnchi
