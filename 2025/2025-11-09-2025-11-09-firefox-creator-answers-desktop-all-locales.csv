It was one of the main reasons I kept using Chrome, so having it in Firefox—on both desktop and Android—is fantastic. Thank you! </p><p>I’ve noticed that to access the translation option, you have to right-click the selected text using a mouse or touchpad. The keyboard’s right-click key, however, doesn’t open the context menu for the selected text, so the translation option isn’t available. This makes it inconvenient for keyboard-focused users. </p><p>It would also be very helpful to have built-in pronunciation for selected text. I tried several add-ons that offer this, but none worked reliably. This feature would complement translation nicely. </p><p>Finally, it might improve usability to show a small popup button beside selected text to trigger translation—similar to what some translation extensions already do. While I personally prefer keyboard shortcuts, this could enhance accessibility for others. </p>",firefox;languages;,firefox,languages,en-US,"",mh.firouzjah+mozilla

Popups like this one always appear. They are driving me crazy because they persist when some new window is moved over the Firefox window. That is,  they always come to the front of a stack of windows. They often cover some clickable  list in another application. I'm working with the latest MAC OS on a Macbook Pro.

I’m using lightweight JavaScript with no third-party ads — just local scripts and analytics. Could anyone explain how Firefox’s Enhanced Tracking Protection or JavaScript settings might affect embedded scripts? And what’s the best practice to make sure essential scripts still load while maintaining user privacy? Any insights from web developers familiar with Firefox’s JS behavior would be really helpful.

Launch Firefox ESR (128.7.0esr or 140esr) 2. Browse Facebook continuously for tens of minutes 3. Screen begins to flicker, then gradually distorts 4. Take a screenshot → image is normal 5. Reboot → screen returns to normal </p><p>✅ Expected Behavior   The screen should remain visually stable during browser usage, without flickering or distortion. </p><p>Actual Behavior   The built-in screen flickers and eventually distorts, while screenshots remain unaffected. This suggests the issue may lie in the final stage of the display output pipeline, possibly involving the TCON (Timing Controller) reacting to GPU output or Firefox’s rendering behavior. </p><pre>Additional Notes   </pre> <p>- Hardware acceleration was disabled in Firefox for testing — the issue still occurred (on older versions). - No similar behavior observed in Chrome or Edge. - BIOS screen appears normal, ruling out panel damage. - After upgrading to Firefox ESR 143.0.4 (64-bit), the distortion issue has not reappeared for two weeks, though minor flickering still occurs occasionally during browsing. - Interestingly, when distortion or flickering occurs while browsing Facebook, switching to another website immediately causes the screen to temporarily return to normal.   </p><pre> This suggests the issue may be triggered by specific rendering patterns or GPU calls on certain web pages. </pre> <p>- This may indicate a rare interaction between Firefox ESR and specific hardware configurations (UMA → TCON → panel). </p>",firefox-1430;windows-10;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",fornews01

The bookmarks toolbar, which I use constantly, was also gone. Furthermore, I can't even create new bookmarks. And I mean of <strong>ANY</strong> sort. Doesn't matter if click the little bookmark star when I'm on the page I want to save, or if I manually try to type it in by right-clicking the toolbar and choosing ""Add bookmark..."" None of it works! </p><p>I tried going to ""Manage Bookmarks -&gt; Import and Backup -&gt; Restore"" where I see 12 restore points. I've tried them all, but I get the same message every time: ""Unable to process the backup file"" </p><p>I've searched the Mozilla support articles and have only found one other entry from a person who seems to have had the same problem, here: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/gl/questions/1504803"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/gl/questions/1504803</a> </p><p>This person managed to solve it themselves by using the ""Refresh Firefox"" option, so I tried that, but it didn't work. The only thing I got out of it was losing all my extensions. I had been warned about that beforehand, so while it's a little more than just annoying that I've lost my Avast! Password Manager, which had a LOT of passwords I can't remember, not backing that up manually before running the refresh was entirely a brain fart on my own part. </p><p>Just to be sure, I've checked my Windows Update history to see if the culprit could be Windows rather than Firefox, but the last one was the 25H2 update that ran on October 17th. If that had been to blame, the problem would have manifested itself much earlier, so I'm fairly certain that has nothing to do with it. </p><p>So, two problems to solve here: </p> <ol><li> 1 - How do I fix this bookmark problem? </li><li> 2 - Is it perhaps possible to restore my Avast! Password Manager? </li></ol> <p>I would be VERY grateful if someone could help me with this!
