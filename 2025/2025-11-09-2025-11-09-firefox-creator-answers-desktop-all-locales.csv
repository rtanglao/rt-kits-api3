Today my bookmarks had disappeared. I rebooted several times, closed and reopened firefox several times and I don't remember what else I clicked on but my bookmarks had reappeared. I sat down at the computer a while ago and opened firefox and my bookmarks seemed to have disappeared again. Before when I clicked on bookmarks up on the toolbar my bookmarks would appear. Now I have to click on bookmarks then bookmarks toolbar to see them and now all of my logins are gone. Should I just ditch this browser and use chrome or is there some simple fix? I never have had as many problems with a browser as I've had with firefox and I no longer see an advantage in using it. </p>",firefox-14402;firefox-1440;windows-10;firefox;recover-data;,firefox,recover-data,en-US,"",jbh61464
