Launch Firefox ESR (128.7.0esr or 140esr) 2. Browse Facebook continuously for tens of minutes 3. Screen begins to flicker, then gradually distorts 4. Take a screenshot → image is normal 5. Reboot → screen returns to normal </p><p>✅ Expected Behavior   The screen should remain visually stable during browser usage, without flickering or distortion. </p><p>Actual Behavior   The built-in screen flickers and eventually distorts, while screenshots remain unaffected. This suggests the issue may lie in the final stage of the display output pipeline, possibly involving the TCON (Timing Controller) reacting to GPU output or Firefox’s rendering behavior. </p><pre>Additional Notes   </pre> <p>- Hardware acceleration was disabled in Firefox for testing — the issue still occurred (on older versions). - No similar behavior observed in Chrome or Edge. - BIOS screen appears normal, ruling out panel damage. - After upgrading to Firefox ESR 143.0.4 (64-bit), the distortion issue has not reappeared for two weeks, though minor flickering still occurs occasionally during browsing. - Interestingly, when distortion or flickering occurs while browsing Facebook, switching to another website immediately causes the screen to temporarily return to normal.   </p><pre> This suggests the issue may be triggered by specific rendering patterns or GPU calls on certain web pages. </pre> <p>- This may indicate a rare interaction between Firefox ESR and specific hardware configurations (UMA → TCON → panel). </p>",firefox-1430;windows-10;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",fornews01

The bookmarks toolbar, which I use constantly, was also gone. Furthermore, I can't even create new bookmarks. And I mean of <strong>ANY</strong> sort. Doesn't matter if click the little bookmark star when I'm on the page I want to save, or if I manually try to type it in by right-clicking the toolbar and choosing ""Add bookmark..."" None of it works! </p><p>I tried going to ""Manage Bookmarks -&gt; Import and Backup -&gt; Restore"" where I see 12 restore points. I've tried them all, but I get the same message every time: ""Unable to process the backup file"" </p><p>I've searched the Mozilla support articles and have only found one other entry from a person who seems to have had the same problem, here: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/gl/questions/1504803"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/gl/questions/1504803</a> </p><p>This person managed to solve it themselves by using the ""Refresh Firefox"" option, so I tried that, but it didn't work. The only thing I got out of it was losing all my extensions. I had been warned about that beforehand, so while it's a little more than just annoying that I've lost my Avast! Password Manager, which had a LOT of passwords I can't remember, not backing that up manually before running the refresh was entirely a brain fart on my own part. </p><p>Just to be sure, I've checked my Windows Update history to see if the culprit could be Windows rather than Firefox, but the last one was the 25H2 update that ran on October 17th. If that had been to blame, the problem would have manifested itself much earlier, so I'm fairly certain that has nothing to do with it. </p><p>So, two problems to solve here: </p> <ol><li> 1 - How do I fix this bookmark problem? </li><li> 2 - Is it perhaps possible to restore my Avast! Password Manager? </li></ol> <p>I would be VERY grateful if someone could help me with this! Like the person in the linked post, collecting these bookmarks has taken me over a decade and they've been used so frequently that - at least for some of them - I don't even remember the URL's of the sites anymore, because I literally haven't typed them in manually for years. </p>",firefox-14402;firefox-1440;windows-11;firefox;recover-data;,firefox,recover-data,en-US,"",mmaromainz

Today my bookmarks had disappeared. I rebooted several times, closed and reopened firefox several times and I don't remember what else I clicked on but my bookmarks had reappeared. I sat down at the computer a while ago and opened firefox and my bookmarks seemed to have disappeared again. Before when I clicked on bookmarks up on the toolbar my bookmarks would appear. Now I have to click on bookmarks then bookmarks toolbar to see them and now all of my logins are gone. Should I just ditch this browser and use chrome or is there some simple fix? I never have had as many problems with a browser as I've had with firefox and I no longer see an advantage in using it. </p>",firefox-14402;firefox-1440;windows-10;firefox;recover-data;,firefox,recover-data,en-US,"",jbh61464
