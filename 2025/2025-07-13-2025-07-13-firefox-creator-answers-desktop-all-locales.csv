It only saves two or three total backups, some of which are completely out of date.  But the worst scenario is when (1) some site pops up a new window;  (2) I mistakenly close my main window before the new window; (3) I open this new saved window once or twice by accident, causing my 60-tab session backup to be overwritten.   </p><p>Using a third-party session manager (I have tried all the well-known ones) can mitigate this problem, but doesn't really solve it because the re-opened sessions aren't quite in the same format as Firefox sessions and so lose information.  In particular, I often lose each tab's icon as well as metadata for Tree Style Tab. </p><p>Could Mozilla please consider a more robust session backup system for Firefox?
