Then i tried to log in the mozilla account but it keep saying that it cannot continue because cookies or localstore are disabled.  Then i checked the about:support page like i said in the titile, many configs are blank. Maybe some problems with the profile i guess. I also opened a issue in Scoop githup repo, they cant reproduce my problem. Where could go wrong? Any help would be appreciate! </p><p>And this is the issue i post on github <a href=""https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras/issues/15770"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras/issues/15770</a> </p>",windows-11;firefox;profiles;,firefox,profiles,en-US,"",YSHFarewell

The download failed, and changing the file directory was still ineffective. Then, it resulted in a situation where no web pages could be opened, as if the network was disconnected. After closing the browser and reopening it, it returned to normal, but the download still could not be used.

Do I need to use a different browser?  And Firefox has had trouble with some websites where the paying portion is not correct.  However, if I go to a different browser (Chrome), the paying portion works correctly.  I'm getting kinda tired of these weird things going on.  Please don't offer a feature that doesn't work like grouping tabs. </p><p>Today:  Can't access website.  I think it is the ISP or the router.  Reset the router.  No luck.  Tried a different device on the Wifi.  Works fine.  Tried a different browser.  works fine.  Shut down Firefox.  I had 2 browser instances open with several windows in each.  Could not restart firefox, as it did not close correctly.  I closed the broken instance(s). opened FF again, only got one set of windows, not both sets.  The other instance had a bunch of grouped windows, and the groups seem to be gone.  I can recreate most of those, but had some windows with ongoing work and things I wanted to look at and now they are gone.  </p><p>FF crashed when I tried to get some answer from <a href=""http://ediblearrangements.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ediblearrangements.com</a> help. </p>",firefox-1400;windows-10;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",mfmattran
