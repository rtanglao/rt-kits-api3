If I try doing save as PDF, the preview shows up as blank sheets of paper, when I click ""save as"" it only saves one page of the 31 as BLANK.  If I try doing normal save as, the saved file is un-annotated.  </p><p>Please help... thanks </p>",firefox-14002;firefox-1400;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;download-and-save;,firefox,download-and-save,en-US,"",lincolnxu.ca

Then i tried to log in the mozilla account but it keep saying that it cannot continue because cookies or localstore are disabled.  Then i checked the about:support page like i said in the titile, many configs are blank. Maybe some problems with the profile i guess. I also opened a issue in Scoop githup repo, they cant reproduce my problem. Where could go wrong? Any help would be appreciate! </p><p>And this is the issue i post on github <a href=""https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras/issues/15770"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras/issues/15770</a> </p>",windows-11;firefox;profiles;,firefox,profiles,en-US,"",YSHFarewell

Do I need to use a different browser?  And Firefox has had trouble with some websites where the paying portion is not correct.  However, if I go to a different browser (Chrome), the paying portion works correctly.  I'm getting kinda tired of these weird things going on.  Please don't offer a feature that doesn't work like grouping tabs. </p><p>Today:  Can't access website.  I think it is the ISP or the router.  Reset the router.  No luck.  Tried a different device on the Wifi.  Works fine.  Tried a different browser.  works fine.  Shut down Firefox.  I had 2 browser instances open with several windows in each.  Could not restart firefox, as it did not close correctly.  I closed the broken instance(s). opened FF again, only got one set of windows, not both sets.  The other instance had a bunch of grouped windows, and the groups seem to be gone.  I can recreate most of those, but had some windows with ongoing work and things I wanted to look at and now they are gone.  </p><p>FF crashed when I tried to get some answer from <a href=""http://ediblearrangements.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ediblearrangements.com</a> help. </p>",firefox-1400;windows-10;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1748611;,mfmattran
