1522580,2025-07-12 18:45:49 -0700,2025-07-12 18:45:49 -0700,Firefox crashes and I lose all my open windows.,"<p>Why does this happen?  I was even logged in, and my tab groups are gone.  Why???  Do I need to use a different browser?  And Firefox has had trouble with some websites where the paying portion is not correct.  However, if I go to a different browser (Chrome), the paying portion works correctly.  I'm getting kinda tired of these weird things going on.  Please don't offer a feature that doesn't work like grouping tabs. </p><p>Today:  Can't access website.  I think it is the ISP or the router.  Reset the router.  No luck.  Tried a different device on the Wifi.  Works fine.  Tried a different browser.  works fine.  Shut down Firefox.  I had 2 browser instances open with several windows in each.  Could not restart firefox, as it did not close correctly.  I closed the broken instance(s). opened FF again, only got one set of windows, not both sets.  The other instance had a bunch of grouped windows, and the groups seem to be gone.  I can recreate most of those, but had some windows with ongoing work and things I wanted to look at and now they are gone.  </p><p>FF crashed when I tried to get some answer from <a href=""http://ediblearrangements.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ediblearrangements.com</a> help. </p>",firefox-1400;windows-10;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",mfmattran

The strictly necessary box is selected and I cannot change it.  The Voluntary data collection box is clickable but does not make any difference if it is checked or unchecked.  The screen is locked, no matter what I click or unclick. The only thing that I can do is to click the grey LP icon which closes the window. </p><p>On two other very similar computers, when the grey icon is clicked, I can search for passwords, alerts, account, etc.  Why does the icon work on this computer.  I've deleted the addin, deleted Firefox and reloaded several times. </p><p>Thank you </p>",firefox-14004;firefox-1400;windows-11;firefox;extensions;,firefox,extensions,en-US,"",cruisertwo
