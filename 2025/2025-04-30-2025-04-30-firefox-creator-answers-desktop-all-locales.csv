Software is always kept up-to-date.  Sometime recently, Mozilla apps, Firefox nor Thunderbird, will no longer print, neither to pdf nor to network printer.  These always worked before. Now, if even ""print preview"" is invoked, the dialog opens as a blank sub window with only the word ""Print"" in upper right, and at left center is ""Preparing Preview with rotating time delay wheel, which never resolves. All other apps, including other browsers and mail handlers, will print without issue. I've tried the obvious checks with no success.  Where could be the problem?  Is there a helper app shared by Firefox and Thunderbird that could be the issue?  The only potential remedy I have not yet tried is complete removal of both Firefox and Thunderbird, as that would cause re-configuration issues for both. It's necessary to press &lt;ESC&gt; to terminate the print window when it fails to respond.

The game runs fine for a few minutes and then randomly starts slowing down â€” especially during fast action scenes. </p><p>Iâ€™ve tried the basic stuff like: </p><p>Updating Firefox </p><p>Using private window mode </p><p>Closing other tabs </p><p>Enabling hardware acceleration </p><p>But the issue still comes back, especially when I play for more than 10â€“15 minutes. Has anyone else experienced this with browser games on Firefox? Any tweaks or settings you recommend to improve performance? </p><p>Thanks in advance! ðŸ˜Š </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",DigitalRay

The discovered 'Tracking Content' (from shield in the address bar) will list the exact domain that's whitelisted and the network tab of the devtools will label the URL as blocked due to tracking content. Obviously this is wrong, that short of per-window type settings, this should be global (and makes no sense to differentiate anyhow). </p><p>Switching to a standard window fixes this, however, and the exceptions are taken into account. </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",thunfremlinc

Previous to this, this problem has not occurred in at least 5 years. What is going on? To utilize data from multiple sites takes a long time to relocate sites and this is becoming unacceptable.
