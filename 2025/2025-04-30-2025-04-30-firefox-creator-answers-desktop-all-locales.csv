Software is always kept up-to-date.  Sometime recently, Mozilla apps, Firefox nor Thunderbird, will no longer print, neither to pdf nor to network printer.  These always worked before. Now, if even ""print preview"" is invoked, the dialog opens as a blank sub window with only the word ""Print"" in upper right, and at left center is ""Preparing Preview with rotating time delay wheel, which never resolves. All other apps, including other browsers and mail handlers, will print without issue. I've tried the obvious checks with no success.  Where could be the problem?  Is there a helper app shared by Firefox and Thunderbird that could be the issue?  The only potential remedy I have not yet tried is complete removal of both Firefox and Thunderbird, as that would cause re-configuration issues for both. It's necessary to press &lt;ESC&gt; to terminate the print window when it fails to respond.
