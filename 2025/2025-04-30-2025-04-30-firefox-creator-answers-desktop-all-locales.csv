I've used FireFox and Thunderbird for years. In the last month-ish something has changed in the Update Dialog for both apps, that asks if you want to allow the app to make changes to your hard drive. With Jaws and NVDA screen readers, this dialog has normally spoken, so I can Tab to the Yes button, press Enter, the update happens and all is well. Suddenly, this dialog doesn't speak... not a word. Don't know where I am at all. I've tried pressing Alt-Y, which is a Windows accessibility standard for pressing a Yes button, but that hasn't worked in the past, and doesn't work now.  I am blessed with a sighted husband. When this dialog has come up in FireFox and Thunderbird the last month, he has kindly bailed me out and clicked Yes. But this is a nightmare accessibility problem. Using only a screen reader there is no way out of this. Escape doesn't get rid of the dialog and just not update. The dialog sits on the screen, not speaking until you take some action. In fact, the first time this happened I couldn't figure out what was going on, but tried to handle it myself. Nothing talked, so in the middle of things, I used the power button to shut down. Well... we think I shut down in the middle of the app attempting to update. So my laptop came up with an error on the screen, and we actually had to use my husband's computer to get into my Microsoft account and dig up a huge numeric code that would allow my laptop to boot. It was bad and took a long time, and my husband is a saint. So... something changed about a month ago in the Update Dialogs for both FireFox and Thunderbird, that causes them to no longer be readable by screen readers. There is not a keyboard way to just press Yes. There's not actually a way to know for sure that the reason the computer won't talk is because this Update Dialog is sitting on the screen. The developers need to know this has happened and fix it. I don't know any other way to reach them. Thanks! </p>",firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",singingmom12
