Let me explain&nbsp;: Firefox has the feature of Primary Password where we have to put a password to access <strong>the Password manager</strong>. Now there is a very big issue with this feature because if I go to any page for which I have saved my password, I just have to select the password and click the eye button to reveal the password, without even needing to put my Primary Password. I know there is a way of just disabling the auto-filling of password but for conveniency purposes it's just better to have a way to select the password. Could there be a way to either ask for the user to enter the Primary Password or implement a way to use the fingerprint to allow the filling of password as it's already the case in other browsers.  </p><p>My questions are&nbsp;: Is the Firefox team aware of that&nbsp;? and is there a way to hope that Firefox could finally implement a fingerprint unlock to access sensitive data like passwords&nbsp;? </p>",firefox-1440;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;primary-password;,firefox,primary-password,en-US,"",wolkworkshop
