In addition Firefox will not make any new bookmarks at all!? I have tried all the restore options advised: - Turning Firefox off and on. No good - Turning laptop off and on. No good - Windows security is up to date. Still no good - Going to Manage Bookmarks to Restore. None there to restore (possibly because of a CC Cleaner clean?). No good - I was able to find my profile and bookmarks back up. That would not open or load.  I was able to find the Jefferson Scher software and use it to process a JSONLZ4 bookmarks file and export/download a HTML version. If I open the downloaded file I can click on that list of bookmarks to link to them (yay). But I cannot copy this list to the Book marks bar!? - I have tried to add some of these links as bookmarks again in Firefox, but no bookmarks appear in the bookmarks toolbar. So I am not sure what is wrong. Please help. Grateful any advice </p>",firefox-1440;windows-11;firefox;recover-data;,firefox,recover-data,en-US,"",theenergygovernator
