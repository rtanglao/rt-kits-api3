However, when I do this on desktop, Firefox treats the IP address as a search term, and takes me to search results instead of the the EWS. When I tried on Firefox for Android and Firefox Focus for Android, I did not have the same issue, but instead was taken to an all-black page (still unable to access the settings I need!). Any thoughts as to what might be going on and how to fix it? </p><p>Google Chrome treats the IP address as a search term on both desktop and mobile, so this might be a problem bigger than Firefox. </p>",firefox;search-tag-and-share;,firefox,search-tag-and-share,en-US,1716111;,arin.pavlov
