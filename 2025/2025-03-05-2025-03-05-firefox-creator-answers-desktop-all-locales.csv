I pressed the escape button and that did get me out of full screen, but the video window did not apply the right formatting. I'll include a screenshot so that you can see what I am talking about. After exiting full screen, if you look at the bottom of the video window, the option to go back to full screen is cut off. Closing Firefox and relaunching it appears to have things working again, at least for now.
