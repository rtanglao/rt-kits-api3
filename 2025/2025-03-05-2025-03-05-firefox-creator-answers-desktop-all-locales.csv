Let's explore both concepts in more depth: </p> <ol><li><ol><li><ol><li> **Happiness:** </li></ol> </li></ol> </li></ol> <p>Happiness is a more broad, enduring emotional state. It can be seen as the general sense of well-being or contentment with life. Happiness is often linked to external factors, such as achieving goals, acquiring things, or experiencing positive events. </p><p>- **Types of Happiness**: </p><pre> - **Short-term Happiness**: This is the fleeting joy we experience in response to something pleasurable, like eating our favorite food, spending time with loved ones, or receiving good news.  - **Long-term Happiness**: Often referred to as life satisfaction or well-being, this type of happiness reflects a more enduring state. It's about a general sense of fulfillment, meaning, and purpose in life.   </pre> <p>- **Factors Influencing Happiness**: </p><pre> - **External**: Relationships, career success, financial stability, health, and other life circumstances.  - **Internal**: Personal attitude, mindset, gratitude, and resilience. The ability to adapt to change and manage stress can also significantly influence happiness.   </pre> <p>- **The Pursuit of Happiness**: </p><pre> Many people search for happiness through achievements or possessions, but studies show that sustainable happiness often comes from intangible aspects such as relationships, personal growth, and practicing mindfulness. </pre> <ol><li><ol><li><ol><li> **Joy:** </li></ol> </li></ol> </li></ol> <p>Joy, on the other hand, is often seen as a more intense, momentary feeling of delight. It's an emotion that can come unexpectedly or be sparked by something deeply meaningful or satisfying. </p><p>- **The Nature of Joy**: </p><pre> - **Instant and Intense**: Joy tends to come in bursts and is often a more intense emotion compared to happiness. For example, joy can come from witnessing a beautiful sunset, receiving an unexpected compliment, or celebrating a significant personal milestone.  - **Intrinsic**: Joy is often linked to personal experiences, meaningful connections, and moments that resonate deeply with us on an emotional or spiritual level. </pre> <p>- **Sources of Joy**: </p><pre> - **Gratitude**: Feeling joy when we acknowledge the good things in our lives, even in the smallest moments.  - **Connection**: Joy is often shared with others—through laughter, love, and mutual support.  - **Presence**: Being fully present and appreciating the moment can bring about joy, especially when we take time to savor life’s simple pleasures. </pre> <ol><li><ol><li><ol><li> **Happiness vs. Joy**: </li></ol> </li></ol> </li></ol> <p>While happiness is often a more stable emotional state, joy is more transient, spontaneous, and intense. Here’s how they compare: </p><p>- **Duration**: Happiness can last for longer periods, while joy is usually fleeting. - **Intensity**: Joy tends to be a more intense, overwhelming feeling, whereas happiness is more moderate and enduring. - **External vs. Internal**: Happiness can be influenced by external circumstances, while joy often comes from internal sources like personal reflection or emotional experiences. </p> <ol><li><ol><li><ol><li> **How to Cultivate Happiness and Joy:** </li></ol> </li></ol> </li></ol> <p>1. **Practice Gratitude**: Focusing on the positives in life—whether big or small—can boost both happiness and joy. Writing down things you’re grateful for each day can cultivate a mindset of contentment. </p><p>2. **Mindfulness**: Staying present and engaged in the moment can help you experience moments of joy more fully. Mindfulness practices like meditation or deep breathing can enhance your ability to appreciate life as it happens. </p><p>3. **Nurture Relationships**: Building strong, meaningful connections with others can increase both your happiness and joy. Spending quality time with loved ones, friends, or even pets can bring about lasting contentment and spur joyful moments. </p><p>4. **Self-Compassion**: Being kind to yourself, recognizing your strengths, and allowing yourself to take breaks or make mistakes can contribute to a more sustainable sense of happiness. </p><p>5. **Pursue Purpose**: Engaging in activities or work that feels meaningful or aligned with your values can lead to long-term happiness. It’s not just about achieving goals, but finding fulfillment in what you do. </p><p>6. **Engage in Joyful Activities**: Whether it’s dancing, hiking, cooking, or painting, find activities that bring you joy and make time for them regularly. Doing what you love is a great way to tap into those intense feelings of joy. </p><p>In summary, both happiness and joy are essential to a fulfilling life, but they manifest in different ways. Happiness tends to be more enduring and related to contentment in life, while joy is more intense and spontaneous, often tied to moments of deep emotional connection or personal meaning. Embracing both in your life can lead to a more balanced, fulfilling emotional experience. </p>",firefox;other;seg-not-firefox;seg-not-actionable;,firefox,other,en-US,"",aman.pawar31oct

I was playing a 4k YouTube video, and at 16 minutes and 10 seconds in the video froze. If I moved the cursor the pause button and all of that would come up at the bottom, but when I clicked on the option to exit full screen it did not respond. I pressed the escape button and that did get me out of full screen, but the video window did not apply the right formatting. I'll include a screenshot so that you can see what I am talking about. After exiting full screen, if you look at the bottom of the video window, the option to go back to full screen is cut off. Closing Firefox and relaunching it appears to have things working again, at least for now.

B): display all opened tabs in a page that I can set for a <em>new tab</em> page? (this sounds a great idea can't believe I can't find extension that can do that!)
