All the online instructions I find say to go to help-more trouble shooting-go to the printer section - then click clear.  However, when I try this, I can go to help-more trouble shooting-  but then no ""printing section"" shows anywhere on that page.  I'm using windows 11 fully updated and most current firefox version.  So I still cant figure out how to clear the printer queue. Any advice how to successfully do this will be much appreciated. Thanks </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",cberlin

This issue happens only in the Firefox browser, not in other browsers.  I've tried reinstalling Firefox, clearing all cache, as well as using firefox on a different computer, and also using InPrivate window.  This specific webpage has been ""repositioned"" to the far-left side of my browser window as if in its own pane (about 2-inches wide, including the vertical navigation bar).  This specific webpage's 'sections' have been cut to fit part of their sections into this 2-inch wide pane, in other words, I can see only the left-most text/icons in each section.  The content fonts and spacing have NOT been reduced in size.  See attached screenshots of the two examples (one in Firefox, one in Brave).  I don't know what I did on my keyboard to cause this, it was a complete accident.  Please assist. </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",qball792
