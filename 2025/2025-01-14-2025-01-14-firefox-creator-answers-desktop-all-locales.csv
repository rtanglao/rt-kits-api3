But in Firefox ""About Firefox"" it says ""Firefox is up to date with version 84. Need to install version 115 ESR for 32-bit tonight as some support is ending starting tomorrow. It was set to ""check for updates but let me choose to install them"". I unchecked that. Still says version 84 Firefox is ""up to date"". My sister used to handle software on this PC but she died and I'm just getting to this between estate paperwork. Apologize for the last minute request. Is there some other setting that could stop an update? Should I close all Firefox windows and re-open them? I found a ""download ESR 32-bit"" button on a Mozilla help article page, but it wanted me to decide where to save and .exe file and I wasn't sure if that determines where the program would go or if it would be a new installation and lose the existing setting. I understand an upgrade of Firefox should keep the settings. Any advice will be greatly appreciated. Thanks. </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",blueseas

This issue happens only in the Firefox browser, not in other browsers.  I've tried reinstalling Firefox, clearing all cache, as well as using firefox on a different computer, and also using InPrivate window.  This specific webpage has been ""repositioned"" to the far-left side of my browser window as if in its own pane (about 2-inches wide, including the vertical navigation bar).  This specific webpage's 'sections' have been cut to fit part of their sections into this 2-inch wide pane, in other words, I can see only the left-most text/icons in each section.  The content fonts and spacing have NOT been reduced in size.  See attached screenshots of the two examples (one in Firefox, one in Brave).  I don't know what I did on my keyboard to cause this, it was a complete accident.  Please assist. </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",qball792
