Every time I open a specific YouTube playlist on Firefox while using Mozilla VPN, my browser crashes within seconds. The crash happens only on this playlist, and oddly, it doesn’t occur when: </p><p>The VPN is turned off. I use other browsers (Chrome, Edge). I play the videos individually, outside the playlist. </p><p>The playlist in question is embedded on a page I’ve built for testing video playlists on my website (you can see it here: <a href=""https://themagistv.pro/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://themagistv.pro/</a>. The crashes happen when I try to preview the playlist directly from the site using Firefox. </p><p>I’ve already tried: </p><p>Changing Mozilla VPN server locations. Clearing the Firefox cache and cookies. Disabling all extensions and testing in Safe Mode. Checking for crashes in about:crashes (no detailed report appears). </p><p>I suspect the crash might involve a unique interaction between Firefox’s video rendering engine and Mozilla VPN’s traffic routing for playlists. Could this be a conflict with HLS streaming, or perhaps Firefox’s handling of encrypted traffic for consecutive video loading? </p><p>This issue has persisted across two different systems (Windows 11 and macOS Ventura). Has anyone encountered something similar, or are there debugging steps I can take to pinpoint the root cause? </p><p>Thank you for any insights </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",themagistv.pro

I don't know why, it keeps repeating itself (probably already a dozen times, didn't count them but it happens very often). Firefox crashes, the bug report window appears shortly after, I try to send the report, but it says error, by clicking on ""Details"" the text I posted in the Troubleshoot Information appears, but I don't know where to look at to solve it, obviously. </p><p>I tried clearing cache, disabling updates for extensions, switching to default theme and other workarounds from similar threads I've found... like scanning the PC or memory for spywares, etc. no threats were found, even the least dangerous ones (shown in green with minimum level of risk, like cookies) were fixed but firefox keeps restarting as describing. I've also changed some configuration in about:config as stated in similar topics but I can't remember which ones, they just didn't work. </p><p>Further info: Firefox version 128.6.0 esr (32 bit) Windows 10 (64bit) HP Intel i5 PC 8 GB RAM Integrated video card </p><p>The problem seems occurring more often when I'm typing or when I click into text boxes, but it also happens randomly when I leave firefox in the background. I'm honestly clueless. </p><p><br> Thank you in advance for any help </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",emanuelepepi86

But in Firefox ""About Firefox"" it says ""Firefox is up to date with version 84. Need to install version 115 ESR for 32-bit tonight as some support is ending starting tomorrow. It was set to ""check for updates but let me choose to install them"". I unchecked that. Still says version 84 Firefox is ""up to date"". My sister used to handle software on this PC but she died and I'm just getting to this between estate paperwork. Apologize for the last minute request. Is there some other setting that could stop an update? Should I close all Firefox windows and re-open them? I found a ""download ESR 32-bit"" button on a Mozilla help article page, but it wanted me to decide where to save and .exe file and I wasn't sure if that determines where the program would go or if it would be a new installation and lose the existing setting. I understand an upgrade of Firefox should keep the settings. Any advice will be greatly appreciated. Thanks. </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",blueseas
