However, when you click on any of the days, all that comes up is the first race. I contacted Oddschecker, thinking that this was there problem. They came back to me saying they could not find a fault and I should try another browser. On trying Google Chrome I found that all the races were available in the Cheltenham Festival Section. It would seem then that the problem is with Firefox. Could you look into this for me or I, and other racing followers are going to have to swap Browsers as information of the races on the 4 most important days of the year (jumps section) is unavailable through Firefox.

Every time I open a specific YouTube playlist on Firefox while using Mozilla VPN, my browser crashes within seconds. The crash happens only on this playlist, and oddly, it doesn’t occur when: </p><p>The VPN is turned off. I use other browsers (Chrome, Edge). I play the videos individually, outside the playlist. </p><p>The playlist in question is embedded on a page I’ve built for testing video playlists on my website (you can see it here: <a href=""https://themagistv.pro/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://themagistv.pro/</a>. The crashes happen when I try to preview the playlist directly from the site using Firefox. </p><p>I’ve already tried: </p><p>Changing Mozilla VPN server locations. Clearing the Firefox cache and cookies. Disabling all extensions and testing in Safe Mode. Checking for crashes in about:crashes (no detailed report appears). </p><p>I suspect the crash might involve a unique interaction between Firefox’s video rendering engine and Mozilla VPN’s traffic routing for playlists. Could this be a conflict with HLS streaming, or perhaps Firefox’s handling of encrypted traffic for consecutive video loading? </p><p>This issue has persisted across two different systems (Windows 11 and macOS Ventura). Has anyone encountered something similar, or are there debugging steps I can take to pinpoint the root cause? </p><p>Thank you for any insights </p>",firefox;crashing-and-slow-performance;seg-bug-performance-issue;,firefox,crashing-and-slow-performance,en-US,"",themagistv.pro

This issue happens only in the Firefox browser, not in other browsers.  I've tried reinstalling Firefox, clearing all cache, as well as using firefox on a different computer, and also using InPrivate window.  This specific webpage has been ""repositioned"" to the far-left side of my browser window as if in its own pane (about 2-inches wide, including the vertical navigation bar).  This specific webpage's 'sections' have been cut to fit part of their sections into this 2-inch wide pane, in other words, I can see only the left-most text/icons in each section.  The content fonts and spacing have NOT been reduced in size.  See attached screenshots of the two examples (one in Firefox, one in Brave).  I don't know what I did on my keyboard to cause this, it was a complete accident.  Please assist. </p>",firefox;sync-and-backup-confusion;sign-in;site-breakages;seg-bug-performance-issue;,firefox,site-breakages,en-US,"",qball792
