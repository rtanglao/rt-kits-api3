But I'm not here to debate genAI, I'm here because I require a work enviroment and tools that make it as easy as possible, preferably default, to avoid genAI. </p><p>I'm deeply disappointed that the Mozilla Organization has decided to add genAI to label tabs in Firefox. Even if I didn't have ethical concerns, I would still be disappointed at the bogged-down performance and genAI hallucinations that make this change categorically a downgrade. </p><p>I respect other users right to do things I find harmful, and the Organization's authority to make decisions. I treat genAI much as I treat smoking, everyone gets to make their own choices, but I have the right not to be exposed to second-hand smoke. Having genAI options default to on is like having somone blow smoke in my face, and when they can't be turned off, it is like having an acquaintence who insists on smoking in my home: I won't have them over (use their software) any more. </p><p>I'm in the process of kicking the people who smoke in my house out, and minimising my exposure to ""second-hand smoke"" (unwanted genAI). I've been a Mozilla user and proponent since the Organization was founded, and was a Netscape user before that, so I don't want to lose an old friend... but I am looking into other options. </p>",firefox-14201;firefox-1420;windows-11;firefox;customization;,firefox,customization,en-US,"",vanishag

Specifically, I'm looking for a function that doesn't just delete the pointers to the data but actively overwrites the data on the storage drive, making it unrecoverable even with forensic tools.  </p><p>I consult with various people and organizations where who want to only perform a limited function within the browser in lieu of running an entire secure wipe throughout the entire computer using software to conduct a multi-pass wipe, or Cryptographic Erasure where the encryption is destroyed.  </p><p>Some clients in the legal, financial, and government sectors require data security and sanitization dictate not just best practices, but often legal and regulatory requirements. For these professionals, when data is marked as ""deleted,"" it must be truly and permanently gone. The distinction between a standard file deletion (which often just removes the file system's reference to the data) and a secure wipe is critical. </p><p>Currently, I rely on third-party software for these tasks and often recommend solutions like Cryptographic Erasure for sanitizing entire drives by destroying the encryption keys. However, this is for the entire storage device. My question today is focused specifically on the browser level. </p><p>When a user selects ""Clear Recent History,"" does Firefox perform any overwriting passes (e.g., a single-pass zeros write), or is it a standard OS-level deletion? If this functionality doesn't exist natively, are there any trusted, Mozilla-vetted extensions that offer this level of secure data sanitization for browsing activity? </p><p>Having such a feature natively or through a recommended extension would be an invaluable asset for users who handle sensitive information and require an auditable level of data destruction within their browser environment. </p><p>Thank you for your time and any insight you can provide.  </p><p>Best to everyone here, Darren Chaker </p>",windows-11;firefox;browser-security;,firefox,browser-security,en-US,"",darrenchaker
