I previously blocked categories I do not care about such as Parenting, Cooking, and others. When doing so, for some reason some of my followed topics including Sports, NFL and NHL no longer appear along with the rest of the topics I've followed. (Please notice only followed sports-related topics disappeared...) </p><p>Checking the settings for Firefox Home shows no blocked topics (even those I have explicitly blocked), and checking what I can think to think via about:config shows me nothing I can edit to get my desired topics back. </p><p>So, I'm not sure what to edit to get my missing topics back. If they were blocked because of some bug, i cannot see blocked topics in the Firefox Home settings, so I cannot unblock them if that's what would need to be done. Has anyone else experienced this? If so, were you able to resolve it or are you aware of some BugZilla or GitHub issue I can watch for this one? </p><p>Any help will be certainly be appreciated.
