I would like to synchronize everything - especially bookmarks and payment methods - on the machines. My question is: what happens if I 'just' set synchronization active in all sections on both machines? Is one of the machines considered the 'master' machine, so its 'content' is synchronized to the other, so that content that was not on the 'master' machine is deleted? Or is everything preserved, so I have all content from both machines on both machines? Where can I possibly find more detailed information about this? Thanks in advance. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",mogensjaeger

Using youtubes stats for nerds, I found that when videos have a small viewport resolution, it starts to drop frames. (I would test with other sites but only know of youtubes stats for nerds system to detect issues like this) For example a viewport resolution of 1250x703 does not drop frames, however by unmaximising the screen and the viewport resolution drops to 681x383, it begins dropping frames. </p><p>Using my 2nd monitor which has a smaller actual resolution, the video drops frames unless fullscreened, see recordings below. <a href=""https://youtu.be/W5HcF4ywnlA"" rel=""nofollow"">Test A | Firefox Maximised but video not fullscreen</a> <a href=""https://youtu.be/ooRiiMJ6dqo"" rel=""nofollow"">Test B | Firefox Maximised and video fullscreen</a> This issue also occurs with picture-in-picture mode. </p><p><strong>Disabling hardware acceleration fixes this issue</strong> but for some reason only affects firefox, using MS Edge with ""graphics acceleration"" enabled does not result in this issue. Is this potentially an issue specifically with how firefox handles hardware acceleration? Also since I require hardware acceleration to be enabled for 3D model work in my browser, is there something I'm missing here that would allow me to keep hardware acceleration on but not have this issue? </p><p>Any help is much appreciated, thanks! </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",nathantudor72
