However, when I press the escape key, it always leaves Full Screen mode. This is annoying when browsing: whenever there is a popup which you should be able to leave with pressing 'Esc', the browser goes out of Full Screen. Why does 'Esc' lead to leaving Full Screen, when there is a dedicated key command to do this (^⌘F)? At least there should be a option to change this behaviour. </p>",mac-os-x-1015;firefox;customization;,firefox,customization,en-US,"",p.ahles
