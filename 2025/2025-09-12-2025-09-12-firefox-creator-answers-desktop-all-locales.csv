While I do change some of the Settings when I reinstall, I haven't touched the first part of the Privacy &amp; Security settings; it's left at Standard Enhanced Tracking Protection. In those same settings, neither have I checked the box under Cookies &amp; Site Settings that would make the browser delete cookies every time it's closed. </p><p>I don't use the Firefox password manager, so that is unchecked. Also, I uncheck the autofill options (address, etc.). </p><p>I think I've narrowed down the problem to one of two things. I use the Bitwarden browser extension. Also, after I reinstall Firefox, I import the back-up .json file of my bookmarks, which was last saved a month ago -- long before I had this issue. Would either of these actions be interfering with Firefox saving cookies? </p><p>The only other thing to add: the laptop computer had a system board failure about a month ago, and the board was replaced by the manufacturer. (The .json bookmarks backup I'm importing was made before the computer was sent for repair.) </p><p>Also I've carefully followed the steps in the support articles related to refreshing/uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox, so no point referring me to those.&nbsp;:-) </p>",firefox-14201;firefox-1420;windows-11;firefox;cookies-history;,firefox,cookies-history,en-US,"",lpking

Can anyone help??,"<p>Hi, whoever may read this ... </p><p>I asked friendly &amp; helpful volunteer @jscher2000 a couple of days ago about the Strange Case of the Disappearing Bookmarks that suddenly befell me in FF last week. </p><p>Last night, the Bookmarks came back - or came back in part, so to speak. ~ ~ There are outstanding problems. I hope these too resolve themselves or can be resolved in the near future, as it is a bit debilitating. </p><p>So, what are my current issues/problems with Bkmrks in FF? </p><p>1) Can't search my Bookmarks any more.  </p><p>I enter a search term in the Bkmrks Search box (whether all Bookmarks or a defined subsection/folder I have made) - never a response but blank (though I know that term is among bookmarks somewhere) - and then, the content list of that sub-folder of my Bookmarks even goes blank when I search there. (That content list returns when I click on another folder and back to that one, but that's not much consolation.) </p><p>2) Problem adding any new Bookmarks.  </p><p>Though the ""Bookmarks Star"" lights up when I try to add a new Bkmrk - suggesting it has been saved - the new saves are nowhere visible among ""Bookmarks"". Not under the folder I chose to save them to (or tried), nor anywhere else I can see under Bookmarks, such as in the general folder. </p><p>3) Can't even Export Bookmarks any more - as html or in any other format.  </p><p>I go to Manage Bookmarks, etc., and click ""Export as html"" ,,, nothing happens. There is no trace of an exported html or other file at the location where I decided to save the file.  </p><p>(To explain what may be obvious: the point of the (attempted) Exportation on this occasion is to (try to) investigate, access the saved Bookmarks, retrieve the sites, etc.) </p><p>Can anyone help - or maybe offer solace that FF might fix itself or be fixed in the near future? Like I said, it's a bit debilitating for work, research and entertainment alike. </p><p>I should perhaps add that I prefer to use a laptop (HP) where possible. </p><p>Best wishes </p><p>Peter Shaw London </p>",firefox-1420;windows-10;firefox;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1763759;1763761;1763793;1763796;1763797;1763801;1763806;1763899;1763921;1763937;,pcshawuk
