Can anyone help??,"<p>Hi, whoever may read this ... </p><p>I asked friendly &amp; helpful volunteer @jscher2000 a couple of days ago about the Strange Case of the Disappearing Bookmarks that suddenly befell me in FF last week. </p><p>Last night, the Bookmarks came back - or came back in part, so to speak. ~ ~ There are outstanding problems. I hope these too resolve themselves or can be resolved in the near future, as it is a bit debilitating. </p><p>So, what are my current issues/problems with Bkmrks in FF? </p><p>1) Can't search my Bookmarks any more.  </p><p>I enter a search term in the Bkmrks Search box (whether all Bookmarks or a defined subsection/folder I have made) - never a response but blank (though I know that term is among bookmarks somewhere) - and then, the content list of that sub-folder of my Bookmarks even goes blank when I search there. (That content list returns when I click on another folder and back to that one, but that's not much consolation.) </p><p>2) Problem adding any new Bookmarks.  </p><p>Though the ""Bookmarks Star"" lights up when I try to add a new Bkmrk - suggesting it has been saved - the new saves are nowhere visible among ""Bookmarks"". Not under the folder I chose to save them to (or tried), nor anywhere else I can see under Bookmarks, such as in the general folder. </p><p>3) Can't even Export Bookmarks any more - as html or in any other format.  </p><p>I go to Manage Bookmarks, etc., and click ""Export as html"" ,,, nothing happens. There is no trace of an exported html or other file at the location where I decided to save the file.  </p><p>(To explain what may be obvious: the point of the (attempted) Exportation on this occasion is to (try to) investigate, access the saved Bookmarks, retrieve the sites, etc.) </p><p>Can anyone help - or maybe offer solace that FF might fix itself or be fixed in the near future? Like I said, it's a bit debilitating for work, research and entertainment alike. </p><p>I should perhaps add that I prefer to use a laptop (HP) where possible. </p><p>Best wishes </p><p>Peter Shaw London </p>",firefox-1420;windows-10;firefox;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1763759;1763761;,pcshawuk
