I clicked on it out of curiosity. However, when I tried to back out of it because I don't need any profiles, it created one anyway. Then whenever I would open the browser, it would prompt me to choose a profile. I don't need any profiles, and it was annoying that there was an extra step. There was the button to turn off the choose profile screen, but I guess I was steadfast in my annoyance, so I deleted the profiles to make it unable to show up. This, however, signed me out of Firefox, and when I logged back in, none of my bookmarks or history were there. I tried the sync option because I at least still had my history on the app, but it did not work. Frankly, I don't care, and I'll just make the bookmarks again. And maybe it should have made sense that deleting the profiles would delete everything with it. But I still think it's insanely stupid to not be able to back out of creating a profile. Took up my time and simultaneously gave me more work to do. I don't want any help or support just needed to voice my feelings. </p>",firefox-14402;firefox-1440;windows-11;firefox;profiles;,firefox,profiles,en-US,"",bdunne5000

So I can't reach my websites. Firefox is still asking for the right certificate to send but that's all. This is weird because on the same version on Windows, with the same certificate, it is working. I tried newer version (144.0.2) on Debian but it is not working. The version I use at the moment is 128.14.0esr. Cloudflare is blocking the traffic because no certificate is sent.
