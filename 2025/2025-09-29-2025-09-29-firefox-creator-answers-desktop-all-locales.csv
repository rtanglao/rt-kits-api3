However, I have encountered a minor issue while using it, and I hope you can try to optimize this problem. My sidebar is always not sensitive enough. Even though I have enabled the ""Expand sidebar on hover"" option, it often fails to expand. Another issue is that it often pops up when I need to use the sidebar of some websites, even when I haven't hovered over it yet. I believe that after these two issues are fixed, the browser will become even more user-friendly! </p>",firefox-14301;firefox-1430;windows-11;firefox;browser-appearance;,firefox,browser-appearance,en-US,"",3150679216
