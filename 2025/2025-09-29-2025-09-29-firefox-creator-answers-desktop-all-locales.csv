I love what Mozilla does for users like me. That’s exactly why I want to raise something: I keep seeing the word “chatbot” show up for Firefox’s new AI-powered assistants (like the sidebar and what’s coming next). But let’s be honest—“chatbot” belongs to the days of robotic customer service and scripted dead-ends. </p><p>What we have now in Firefox—powered by real LLMs (Large Language Models)—is a whole different species. Calling these assistants “chatbots” just doesn’t fit. It sells short what LLM-based assistants can do: they’re powerful, context-aware, and, at times, strikingly human in their conversation. New users might miss the true magic if we stick to old language. So why not call them “AI assistants,” “LLM-powered assistants,” or just “AI” instead? It would help everyone see the progress, and show how Mozilla’s still leading, not just catching up. </p><p>I’ll leave it open for discussion, but I hope others feel this shift too. Language shapes how we see these things—and sometimes it takes a Singular Fella (or maybe two) to nudge the world past old memes. Thanks for hearing me out, and here’s to a future where our assistants, and our words, keep getting smarter. </p><p>—Robert Beck </p>",firefox-14301;firefox-1430;linux;firefox;undefined;,firefox,undefined,en-US,1768310;,rfbeck

However, I have encountered a minor issue while using it, and I hope you can try to optimize this problem. My sidebar is always not sensitive enough. Even though I have enabled the ""Expand sidebar on hover"" option, it often fails to expand. Another issue is that it often pops up when I need to use the sidebar of some websites, even when I haven't hovered over it yet. I believe that after these two issues are fixed, the browser will become even more user-friendly! </p>",firefox-14301;firefox-1430;windows-11;firefox;browser-appearance;,firefox,browser-appearance,en-US,"",3150679216
