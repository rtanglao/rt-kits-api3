This is a recent phenomenon.  I have another computer in the office I've turned off FF updates (obvious reasons) and the animation works fine.  It worked on my computer until recently.  I'm so exhausted with FF updates that break things, it's getting as bad as Windows.  I've run FF in troubleshoot mode, no good.  I've added this primary domain to exceptions to enhanced tracking, no good.  Nothing works so I assume it's Firefox (may not be).  But v129.0.2 works fine, in this respect (streaming the animation loops of GOES West). </p><p>Does anyone know what configuration or setting I can explore to make this work again? &nbsp;:-( </p><p>Thanks, </p>",firefox-14501;firefox-1450;windows-10;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",BPaul_H

I haven't been able to find anything of the sort on my own, so i fear maybe there is no actual way other than doing it one by one. But, is there a way to add all of my currently open tabs in firefox android app, to my bookmarks (or collections, maybe), instead of having to select them one by one? Or, in its defect, a way to select all tabs, given that there seems to be no button to quickly select all currently open tabs? At this point, if anyone knows a firefox extension/add-on that works on mobile that could do that, i would deeply appreciate it. </p><p>Thanks in advance, i just want a way to not have to select my 100+ open tabs by hand since it genuinely seems like a waste of effort for me and i would rather spend that energy into migrating to another browser altoghether. </p>",firefox;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1784984;1785009;1785024;,Alex.E_45
