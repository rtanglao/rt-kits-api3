Neither one does anything at all for me now.  The ""right-click on the device in the sidebar"" sounded SO promising, but it does not cause anything at all to happen.  And checking the ""sync tabs"" box does indeed make them all show up in the sidebar list, but does not open anything.  So besides clicking on each of the hundreds of tabs listed, how can I do this, or is it just another FF functionality lost to time? </p>",firefox-14502;firefox-1450;firefox;sync-failure;,firefox,sync-failure,en-US,"",jeff.home

I've added this primary domain to exceptions to enhanced tracking, no good.  Nothing works so I assume it's Firefox (may not be).

I haven't been able to find anything of the sort on my own, so i fear maybe there is no actual way other than doing it one by one. But, is there a way to add all of my currently open tabs in firefox android app, to my bookmarks (or collections, maybe), instead of having to select them one by one? Or, in its defect, a way to select all tabs, given that there seems to be no button to quickly select all currently open tabs? At this point, if anyone knows a firefox extension/add-on that works on mobile that could do that, i would deeply appreciate it. </p><p>Thanks in advance, i just want a way to not have to select my 100+ open tabs by hand since it genuinely seems like a waste of effort for me and i would rather spend that energy into migrating to another browser altoghether. </p>",firefox;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1784984;1785009;1785024;,Alex.E_45
