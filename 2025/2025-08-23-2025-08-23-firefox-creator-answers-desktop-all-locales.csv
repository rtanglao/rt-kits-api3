I would like to comment here about what forum means. I'm subsequently adding this as a post to 'forum' via another open window, of same page. I do believe these are related with my input on Mozilla, but it can't all fit in a single forum post. </p><p>This is the first time I've attempted to add to a forum on Mozilla.  I'm half certain that this will arrive to a forum.  I'm 80% certain that this will be scrutinized through a vetting process of 'approvability'... prior to it's appearance online &lt;publicly&gt;.  I'm really unsure completely though, if this is a comment to a technician [or siphoning this [for department] is 'teamwork' from a variety of work-from-home gaming chairs...  And then it may be in a community forum. </p><p>This is all probably not really a huge deal, of course.  I do think it will go to a forum.  But it's realistic to put all this in here, since I really can describe how I wouldn't tell easily. The screenshots I'm including show that I am logged in.  Show that there are plugins.  Plugins which can't work on this computer.  Perhaps it is due to it being a library computer.  But it is accessible and non-functional none-theless.  Another would depict my inability to know that I am logged into the browser. </p><p>These are the chronological events of this morning, which led me to be here with this in essay-format. </p> <ol><li> 1. I have opened a separate desktop window on this DELL, suing Win{windows}+Tab.  I began running Chrome Windows in quadrants.  I had logged into my dual accounts &amp; begun remodeling my settings.  I did configure browser figure settings as well here; hoping this would link to my next logons on any computer! </li><li> 2. I Win.Tab or cmd[i think on mac?]tab to origin desktop (here).  i decide to utilize mozilla.  I'm incomplete here with my formal understanding of if a microsoft corporation or abc has any link with Mozilla.  I vaguely recall being slightly-informed here.  I could open my Proton and Outlook drives, but opt-in <em>on </em> settling with the google chrome account.  I begin continuing perusing through settings of the 'menu' in Mozilla browser [which is frequently known as a 'more' or 'menu' icon in a task bar adjacent to URL field. (this would be similar with Vertical tabs &amp; w/o).  I am intent on signing into Mozilla with my Google, completely unaware of if it could be feasible.  I get down to a setting.  This Setting is depicted below in a screen-shot image-upload.  Thank You. </li><li> 3. I have found that I am able to deselect this 'update while browser is querying' there below.  or however it read.  So in that I may leave it to the Auto-Update whilst utilizing.  At this point, I am still unaware of if I'd be able to sign-into this browser.  I was (as I've denoted) curious in accessing a page or button of menu... enabling me to create a Mozilla Account -formal to this browser &amp; this forum.  I began losing interest. </li><li> 4. I found more settings and completed my crude daily-configuration.  As it is I can deal with it for a week or so; but my unreasonable <em>demands</em> as a computerizing citizen wouldn't prevent me from pushing for <strong>more.</strong> </li></ol> <p>I found extensions.  I'm sorry is plugins the correct term?&nbsp;:-) I began snapping the screenshots once I recognized that these should be accounted for within the Tech community of Mozilla [i really won't have any qualms should this not go to 'forum'].  I did this also not-aware of if I'd be able to upload any images.  &amp; of course there wouldn't be an email....  I found luck though which brought me here </p><p>In summary: The accessibility of this function Mozilla, on a commonly configured &amp; well-shared\secure\established computer-based system within a decent network of Libraries across the District of Columbia...  requires perhaps less attention that you'd expect but some configuration IMHO. {In My Humble Opinion} I'd image that creating the login (keychains? or codices or account???) as a configuration within the known network of Google preliminary? --or modern &amp; tested configuration... proven to be what is seen as functional across the globe; could be sync'd respectively with a click of button's.  perhaps a link? which is via a menu of a browser.  or perhaps this must be a 3rd party application, and therefore... accessible as a setting via our Google Accounts data &amp; privacy tab.  a configuration means the costly investment ... and how this can exist is a neutral territory for a shared geek-complex the world can continue to peruse.   </p><p>This would be fitting, being able to access mozilla though a readily configured browser.  But, if the 'browser' would need to function more as a modernized App.  Less of a desktop application (&amp; compatible?)... then the cultured world of Smarts' would be okay with this.  I hope that the ideas come across in a harmonious manner via community feedback/suggestions &amp; patronatism.  Pragmatically.
