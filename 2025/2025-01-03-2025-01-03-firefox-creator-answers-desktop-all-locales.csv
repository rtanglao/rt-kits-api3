Three days ago I got three pop-up messages claiming to be from Mozilla Firefox with the logo in the top left corner and the words Mozilla Firefox. All three contained various warnings: – Virus detected! – Alert! – You could be infected! Then they each said to ""click here to resolve."" And an address of some type which was a long string of random letters and the words merge network protocol. I did not click on any of these, nor did I click the ""dismiss"" bar that they had. I did try the X in the top right corner of each pop-up but they did disappear for one second and were replaced by another warning of some type. These pop-ups are on the right side of the page and block information that I need. They don't go away and stay with me no matter where else I go. Turning off the computer and restarting allows me to travel the Internet without the pop-ups, but as soon as I signed into Firefox they reappear. I don't believe that they are from Mozilla and though I have reported use of their trademark to them, I have not received any reply. I'm desperate to get rid of these. Can someone help? </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1699707;1699726;,catdubie
