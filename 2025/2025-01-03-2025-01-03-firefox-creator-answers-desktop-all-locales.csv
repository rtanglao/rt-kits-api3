I'm currently in dialogue with Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), via their 'Director' email address. as they use this device for access to many features and to all communication, comments, complaints etc. The reCAPTCha window and message of things to verify doesn't appear at all, eg, no phrase like:select all traffic lights; and no window of 9 images, just the message that the site uses ReCAPTCha. But it isn't just ABC, it is all sites that use this verification device. I contacted ABC because they are a large organisation with a dedicated IT team.  I take the Firefox upgrades currently 133.03 - 64 bit with Window 10 My concern is now that this has occurred for so long, that even ABC are saying this is caused by Firefox, not Google. I've pointed out how ludicrous that statement is, eg, why would Firefox create such a problem, whereas Goggle has a vested interested in not resolving it as many will switch to Google platform products. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1699659;1699661;,longinthetooth

When a second video is selected and begins to play, it is not recognized (""No media to process in current tab).  F5 Refresh does not change this behavior. I've tried clearing cookies &amp; site data, cached files &amp; pages, history, and site settings. The only workaround is to close Firefox completely and restart. I've tried going back to older versions of Firefox and Video DLH. Prior to about 4-6 weeks ago there was no problem. For comparison, VDLH works just fine in Chrome on this same site. </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",tomcannady
