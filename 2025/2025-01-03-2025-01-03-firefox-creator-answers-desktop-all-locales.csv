When a second video is selected and begins to play, it is not recognized (""No media to process in current tab).  F5 Refresh does not change this behavior. I've tried clearing cookies &amp; site data, cached files &amp; pages, history, and site settings. The only workaround is to close Firefox completely and restart. I've tried going back to older versions of Firefox and Video DLH. Prior to about 4-6 weeks ago there was no problem. For comparison, VDLH works just fine in Chrome on this same site. </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",tomcannady
