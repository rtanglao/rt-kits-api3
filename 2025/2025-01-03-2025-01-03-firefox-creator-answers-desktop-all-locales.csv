Three days ago I got three pop-up messages claiming to be from Mozilla Firefox with the logo in the top left corner and the words Mozilla Firefox. All three contained various warnings: – Virus detected! – Alert! – You could be infected! Then they each said to ""click here to resolve."" And an address of some type which was a long string of random letters and the words merge network protocol. I did not click on any of these, nor did I click the ""dismiss"" bar that they had. I did try the X in the top right corner of each pop-up but they did disappear for one second and were replaced by another warning of some type. These pop-ups are on the right side of the page and block information that I need. They don't go away and stay with me no matter where else I go. Turning off the computer and restarting allows me to travel the Internet without the pop-ups, but as soon as I signed into Firefox they reappear. I don't believe that they are from Mozilla and though I have reported use of their trademark to them, I have not received any reply. I'm desperate to get rid of these. Can someone help? </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1699707;,catdubie

I'm currently in dialogue with Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), via their 'Director' email address. as they use this device for access to many features and to all communication, comments, complaints etc. The reCAPTCha window and message of things to verify doesn't appear at all, eg, no phrase like:select all traffic lights; and no window of 9 images, just the message that the site uses ReCAPTCha. But it isn't just ABC, it is all sites that use this verification device. I contacted ABC because they are a large organisation with a dedicated IT team.  I take the Firefox upgrades currently 133.03 - 64 bit with Window 10 My concern is now that this has occurred for so long, that even ABC are saying this is caused by Firefox, not Google. I've pointed out how ludicrous that statement is, eg, why would Firefox create such a problem, whereas Goggle has a vested interested in not resolving it as many will switch to Google platform products. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1699659;1699661;,longinthetooth
