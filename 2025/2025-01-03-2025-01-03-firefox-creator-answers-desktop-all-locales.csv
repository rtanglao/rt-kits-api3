Three days ago I got three pop-up messages claiming to be from Mozilla Firefox with the logo in the top left corner and the words Mozilla Firefox. All three contained various warnings: â Virus detected! â Alert! â You could be infected! Then they each said to ""click here to resolve."" And an address of some type which was a long string of random letters and the words merge network protocol. I did not click on any of these, nor did I click the ""dismiss"" bar that they had. I did try the X in the top right corner of each pop-up but they did disappear for one second and were replaced by another warning of some type. These pop-ups are on the right side of the page and block information that I need. They don't go away and stay with me no matter where else I go. Turning off the computer and restarting allows me to travel the Internet without the pop-ups, but as soon as I signed into Firefox they reappear. I don't believe that they are from Mozilla and though I have reported use of their trademark to them, I have not received any reply. I'm desperate to get rid of these.

When a second video is selected and begins to play, it is not recognized (""No media to process in current tab).  F5 Refresh does not change this behavior. I've tried clearing cookies &amp; site data, cached files &amp; pages, history, and site settings. The only workaround is to close Firefox completely and restart. I've tried going back to older versions of Firefox and Video DLH. Prior to about 4-6 weeks ago there was no problem.
