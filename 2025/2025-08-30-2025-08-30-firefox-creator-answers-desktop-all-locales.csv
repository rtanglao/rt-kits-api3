The billing email? Or maybe the actual login input? </p><p>Right now, Firefox decides that the billing field is a better candidate for autofill. Which makes me wonder… is your detection logic just matching the first input with a name that fits /^email$/? </p><p>Because if that’s the case — seriously — maybe someone working on the heuristics should pause and think. Blasting credentials into random inputs just because the name looks vaguely like ""email"" is not a smart strategy. </p><p>This isn’t meant to insult anyone. It’s a bug report. And a bit of constructive sarcasm, yes — because this has a real impact on UX and user trust. </p><p>Attached screenshot is from my dev environment.

It completely omits the page's URL. This is the prompt that is sent:  </p><p><em>* * I’m on page “&lt;tabTitle&gt;Get Support | Mozilla Support&lt;/tabTitle&gt;” with “&lt;selection&gt;&lt;/selection&gt;” selected. </em> </p><p><br> </p> <ul><li> * Please summarize the selection using precise and concise language. Use headers and bulleted lists in the summary, to make it scannable. Maintain the meaning and factual accuracy. <em> </em> </li></ul> <p><br> </p><p>This is a major issue because without the URL, the AI cannot access the full context of the page. It can't scrape the content, analyze the structure, or understand the full context of the selected text, which is often crucial for generating accurate and comprehensive summaries or answers. The feature, as it is, relies entirely on the user manually selecting a large block of text, which is clunky and often insufficient. </p><p>Proposed Improvements </p><pre>   Include the URL in the Prompt: The most critical improvement would be to automatically include the page's URL in the prompt sent to the AI. This would allow the AI to properly ""see"" and interact with the full page, making tasks like ""Summarize"" much more effective. </pre> <pre>   Allow Custom Prompt Editing: A second, highly beneficial feature would be the ability for users to customize the prompt before it's sent. This would give users more control over the AI's output and enable more creative and specific uses of the feature beyond the pre-set options. This would also allow users to manually insert the URL if needed, as a workaround for the current limitation. </pre> <p>These changes would transform the ""Ask AI"" feature from a novelty that only works on selected text to a genuinely powerful tool for research, content analysis, and productivity. </p><p>Thank you for considering this request. </p>",firefox-1420;windows-10;firefox;customization;,firefox,customization,en-US,1760687;1760691;1760700;,knostikos
