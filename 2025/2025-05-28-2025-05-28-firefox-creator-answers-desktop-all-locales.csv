I moved back again to Firefox to maintain the adblockers that Chrome so graciously crippled. </p><p>Now, with that out of the way, I noticed that sites that have autoplaying mp4 files that basically act like good old-fashioned gifs tend to cause the firefox to freeze. </p><p>It is a strange freeze though - the whole browser becomes VISUALLY unresponsive, but if I click blindly, say to close the tab or if I scroll up or down it appears to work. How do I know? Well, if I drag the mouse to the bottom of the taskbar in Windows and bring up the thumbnail... It unfreezes the browser - showing the changes I made blindly, at least until it freezes again when the MP4 files start playing again. </p><p>The issue is not consistent either. Sometimes it goes through the mp4 files perfectly fine, but usually scrolling through any thread containing embedded MP4 videos, like reaction clips and the like, is literally impossible due to the rate of freezes. </p><p>I have narrowed down the culprit - the issues ceases when I disable the hardware acceleration, but I do not find it to be an acceptable solution in a long term - because disabling it causes various videos to play at noticeably lower and unpleasant framerates. </p><p>I'm fairly convinced it is NOT a hardware or software issue on my end - it is a brand new and powerful PC with a fresh install of Windows 11 and all the drivers are up to date, AMD GPU.  Unless the issue is with some obscure codec, perhaps.  However, the issue does not persist on any other browser I used. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",Hides

Then went to a bank site to download a CSV file of transactions - something I've been doing for many years.  I click the button to 'Export Activity (CSV)' and then a pop-up window comes asking me if I want to open or save the file.   Another window opens, headed 'Enter name of file to save to' and shows me the folders and has boxes at the bottom 'File name' and 'Save as type'. Here is where the problem starts.  The 'Save as type' box usually has CSV in it, but now it's greyed out. The only option there is 'All files'. So I have to select that, and after I press OK then another window comes up giving the folder path and filename and saying 'File not found, Check the filename and try again'.   I also get a Windows Security message saying 'Unauthorised changes blocked, Controlled folder access blocked firefox.exe from making changes'.   I should stress again that none of this has ever happened before so I suspect it must be related to the Firefox update.  I was able to download from the same site on Microsoft Edge with no problems. </p>",firefox-1390;firefox;download-and-save;,firefox,download-and-save,en-US,"",mail2362
