I moved back again to Firefox to maintain the adblockers that Chrome so graciously crippled. </p><p>Now, with that out of the way, I noticed that sites that have autoplaying MPEG-4 files that basically act like good old-fashioned gifs tend to cause the firefox to freeze. </p><p>It is a strange freeze though - the whole browser becomes VISUALLY unresponsive, but if I click blindly, say to close the tab or if I scroll up or down it appears to work. How do I know? Well, if I drag the mouse to the bottom of the taskbar in Windows and bring up the thumbnail... It unfreezes the browser - showing the changes I made blindly, at least until it freezes again when the MPEG-4 files start playing again. The freezes are not temporary either - I need to unfreeze through this thumbnail method I described above - otherwise it stays frozen.  </p><p>The issue is not consistent either. Sometimes it goes through the MPEG-4 files perfectly fine, but usually scrolling through any thread containing embedded MPEG-4 videos, like reaction clips and the like, is literally impossible due to the rate of freezes. </p><p>Furthermore - this issue does not seem to occur when MPEG-4 videos are embedded on site itself, but freezes occur when the files appear in comments on imageboards and such. </p><p>I have narrowed down the culprit - the issues ceases when I disable the hardware acceleration, but I do not find it to be an acceptable solution in a long term - because disabling it causes various videos to play at noticeably lower and unpleasant framerates. </p><p>I'm fairly convinced it is NOT a hardware or software issue on my end - it is a brand new and powerful PC with a fresh install of Windows 11 and all the drivers are up to date, AMD GPU.  Unless the issue is with some obscure codec, perhaps.  However, the issue does not persist on any other browser I used. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",Hides

The 'Save as type' box usually has CSV in it, but now it's greyed out. The only option there is 'All files'. So I have to select that, and after I press OK then another window comes up giving the folder path and filename and saying 'File not found, Check the filename and try again'.   I also get a Windows Security message saying 'Unauthorised changes blocked, Controlled folder access blocked firefox.exe from making changes'.   I should stress again that none of this has ever happened before so I suspect it must be related to the Firefox update.

It only happens when I have a Youtube video running, Youtube can be open in a tab but not running a video with no issue. Is it possible that the update request is locking up my PC? Is it being caused by Youtube? Any suggestions on how to stop it happening short of changing browsers?  No error messages. No crash report.
