However, I recently experienced a serious issue due to how Firefox handles saved sessions, cookies, and multiple logged-in accounts. </p><p>I had two Gmail accounts saved in Firefox, both of which were at some point used to access Fiverr accounts — one active, and one previously disabled. During a session where I was logged into my active Fiverr account, my internet went down temporarily. When I refreshed Fiverr after the connection came back, Firefox reloaded a session that appeared to be linked to the disabled Fiverr account — even though I never intentionally accessed it. </p><p>As a result, Fiverr’s automated system flagged my active account for being ""connected"" to a banned one. This has had a direct negative impact on my freelancing career — my account was permanently flagged, and I lost access to valuable clients and my work history. </p><p>I understand that session management and cookie handling are standard browser features, but I want to highlight how important session isolation and protection from unintended auto-logins are, especially for freelancers and remote workers using platforms like Fiverr, Upwork, and others. </p><p>Please consider offering better controls or clearer separation between accounts (e.g., warning before auto-loading saved sessions, stronger isolation per Gmail/Fiverr session, or more powerful multi-account browsing containers by default). </p><p>This small technical behavior has led to a major professional loss. </p><p>Thank you for your work on this browser, and I hope you’ll take this feedback seriously to help prevent this from affecting others in the future. </p><p>Sincerely, A frustrated (but still hopeful) Firefox user </p><p>– Ehsan, Freelancer </p>",firefox-1400;windows-10;firefox;browser-security;,firefox,browser-security,en-US,"",ranaehsan17030

So when emails were going nowhere and set MFA was systematically destroyed -- I turn to FireFox ESR personal to ensure my data remains secure among those world class suppliers I have trusted for years.   </p><p>I trust FF but the subtle ways in which our WIndows10Pro is trying to wipe out all relationship with other OEMs - I want to be sure that FF is set up as it should be.   It appears even in FF private browser window - that the OS or Copiliot is attempting to destroy that also as part of what is some scheme according to bank Fraud experts I've consulted as a scheme to destroy Win10 home office usage and force move to WIn11. </p><p>My home PC has supported many many individuals and organizations.  I cannot believe what I have been put through,.  Still rebuilding relationships with the worldclass firms I rely on.   </p><p>What are the definitive steps that will ensure that data cannot be manipulated and OS cannot randomly overwrite desperately needed Disabilty / Accessiblity changes needed to even see the ""simulations?' at 1-2point font.  This activity is allegedly CoPilot - which would be the last place I would suspect.  The violations of trust and data integrity go way beyond what you might imagine.   </p><p>How to protect from any and all deceptive practices where what I""m seeing and doing are not being alterered in such ways that prevent me from supporting a Hipaa client because a rogue software misrepresnts and destroys valuable data and more importantly TRUST.   </p><p>Part of undoing damage due to Coplilot is to follow those I trust - so regarding Firefox I download it from official Mozilla / Firefox - current ESR version for Personal use.   - I try now to do most work that requires a modicum of importance - and still each moment there's some deceptive something or other trying to deceive me into excluding Firefox.   </p><p>I'm not here to blame Copilot - and MS accountability for this is reported via the public domain and several professionals I've consulted.  Feeling handicapped with handicapped devices.  Totally hostage to a system that wants to ensure everything we do is via Microsoft.   </p><p>There's a time and a place for security we can trust.  I had security keys and MFA out the wazoo.  It's taken amonth to even begin to get back to a secure wiped licensed Win10 system.  And the first job was to ensure the OS could not mess with Firefox.  Something is tearing at that already.  My only involvement with MS at this point is to ensure they don't mess with FF's integrity.  The FF account is an outlook address so pls LMK if that is hurting rather than helping.  </p><p>I cant do anything if trust is violated and data is changed intentionally by a rogue software.  Plus the overwritiung of accessiblity / disabilty modifications is unconscionable. </p><p>HOW TO KNOW I'M NOT MISSING THE LATEST TRICKS DESIGNED to take away FIrefox or others who we trust. </p>",windows-10;firefox;browser-security;,firefox,browser-security,en-US,"",tlsel
