I've been using ESR115 on Windows 7 64bit for a while now, at lease since <a href=""http://Chase.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Chase.com</a> enhanced their online banking browser requirements. But now, Nov 6th, <a href=""http://Chase.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Chase.com</a> updated their online banking site, yet again. ESR115 no longer works. Just thought I'd let you guys know in case an update to ESR115 is needed. </p><p>I tried to update to a newer ESR version but nothing is available. I'll probably have to buy a new PC since this mobo doesn't have a TPM chip and I'd rather go to Win11 than to Win10. Thanks! </p><p>Mark </p>",firefox-115290;firefox-11529;windows-7;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",mark5r
