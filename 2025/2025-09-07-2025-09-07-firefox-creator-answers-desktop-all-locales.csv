I recently bought a new laptop, but I’ve run into an issue. On my old laptop, I was able to use multiple Firefox profiles at the same time—similar to how Chrome handles profiles. </p><p>On the old setup, when I clicked the three-line (menu) button, I could see my second profile there and switch between profiles with just one click. After installing Firefox on my new laptop, I can’t find that option anymore. </p><p>I know some of you might suggest using about:profiles to switch profiles. Yes, I’m aware of that method, but I find it inconvenient because I’d have to type about:profiles every time, which is a bit of a time waste for me. I really want the same quick-switch option I had before. </p><p>How can I get that functionality back? Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! </p><p>I’m already using the latest version (142.0.1, 64-bit). </p><p>Thanks </p>",firefox-14201;firefox-1420;windows-11;firefox;profiles;,firefox,profiles,en-US,1762512;1762562;1762566;1762589;1762599;,rpartho750
