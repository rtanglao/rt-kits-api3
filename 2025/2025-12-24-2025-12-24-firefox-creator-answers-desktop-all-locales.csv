If I ""slowly"" scroll back up to the ""quiet"" area (midway to top of screen) it will behave normally. I try and watch the video I had been watching when it went nuts, happens again. I 'think' I got by it the other night...somehow I don't think it was me, rather it just happened to snap back into place. It had been happening more frequently several months ago where it was a real problem, went through all the normally accepted ways of cleaning, checking and hunting for others having a similar problem. The latter is where I have normally found the best and most recent inquiry similar to mine. Good part is it's fast and I know it's not just me. Bad part is it's fast and nobody has had time to answer it.  Then it suddenly just stopped. In fact, I had forgotten about it! The bane of my daily computer life for weeks was suddenly gone and I forgot about it???? Well, it reminded me today, it's back. Any suggestions?
