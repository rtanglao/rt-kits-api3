(Reason: CORS request did not succeed). Status code: (null). </li></ul> <p>I suspect that the CORS blocking is a result of the first (SSL) error, AI also told me that I can configure my remote server/resource (e.g., using Apache, Nginx, or PHP) to include the necessary CORS headers in its responses and indeed the remote server of mine has such lines inside a PHP script that is receiving the request: header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *'); header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods: POST'); header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *'); </p><p>The remote resource (server) is using self-signed SSL certificate and it is referenced using IP instead of a domain name. </p><p>When I try to do the same  request via Private browsing window (without extensions), there is no NS_ERROR about self-signed cert. but only CORS one. When I try browser Librewolf 137.0.2-1 (my FF version is older: 128.9.0), the request is NOT blocked, is OK.. </p><p>My main aim is not to avoid blocking in my browser, but in all main browsers for everyone. </p><p>Is it so that this kind of blocking is default behavior in browsers? Is there please any way to avoid that, beside getting a domain name and CA signed SSL certificate? </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",lkeewp

Most Kaspersky Plus előfizetésem van és ez a védelmi program felajánlotta, hogy adjam hozzá a ""Kaspersky védelem"" kiegészítőt a Firefoxhoz. Megnéztem, de a Google Chrome-ban  nincs lehetőség Kaspersky védelmi kiegészítő hozzáadására.  Mindezek miatt, valamint (egy-két incidenstől eltekintve) a Mozillával korábban szerzett jó tapasztalataim okán felmerült bennem, hogy érdemes lenne-e visszatérnem a Firefoxhoz mint alapértelmezett böngésző:  <strong>1. Összességében a Mozilla Firefox biztonságosabb mint a Google Chrome? </strong> <strong>2. Melyik böngészőben vannak a jelszavak nagyobb biztonságban?</strong> <strong>2.1. Egyáltalán szabad-e / javasolt-e bármelyik böngészőben jelszavakat tárolni? Ha nem, akkor Bitwarden-t vagy  hasonló jelszó kezelőt érdemes alkalmazni a jelszavak és bejelentkezések biztonságos kezeléséhez? </strong> <strong>3. Melyik az a 2-3 fő indok ami a Chrome ellen és/vagy a Mozilla mellett szól?</strong><em> </em> (3.1. Végezetül egy költői kérdés: ha a fenti 3. kérdést a Chrome fórumon fordított előjellel tenném fel, vajon milyen válaszokat kapnék ott?) </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,hu,"",tamas.katona
