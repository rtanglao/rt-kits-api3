Every tip I see tells me to ""just request the desktop version of the site!""; only, that's ONLY a feature in the mobile Firefox app... which I'm NOT using.  Every time I go to Youtube's home page: it starts me scrolled down as though it's trying to display on a portrait-mode screen, and only shows 3 videos per row.  It's clearly trying to display on a mobile device.  If I hold down F5, and force it to refresh for a dozen or so times, for a split second it will display properly before re-setting to mobile mode. </p><p>Things I've already done so don't suggest them: - Force refresh teh page - Alreadyd one, didn't work - Clear Website cookies &amp; site data - Already done, didn't work - Restart Firefox - Already done, didn't work - Clear browser cache - Already done, didn't work - Open new private window - Already done, didn't work - Restart Firefox in safe mode - Already done, didn't work - Restore default Firefox theme - Already done, didn't work </p><p>The problem apepars to be that Youtube has just reclassified my browser/device as mobile and there's nothing I can do to change it. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",luke_nx01

Things are lagging, primarily on You Tube (for the last 4 or more days), and normally updates don't leave as much time in between updates. Anyone know what's going on? Will it ever update or do I need to leave for another browser? </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,1728882;1728888;,fittsjeni
