However, it takes multiple clicks to get to this information in the reviews, and there is very little curation.  </p><p>I understand it is likely highly infeasible to audit extensions for malware in any comprehensive way, however I definitely feel that there is room for enhancement of the present processes.  </p><p>I think this extension search process should be more proactive in informing users of these events. For example, rather than just displaying a star rating next to the extension name, displaying chronological trends would be more information-dense. Like if recent reviews are trending negative. This could also reward and incentivise extensions which are properly supported, (and not malware), displaying that their reviews are maintaining / increasing positivity over time.  </p><p>A supporting feature could be publicising changes of ownership of an extension prominently - ""This extension has changed ownership N times, the most recent change was Y-date to X-owner. Reviews have trended Z since that time"".  </p><p>Is something like this being worked on already? If so I am interested in contributing to it. </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1712657;,jaymacbarn
