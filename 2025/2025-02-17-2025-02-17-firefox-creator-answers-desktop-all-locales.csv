I haven't done this for a while and the interface has changed, so I'm not sure how it works. </p><p>I want to move my Firefox profile to a directory in the Documents library to simplify backup. Following the Mozilla instructions I found, I opened about:profiles and clicked the Create New Profile button. I deleted the contents of the directory that Create New Profile created and copied the contents of the default profile directory to it. The last step is to tell Firefox to use my new profile instead of its default. </p><p>But the about:profile page lists three profiles: <em>default-release</em>, default, and my new one. The first two have a <em>Set as default profile</em> button; the last does not. So it appears that I can tell Firefox to use the <em>default-release</em> profile or the <em>default</em> profile, but there's no way I can tell it to use my new profile. I can only <em>Launch profile in new browser</em> -- presumably something I'll have to do every time I run Firefox. </p><p>This makes no sense. How can I tell Firefox to use my new profile -- not to launch a new browser with it, but to use it, period? If I can't, why can't I? Every version of Firefox I've ever installed up to now allowed this. </p><p>Also, the <em>default-release</em> profile section of about:profiles has the note ""This is the profile in use and it cannot be deleted."" So it appears that Firefox uses the <em>default-release</em> profile instead of the <em>default</em> profile as its default profile. What <em>is</em> the <em>default-release</em> profile? Why isn't the <em>default</em> profile the default profile? </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",Jonathan.H

However, it takes multiple clicks to get to this information in the reviews, and there is very little curation.  </p><p>I understand it is likely highly infeasible to audit extensions for malware in any comprehensive way, however I definitely feel that there is room for enhancement of the present processes.  </p><p>I think this extension search process should be more proactive in informing users of these events. For example, rather than just displaying a star rating next to the extension name, displaying chronological trends would be more information-dense. Like if recent reviews are trending negative. This could also reward and incentivise extensions which are properly supported, (and not malware), displaying that their reviews are maintaining / increasing positivity over time.  </p><p>A supporting feature could be publicising changes of ownership of an extension prominently - ""This extension has changed ownership N times, the most recent change was Y-date to X-owner. Reviews have trended Z since that time"".  </p><p>Is something like this being worked on already? If so I am interested in contributing to it. </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1712657;,jaymacbarn
