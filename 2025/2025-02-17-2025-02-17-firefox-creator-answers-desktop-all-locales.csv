I want my start page black but all you have are other colors, abstract, etc.  These wallpaper choices are stored somewhere inside Firefox 135.  I want to remove them all.  Also after searching from Firefox start page, the background turns an ugly navy blue.  Here would be a great example of where solid black would also look better.  So how do you make both of these pages display only black, white or gray?  With NO other options or clutter.  I do not want to see any other colors or designs one of your interns picked out. </p>",firefox;search-tag-and-share;,firefox,search-tag-and-share,en-US,"",ghxc7ofw

However, it takes multiple clicks to get to this information in the reviews, and there is very little curation.  </p><p>I understand it is likely highly infeasible to audit extensions for malware in any comprehensive way, however I definitely feel that there is room for enhancement of the present processes.  </p><p>I think this extension search process should be more proactive in informing users of these events. For example, rather than just displaying a star rating next to the extension name, displaying chronological trends would be more information-dense. Like if recent reviews are trending negative. This could also reward and incentivise extensions which are properly supported, (and not malware), displaying that their reviews are maintaining / increasing positivity over time.  </p><p>A supporting feature could be publicising changes of ownership of an extension prominently - ""This extension has changed ownership N times, the most recent change was Y-date to X-owner. Reviews have trended Z since that time"".  </p><p>Is something like this being worked on already? If so I am interested in contributing to it. </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1712657;,jaymacbarn
