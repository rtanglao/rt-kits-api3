I have extensively googled the issue and tried pretty much all the remedies I could find: just click on the place holder icon to refresh, delete the bookmark and place it again, use the Checkmark extension, check the integrity of the favicon DB, delete the favicon and places.sqlite files, clear the cache. Doing these things repeatedly and repeatedly restarting Firefox, I could claw back a number of my icons, but now things have stalled and there a quite a few holdouts that refuse to update. I'm also using Firefox on Windows without these issues.
