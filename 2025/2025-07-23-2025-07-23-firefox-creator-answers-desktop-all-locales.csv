Cool, I decided to uninstall Firefox and make a clean install, so I have space to delete the folder too. </p><p>2. Long story short, it didnt work. I removed Firefox and tried to delete that folder, but wait for it, yeah I cant because I need permission from MYSELF. Awesome stuff. </p><p>3. I decided to use safe mode, so I used run command to run msconfig and I changed it to boot in to safe mode. But wait for it! YES! Its bugged and I cant login in safe mode, because pin is useless and it doesnt give me option to use password, so after hour of various things I got back to my normal mode via CMD commands.

Please let me explain. </p><p>I use a browser for intranet work only.   It's firefox, because frankly its all things that ARE NOT Google, nor Microsoft.   Obviously Firefox will not let me remove all search engines, nor will any other Browser that *I* know of.   Perhaps the community can advise me otherwise. </p><p>I also need to explain that when I say intranet, its not everything in one place, but everything is connected in one big widespread private network, access via putty or vpn.   As such, the IP range is always private but over a number of subnets, all reachable from my location, which in many cases is remote access. </p><p>Having a search engine active means that if I enter something wrong in the IP addressing, it goes hunting and brings up search results.   A 404 error would be far more appropriate. </p><p>So great and wider community of educated persons, I come to you one and all, and ask whether there is any way (mozilla approved or otherwise) that I can completely disable all searches in firefox ( My preferred browser as I have internet access options that are local to firefox, whereas other browsers who shall remain nameless rely on global access settings) or, as much as I have to ask, an alternative intranet only browser that could fulfil me requirements. </p><p>I'm hopeful that I have included enough information ( have to comply with my NDA here) that will allow you all to either laugh at me, or offer some nuggets of wisdom. </p><p>Cheers Steve </p>",linux;firefox;search;,firefox,search,en-US,"",steebs
