1537801,2025-09-24 21:00:38 -0700,2025-09-24 21:00:38 -0700,SOLUTION: Firefox opens .m3u files as text. Doesn't play the audio playlist/track.,"<p>I've seen many questions about this matter over the years, and thought I'd been lucky. Every link containing a .m3u file opened in my media player, WACUP. However ... after an update to version 143 it suddenly didn't. .m3u links opened as a text file in the browser window. </p><p>We have five windows 10 workstations in the home, and this happened with all of them. </p><p>I write webpages for a family intranet, and several thousand tracks are available for playing, so that was messed up too. </p><p>These are the steps I followed - unsuccessfully: </p> <ul><li> Bulleted list item Checked file association settings in Windows 10. .m3u was associated to WACUP, my media player. </li><li> Bulleted list item Checked file actions in Firefox. .m3u files set to open in WACUP. </li><li> Bulleted list item Added the type=""audio/mpgurl"" in the anchor link for webpages I make. </li><li> Bulleted list item Changed the default download panel in FF settings to ""Ask"". I could then get it to ask me to save or open. ""Open"" worked, as it this is tied to the system default audio player - nothing to do with FF. </li><li> Bulleted list item A few other frustrating, but eventually inconsequential solutions that were in the realm of ""I wonder if ...?"" </li></ul> <p>So ... after all of this and a lot of investigation I noticed something interesting: All my playlists were in the format with just a listing of the filename, which as mentioned had been working for years: </p><p>Example ""01 Queen - We Are The Champions.mp3"". </p><p>Yet a playlist made in VLC had a different format: example,  </p><p>""#EXTM3U  </p> <ol><li>EXTINF:-1,01 The Beach Boys - Help Me Rhonda.mp3  </li></ol> <p>01 The Beach Boys - Help Me Rhonda.mp3 "" </p><p><br> <strong>SOLUTION</strong> </p><p>Having far too much time on my hands, I experimented with this, dissecting the various components of the playlist, and eventually found when adding ""#EXTM3U"" as the first line in the playlist, Firefox opened the playlist in WACUP once again when the link was clicked. </p><p>New playlist entry: </p> <ol><li>EXTM3U </li></ol> <p>01 Queen - We Are The Champions.mp3 02 ... 03 ... etc. </p><p>I've left the ""type='audio/mpegurl"" declaration in the link. </p><p>I don't know why this happened, but I hope somebody finds this useful in the future. </p><p>So now I have several thousand playlists to edit, although Notepad++ will make this easier, but by no means quick. </p>",firefox-14301;firefox-1430;windows-10;firefox;audio-and-video;,firefox,audio-and-video,en-US,"",skerrick

With this css in place and the preferences set, toggling the bookmarks toolbar in fullscreen mode will toggle everything at the top of the FF window (but won't do that unless fullscreen is active). </p><p>This code changed recently (like, today) because the ""collapsed"" attribute from the #PersonalToolbar item no longer toggles between ""true"" and ""false"" when the user hides/shows the toolbar — instead, the ""collapsed"" attribute disappears entirely when the toolbar is showing, and reappears to be assigned the value """" (yes, empty) when the toolbar is hidden. </p><p>--- Here's the CSS. It goes into a text file called ""userChrome.css"". </p> <dl><dd>root[sizemode=""fullscreen""] #navigator-toolbox:has(#PersonalToolbar[collapsed=""""]) { </dd></dl> <pre> visibility: collapse; </pre> <p>} </p><p>--- On the Mac, here's the location. The CSS file then goes into a ""chrome"" folder in the ""Profiles"" folder located within your Mac user account's ""Library"" folder (not the Profiles folder within the Library folder on the root of the system drive, but the one in your computer account Home folder). You'll probably need to create the chrome folder. Just put the CSS above into a text file, name that file ""userChrome.css"" and drop it in the location shown below. Quit Firefox first, of course. </p><p>/Users/&lt;user&gt;/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/&lt;profile&gt;/chrome/ </p><p>--- You'll also need to set the about:config options in Firefox to allow legacy user profile customizations. Go to about:config in the browser, and search for ""toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets"" and set this preference to ""true"". </p><p>--- The code only updated slightly today.
