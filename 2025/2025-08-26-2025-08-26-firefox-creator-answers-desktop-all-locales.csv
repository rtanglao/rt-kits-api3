I used to be able to pin my extensions on the toolbar between the account icon and the extension icon on the toolbar. This is REQUIRED for certain extensions to function properly. One example is uBlock; when visiting a site it actively updates the icon letting you know its working and blocking unwanted items. Same with Facebook Container. Password managers such as 1Password also have stopped working for me unless they are pinned to the toolbar. You use to be able to click the extension icon and then see the list of extensions in a window. Now when you click the extension icon it opens to the Recommendations tab of Add-on Manager. You then navigate to extensions and see you enabled extensions but there is no option to pin, only manage/remove/report. I was able to fix this behavior once by completely uninstalling Firefox and then removing the left over folders on the C: drive. Once I reinstalled and went through the initial process of adding the extension, it also asked me if I wanted to pin to the toolbar. To which I said yes and got things working again. After clearing my browser history and cookies, then turning that feature off, it also blew away my pinned extensions. Even after removing the extension and re-adding, I do not get the prompt to pin like I mentioned above. So its seems I may have to go back and uninstall/delete folders/reinstall to get this working again. I see several similar posts so this appears to be either a bug or a very poor design choice on the part of Mozilla.  </p><p>How do I fix this?

In the northeast huge mountains of clouds could be seen approaching. The air was fresh and sweet. </p><p>Bengali: খাওয়ার সময়ই, যেমন লেনচো ভবিষ্যদ্বাণী করেছিল, বড় বড় বৃষ্টির ফোঁটা পড়তে শুরু করল। উত্তর-পূর্ব দিকে বিশাল মেঘের পাহাড় আসতে দেখা গেল। বাতাস ছিল সতেজ আর মিষ্টি। </p><p><br> --- </p><p>Paragraph 6 </p><p>English: “It’s during the meal… These aren’t raindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins. The big drops are ten-cent pieces and the little ones are fives.” </p><p>Bengali: “খাওয়ার সময়… এগুলো আকাশ থেকে বৃষ্টির ফোঁটা নয়, এ যেন নতুন কয়েন। বড় ফোঁটা দশ পয়সার মুদ্রা আর ছোটো ফোঁটা পাঁচ পয়সার।” </p><p><br> --- </p><p>Paragraph 7 </p><p>English: With a satisfied expression he regarded the field of ripe corn with its flowers, draped in a curtain of rain. </p><p>Bengali: এক তৃপ্ত মুখভঙ্গি নিয়ে সে তাকিয়ে রইল ভুট্টার ক্ষেতে, ফুলে ভরা সেই ক্ষেত বৃষ্টির পর্দায় মোড়ানো ছিল। </p><p><br> --- </p><p>Paragraph 8 </p><p>English: But suddenly a strong wind began to blow and along with the rain very large hailstones began to fall. These truly did resemble new silver coins. </p><p>Bengali: কিন্তু হঠাৎ প্রবল হাওয়া বইতে শুরু করল আর বৃষ্টির সঙ্গে সঙ্গে বিশাল শিলাবৃষ্টি নামল। সেগুলো সত্যিই নতুন রুপোর কয়েনের মতো লাগছিল। </p><p><br> --- </p><p>Paragraph 9 </p><p>English: The older boys, exposing themselves to the rain, ran out to collect the frozen pearls. </p><p>Bengali: বড় ছেলেরা নিজেদের ভিজিয়ে বাইরে ছুটল সেই বরফের মুক্তোগুলো কুড়োতে। </p><p><br> --- </p><p>Paragraph 10 </p><p>English: “It’s really getting bad now,” exclaimed the man. “I hope it passes quickly.” </p><p>Bengali: “এখন সত্যিই খারাপ হচ্ছে,” exclaimed করল লোকটা। “আশা করি এটা তাড়াতাড়ি থেমে যাবে।” </p><p><br> --- </p><p>Paragraph 11 </p><p>English: It did not pass quickly. For an hour the hail rained on the house, the garden, the hillside, the cornfield, on the whole valley. The field was white, as if covered with salt. </p><p>Bengali: কিন্তু এটা তাড়াতাড়ি থামল না। এক ঘণ্টা ধরে শিলা পড়ল ঘরের উপর, বাগানের উপর, পাহাড়ের ঢালে, ভুট্টার ক্ষেতে, পুরো উপত্যকার উপর। ক্ষেত সাদা হয়ে গেল, যেন নুনে ঢাকা। </p><p><br> --- </p><p>Paragraph 12 </p><p>English: Not a leaf remained on the trees. The corn was totally destroyed. The flowers were gone from the plants. </p><p>Bengali: গাছের উপর একটাও পাতা রইল না। ভুট্টা পুরোপুরি নষ্ট হয়ে গেল। গাছ থেকে ফুলগুলো সব ঝরে গেল। </p><p><br> --- </p><p>Paragraph 13 </p><p>English: “It’s during the meal... the locusts would have left more than this. The hail has left nothing: this year we will have no corn.” </p><p>Bengali: “পঙ্গপাল এলে অন্তত কিছু রেখে যেত, কিন্তু শিলাবৃষ্টি কিছুই রাখেনি। এ বছর আমাদের ভুট্টা হবে না।” </p><p><br> --- </p><p>Paragraph 14 </p><p>English: That night was a sorrowful one. </p><p>Bengali: সেই রাতটা ছিল একেবারে দুঃখে ভরা। </p><p><br> --- </p><p>Paragraph 15 </p><p>English: “All our work, for nothing. There’s no one who can help us. We’ll all go hungry this year.” </p><p>Bengali: “আমাদের সমস্ত পরিশ্রম, সব বৃথা গেল। আমাদের সাহায্য করার মতো কেউ নেই। এ বছর আমরা সবাই না খেয়ে থাকব।” </p><p><br> --- </p><p>Paragraph 16 </p><p>English: But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary house in the middle of the valley, there was a single hope: help from God. </p><p>Bengali: কিন্তু উপত্যকার মাঝখানে সেই নির্জন ঘরে যারা থাকত, তাদের হৃদয়ে একটাই আশা ছিল: ঈশ্বরের সাহায্য। </p><p><br> --- </p><p>Paragraph 17 </p><p>English: “Don’t be so upset, even though this seems like a total loss. Remember, no one dies of hunger.

At the post-office, he placed a stamp on the letter and dropped it into the mailbox. </p><p>Bengali: সে খামে লিখল ‘To God’, ভেতরে চিঠি রেখে দিল আর অস্থির মনে শহরে গেল। ডাকঘরে খামে ডাকটিকিট লাগিয়ে চিঠিটা পোস্টবাক্সে ফেলে দিল। </p><p><br> --- </p><p>Paragraph 24 </p><p>English: One of the employees, who was a postman and also helped at the post office, went to his boss laughing heartily and showed him the letter to God. </p><p>Bengali: একজন কর্মচারী, যে ডাকপিয়ন ছিল এবং ডাকঘরে সাহায্য করত, হাসতে হাসতে তার বসকে দেখাল ঈশ্বরের উদ্দেশে লেখা চিঠিটা। </p><p><br> --- </p><p>Paragraph 25 </p><p>English: Never in his career as a postman had he known that address. The postmaster — a fat, amiable fellow — also broke out laughing, but almost immediately he turned serious and, tapping the letter on his desk, commented: “What faith! I wish I had the faith of the man who wrote this letter. Believing: waiting for God to reply...” </p><p>Bengali: তার ডাকপিয়ন জীবনে সে কখনো এমন ঠিকানা দেখেনি। পোস্টমাস্টার – মোটা, ভদ্র এক ব্যক্তি – হেসে উঠল, কিন্তু প্রায় সঙ্গে সঙ্গেই গম্ভীর হল আর ডেস্কে চিঠি ঠুকে বলল: “কি বিশ্বাস! ইশ, যদি আমারও এই মানুষটার মতো বিশ্বাস থাকত। ভাবো তো – ঈশ্বরের উত্তর আসার অপেক্ষায় আছে!” </p><p><br> --- </p><p>Paragraph 26 </p><p>English: So, in order not to shake the writer’s faith in God, the postmaster came up with an idea: answer the letter. But when he opened it, it was evident that to answer it, he needed something more than goodwill, ink and paper. </p><p>Bengali: তাহলে লেখকের ঈশ্বরে বিশ্বাস যাতে নষ্ট না হয়, সেইজন্য পোস্টমাস্টারের মাথায় এল এক বুদ্ধি: চিঠির উত্তর দেওয়া। কিন্তু খাম খুলতেই বোঝা গেল উত্তর দিতে শুধু শুভেচ্ছা, কালি আর কাগজ নয়, আরও কিছু দরকার। </p><p><br> --- </p><p>Paragraph 27 </p><p>English: But he stuck to his resolution: he asked for money from his employees, he himself gave part of his salary, and several friends of his were obliged to give something “for an act of charity.” </p><p>Bengali: কিন্তু সে নিজের সিদ্ধান্তে অটল রইল: সে তার কর্মচারীদের কাছে টাকা চাইলো, নিজে নিজের বেতনের কিছু অংশ দিল, এমনকি কয়েকজন বন্ধুকেও বাধ্য করল কিছু দিতে – “দানশীলতার নামে।” </p><p><br> --- </p><p>Paragraph 28 </p><p>English: It was impossible for him to gather the hundred pesos, so he was able to send the farmer only a little more than half. </p><p>Bengali: তার পক্ষে একশো পেসো জোগাড় করা সম্ভব হলো না, তাই কৃষককে সে পাঠাতে পারল অর্ধেকেরও কিছু বেশি। </p><p><br> --- </p><p>Paragraph 29 </p><p>English: He put the money in an envelope addressed to Lencho and with it a letter containing only a single word as a signature: God. </p><p>Bengali: সে টাকা রাখল এক খামে, ঠিকানায় লিখল লেনচো, আর সঙ্গে দিল এক চিঠি যাতে শুধু এক শব্দ লেখা ছিল – ঈশ্বর। </p><p><br> --- </p><p>Paragraph 30 </p><p>English: The following Sunday, at daybreak — after having convinced himself that there is a God: on the earth, in the sky, in one’s conscience — the man began his usual Sunday task: to visit town. </p><p>Bengali: পরের রবিবার ভোরে – আবারও নিজেকে বুঝিয়ে যে ঈশ্বর আছেন: পৃথিবীতে, আকাশে, অন্তরে – লোকটা তার রবিবারের কাজ করল: শহরে গেল। </p><p><br> --- </p><p>Paragraph 31 </p><p>English: He was not surprised when, at the post office, he found a letter addressed to him with a God as the sender. </p><p>Bengali: সে অবাক হলো না যখন ডাকঘরে গিয়ে দেখল, তার নামে এক চিঠি এসেছে আর প্রেরক হিসেবে লেখা আছে ঈশ্বর। </p><p><br> --- </p><p>Paragraph 32 </p><p>English: With a content expression, he opened the envelope, but it was evident to him: God could not have made a mistake, nor could he have denied him what he had requested. </p><p>Bengali: তৃপ্ত মুখভঙ্গি নিয়ে সে খাম খুলল, কিন্তু তার কাছে স্পষ্ট ছিল: ঈশ্বর কোনো ভুল করতে পারেন না, আর তিনি তার চাওয়া প্রত্যাখ্যান করতে পারেন না। </p><p><br> --- </p><p>Paragraph 33 </p><p>English: But when he counted the money, he found only seventy pesos. </p><p>Bengali: কিন্তু যখন টাকা গুনল, তখন সে পেল মাত্র সত্তর পেসো। </p><p><br> --- </p><p>Paragraph 34 </p><p>English: His anger was evident. “God: of the money that I asked for, only seventy pesos reached me. Send me the rest, since I need it very much. But don’t send it to me through the mail because the post office employees are a bunch of crooks.” </p><p>Bengali: তার রাগ স্পষ্ট হলো। “ঈশ্বর: আমি যে টাকা চেয়েছিলাম, তার মধ্যে মাত্র সত্তর পেসো আমার কাছে এসেছে। বাকিটা পাঠাও, কারণ আমার তা খুব দরকার। কিন্তু দয়া করে এটা ডাকঘরের মাধ্যমে পাঠিও না, কারণ ডাকঘরের কর্মচারীরা একদল চোর।” </p><p><br> --- </p><p>✅ এভাবেই গল্প শেষ হয়। </p><p><br> --- </p><p>তাহলে বলো, তুমি কি চাও আমি এখন এই পুরো অনুবাদটা একটা সুন্দর PDF ফাইল আকারে বানিয়ে দিই, যাতে তুমি পড়াশোনা/প্রিন্ট করতে পারো? </p>",firefox;download-and-save;,firefox,download-and-save,en-US,"",choudhuryabid93
