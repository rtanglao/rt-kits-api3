I have a Firefox account, am signed in on both devices, sync is turned on, and passwords are set to sync. I don't know how, but all of my passwords are on my new computer, but not on my laptop and I can't figure out how to get them back. Maybe I messed something up trying to get all of my tabs transferred? It wouldn't be a problem if I was completely done with my laptop, but I'm still going back and forth between the two. </p><p>Also, it seems that the passwords on my new computer aren't the most up to date, as I'm signed in to several websites on my laptop, that won't accept the passwords on my new computer. </p><p>I would really appreciate any help getting this all straightened out. </p>",firefox-14103;firefox-1410;windows-11;firefox;sync-failure;,firefox,sync-failure,en-US,"",legomaster65

Normally toolbar comes back visible when I move the cursor to the area, but not now. I need to either click Win+T or to minimize the browser window and then to make it bigger again (full size). That's not the normal solution. Normal shouldn't hide the toolbar at all. This doesn't happen with other softwares, and my toolbar settings in Win10 are like they should be.  </p><p>If this is a known Firefox bug, is there any change that it could be fixed for the next update?
