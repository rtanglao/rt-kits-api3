I don't want you people spending your time trying to dream up ways to build the cheese that leads me into your maze.  I just want to buy a product. I want that product to work for years. It should be reliable not flashy.  Why is that so hard these days? When did we become people who would accept junk that needed to constantly be repaired after purchase? Why does an upgrade do exactly the same thing it's predecessor did, but more slowly and requiring more resources?  Why can companies build something and then a few years down the road simply stop supporting it?  Here in the US car companies were required to support their products for 15 years. As expensive as phones have become and as disruptive as changing operating systems is we need similar legislation in the tech industry.  Google needs to be broken up and not be the hub of the internet. No matter where I go in the net my browser always goes to google first. That's just creepy. So please someone just offer a product that doesn't make me a product by it's use. </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1705019;,bianaryabyss

I think.,"<p>I have been using Private Browsing to read <a href=""https://www.dailymail.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.dailymail.co.uk</a> for years because it blocks the adds.  Now for the second time in years it seems to block a part of the page I don't want it too block. And for the life of me I cant remember if I did something to fix it the first time or Mozilla fixed it.  Anyway the problem does not show up in ordinary Firefox but the adds make it so hard to concentrate while they keep flashing on and off all the time.  So I have attached two screen shots to show the difference between the two Ordinary &amp; Private. Any ideas very welcome. Thanks. First one shows the comment section that I want to see the second shows Private not showing them. Same story, day ect </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",phillstroud

I had sync turned on with bookmarks enabled but it wasn't syncing my bookmarks to my computer. I double checked that these sync settings were enabled on the Firefox app on my phone and I tried syncing multiple times. It transferred my passwords and other data but not my bookmarks. So I logged out of Firefox on my computer and phone, then logged back in and synced them together only to find that Firefox deleted all my bookmarks from my account completely (now they don't show up on my phone either). I looked at the forums and saw that they make separate profiles that I could access with about:profiles so I opened that and only saw 2 profiles, neither of which have my bookmarks. Is there a way to recover these since Firefox deleted them out of no where? </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",bmschw

This leaves the file corrupted/incomplete. </p><p>I have no idea why is started doing this. Just one day it started opening everything I downloaded, be it PDF, image etc when complete. I turned this off and it has stopped for things that download properly, but it's still doing this 'cut off' attempt to open. </p><p>Any help would be appreciated, thanks, </p>",firefox-13401;firefox-1340;performance-and-connectivity;needsinfo;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1705017;,mirumotokojiro

I've uninstalled intel graphics driver and reinstall, didn't work, I've refreshed firefox, didn't work, I've fully uninstalled firefox and reinstall, didn't work, and when the error occurs the igpu is at 100% usage (and ram/vram usage is not full). The whole firefox app will be laggy but not windows, and upon pausing the video only will firefox be free of lag, and a refresh will solve the issue. However, it will occur again once in a while, doesn't matter the resolution or volume, and not just youtube but all other video players. It does occur more frequently and predictably when the video is paused for some time, or when the computer sleeps for a while, and I think it has something to do with the way firefox handles ram. (just my guess) </p><p>The only fix that worked was setting <strong>media.wmf.dxva.d3d11.enabled</strong> to false, which is undesirable as it increases cpu usage by at least 20% as well as increasing my battery discharge. Other fix includes using other browsers, using my nvidia rtx on firefox, and (not totally sure) setting the resolution lower.  </p><p>Also, after the error occurs/before the error occurs, firefox doesn't do that blink-in-blink-out animation when going fullscreen on video players (like chrome), which can be fixed by exiting the firefox application completely and restarting it. Refresh doesn't work here. </p>",firefox-13401;firefox-1340;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",dennisheyuxi
