Within the last few days, ""Recent Activity"" has been blank, and will no longer keep track of articles I've recently read. I've tried clearing the browser history and cookies, and it came back for a moment, but quickly went back to being blank. And the major downside to clearing the browser is that my four rows of most frequently visited sites gets wiped clean also, and I have to spend time getting them back on the list. I do not have Firefox set to automatically clear history upon closing it. I've tried turning ""Recent Activity"" off and on with the page's Settings (cog in the bottom right corner).

Non c'è modo poi di inserire la cifra corretta. Sembra che il sistema non gestica correttamente gli zeri, eliminandoli. Ovviamente le cifre sono disponibili sul conto corrente e provando con browser differenti, funziona correttamente (quindi non è un problema del servizio di home banking).

I don't want you people spending your time trying to dream up ways to build the cheese that leads me into your maze.  I just want to buy a product. I want that product to work for years. It should be reliable not flashy.  Why is that so hard these days? When did we become people who would accept junk that needed to constantly be repaired after purchase? Why does an upgrade do exactly the same thing it's predecessor did, but more slowly and requiring more resources?  Why can companies build something and then a few years down the road simply stop supporting it?  Here in the US car companies were required to support their products for 15 years. As expensive as phones have become and as disruptive as changing operating systems is we need similar legislation in the tech industry.  Google needs to be broken up and not be the hub of the internet. No matter where I go in the net my browser always goes to google first. That's just creepy.

I had sync turned on with bookmarks enabled but it wasn't syncing my bookmarks to my computer. I double checked that these sync settings were enabled on the Firefox app on my phone and I tried syncing multiple times. It transferred my passwords and other data but not my bookmarks. So I logged out of Firefox on my computer and phone, then logged back in and synced them together only to find that Firefox deleted all my bookmarks from my account completely (now they don't show up on my phone either). I looked at the forums and saw that they make separate profiles that I could access with about:profiles so I opened that and only saw 2 profiles, neither of which have my bookmarks.

I've uninstalled intel graphics driver and reinstall, didn't work, I've refreshed firefox, didn't work, I've fully uninstalled firefox and reinstall, didn't work, and when the error occurs the igpu is at 100% usage (and ram/vram usage is not full). The whole firefox app will be laggy but not windows, and upon pausing the video only will firefox be free of lag, and a refresh will solve the issue. However, it will occur again once in a while, doesn't matter the resolution or volume, and not just youtube but all other video players. It does occur more frequently and predictably when the video is paused for some time, or when the computer sleeps for a while, and I think it has something to do with the way firefox handles ram. (just my guess) </p><p>The only fix that worked was setting <strong>media.wmf.dxva.d3d11.enabled</strong> to false, which is undesirable as it increases cpu usage by at least 20% as well as increasing my battery discharge. Other fix includes using other browsers, using my nvidia rtx on firefox, and (not totally sure) setting the resolution lower.  </p><p>Also, after the error occurs/before the error occurs, firefox doesn't do that blink-in-blink-out animation when going fullscreen on video players (like chrome), which can be fixed by exiting the firefox application completely and restarting it. Refresh doesn't work here. </p>",firefox-13401;firefox-1340;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",dennisheyuxi
