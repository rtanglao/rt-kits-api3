I've uninstalled intel graphics driver and reinstall, didn't work, I've refreshed firefox, didn't work, I've fully uninstalled firefox and reinstall, didn't work, and when the error occurs the igpu is at 100% usage (and ram/vram usage is not full). The whole firefox app will be laggy but not windows, and upon pausing the video only will firefox be free of lag, and a refresh will solve the issue. However, it will occur again once in a while, doesn't matter the resolution or volume, and not just youtube but all other video players. It does occur more frequently and predictably when the video is paused for some time, or when the computer sleeps for a while, and I think it has something to do with the way firefox handles ram. (just my guess) </p><p>The only fix that worked was setting <strong>media.wmf.dxva.d3d11.enabled</strong> to false, which is undesirable as it increases cpu usage by at least 20% as well as increasing my battery discharge. Other fix includes using other browsers, using my nvidia rtx on firefox, and (not totally sure) setting the resolution lower.  </p><p>Also, after the error occurs/before the error occurs, firefox doesn't do that blink-in-blink-out animation when going fullscreen on video players (like chrome), which can be fixed by exiting the firefox application completely and restarting it.
