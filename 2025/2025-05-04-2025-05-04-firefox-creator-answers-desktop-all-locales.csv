Now I cannot get Prime Video to open any show, nor can I access previous episodes of any show. I tried removing all my add-ons, including all my ad blockers and making Prime Video an exception to the enhanced Firefox browser feature. Nothing worked. Can someone at Firefox fix this problem or tell me why it happened?  I CAN use prime video without difficulty on Safari and Chrome. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1729962;,mandisrd
