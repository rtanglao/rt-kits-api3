I did not recognize the web address or name that was shown, and the account number from which recent payment was deducted did match any accounts I hold or held in the past. I cancelled the action immediately, without downloading, but am still concerned. I found nothing on the internet about this, just got a summation chat AI response that stated the phone company had no download/extension for Firefox. Has anyone had any experience like this or could someone shed some light on this? </p>",firefox-1440;windows-10;firefox;browser-security;,firefox,browser-security,en-US,"",79erkilo

Ich habe es dann mit viel Recherchieren und Rumprobieren geschafft, dass in beiden Fällen Google kommt, was ich so haben will (Punkt). Jetzt kommt zumindest bei der Suchzeile wieder Yahoo und ich schaffs wieder auf die Schnelle nicht, das zu ändern. Versucht Firefox hier gegen meinen Willen Yahoo nerv-stehlend zu pushen? Wisst ihr, wie ich das aktuell wieder in meinem Sinne repariere? Wisst ihr, wie ich das dauerhaft verhindern kann, dass Firefox immer wieder Aktionen gegen meinen Willen setzt??? </p>",firefox-1430;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;search;,firefox,search,en-US,"",christoph63
