I've just looked at your answer to the missing icon problem.  You suggested refreshing Fire Fox.  This sounds like a brilliant answer to my problem, but you missed out the crucial steps to how to do this.  This isn't the first time I've felt like hurling objects at my computer after trying to follow your trouble shooting instructions. </p><p>These steps might seem obvious to your software technicians, but many of us are oblivious on how to do these simple things.  Could you please pretend that we are all computer illiterate, and include the final steps in your answers.  If you don't like writing the same thing over and over again,  could you please just paste a link at the end on ""How to Refresh Firefox."" </p><p>Thanks! </p><p>PS I'm running Windows 11 on a Dell Latitude laptop, using the brand new Firefox version.

I'm not the most computer savvy person on the planet, so I have to kinda take is slow. If someone could help me bring back everything I had before, that would be great! If that's even possible.
