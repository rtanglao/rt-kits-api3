This is very annoying. I checked my extensions, and the extension is not disabled. I also haven't inadvertently blocked startpage. So this appears to either be a coincidence and issue with the startpage going down, or Mozilla Firefox have blocked the site. Looking for advice to resolve the access issue. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1732921;1732923;,dcallen_01
