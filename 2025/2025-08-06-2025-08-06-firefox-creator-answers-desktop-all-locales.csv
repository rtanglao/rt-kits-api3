I have had many problems with YouTube TV since spending summers in Washington state from Arizona state, starting in May. I am continually asked about my location and have to confirm every time where I am. It's very frustrating, especially since I have not missed a membership payment since signing up with YouTube TV years ago, and paying a hefty membership fee. Currently, when I enter TVyoutube into the address bar on my computer, I am asked if I am at my location ""permanently"" or ""temporarily"".  I continually choose ""temporarily"", and then I am told I will have access until August 6, which is tomorrow, and something to the effect ....""I will have full access when I return to my home location. (home, which is AZ., and I won't be there until NOVEMBER).  I have TWO homes, one in Arizona (where I am a resident), and one in Washington state, where I spend my summers (i.e., snowbird). I want FULL ACCESS NOW since I live in two states.  I don't care if I get Az TV or Wa state TV, just full access at all times.  You see that I MAKE PAYMENTS EVERY MONTH TO YOUTUBE TV.  Please remove the question about my location, and just let me watch YOUTUBE TV as usual!!
