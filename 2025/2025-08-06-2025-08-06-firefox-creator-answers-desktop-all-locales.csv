For some reason, when a video is present, scrolling becomes very choppy. Video only needs to be loaded or playing, and scrolling will become choppy and jittery. It's most notable when you middle mouse click and drag up and down.  This problem is not specific to Youtube, but other sites as well. This does not happen on other browsers. I have tried both Chrome and Edge, and they experience no choppiness. Turning on Freesync only makes it more noticeable. I have also tried toggling the performance and hardware support functions under options, but does nothing. </p><p>PC Specs: CPU: Ryzen 7 7700x GPU: RX 7900 xt Motherboard: B650 Aorus Elite Ax RAM: 32gb G.Skill TridentZ5 DDR5 </p>",firefox-1410;windows-11;firefox;app-responsiveness;,firefox,app-responsiveness,en-US,"",tanekoden

I have had many problems with YouTube TV since spending summers in Washington state from Arizona state, starting in May. I am continually asked about my location and have to confirm every time where I am. It's very frustrating, especially since I have not missed a membership payment since signing up with YouTube TV years ago, and paying a hefty membership fee. Currently, when I enter TVyoutube into the address bar on my computer, I am asked if I am at my location ""permanently"" or ""temporarily"".  I continually choose ""temporarily"", and then I am told I will have access until August 6, which is tomorrow, and something to the effect ....""I will have full access when I return to my home location. (home, which is AZ., and I won't be there until NOVEMBER).  I have TWO homes, one in Arizona (where I am a resident), and one in Washington state, where I spend my summers (i.e., snowbird). I want FULL ACCESS NOW since I live in two states.  I don't care if I get Az TV or Wa state TV, just full access at all times.  You see that I MAKE PAYMENTS EVERY MONTH TO YOUTUBE TV.  Please remove the question about my location, and just let me watch YOUTUBE TV as usual!!
