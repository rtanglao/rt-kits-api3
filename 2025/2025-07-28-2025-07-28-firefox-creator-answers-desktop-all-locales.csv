The profile is missing, yet Firefox is working fine, and I see all of my bookmarks, etc. </p><p>I have windows set to show hidden files. </p><p>When I try to run %APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\ it tells me that the location is unavailable. </p><p>I cannot find the profile anywhere in file explorer, despite multiple tries to search for it. </p><p>If I go to Help &gt; Troubleshooting Information, I see a ""Location is not available"" message, shown in the attached image.  </p><p>I could uninstall and reinstall Firefox, but I'd prefer to solve this because the exact same thing is happening to my Thunderbird profile. It doesn't exist anywhere, yet I can see all of my emails and it appears to be working properly. I only found this problem because I wanted to backup my emails but was unable to. </p><p>Both of these profiles must exist somewhere, but I've tried everything to find them. Please help me fix this in Firefox, and then if I have a fix here I'll try to apply it to Thunderbird, where I have a lot of emails I'd hate to lose. </p>",firefox-1410;windows-11;firefox;backup-data;,firefox,backup-data,en-US,1752232;,sarehder
