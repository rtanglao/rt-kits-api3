When I install a Firefox update, MacOS (15.5 at present) often gives me a popup that says ""Firefox is trying to install a new helper tool. Enter your password to allow this."" </p><p>But I don't ever want to enter my password to install a tool that doesn't identify itself.  I view Firefox as always being at the forefront of security, but asking for a password for a tool that's not identified is a security risk.  Maybe it's MacOS that refuses to identify the ""helper tool"", but it's a Firefox problem. It's unacceptable. </p><p>In today's update, Firefox won't work at all after I hit cancel to the password dialog. I have to Force Quit it. I'm going to have to delete Firefox and reinstall, and hopefully that will work. But I shouldn't have to do this. It's unacceptable that this keeps happening.  (If there's some weird configuration issue at my end, I think Firefox should be  flexible enough to deal with it.) </p><p>I don't know what version of Firefox is generating the problem, because it's currently unresponsive, since I haven't entered my password to install the helper tool.
