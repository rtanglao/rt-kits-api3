When I install a Firefox update, MacOS (15.5 at present) often gives me a popup that says ""Firefox is trying to install a new helper tool. Enter your password to allow this."" </p><p>But I don't ever want to enter my password to install a tool that doesn't identify itself.  I view Firefox as always being at the forefront of security, but asking for a password for a tool that's not identified is a security risk.  Maybe it's MacOS that refuses to identify the ""helper tool"", but it's a Firefox problem. It's unacceptable. </p><p>In today's update, Firefox won't work at all after I hit cancel to the password dialog. I have to Force Quit it. I'm going to have to delete Firefox and reinstall, and hopefully that will work. But I shouldn't have to do this. It's unacceptable that this keeps happening.  (If there's some weird configuration issue at my end, I think Firefox should be  flexible enough to deal with it.) </p><p>I don't know what version of Firefox is generating the problem, because it's currently unresponsive, since I haven't entered my password to install the helper tool.  (I'm writing this in Safari.) </p><p>(In the attached image, I blotted out my username.) </p>",firefox;launch-failure;,firefox,launch-failure,en-US,"",mabrams001

I've been doing this for years, but now all of a sudden within the last (week??) it's not doing it AT all. </p><p>For one thing it now opens my in-game image - into a whole new tab (which is absolutely bizarre and annoying!!) </p><p>When I DO go to 'right click' on this image to save, I have it PRE-SET to go to my preferred location to save as a PNG file. </p><p>I go to windows explorer and it's NOT there.   I try it again! Saving it as a JPG, NOT THERE. </p><p>Restarted the browser... tried again (resumed the game, got to the place where I wanted the screenshot..it's an ingame 'screen shooter' that's worked for me for years in Opera and Chrome).  </p><p>It GRABS the screenshot, no problem! But to save the image (no matter the file format) it WILL NOT DO ITTttttttttttttttt </p><p>I am going bonkers. I have double checked the file path. I've given it a VERY Specific name JUST in case if I DID save it somewhere 'stupid' lol!! I've checked my 'screenshots' folder! (Which is also bizarre to me!) These images *Are noooooooooowhere*  </p><p>This is a very new thing for this browser (For me!) </p><p>i've gone through my Firefox settings insofar as I can see - with a fine tooth comb. I've cleared ALL CACHE and TMP folders, REBOOTED the system, restarted my browser (which is supposedly fully up-to-date! I Check on this *Daily*) </p><p>Can you please help me out here?? this is driving me bat sh*t crazy  I'm the desktop PC/Windows 11.  i've run scans for drivers! For any system updates! My browsers are ALL up to date! </p><p>I tried running this in Opera and it works!! But I need to keep things separate and chose Firefox for this particular game (in-browser). </p><p>I am at a loss and can't think of what else I can try to do! (if there's a setting I've over looked! if this is a known issue... I have lost the patience to try and filter through the help pages I'm so sorry) this has put me to my wits end.  </p><p>Please help.
