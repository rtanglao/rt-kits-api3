OTOH, the Copy-n-Paste extension would allow me to make Firefox my default browser.  I am very active in a number of support forums and often post screenshots.  The inability to upload clipboard content when using FF makes it too inconvenient to use for these forum sites.  Vivaldi and Startpage have this functionality built-in so one of them gets used.  I prefer FF as a browser though so I wish I could get Copy-n-Paste to work.  Thoughts on how to do that would be appreciated.  Other installed extensions are uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger.
