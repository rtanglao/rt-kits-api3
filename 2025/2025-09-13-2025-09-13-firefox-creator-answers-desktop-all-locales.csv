Not anymore. </p><pre>I am superscribed to One Drive. Every few days I get an email from One Drive with the past memories from the day of the email. I will open the emails and click on ""View all memories"" then it would take me to the One Drive and I would be able to see those pictures individually. For a few days now I have not been able to do this on Firefox anymore. The website goes to gray like it is trying to download the pictures but it gets tuck there.  </pre> <p>This is happening both on my desktop with Windows 7 and my laptop with Window 11. Everything works in the Microsoft Edge browser. I can see all the images individually from that day. </p><p>I have communicated this problem to Microsoft One Drive and it seems to be a browser problem. Is there any way that this problem can be solved in the Firefox browser? </p><p>I would appreciated your help </p><p>Amy </p>",firefox-1150;windows-7;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",Amylogamy

I highlight this information and copy it to a Word document which I print out and use as I interview the client. This has worked just fine for years. As of Wednesday, Sept 10, the client's phone number and email address began appearing in blue text and underlined in the sidebar, and the blue text cannot be copied. Everything else copies just fine. The problem is that the client's phone number and email address are two of the most important things I need to copy. Why are those two items suddenly in blue and not copyable? How can I change this? (I know how to copy and paste--that's not the problem.) I contacted Square support, and they said that the blue text is copyable when using the Chrome browser; I tried it, and they were right--it copied just fine. But, I don't want to use Chrome, I want to use Firefox. How can I fix this? </p>",firefox-14201;firefox-1420;windows-11;firefox;links;,firefox,links,en-US,"",sboyd227
