We have used FF fir many, many years, and NEVER, that is NEVER, been able to ad an extension to our toolbar. Yes, we have read myriad posts and sundry blogs where most of the advice we see is totally useless because the things we are supposed to do not exist in our FF. We can’t add in the customise palette, the extension manger Pin to Toolba, settings, et ceteras. So, how do we add an FF extension to the toolbar in FF 142.0.1?

I highlight this information and copy it to a Word document which I print out and use as I interview the client. This has worked just fine for years. As of Wednesday, Sept 10, the client's phone number and email address began appearing in blue text and underlined in the sidebar, and the blue text cannot be copied. Everything else copies just fine. The problem is that the client's phone number and email address are two of the most important things I need to copy. Why are those two items suddenly in blue and not copyable? How can I change this? (I know how to copy and paste--that's not the problem.) I contacted Square support, and they said that the blue text is copyable when using the Chrome browser; I tried it, and they were right--it copied just fine. But, I don't want to use Chrome, I want to use Firefox. How can I fix this? </p>",firefox-14201;firefox-1420;windows-11;firefox;links;,firefox,links,en-US,"",sboyd227
