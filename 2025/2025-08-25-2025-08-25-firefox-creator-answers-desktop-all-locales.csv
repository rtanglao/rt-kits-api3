Ma ho scoperto che rispetto ad una normale scheda ha diverse limitazioni intrinseche. Se voglio temporaneamente chiudere il pannello per avere più spazio sul sito e poi lo riapro, noto che non rimane aperta sull'ultima chat col chatbot, ma ritorna alla schermata di benvenuto, ed ogni volta sono costretto ad andarmi a ripescare la chat dalla mia lista di chat. Questo è frustrante e noioso e mi obbliga a ritornare spesso al paradigma del bot aperto in una normale tab pinnata. Vi chiedo se c'è esiste qualche work around e se è prevista l'aggiunta della persistenza in futuro... renderebbe Firefox migliore ancor di piú di quanto non lo è gia. </p><p>Rey </p>",firefox-14103;firefox-1410;linux;firefox;extensions;,firefox,extensions,it,"",rey.fox.perseus

Thanks to help from this website, both were repaired. New problems have occurred and I’m here again, hoping for help. My computer is a Dell XPS desktop, running Windows 11 (Home), upgraded from Windows 10. Both FF and TB are up to date. </p><p>So, problems: TB: I turn on the computer in the morning, have a small breakfast, then start TB. The Inbox appears on the screen and then the request for my password. When I type the first letter, it doesn’t appear. I type it again, it appears, and then I finish entering the password. Works fine after that. Well, almost. I want to delete several non-consecutive emails. What used to work was to hold down Ctrl key, then click on emails to be deleted, finally release Ctrl. Now what happens is the first email to be deleted is highlighted but when I click on the second email, the first email is unselected. Then I release Ctrl, press it once again, select first email, then additional emails to be deleted. They are all highlighted. FF: Inconsistent download times. I just tried to download a webpage from one of my bookmark folders. After about 30 seconds, with nothing showing, I closed the page, then tried downloading again. Another 30 seconds, same result. I closed FF then reopened it, tried loading the same page. It appeared in just a few seconds. Opened the Google webpage, clicked Maps and received the error shown. (First image) Clicked Try Again, Maps reappeared. </p><p>Sometime after these problems began, I noticed something different on my Task Bar. When FF was not running and I hovered the pointer over the FF icon, the name of the icon was displayed but was followed by the number 2 within parentheses. (See the image). The same thing for TB.  Are these numbers somehow connected to the problems I am having with TB and FF? </p><p>Any help will be appreciated. Thanks. </p>",firefox-1420;windows-11;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",I_Rufus
