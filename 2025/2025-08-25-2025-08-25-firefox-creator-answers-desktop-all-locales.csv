I start it, the menu bar and tab comes up, but then nothing. I can't access any web sites. I tried removing the Windows update, then tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox, and then messing with the settings. In each case Firefox would work for a couple of days, then I'd have to start it three or four times to get it to work, then it wouldn't work at all. I've been using it for 10 or more years now (four on this computer) and have never had any problems before. I'm loathe to switch to another browser, but if this can't be fixed I won't have any choice. This is what happens when I start the program. </p>",firefox-1420;windows-10;firefox;app-responsiveness;,firefox,app-responsiveness,en-US,"",michael_lemick

Thanks to help from this website, both were repaired. New problems have occurred and I’m here again, hoping for help. My computer is a Dell XPS desktop, running Windows 11 (Home), upgraded from Windows 10. Both FF and TB are up to date. </p><p>So, problems: TB: I turn on the computer in the morning, have a small breakfast, then start TB. The Inbox appears on the screen and then the request for my password. When I type the first letter, it doesn’t appear. I type it again, it appears, and then I finish entering the password. Works fine after that. Well, almost. I want to delete several non-consecutive emails. What used to work was to hold down Ctrl key, then click on emails to be deleted, finally release Ctrl. Now what happens is the first email to be deleted is highlighted but when I click on the second email, the first email is unselected. Then I release Ctrl, press it once again, select first email, then additional emails to be deleted. They are all highlighted. FF: Inconsistent download times. I just tried to download a webpage from one of my bookmark folders. After about 30 seconds, with nothing showing, I closed the page, then tried downloading again. Another 30 seconds, same result. I closed FF then reopened it, tried loading the same page. It appeared in just a few seconds. Opened the Google webpage, clicked Maps and received the error shown. (First image) Clicked Try Again, Maps reappeared. </p><p>Sometime after these problems began, I noticed something different on my Task Bar. When FF was not running and I hovered the pointer over the FF icon, the name of the icon was displayed but was followed by the number 2 within parentheses. (See the image). The same thing for TB.  Are these numbers somehow connected to the problems I am having with TB and FF? </p><p>Any help will be appreciated. Thanks. </p>",firefox-1420;windows-11;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",I_Rufus
