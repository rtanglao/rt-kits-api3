I've tested it, and ctrlk works to open the URL window when I switch back to Google as my search engine--except when I am logged into my Mozilla account--ctrlk brings up the URL window. </p><p>Is there any way to turn off the ctrlk/Address Bar shortcut?  As part of my job, I write job aids and emails that have lots of links embedded in them so, for me, this is an accessibility issue as it take fewer keystrokes to activate the URL window using the this shortcut, and just a single roll of my trackball to get from wherever I am on a page to the Address Bar the few times I may i need it while writing.
