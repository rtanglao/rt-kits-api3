Since  I have many tabs, now I can group them in a 'tab group'  and give  it a name so I  have fewer tabs and less  clutter  and can open a 'tab group' to display all its tabs. Kind of a file manager with folders and files but for browser and its tabs. The question is, how do I sync  all tabs and tab groups in Firefox browser in all my devices so I can work seamlessly?  One device is Windows 10 Pro,, another is Windows 11  Pro and the third is my iPhone with Firefox app. I would really appreciate some  guidance. </p>",firefox-13901;firefox-1390;firefox;sync-data;,firefox,sync-data,en-US,"",ravalbj1

Lost ALL references to bookmarks, i.e. Bookmarks Toolbar totally gone.  How can/do I restore from .jsonlz4 file in bookmarkbackups.  Also, will I be able to salvage my previous profile, presumably containing my older ""Tabs on Bottom"" work-around?  Alternatively, is there a process to restore JUST Firefox from Time Machine?

I recently switched it to DuckDuckGo. </p><p>I regularly use Ctrl+k (hereinafter <em>ctrlk</em>) to popup the window to enter a URL to create a link in whatever web app I am using (Microsoft Office 365 apps, Reddit, Quora, etc.) </p><p>Suddenly, in when I used ctrlk to enter a URL for a title I highlighted in an email, the cursor bounced up to the Address Bar and selected it. I've tested it, and ctrlk works to open the URL window when I switch back to Google as my search engine--except when I am logged into my Mozilla account--ctrlk brings up the URL window. </p><p>Is there any way to turn off the ctrlk/Address Bar shortcut?  As part of my job, I write job aids and emails that have lots of links embedded in them so, for me, this is an accessibility issue as it take fewer keystrokes to activate the URL window using the this shortcut, and just a single roll of my trackball to get from wherever I am on a page to the Address Bar the few times I may i need it while writing. (Between having nine functional fingers and severe arthritis in my hands, I am not exaggerating my use of the word ""accessibility"".) </p><p>Thanks for any assistance I can get on this! </p><p>MK </p>",firefox-13904;firefox-1390;firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",melissk
