How do I know my crashed Dell Latitude 5500 (NOT E5500) , 512GB M2 NVME, 32GB DDR4 2400 RAM, W11 Pro x64 is now truly healed and with no glitches due to Firefox 137.0 x64 conflicting with Spectrum Security Suite (most current version by F-Secure {TOTAL} as of 03-31-2025) and thereby crashing the entire computer. I have recovered 90whatever percent functionality to the computer, but cannot take the chance of re-installing Security Suite if there is an unresolved conflict not yet addressed and corrected. I've seen the Mozilla Connection entry about another crash similar to mine involving a different Antimalware APP. And I have seen the posting about the fix applied to correct the same type issues with a Chinese provided Antimalware APP. Has ANYONE addressed Firefox 137.0 induced conflicts with other security APPS like my Spectrum Security Suite? I cannot re-install Security Suite until or IF the conflicts that crashed my Dell 5500 have been addressed and corrected. I'd had to use a 2nd backup computer to go online, find, download, copy to a USB thumbdrive, a ""suite"" of online security scanners AND proprietary uninstallers, copy all of those to the crashed computer, install the necessary ones, run the scanners to check for malware infection(s), none were found, THEN run the F-Secure uninstaller, successfully removing Security Suite. THEN I had to run Firefox in Safe Mode to find and correct all the damaged website URLs the crash involved. Some 30(?) websites I could not get to until i repaired them. NOW, how do I get Firefox 137.x checked for conflicts with Spectrum Security Suite and have them corrected so I can have my Firefox AND Antimalware APP running together?

Does anyone have any ideas why, please? </p><p>I should warn anyone before they read on that I am in no way techie, so helping me may be frustrating at times as I need advice/instructions etc spelled out really simply, as anything too technical is beyond me, I'm afraid. </p><p>So, anyone brave and/or patient enough to read on... I've bought the tablet secondhand, 'wiped' etc. It's an Asus T100HAN Processor: Intel(R) Atom(TM) x5-Z8500 CPU@ 1.44GHz 1.44GHz Installed memory: 2.00GB System type: 64-bit Operating System, 64-based processor Pen and touch: Full Windows Touch Support with 10 Touch Points </p><p>It's currently running Windows 10 Home, but I'm hoping to install Linux Mint on it, although it's only since I bought it that it's occurred to me that putting Linux on it might not be as straightforward as I thought, (ie I'm typing this on a laptop that came with Windows but on which I installed Linux Mint. ""If Linux runs on this, it must run on anything that can handle Windows,"" I thought to myself before buying the tablet. But now I've realised that, eg, this laptop doesn't have a touchscreen, not does the screen have to rotate, which is the main reason for buying the tablet.) </p><p>That's sort of a digression, but might not be, as it explains why my priority right now is installing Firefox on the machine - so that even if it turns out I can't install Linux on it, at least I'll have Firefox rather than Edge or whatever. </p><p>So, in the Edge that came already on the machine, I accessed the official Mozilla page (despite getting several scary warnings from Edge about there being a problem with ""this website's"" security certificate, oh, and something about ""Windows SmartScreen can't be reached at the moment"") and downloaded Firefox. I went for the desktop version because that seemed more relevant than the Android or iOS versions. Then I've told it to ""Run"". The installer thing has come up and the little colour wave thing has happened with the icon in the taskbar (or whatever it's called). And then, after several minutes, I've got a message from Firefox Installer: ""Hmm. For some reason, we could not install Firefox. Choose OK to start again."" So I've clicked on OK, and the same thing has happened. Several times. And I've downloaded Firefox umpteen times as well, just in case there'd been an issue with that first download, only the same thing has happened, over and over again. </p><p>From the ""about"" thing, it looks like the 30GB or so of storage on the tablet, but about 10GB(!!!) is taken up by ""system files to help Windows run properly. Your PC won't work without them."" </p><p>Can anyone explain, please, what's going on, and what (if anything) I can do to get the wretched thing to allow me to install Firefox? I could just about cope if I can't get Linux, but no Firefox??? No, no no! </p><p>Thanks, Alice. </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",FirefoxFan

I believe I was using Firefox 137.0 but have now gone back to the last saved update session file which is 133.0.3. </p><p>When I close Firefox, it clearly recognises all the open windows as it asks if I want to close all 6 windows. When I reopen Firefox it briefly shows all the windows in position but before it reopens all the tabs in those windows, 2 of them disappear. If I open a new tab and start typing something I know is in those missing windows it suggests ""Switch to tab"". If I click on that the current window dulls as if the requested window and its tabs have become active but the entire window is invisible. I have tried renaming xulstore and localstore and tried deleting xulstore entirely. Neither worked. It's possible that I hit some mental combination of shift, command and something near the 3 or 4 keys on the keyboard as I was trying to take a quick screenshot on a website before a pop up reappeared. This was the last session where everything was as it should be. I wish I hadn't gone back to the saved update session from December as its clear the app still recognises the windows are ""there"". I've reopened it so many times since having deleted tabs, cookies, whatnot that the session I was in before things went pear shaped is now long gone. If I click on the icon for recent browsing it shows 6 windows and I subsequently deleted some tabs from the missing windows that might've been an issue, were recent, or might use more power like Youtube or news sites.

There are occasional times where, if Firefox initially opens from a link, it will start to load the page, but then stop partway and, although it claims to be loading, will make zero progress and eventually time out.  Since then, I have done a Firefox refresh, full uninstall and reinstall of the program, defragmented and done a virus scan of my computer to no results and still have had no luck fixing the issue.  I've tried opening the troubleshoot mode, but any attempts to do so have been met in error, as Firefox closes to reopen, but never reopens and instead gives a crash report that it states can't be sent.  In fact, that crash report that can't be sent shows up for every time Firefox closes, making the app not even open until I clear that report.  I've attached pictures of the browser console that I've not had any luck assessing, the problem loading page that is not showing the same timeout error it had previously, and the crash report that it states cannot be sent. </p><p>If anyone has any solutions, that would be wonderful and I'd be extremely grateful.
