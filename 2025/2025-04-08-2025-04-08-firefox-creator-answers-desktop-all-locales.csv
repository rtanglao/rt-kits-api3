1504532,2025-04-07 17:47:22 -0700,2025-04-07 17:47:22 -0700,Firefox stopped loading,"<p>Good evening (or morning, depending on your time of day) </p><p>As of about 3 days ago, in the middle of browsing, Firefox stopped loading any and all pages I tried to go to.  There are occasional times where, if Firefox initially opens from a link, it will start to load the page, but then stop partway and, although it claims to be loading, will make zero progress and eventually time out.  Since then, I have done a Firefox refresh, full uninstall and reinstall of the program, defragmented and done a virus scan of my computer to no results and still have had no luck fixing the issue.  I've tried opening the troubleshoot mode, but any attempts to do so have been met in error, as Firefox closes to reopen, but never reopens and instead gives a crash report that it states can't be sent.  In fact, that crash report that can't be sent shows up for every time Firefox closes, making the app not even open until I clear that report.  I've attached pictures of the browser console that I've not had any luck assessing, the problem loading page that is not showing the same timeout error it had previously, and the crash report that it states cannot be sent. </p><p>If anyone has any solutions, that would be wonderful and I'd be extremely grateful.  Thank you very much in advance. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",Dementisxyz
