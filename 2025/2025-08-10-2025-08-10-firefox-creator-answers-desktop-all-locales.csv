This is happening on the <em>.deb</em> installation of <em>Firefox</em> (version 136.0) across 3 different devices, with different profiles, also when all extensions are disabled. The issue seems to be specific with vertical tabs, as it does not happen with the classical horizontal ones. </p><p>The issue: In the vertical tabs sidebar I can move any tab up to any desired position. However, <strong>when moving a tab down, the next 2 positions are inaccessible</strong> (unless the lowest position in the sidebar is reached in less than 3 steps), it can only be moved to any position lower than that. </p><p>Illustration: Assume you had 5 tabs open, named A, <strong>B</strong>, C, D, and E. And let's assume you wanted to move tab B one position down to be situated between C and D. What I currently have to do to achieve that, is to move B below E (3 positions down: A, C, D, E, <strong>B</strong>), before I can move back up above D (2 positions up: A, C, <strong>B</strong>, D, E). </p><p>Seeing how tedious that is, I can only assume that it is unintended behavior caused either by a bug, or a setting (if so, which parameter in about:config should I look for?). </p><p>Any suggestions to resolve this are appreciated. </p>",firefox-1360;linux;firefox;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",schwobi

On the whole everything is going fine, except for streaming. I often use my provider's site (<a href=""http://nostv.pt"" rel=""nofollow"">nostv.pt</a>) to watch some games, races or shows. However, every time I do, I'll get backwards skips every now and then where the stream goes back 1-2s. Usually the second time this happens the stream detects I'm no longer live and I can skip ahead to real time, but this is annoying, especially when watching games. During a 2h stream session this will happen around a dozen times. </p><p>So I would like to know if there are other people with the same issue or what I can do to prevent this from happening. </p>",firefox-14103;firefox-1410;windows-10;firefox;audio-and-video;,firefox,audio-and-video,en-US,1755316;,DJSamhein

It is current per Microsoft automatic updates.  I've had it running for the better part of 3 years.  This is an important piece of information.  In the past 6 months or so, I randomly get a blue screen in the midst of my activity.  There are two important pieces of info in the text:  <a href=""http://www.windows.com/stopcode"" rel=""nofollow"">www.windows.com/stopcode</a>  And, the second is: K_mode_exception_not_handled.  After about 30 seconds, the blue screen disappears, the PC restarts itself, and the interesting thing is that when I click on the icons (in the bottom tray) for FIREFOX &amp; THUNDERBIRD, both open properly exactly as they were previously. </pre> <p>In other words, whatever websites (local news stations open / e-mail addresses open) will be as before the blue screen. </p><pre> In the background I have MALAWAREBYTES (paid license), SPYBOT PROFESSIONAL (paid license), CCLEANER (expired license) &amp; AVG (free version).  Usually I have no other programs running at this time.  The only other programs that I run as needed are an Editor </pre> <p>for PLC programming and/or WORD or EXCEL (2007) editions. </p><pre> I'm not saying that either FIREFOX or THUNDERBIRD are to blame, but I find it odd that since I've gotten periodic updates for both these programs (and WINDOWS also) this situation has become a problem.  When I first began using this PC, I never had this 'blue screen of death', a term that was common 40 years ago with WINDOWS 3.1 thru 98SE.  Any suggestions are gratefully appreciated since a user can't get any assistance from Microsoft. </pre> <p>Thank you. </p>",firefox-14103;firefox-1410;windows-10;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",KARL_TAUSCHEN

I have attempted to get back on firefox, and seemed ok at least i got my bookmarks. I also thought I had created a password, but most of the time I can not log in to some sights. My email address is always the same rosehallmanorbj@comcast.net. So my question is, am i actually completely set up in firefox? at one time I thought I created a password to log into firefox but it does not allow me in. Please let me know it I am totally with my account, and if so how do I get a password to log in.
