After reinstalling Windows on my PC, I lost access to my Firefox Sync data, which includes years of bookmarks, saved passwords, and browsing history. </p><p>Before formatting, I had been using Firefox Sync with my Firefox Account (sometimes signed in via Google). However, after reinstalling Windows and logging back into Firefox Sync, my data no longer appears. At one point, I saw my account showing activity from just before formatting, but now that is gone as well. </p><p>I am worried that my synced data might have been overwritten or lost during this process. Unfortunately, I do not have a local backup of my Firefox profile. </p><p>Could you please help me: - Verify if my Firefox Sync data is still stored on your servers. - Assist with recovering my synced data or advise on next steps I can take. - Provide any guidance on preventing data loss in the future. </p><p>Thank you very much for your help. I look forward to your response. </p><p>Best regards. </p>",firefox-14103;firefox-1410;windows-11;firefox;sync-failure;,firefox,sync-failure,en-US,"",ayoub.nadory

No matter what I have tried (un- and re-install the software, etc.) I set as default - which currently performs for exactly one click.  </p><p>Firefox/Mozilla/TB do not even SHOW on the list when trying to set as Default. </p><p>The ONLY non-MS product that IS listed is ""DuckDuckGo for Firefox"". I used to feel comfortable with them, but no longer feel ""safe"" using them as a relay to you. This is because seemingly no matter what I do, I am still getting 100's of un-asked for emails AND 100's more of phone calls/texts EVERY SINGLE DAY. Yikes! </p><p>I take great efforts to fill out every site to exercise my California rights on every site I click on... ""no soap"". Even that process has become so complicated, that if a ""one click"" opt-out isn't available - sending emails, etc. that if there isn't a preference option I don't use that site ever again for any reason. </p><p>Related Problem #2: I love LOVE your relay for emails/and phone calls... That's NO LONGER available either - WHAT???!!! Worse still, when I follow instructions HERE... go to Settings/Privacy - there isn't even a ""Passwords"" setting option. The whole catagory is just Gone. </p><p>I admit, I am a Senior and not that skilled at computers... but I spend HOURS researching and trying to learn.  Since AI was Officially activated... these problems didn't exist.  </p><p>I am SOoooo tempted to throw the darn thing in the trash... however the State of CA says I MUST have an email to even get a REAL ID. As I interpret the Law... I MUST maintain an email/phone. I live Very Rural can't even get a landline. I don't have a passport and now cannot Fly in my own Country (never intending to even leave the US until I was much more ""retired"" than I am now, lol) but now I can't even ""opt-out"" on my birth-state's website either. </p><p>Problem #3: Not as severe... but similar problems also exist on my two iOs platforms as well (iPhone/iPad) </p><p>I searched this site pretty thoroughly... only ONE person reported a similar problem (Problem #1) and so far there wasn't response after 5 days. Hopefully this post draws the attention of Admin, as I have spoken to other Seniors near me who are experiencing the same types of issues... but appear far more reticent to report. </p><p>HELP??!!! </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",jayehelps

It is current per Microsoft automatic updates.  I've had it running for the better part of 3 years.  This is an important piece of information.  In the past 6 months or so, I randomly get a blue screen in the midst of my activity.  There are two important pieces of info in the text:  <a href=""http://www.windows.com/stopcode"" rel=""nofollow"">www.windows.com/stopcode</a>  And, the second is: K_mode_exception_not_handled.  After about 30 seconds, the blue screen disappears, the PC restarts itself, and the interesting thing is that when I click on the icons (in the bottom tray) for FIREFOX &amp; THUNDERBIRD, both open properly exactly as they were previously. </pre> <p>In other words, whatever websites (local news stations open / e-mail addresses open) will be as before the blue screen. </p><pre> In the background I have MALAWAREBYTES (paid license), SPYBOT PROFESSIONAL (paid license), CCLEANER (expired license) &amp; AVG (free version).  Usually I have no other programs running at this time.  The only other programs that I run as needed are an Editor </pre> <p>for PLC programming and/or WORD or EXCEL (2007) editions. </p><pre> I'm not saying that either FIREFOX or THUNDERBIRD are to blame, but I find it odd that since I've gotten periodic updates for both these programs (and WINDOWS also) this situation has become a problem.  When I first began using this PC, I never had this 'blue screen of death', a term that was common 40 years ago with WINDOWS 3.1 thru 98SE.  Any suggestions are gratefully appreciated since a user can't get any assistance from Microsoft. </pre> <p>Thank you. </p>",firefox-14103;firefox-1410;windows-10;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",KARL_TAUSCHEN

So my question is, am i actually completely set up in firefox? at one time I thought I created a password to log into firefox but it does not allow me in. Please let me know it I am totally with my account, and if so how do I get a password to log in. Thank you. </p>",firefox-14103;firefox-1410;windows-10;firefox;reset-passwords;,firefox,reset-passwords,en-US,"",rosehallmanorbj
