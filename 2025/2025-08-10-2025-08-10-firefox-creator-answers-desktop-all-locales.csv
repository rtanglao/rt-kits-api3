You can't upload videos to Youtube with it! The upload stops at zero percent and doesn't move any further! The problem started with version 138, and it's currently the same with version <strong>141.0.3</strong>! My operating system is <strong>Windows 10 / 64 bit</strong>. I was previously advised to delete cookies, but that didn't work either. Uploading videos works with other browsers. Sometimes, you can't even post a picture attached to a comment on Facebook. I was able to do that with another browser. The video upload error occurred earlier, with version 131! It was fixed shortly after that! I would like this to happen again! It's very annoying that this error has been around for months and hasn't been fixed! </p>",firefox-14103;firefox-1410;windows-10;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",bareszsopte

I really still want to update it. I know Mint 17.3 is really old and will replace it. Firefox does work, but I'm now getting sluggish Internet because Firefox can't handle all the security requirements. So many web pages don't very well anymore.
