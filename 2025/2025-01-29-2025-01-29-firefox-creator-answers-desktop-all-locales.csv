The script uses <em>&lt;embed&gt;</em> tags. I know these arent favoured but I think they should still work, as they have in the past, so the script itself is fine.  But there is no sound (obviously I have checked the <em>src</em> is correct and made sure the speakers are on and working. They are.)
