I went to <a href=""http://Microsoft.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Microsoft.com</a> and clicked Sign In to log into my account but the page will act like you're hitting the TAB button on the keyboard over and over and also hitting enter. Since it tabs through the hyperlinks on the website and acts like I'm hitting ENTER it opens a new window/tab to <a href=""https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement/</a>. If you have pop up blockers on it will keep blocking the page while tabbing through all the hyperlinks on the page. I have recreated this issue in both the Firefox standard download version(Currently on 136.0 64 bit) and in the Microsoft Store windows app version of Firefox. I have tried clearing my cache/cookies and Private browsing as well to help keep some weird data sync from occurring. I checked my SSO settings in windows and don't have anything that would cause it to try and auto-login with that either. The ""Allow Windows single sign-on for Microsoft, work, and school accounts"" is not enabled. I noticed this ONLY happens when you try to login to Microsoft with the <a href=""http://login.live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">login.live.com</a> link instead of the <a href=""http://login.microsoftonline.com"" rel=""nofollow"">login.microsoftonline.com</a> link. I tried recreating this on my phone on Firefox for Android and it does not happen. Chrome and Edge do not have the issue either. I did not have this issue on Windows 10. I have not tried uninstalling the browser since the Microsoft/Windows App version of Firefox had the issue and I had never downloaded/installed that version before. I did not log into my Mozilla account on that version either to try and help figure out if this was an account data problem. I tried to report this on the report a bug but the bot auto closed my bug report. If anyone could help I would appreciate it. Really don't want to switch over to another browser for such a small problem like this. I can't add any image since the page constantly opens a new window/changes.
