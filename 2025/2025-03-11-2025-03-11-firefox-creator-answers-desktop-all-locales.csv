If I have,say 2 livestreams or videos opened (in separate windows) and full screened,if I hover over the Firefox icon in the taskbar,I no longer get a live preview of what is happening in said windows. It shows a live preview of only one,and if I want to see what's going on in the other,I have no switch over to that window,which causes the first one to appear paused. Prior to the last update,that wasn't the case. Was this intentional or is there a new setting in Firefox that I've missed? </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",st.nikiforov.07
