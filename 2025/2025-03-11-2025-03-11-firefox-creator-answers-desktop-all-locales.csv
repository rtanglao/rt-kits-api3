I have tried clearing my cache/cookies and Private browsing as well to help keep some weird data sync from occurring. I checked my SSO settings in windows and don't have anything that would cause it to try and auto-login with that either.

I have not tried uninstalling the browser since the Microsoft/Windows App version of Firefox had the issue and I had never downloaded/installed that version before. I did not log into my Mozilla account on that version either to try and help figure out if this was an account data problem. I tried to report this on the report a bug but the bot auto closed my bug report. If anyone could help I would appreciate it.
