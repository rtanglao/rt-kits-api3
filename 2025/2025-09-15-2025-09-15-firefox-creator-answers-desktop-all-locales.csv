I use Google Meet and a page called Preply to do my classes. When I share my screen, my students can hear any audio (if I am sharing a YouTube video or an audio recording I've made). I don't see any options to allow my audio to be shared, and it's not a Google Meet or Preply problem because as soon as I use Opera or Google, it works.

This is causing a number of glitches for me, most notably if I release onto a desktop that already has an app, it will create a ghost tab or occupies the same position as a different tab making both of them unusable and I want to know how to change it to be more like Windows, or is this a Firefox specific thing in which case will switching to another browser fix the issue? </p>",firefox-14201;firefox-1420;linux;firefox;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",noamn.fv
