Every time I reinstall Firefox on a new system and sign in to my Mozilla (Firefox) Account, not all of my previously selected settings are restored, only some of them appear to sync correctly. </p><p>For clarity, I have Sync configured to include only the following: </p> <ul><li> Bookmarks </li><li> Add-ons </li><li> Settings </li></ul> <p>I intentionally <strong>do not</strong> sync: </p> <ul><li> Passwords </li><li> History </li><li> Addresses </li><li> Open tabs </li><li> Payment methods </li></ul> <p>Despite syncing ""Settings,"" many of my custom configurations (such as certain privacy preferences and UI tweaks (customized toolbar) do not get restored. This forces me to manually go through all the settings each time, compare them to my previous setup, and reconfigure Firefox, which defeats much of the purpose of having a sync feature in the first place. </p><p>I have never faced this issue with Chromium-based browsers, where settings sync tends to be more comprehensive and consistent. </p><p>My questions: </p> <ol><li> Why are some Firefox settings not included in the sync process? </li><li> Is there a documented list of which settings are actually synced when ""Settings"" is enabled in Sync? </li><li> Are there any plans to improve the completeness of settings synchronization in future Firefox releases? </li></ol> <p>Any insight or official guidance would be greatly appreciated. I really value Firefox, but this ongoing sync limitation is making it harder to maintain a consistent browsing experience across devices. </p><p>Thank you for your support. </p>",firefox-1410;windows-10;firefox;sync-configuration;,firefox,sync-configuration,en-US,"",epsilons

However, during the installation process, I ran into a major issue — the installation was extremely slow, and even after waiting for over an hour, it still did not complete. </p><p>I’m not sure what’s causing this problem, and I’d really appreciate any support or suggestions you can offer. I truly enjoy using Firefox and value the experience it provides. I sincerely hope I can continue using it without interruptions. </p><p>Could you please advise me on what I can do to fix this and successfully install the new version? </p><p>Looking forward to your kind assistance. </p><p>Best regards, Lily </p>",windows-10;firefox;install-failure;,firefox,install-failure,en-US,"",tingandnin20

Since installing Firefox, streaming videos in Youtube are distorted with significant tiling during the first few seconds. The video has to be rewound manually to see the beginning unhindered, sometimes rewound several times because the tiling still happens, albeit less so with each rewind. I had to rebuild the Windows 11 because some mysterious problem, possibly from a Windows update a couple of months ago, caused a growling hardware contention noise during video or video games that would cycle through several harmonic levels and sometimes move across the stereo plane. Just before the rebuild it became continuous and untennable. The rebuild did not get rid of that problem completely, but there have only been a couple of tiny hardware contention noises since then. This tiling of Youtube video is brand new. The system is pretty much the same now as it was before the rebuild. I still have the old OS on another internal drive so it would be possible to compare files. I just want to know why all of a sudden Firefox is showing this momentary tiling in Youtube. I tried Chrome and there was no titling. Thanks for your time. </p>",firefox-1410;windows-11;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",kurtfaasse
