Just be honest: it's the DNC curating Firefox's news just as the FBI curated who was allowed to talk on X. Just be up front with everyone. Firefox is sort of like the Bluesky of internet browsers. Here is a crazy concept: Instead of shoving your views down the throats of average Americans. How about let us citizens choose are own news sources? Crazy concept.  Or are you Big Brother? Seriously. Get a clue if you want the 60% of ordinary people to keep using your browser as I have done for 15 years give or take. I get that I can turn off the propaganda your are displaying but choice would be better. If you would like to discuss, I'm all ears. </p>",firefox-1420;windows-10;firefox;undefined;,firefox,undefined,en-US,"",gregersonart

Because I forgot my password, I went through the process of changing it. I received a confirmation from Mozilla, saying that I had correctly changed the password, but when I try to sign in, it says that the password is wrong. I tried several times with no success.  Because I never did anything with my Android phone, I am able to access my Firefox there. I have no idea what to do next. </p>",firefox-14201;firefox-1420;windows-11;firefox;sign-in;,firefox,sign-in,en-US,"",Southpaw326
