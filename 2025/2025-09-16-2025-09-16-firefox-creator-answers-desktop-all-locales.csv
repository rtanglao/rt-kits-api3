Volevo capire perchè deve aprire così tante finestra e tanti eseguibili. Considerata che avevo aperto Mozilla Firefox con due finestre. </p><p>Grazie e complimenti per il browser (è il mio preferito). </p><p>Saluti. </p><p>Luca </p>",firefox-1420;windows-10;firefox;crashing-and-slow-performance;,firefox,crashing-and-slow-performance,it,"",admin978

When I open Google Maps it seems always to center on a point 7 miles away instead of on my current (home) location.  When I seek travel directions  from ""Your location"", the route starts from that incorrect point.  If I click the location button on the bottom right of the map, I get the message""Your precise location could not be determined."" But, when I click the location button twice more, it says ""Getting current location"" and then blue dot appears at my current location. Routes now start from this location.  But when I close and reopen Google Maps, the incorrect approximate location comes back up.    (Note Google Maps shows correct location in Microsoft Edge). I tired several times to toggle Firefox's Location permission (Allow/Block; Remove website/Allow; with and without reboot) without any change. The Google forum had no viable suggestions.  I'd appreciate any ideas for a fix  from this group. </p>",firefox-14201;firefox-1420;windows-11;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",rrrvjjj

Just be honest: it's the DNC curating Firefox's news just as the FBI curated who was allowed to talk on X. Just be up front with everyone. Firefox is sort of like the Bluesky of internet browsers. Here is a crazy concept: Instead of shoving your views down the throats of average Americans. How about let us citizens choose are own news sources? Crazy concept.  Or are you Big Brother? Seriously. Get a clue if you want the 60% of ordinary people to keep using your browser as I have done for 15 years give or take. I get that I can turn off the propaganda your are displaying but choice would be better.
