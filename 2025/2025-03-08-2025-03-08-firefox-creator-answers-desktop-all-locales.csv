When I delete all the website shortcuts, I am unable to add new website shortcuts. There is no option available to add them back. </p><p><br> 2. When I use the ""Unpin"" option, the shortcut gets deleted completely, instead of just being unpinned. Ideally, the shortcut should remain available after unpinning. </p><p><br> </p><p>I kindly request you to address these issues in an upcoming update so that users can have a smoother browsing experience. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",tonese8721

I can't find anything in settings to remedy the problem so I have disabled  home screen shortcuts. Do you have a patch to correct the problem? </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",bytnttsym9

On the first launch, there was nothing unusual, except the usual dialogs to describe new features and release notes. </p><p>I tried the new setting to show the new sidebar, but turned it back off afterward. </p><p>But on all subsequent browser launches, my primary password was required. I want a primary password to protect my saved logins and settings, but don't want to have to enter it just to use the browser. </p><p>An online search said that if I were using Sync, that might be a reason my password is required at startup. However, I have never used Sync and never logged into it. </p><p>I tried starting up in safe mode, to eliminate extension issues, but my PW was still required. Does anyone know how to eliminate the prompt at startup, while still maintaining the primary password for settings? </p>",firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",Wizardgoat

I then have to exit Firefox and sign in again to my email or my bank.  Sometimes it's stays connected for 10 minutes and then it drops.  I can go immediately to Chrome and I have no issues.  This started happening about 2 weeks ago after an update.  Not sure what the problem is but when I look at my network connection it shows it's connected and secure.  Is it the update or could it be my extensions?  Firefox says it has the latest update and I did update one of my extensions so I think everything should be good.  Any ideas? </p>,firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",vgmiller100
