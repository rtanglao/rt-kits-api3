Everything works, ie. I can still search the net, etc. but this is driving me crazy.  I have tried everything from checking settings, through extension conflicts and resetting, but nothing makes any difference.  I even uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox but it came back with the same problem.  i have windows 10 and am getting ready to upgrade to 11, but I would like everything working as it should before doing the upgrade. I even tried to change my profile, but I'm not sure how to do  it and it made no difference. Any help will be much appreciated. </p>",windows-10;firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",gwilson5
