I tried to use this FF to log onto bleeping computer to post a question. Their ""verification process"" never completed. I went to troubleshoot mode to bypass extensions. Didn't work.

Thank you. </p>",firefox-1420;beta;windows-11;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",linusr
