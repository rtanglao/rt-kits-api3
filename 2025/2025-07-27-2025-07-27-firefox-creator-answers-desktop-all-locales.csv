Recently, I noticed that when inspecting certain pages or downloading developer utilities like Fluxus Executor APK (used for scripting in Roblox), the screen reader doesn’t clearly read out links, buttons, or code blocks properly in Firefox. </p><p>Other browsers seem to provide better narration for preformatted code, labels, and actionable items. Is there a way to optimize or enable better accessibility support for developers who use assistive tech in Firefox? </p><p><a href=""https://fluxusexecuter.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">Fluxus Executor</a> is part of my dev testing routine, so accessibility while browsing trusted dev resources is important for my workflow. </p><p>Appreciate your support — any tips or settings you recommend? </p><p>Thanks! </p>",windows-10;firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",jackangelina546
