Hoping someone here can help. While trying to update Firefox FROM version 115.0.3 TO version 115.12.0esr I ran into some problems that prevented me from using/adding bookmarks. While I believe I've solved the problems, I found the following info worth questioning. </p><p>By selecting Firefox's ""Application Menu-&gt;Help-&gt;More Troubleshooting Information-&gt;Profile Folder-&gt;Open Folder"" I find that I have: </p> <ul><li> 10,000 <strong>AlternativeServices</strong> files as text documents </li><li> 312 'serviceworker' files as text documents, and  </li><li> 3,134 'SiteSecurityState' files as text documents. </li></ul> <p>I'm wondering if I need them? Doubt that I do, but 'fresh eyes' seldom hurt. Can I delete them all without harm or data loss? </p><p>This is on a Gateway P-7811FX laptop, (yes, a bit old, but it was a workhorse in its day and still works well), with IntelCore2 Duo CPU @ 2.26 GHz 2.27GHz running Windows 7 Ultimate (64 bit) with 8 GB of memory </p><p>Hoping someone here can provide help or insight that would be greatly appreciated.
