I have chosen outlook as the default for clicking a link that opens email. And in my gmail tab it keeps asking me if I want to open it instead. Well no I don't but all I can click is ""not now"" and then it keeps pestering me every time I open firefox. Is there an option like ""not ever, please go away""? How can I stop the question.
