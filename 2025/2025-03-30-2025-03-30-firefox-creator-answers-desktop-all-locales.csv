I pull up synced tabs on my <em>phone</em> to see what's open on my <em>laptop</em>, it appears normally. However, when I open synced tabs on my <em>laptop</em> to see what open on my <em>phone</em>, I get tabs that haven't been open and were closed days to a week ago. And now, it displays two different sets of synced tabs (as seen below). It's a strange quirk I'm not confident how to fix. Any ideas? </p>",firefox;accounts;,firefox,accounts,en-US,"",alxpaz8
