The next time I closed and then later reopened Firefox on the Mac Mini, Firefox had logged me out of every website, forgot my entire browsing history, passwords, bookmarks, everything. Its all gone with the exception of 4 of my 16 links on Firefox Home. </p><p>So I spent an hour fighting MFA, etc. on the websites I use the most, only to close Firefox and have it log me out and forget everything again. That is now its behavior, it loses everything every time I close the app. It does remember my toolbar settings, and those same 4 links on Firefox Home. i rebooted the computer and the problem remains. </p><p>Firefox is still logged into my account, it just doesn't sync or remember anything. Doesn't save cookies, history, nothing. Every time i relaunch the app, Firefox home is back in its default state </p><p>I also still have an instance of Firefox open on my MBP, I am now deathly afraid of closing the app for worry it will do the same. I also am afraid of using Firefox on the Windows computer, I absolutely cannot break this more. </p><p>How do I fix this this quickly and prevent it from ever happening again? I am getting absolutely buried in computer problems at every turn right now and nothing's getting solved. Every fix for weeks not only fails, but inevitably creates a new problem and I'm sorry but I'm going a little crazy and I really need a break. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",firefox-14103;firefox-1410;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;sync-failure;,firefox,sync-failure,en-US,"",VincentBrick
