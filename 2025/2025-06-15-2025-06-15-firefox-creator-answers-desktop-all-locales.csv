When watching videos on YouTube, especially in 4K, it starts to freeze, and the loading screen stays on indefinitely. The same thing happens when you fast-forward or rewind the video. Switching the video to 1440p or 1080p helps, but over time, even at 1080p, it starts to freeze. but if I switch back to 4K, everything works fine, but only temporarily or until I fast-forward it.  </p><p>I can provide browser data files. I'll say right away that I've tried a lot of things, and even everything that ChatGPT recommended didn't help.  I tried changing the about:config settings related to the video player and codecs. </p><p>The only thing that helped was installing a plugin (h264ify by erkserkserks) that disables av1, and in that case the video works fine, BUT only at 1080p, which doesn't suit me, as I would like to watch videos in high quality. </p><p>If I disable hardware acceleration so that videos are rendered on the processor, then everything works fine and everything runs smoothly, except that the processor is loaded at 60%. This may be a solution to the problem, but I would like to figure it out and solve it completely, rather than looking for a compromise. </p><p>Motherboard: ASRock B850M Pro-A (BIOS date 02/21/2025, DMI BIOS version 3.20) CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 8400F 6-Core Processor RAM: Crucial CP16G60C36U5B (Crucial 2x16 - 32GB) Video card: NVIDIA GeForce MSI RTX 3080 Ventus 3X OC LHR (MS-V389) (Driver version: 32.0.15.7652, Development date: May 14, 2025, DirectX version: 12 (FL 12.1)) Video card driver 576.52, May 19, 2025 The entire system and browser are installed on an M.2 NVMe CT1000P3PSSD8 SSD (Crucial P3 Plus 1TB PCIe 4.0 x4) (there are also other drives) (2 monitors 1440p) Windows 11 Pro If any data is required, I can provide it. All drivers and everything else are installed in the latest version (unless new ones have been released or it has not updated itself). All Visual C++ and Windows components are installed, I don't think there is a problem with them. </p><p>The problem only occurs in the Mozilla browser; there are no problems in any other browsers. I also noticed that on some websites where I watch movies, there is a problem with the video. Unlike YouTube, they load normally, but in dynamic scenes, the image breaks up, similar to the image breakup in games when vertical synchronization is turned off. That is, the video is divided into two parts, and one of them lags behind by a fraction of a second. I tried resetting the browser settings, but it didn't help. Everything works fine on my MacBook and in other browsers and devices, so it's not related to the internet. </p><p>Please help me figure this out and solve the problem because I've already tried everything, and I don't want to switch to another browser because I've been using Mozilla for over 15 years. Also, if you need any information or a detailed explanation, I can show you or even record a video. Everything worked fine on Windows 10 on the same system, but Windows 11 is not running as smoothly. (To clarify, this is a clean system; I did a complete clean install of Windows 11, although when I upgraded from 10 to 11, everything seemed to work fine). </p><p>I would be grateful for any help. </p>",firefox-13904;firefox-1390;firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",danslip001
