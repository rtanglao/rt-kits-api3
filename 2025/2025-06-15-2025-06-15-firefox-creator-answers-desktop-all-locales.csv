All Visual C++ and Windows components are installed, I don't think there is a problem with them. </p><p>The problem only occurs in the Mozilla browser; there are no problems in any other browsers. I also noticed that on some websites where I watch movies, there is a problem with the video. Unlike YouTube, they load normally, but in dynamic scenes, the image breaks up, similar to the image breakup in games when vertical synchronization is turned off. That is, the video is divided into two parts, and one of them lags behind by a fraction of a second. I tried resetting the browser settings, but it didn't help. Everything works fine on my MacBook and in other browsers and devices, so it's not related to the internet. </p><p>Please help me figure this out and solve the problem because I've already tried everything, and I don't want to switch to another browser because I've been using Mozilla for over 15 years. Also, if you need any information or a detailed explanation, I can show you or even record a video. Everything worked fine on Windows 10 on the same system, but Windows 11 is not running as smoothly.
