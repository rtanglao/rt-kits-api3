Seems to only involve Norton - I haven't found a place in the Norton site system to make this request directly to them  Win 11 - I tried various options in Display&gt; scale, text size, etc.   My old laptop is Win 10 and I don't have this problem.  I've been using this win 11 laptop for about a year and included Norton most of that time - this problem just came up a couple months ago.  I've tried a couple times to get to Norton about it but I get so frustrated that I give up.  One picture shows the large screen pop-up.  A smaller one pops up in lower right when I insert a thumb drive [ it wants to scan it for virus ]  but i can't make it go away, it's right in the way of some important options that can come up beneath it on various apps [like my slider to move up &amp; down the page],  and it doesn't show up on screanshots,  and Task Mgr&gt; end task does nothing.   I took a picture of it with my phone - I'll see if I can attach it here.  Any suggestions on normalizing these , scale settings&nbsp;?, access to Norton where I can deliver this same request   - -  would be greatly appreciated. </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",combohan
