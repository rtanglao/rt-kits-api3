To fix this in Firefox, go to Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security, and under Cookies and Site Data, click Clear Data. Reload the website afterward. </p><p>Disable Extensions Some browser extensions, such as ad blockers, may interfere with the site's functionality. Disable all extensions temporarily by going to Add-ons and Themes in the Firefox menu and toggling off active extensions. Revisit the site to check if performance improves. </p><p>Check Your Internet Connection Ensure your internet connection is stable. If other websites are loading slowly as well, restart your router or switch to a different network to improve connectivity. </p><p>Adjust Enhanced Tracking Protection Firefox’s Enhanced Tracking Protection may block some features of the site. Click the shield icon in the address bar and select Turn off Enhanced Tracking Protection for this site, then refresh the page. </p><p>Flush DNS Cache A stale DNS cache can cause connectivity issues. Restart Firefox or type about:config in the address bar, search for network.dnsCacheEntries, and reset the value to clear the DNS cache. </p><p>Test the Site in Private Browsing Open the site in a private window by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P. This disables extensions and cached data, helping you determine if the issue lies with your browser settings. </p><p>Check Server Status If the website still doesn’t load, visit a server status checker tool to see if <a href=""http://MuslimPrayerTimes.info"" rel=""nofollow"">MuslimPrayerTimes.info</a> is down for everyone or just you. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",backielinks1996

If it reaches 10000 windows will not create more. Sometimes firefox hangs, but often Fullscreen (e.g. youtube videos) will not work and the gui will disappear. Also the context menu will not open and the save dialog cannot work and is hidden. </p><p>Am I the first to report this? I did not find anything. Can this be fixed?
