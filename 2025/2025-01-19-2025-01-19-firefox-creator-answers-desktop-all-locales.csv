When doing so, the ""Mute tab"" icon is nearly half the size of the pinned tab.

Does anyone have a way of simply disabling the mute feature? It's honestly more annoying than helpful because I accidentally click that infernal mute button numerous times a day when I simply want to switch back to what's playing.
