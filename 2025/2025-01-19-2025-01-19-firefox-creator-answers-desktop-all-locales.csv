Am I missing something here?  </p><p>Sadly, this is not even close to being competitive with the Google Translate level of functionality.  I use Google Translate every day to read package labels in grocery stores, road signs, and a host of other written sources of information. Occasionally, I even use it to hold conversations with people I would not otherwise be able to talk to. So far, I am nearly monolingual, and  I am unwilling to do without this; I probably wouldn't travel if it were not available.  It does tie me to that fraction of the surface area of the earth where high speed internet access is generally available, but I don't really need to go any places where it is not; I am not trying to hike across Antarctica.

Windows has a global limit and a per process limit of 10000. GDI objects are used for windows, for the file save dialog and also for user interface elements like buttons or lists. However many applications like Firefox draw everything themself like XUL etc. But still, Firefox consumes 3 handles for me (verified on another computer) per open tab. </p><p>If you have a lot of tabs open (for reasons not to be discussed in this topic) this can be problematic. If it reaches 10000 windows will not create more. Sometimes firefox hangs, but often Fullscreen (e.g. youtube videos) will not work and the gui will disappear. Also the context menu will not open and the save dialog cannot work and is hidden. </p><p>Am I the first to report this? I did not find anything. Can this be fixed?

I checked the Return Path and glanced at all the information but perhaps I do not know what to look for. </p><p>Can someone offer me any guidance as to what to do about this? If the message source is legitimate as it appears to be, was Mozilla's community support forum hacked?

Is there a Mozilla email address for reporting emails like this? I can't change my email address associated with my Mozilla account so any advice would be appreciated.
