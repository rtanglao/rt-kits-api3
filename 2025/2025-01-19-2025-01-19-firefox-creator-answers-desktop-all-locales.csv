I checked the Return Path and glanced at all the information but perhaps I do not know what to look for. </p><p>Can someone offer me any guidance as to what to do about this? If the message source is legitimate as it appears to be, was Mozilla's community support forum hacked? Normally I would put an email like this in the Junk folder and block the sender, but if the email address is legitimate then I'm not sure how to proceed. Is there a Mozilla email address for reporting emails like this? I can't change my email address associated with my Mozilla account so any advice would be appreciated.
