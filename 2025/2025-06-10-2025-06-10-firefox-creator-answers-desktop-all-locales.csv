File Explorer's address bar shows the whole path to the folder. </p><p>If I find a bookmark through the Bookmarks&gt;Manage Bookmarks window's search box, the window gives no clue to where the bookmark is. If I display its properties with <em>Bookmarks&gt;Edit Bookmark</em>, it shows what folder the bookmark is in, but it gives no clue to where that folder is. If the folder's name is unique, an I created it, I can probably figure out where it is. But if the name is something generic like <em>Pending</em>, it's hopeless.
