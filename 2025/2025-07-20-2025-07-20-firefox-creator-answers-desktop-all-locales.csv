Originally I started with 512MB which seemed plenty, but got bloated eventually, so I increased it to 700MB, then 800MB thinking it should be fine, cause ""my personal data"" isn't that much.  </p><p>In the beginning i had to manually clear my own Website Data every couple months, deleting everything older than a year.  </p><p>Currently I have to delete my personal Data every 10 days and only keep the last 2-3 months, to not run out of space... I also started to not visit heavy Websites with firefox, but with another browser that doesn't run of a Ramdisk, but despite all my efforts I need some other solution.  </p><p>It feels like some files just keep growing over time without getting rid of old data, and storing new technical files, that i don't want in my profile folder... At this point, getting some extra 50-100MB that doesn't come from deleting my current data would be great... A way, to cleanup any unused data... I tried everything I could find, but I'm kinda stuck.
