For some reasons now it's all the tabs of all the windows in chronological order. It became practically unusable. Who the heck thought this was a smart move: turning a very practical feature into a useless one? Is there a turn-around? Maybe it's like the Window menu that used to be in chronological order and turned into an alphabetical order: a bureaucratic decision completely unaware of the users preferences.
