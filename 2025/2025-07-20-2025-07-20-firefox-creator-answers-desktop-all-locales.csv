The Interactive Artifacts work in Safari and on my iPhone app, but not in Firefox. I've tried clearing cache, disabling extentions, and opening up Claude in a Private Window, but nothing seems to work. I much prefer Firefox to other browsers. I haven't disbled Javascript (nor do I know how). What else could be causing this? One suggestion was to restore Firefox to default settings - I'd prefer ot to but if it works, I will do that. How do I do that? Is there anything else I should try? </p>",firefox-14004;firefox-1400;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",zleavitt

Originally I started with 512MB which seemed plenty, but got bloated eventually, so I increased it to 700MB, then 800MB thinking it should be fine, cause ""my personal data"" isn't that much.  </p><p>In the beginning i had to manually clear my own Website Data every couple months, deleting everything older than a year.  </p><p>Currently I have to delete my personal Data every 10 days and only keep the last 2-3 months, to not run out of space... I also started to not visit heavy Websites with firefox, but with another browser that doesn't run of a Ramdisk, but despite all my efforts I need some other solution.  </p><p>It feels like some files just keep growing over time without getting rid of old data, and storing new technical files, that i don't want in my profile folder... At this point, getting some extra 50-100MB that doesn't come from deleting my current data would be great... A way, to cleanup any unused data... I tried everything I could find, but I'm kinda stuck. Keeping all my Profile settings, customisations and still used personal Data is really important to me. </p>",firefox-14004;firefox-1400;windows-10;firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",aldawnsummer
