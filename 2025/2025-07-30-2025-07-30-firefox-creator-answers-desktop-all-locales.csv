However, I’ve encountered a frustrating issue regarding how history entries open: When I click on a history entry in the right-side history sidebar, it overwrites my current tab by default. To open it in a new tab, I have to manually press the Ctrl key while clicking — which breaks my long-standing browsing habit. Previously, in the version I used (the domestic variant), a simple click on a history entry always opened it in a new tab. Strangely, the left-side history panel (if applicable) also opens history entries in new tabs without overwriting. This inconsistent behavior between the sidebar and other interfaces is confusing. I understand some users might prefer overwriting the current tab, but flexibility is key. Could Mozilla add a configurable setting (e.g., in about:config or the preferences menu) to let users choose: </p><pre>   Option 1: Overwrite the current tab when clicking history entries.    Option 2: Open history entries in a new tab by default. </pre> <p>This would respect diverse user habits and resolve the mismatch between the sidebar and other history interfaces.

Then with one key we could just be taken to Chrome where the page would work correctly!  That would be just awesome! Firefox has really gone down the tubes as far as reliability is concerned.  I only use it because I prefer the layout but when it fails (every day multiple times) Chrome is the solution and it always works.  Why is this?
