However, I’ve encountered a frustrating issue regarding how history entries open:   When I click on a history entry in the **right-side history sidebar**, it **overwrites my current tab** by default. To open it in a new tab, I have to manually press the *Ctrl* key while clicking — which breaks my long-standing browsing habit.   Previously, in the version I used (the domestic variant), a simple click on a history entry always opened it in a new tab. Strangely, the **left-side history panel** (if applicable) also opens history entries in new tabs without overwriting. This inconsistent behavior between the sidebar and other interfaces is confusing.   I understand some users might prefer overwriting the current tab, but flexibility is key. Could Mozilla add a **configurable setting** (e.g., in *about:config* or the preferences menu) to let users choose:   - Option 1: Overwrite the current tab when clicking history entries.   - Option 2: Open history entries in a new tab by default.   This would respect diverse user habits and resolve the mismatch between the sidebar and other history interfaces. Thank you for considering this improvement!  我是一个中国地区的用户，因为国内的停运了，现在更新了国际版的火狐，但是在用到国际版的火狐中，我遇到了这个问题：在当我点击历史记录时，会把我当前的标签页覆盖，如果需要不覆盖当前标签页，则需要我按住ctrl再点击。在这之前，我用的版本一直都是在新标签上打开历史网址的，然后我发现在左侧的历史记录这，点击历史记录则不会覆盖标签页，也是新打开一个标签。这让我很苦恼，我之前一直的习惯逻辑都是点开就可以了，而且是点开右边的历史记录侧边栏。我希望能够增加个设置什么的，可以给予用户选择的权利，如果有人希望点开历史覆盖当前页面，则覆盖，希望新打开标签页的则可以打开新标签页。谢谢 </p>",firefox-1410;windows-10;firefox;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",1044064339

At that very same site I wanted to highlite copy and paste but when I did the highlight was so faint as to be almost invisable . After some attempts and not wanting to lose that feature I deleted the AI via mouse right click. Realizing that was not the problem I have searched several times but cannot get any further thru settings and more tools to try to Reinstall that feature . Also the sparkle button never showed with the fisrt install.  It originally appeared of its own accord . Will I get the choice again when I reboot ..&nbsp;? hope you can help me  thanks  mike </p>,windows-10;firefox;extensions;,firefox,extensions,en-US,1752706;,lungtamtn
