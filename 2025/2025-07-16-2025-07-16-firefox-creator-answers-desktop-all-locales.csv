I was faced with a ""Create Profile"" dialogue that launched me into a brand new profile with none of my settings, keybinds, cookies, extensions, anything. Despite this, I know for a fact that my old profiles are *still* there. As you can see my profile folders are right there, with all their data intact as far as I can tell from inspecting their contents, yet they are not accessible from the about:profiles.  </p><p>Please help me.
