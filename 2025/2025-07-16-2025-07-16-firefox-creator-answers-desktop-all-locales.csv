They require to select the username from a drop down list. (In my case it's a specific government portal with limited users, which are all in the drop down list). When I type in my username it will appear in the drop down list (which is actually only one field tall by then). But it is covered by Firefox's saved login button (which also pops up at the same spot). So I can't access the drop down list.  Is there any way I can avoid the saved login suggestion from popping up? </p>",firefox-1400;windows-10;firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",marc.gt400
