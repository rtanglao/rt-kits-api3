I frequently shop at particular store and have never had a problem.  </p><p>Now, it's off and on. One order will go through with the help of their customer service (doing a direct purchase). Then a few weeks later I don't have a problem and can order without assistance. Now, once again, I can't purchase anything. Once my credit card goes through my address disappears. Then I add my address again and then my credit card is deleted. When my address or my credit card is deleted the order has in bold red letters telling me to add it again.  I've tried Chrome after Firefox had  issues but it had an issue too. </p><p>Is there something I can disable while I shop? I'm not having any problems with any other sites.  Thank you! </p>",firefox-14004;firefox-1400;windows-11;firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",peaceful.angel
