I have spent years convincing others to make the switch to firefox, but what's the point if it ends up just as toxic and useless as every other browser. disappointing. </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",foxfernillustration

It's running, but stuck minimized. I can see the little mini version of it when i mouse over the shortcut on my taskbar. I've followed instructions of people who have also had this problem. I've deleted and renamed xulstore. The only thing that ever solves the problem when it comes up (which is often) is trying to uninstall firefox and then refreshing it instead.  </p><p>This is kind of untenable though because I'd really rather not reinstall my plugins every day and get logged out of everything.
