Some passwords sometimes sync. But many are missing on iOS, and many that are there are out of date. I've done the usual like logging out and in again, I've tried forcing sync manually, passwords are set to sync on both devices. This has been going on for years now and I'm at the point where I'm going to have to switch browsers as I can't keep not having access to my passwords on my phone. Any ideas on how I can fix this?

It's running, but stuck minimized. I can see the little mini version of it when i mouse over the shortcut on my taskbar. I've followed instructions of people who have also had this problem. I've deleted and renamed xulstore. The only thing that ever solves the problem when it comes up (which is often) is trying to uninstall firefox and then refreshing it instead.  </p><p>This is kind of untenable though because I'd really rather not reinstall my plugins every day and get logged out of everything. What should I do to make this problem go away forever without constantly having to take time and reset firefox </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",D4RK_ST4R

I clicked on a video to play, got the sound and no picture.   I closed out my browser and I kept getting the audio of the video and had to shut down my computer to stop it.   Now when I go to a video nothing works.  My cursor disappears when I go to chick on the video and I have to move it off to the side just to see my cursor. </p><pre>I also use a service (VidIQ) that helps me see the tags on the right hand side of my screen for a video and the channel so that I can compare those tags to my videos that I am uploading.   Now that never load just a spinning dial or object like it is stuck. </pre> <p>I hope that you can get this fixed soon or let me know if there is something that I must do at my end. </p><p>Thank you, </p><p>Johnny Dunn </p>",firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",johnroby
