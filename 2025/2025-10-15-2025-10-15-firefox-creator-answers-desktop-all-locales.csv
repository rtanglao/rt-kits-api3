As always, the first thing I did was download Firefox and set it to my default browser. Then I logged in and synced. Firefox picked up some things - like my passwords, but not a single instance of history, not a single bookmark, or the tiles of frequent websites seen on the new tab page.  Thinking something had gone wrong, I uninstalled FF and then reinstalled it. No change. As I was researching what to do when FF syncing fails, I realized that FF is not saving any data in history. NONE. I fiddled around with this situation for about five hours and it showed NO history of websites/pages visited. I went to a few common websites by name, typing <a href=""http://www.ebay.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.ebay.com</a> into the search bar (for example) and since that was a website I had now ""frequented"" I expected it to show up as a tile in the new tab page, but it didn't, even after closing it and opening it several more times to demonstrate (to FF) its frequent-ness. </p><p>What could be causing all this? I assume some settings in about:config are off, but can't find any information searching the web. No matter how I state the question, I only get responses like what to do if FF doesn't sync, NOT what to do if FF doesn't collect any history. Honestly, this is a standalone private home computer. It doesn't actually HAVE to sync with work. But it's not very useful to have a browser that collects NO history.  </p><p>Sorry this is so long, and may I say, any help will be seriously appreciated. </p>",firefox-14304;firefox-1430;windows-11;firefox;history;,firefox,history,en-US,"",Anaya

When using web applications such as Vimcar (<a href=""https://fleet.vimcar.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fleet.vimcar.com</a>) in Firefox, we observe a very high RAM consumption. A single Firefox tab can consume 2 GB of RAM or more after being open for several hours. As a result, the terminal server becomes slow or unresponsive, and other users on the same server are affected. Since the terminal server allocates resources on demand, a hanging process continues to request memory until it eventually terminates itself, which severely impacts overall system performance. </p><p>Questions: 1. Are there settings or configuration options to reduce Firefox’s memory usage in terminal server environments? 2. Are there recommended best practices for running Firefox with memory-intensive web applications on terminal servers? 3. Is it possible to set memory limits per tab or per user session to improve stability? </p><p>Thank you very much for your assistance. </p>",firefox-14304;firefox-1430;windows-11;firefox;app-responsiveness;,firefox,app-responsiveness,en-US,"",echle1
