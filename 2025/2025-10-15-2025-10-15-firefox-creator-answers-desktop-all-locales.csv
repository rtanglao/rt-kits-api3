I am thinking of deleting Firefox despite having been using it for years, a loyal customer who subscribes to your VPN. When I log in my pinned tabs do not open the web sites, I'm told I've got connection issues, I've removed the sites from tracking protection, X tells me that is an issue since it only started after the update before todays update. What is the point of pinned tabs if they don't open? If I can't resolve this issue I will use Chrome, All of my pinned sites open there I just have to get used to using another browser, I don't like Chrome very much but I'm pulling my hair out getting no joy from Firefox. There has to be a better way of contacting Firefox than spend ages online as though it's top secret!

When using web applications such as Vimcar (<a href=""https://fleet.vimcar.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fleet.vimcar.com</a>) in Firefox, we observe a very high RAM consumption. A single Firefox tab can consume 2 GB of RAM or more after being open for several hours. As a result, the terminal server becomes slow or unresponsive, and other users on the same server are affected. Since the terminal server allocates resources on demand, a hanging process continues to request memory until it eventually terminates itself, which severely impacts overall system performance. </p><p>Questions: 1. Are there settings or configuration options to reduce Firefox’s memory usage in terminal server environments? 2. Are there recommended best practices for running Firefox with memory-intensive web applications on terminal servers? 3. Is it possible to set memory limits per tab or per user session to improve stability? </p><p>Thank you very much for your assistance. </p>",firefox-14304;firefox-1430;windows-11;firefox;app-responsiveness;,firefox,app-responsiveness,en-US,"",echle1
