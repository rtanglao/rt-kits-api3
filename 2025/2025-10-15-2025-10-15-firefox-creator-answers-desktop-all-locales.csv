When using web applications such as Vimcar (<a href=""https://fleet.vimcar.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://fleet.vimcar.com</a>) in Firefox, we observe a very high RAM consumption. A single Firefox tab can consume 2 GB of RAM or more after being open for several hours. As a result, the terminal server becomes slow or unresponsive, and other users on the same server are affected. Since the terminal server allocates resources on demand, a hanging process continues to request memory until it eventually terminates itself, which severely impacts overall system performance. </p><p>Questions: 1. Are there settings or configuration options to reduce Firefox’s memory usage in terminal server environments? 2. Are there recommended best practices for running Firefox with memory-intensive web applications on terminal servers? 3. Is it possible to set memory limits per tab or per user session to improve stability? </p><p>Thank you very much for your assistance. </p>",firefox-14304;firefox-1430;windows-11;firefox;app-responsiveness;,firefox,app-responsiveness,en-US,"",echle1
