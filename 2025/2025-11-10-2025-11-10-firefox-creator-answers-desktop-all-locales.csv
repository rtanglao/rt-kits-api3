I tried to restore them, but I was unable to get them back from all of the 15 backup points. I kept getting an ""unable to process backup folder"" error message. I only have one Firefox profile that I am currently signed into. </p><p>I use CC cleaner to clean my computer weekly and sometimes use the custom clean feature to clean up cookies and browsing history, but by default the clean bookmark backups box is unchecked and I have never had a problem using it before. I suppose it's possible that I may have checked that box, but I don't know if that would have also wiped the bookmarks off my browser. I am also checking with CC tech support to see if they have any answers. Suppose I may be out of luck if so. </p><p>I also sometimes go into FF settings and clear browsing history and cookies, but I don't think there's even an option to wipe out all bookmarks. I have also been doing that for years, and have never had an issue before. Does anyone know if there's a way to re-download my bookmarks from the cloud, or do I have to start all over again? </p><p>Any tips would be appreciated, thanks. </p>",firefox-1440;windows-10;firefox;recover-data;,firefox,recover-data,en-US,1778031;,L......
