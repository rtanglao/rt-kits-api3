Unfortunately, I make a mistake, and the first character I type is 'b'. Firefox then offers the autocomplete ""<a href=""http://bc.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">bc.co.uk</a>"", and highlights it. I type another different letter, the added autocomplete offer is replaced with the character I added, and it will try to offer another autocomplete suggestion with all the characters I have typed so far. However, I realised the 'b' was wrong, so I press &lt;backspace&gt; then start typing ""<a href=""http://nextcloud.com"" rel=""nofollow"">nextcloud.com</a>"". Of course, the backspace key now only removed the autocomplete suggestion, leaving the original 'b' I typed (so I now have ""<a href=""http://bnextcloud.com"" rel=""nofollow"">bnextcloud.com</a>"").  My question: Is there a way set configure firefox so that the key sequence 'b' followed by '&lt;backspace&gt;' to return the address bar to the original (empty in this example) condition? If this means turning off auto-suggest, I am happy to do that, since I don't use it anyway.  </p><p>Thanks. </p>",firefox-14040;firefox-1404;linux;firefox;search-suggestions;,firefox,search-suggestions,en-US,"",paul684

I tried to restore them, but I was unable to get them back from all of the 15 backup points. I kept getting an ""unable to process backup folder"" error message.

I suppose it's possible that I may have checked that box, but I don't know if that would have also wiped the bookmarks off my browser. I am also checking with CC tech support to see if they have any answers. Suppose I may be out of luck if so. </p><p>I also sometimes go into FF settings and clear browsing history and cookies, but I don't think there's even an option to wipe out all bookmarks. I have also been doing that for years, and have never had an issue before.
