I type another different letter, the added autocomplete offer is replaced with the character I added, and it will try to offer another autocomplete suggestion with all the characters I have typed so far.

Of course, the backspace key now only removed the autocomplete suggestion, leaving the original 'b' I typed (so I now have ""<a href=""http://bnextcloud.com"" rel=""nofollow"">bnextcloud.com</a>"").  My question: Is there a way set configure firefox so that the key sequence 'b' followed by '&lt;backspace&gt;' to return the address bar to the original (empty in this example) condition?
