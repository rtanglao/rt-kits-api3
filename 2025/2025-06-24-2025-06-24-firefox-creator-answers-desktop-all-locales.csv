That is, if a certificate includes the Must-Staple flag and the web server fails to provide a stapled OCSP response, the connection is appropriately terminated. </p><p>Unexpected Behavior on iOS: However, we have observed that Firefox on iOS does not appear to enforce this requirement consistently. Even when the server does not provide a stapled OCSP response, the browser still establishes the TLS connection. We are unsure whether this is due to platform limitations or an implementation inconsistency. </p><p>Redundant OCSP Requests Despite Stapling: Additionally, we found that Firefox still initiates an OCSP request even when a valid stapled response has already been provided by the server. This behavior not only degrades performance but may also introduce privacy concerns, it contrary to the original privacy and efficiency goals of OCSP Stapling. </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",whimsy947

I do that, and web browsing works fine.  But, syncing does not work. It's as if the syncing feature doesn't use the installed certificate.  So, to sync, I have to use my phone hot-spot from time-to-time.  It's a big pain, however, when I've set or changed a password at the school and expect it to be available in all my other computers but I've forgotten to do the manual sync before I left.
