The theory forming currently is the website is having issues retrieving or reading the input images; however, this bug seems to be consistent with several other websites, indicating Firefox is not able to read the images correctly and thus could result in fragmentation. - The image posted is a .png file of a screenshot of an attempt to post a picture to social media, based on the functionality of this bug, I am predicting this image will be fragmented and will only show blue and black lines.

However, at one location, a school, there's a filtering system in place called Securly.  To get through the school filters, you have to download a certificate and install it.  I do that, and web browsing works fine.  But, syncing does not work. It's as if the syncing feature doesn't use the installed certificate.  So, to sync, I have to use my phone hot-spot from time-to-time.  It's a big pain, however, when I've set or changed a password at the school and expect it to be available in all my other computers but I've forgotten to do the manual sync before I left.  Is there a way to get the sync process to use the installed certificate? </p><p>Thanks! </p><p>-Farren </p>",firefox;sync-failure;,firefox,sync-failure,en-US,"",farren
