I have not been able to add any extension's tool to the toolbar.  It used to be that a left-click on the ""Extensions"" tool produced a drop down window with a list of installed extensions and the option to and/remove any extension from the toolbar.  Things still work this way with Microsoft Edge (Chromium) and Google Chrome. Left-clicking the new Firefox ""unified extensions tool"" opens an Add-ons Manager with ""Recommendations"", ""Extensions"", ""Themes"" and ""Plugins"".  Clicking on ""Extensions"" does list the extensions I have installed, but there is no way to add the tools for those extensions  to the toolbar.   </p><p>Please, please, please put to original ""Extensions"" tool back on the toolbar.  If you must add a tool to the toolbar for the ""Add-ons Manager"", do it.  I actually think that would be a very good idea.  Call the tool ""Add-ons Manager"", NOT ""Extensions""!  </p><p>NOTE: the computer I am running Firefox on in this instance does have my desired tools in the toolbar.  I installed Firefox on this machine long before the newer versions of Firefox were released.  I have used Firefox for years as my default browser on several computers over the years.  </p><p>Thank you, William A. Butcher </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",wbutcher8
