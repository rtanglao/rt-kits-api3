This Andhra vs Madhya Pradesh match at DY Patil was exactly that kind. A slow start, then a sudden collapse, then another weird collapse in reply. If someone only saw the scorecard, they might think it was a <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>low-skilled slogfest</strong></a>, but watching the overs unfold told a very different story. The pitch had bounce, not extreme bounce, just enough to poke the batter’s mind, and you could see every top-order player second-guessing whether to commit forward or stay hanging back. That hesitation usually becomes the real bowler. </p><p>Andhra batting: starts everywhere, but nothing sticks </p><p>Andhra never looked settled, even though a few strokes early on made it seem like they might find rhythm. Some balls begged to be hit, yet the timing kept disappearing at the last moment. Batters tried nudging singles when twos were possible, then suddenly someone would attempt a risky loft, looking like they wanted to force a tempo that the pitch did not really allow. The collapse was not the dramatic kind. It came like drops of water leaking from a bucket that no one cared to fix. One wicket, then a small partnership, then another wicket that looked more self-inflicted than created. </p><p>Madhya Pradesh bowlers did not bowl unplayable spells. They bowled that annoying hard length that lives between comfortable shot making and proper defence. Half the dismissals looked like the batter was caught between options. When a team ends on 112 in a T20 on a fairly standard surface, it usually means they never figured out what the surface actually <a href=""https://betbhai9.news/home/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://betbhai9.news/home/</a> wanted from them, and that is exactly what happened here. </p><p>The tiny target that carried huge tension </p><p>Chasing 113 should not feel like a task big enough to trouble a top domestic side. Yet somehow, MP started like the pitch suddenly became a minefield. The new ball jagged a bit, though nothing outrageous, but enough to make the shot choice complicated. <a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Andhra’s bowlers</a>, for the first time, looked like they understood the surface. They pitched fuller surprisingly, but it worked. MP’s top order played away from the body or through the line without fully reading the seam movement, then those edges flew to fielders who barely had to move. </p><p>A chase of 113 becoming 21 for 4 is the kind of moment that wakes up even a silent dressing room. For a few overs, the match stood at that awkward point where both teams felt equally uncertain about how this would play out. Andhra suddenly sensed they had a chance to steal a game they had almost thrown away earlier. The energy in their huddle doubled. The fielders became louder, not over the top loud, just that sudden sharpness that arrives only when a tiny hope reappears. </p><p>Middle overs: MP settling but not really dominating </p><p>After the early chaos, MP steadied things through<a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">small nudges. </a>No big strokes, just a determination not throw it away. It was not pretty cricket. It was not commanding either. It felt like two players agreeing silently to let the game crawl rather than sprint. Andhra bowlers still kept landing those difficult lengths, though one or two loose deliveries each over allowed the scoreboard to breathe just enough. </p><p>This middle phase did something important for MP. It reminded them that they did not need to chase at high speed. When the required rate stays below six, the game becomes more about avoiding mistakes than creating brilliance. Andhra tried changing pace sometimes, too much variation, and that made life easier for the batters, who finally understood that simple batting works on this surface. </p><p>Why this match felt strange from beginning to end </p><p>Nothing flowed in a normal T20 rhythm. A pitch that looked decent played trickily. A batting lineup that should have cruised instead stumbled early. A small target created pressure like a big one. You could sense the players second-guessing everything. Even the crowd seemed confused at times, not sure whether the match was heading toward a thriller or a slow surrender. </p><p>For Andhra, the biggest frustration will be how avoidable their collapse was. Most wickets came from indecision. Not poor technique, not great bowling, just that half-second of doubt. For MP, the concern is clear. If chasing 113 creates this much panic, then future bigger chases might expose deeper issues. Still, a win is a win, and grinding one out often teaches more than winning effortlessly. </p><p>Final thought: a match both teams will remember for different reasons </p><p>Andhra will remember the missed chance.<a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">MP will remember</a> the early scare. Coaches will remember the middle overs where the game drifted almost aimlessly. Viewers will remember the feeling that anything could happen, even though the final result looked one-sided on paper. </p><p>Sometimes cricket does not follow patterns. This game was that reminder. </p>",windows-11;firefox;search-tag-and-share;,firefox,search-tag-and-share,en-US,"",kunalvarma4577

No matter the way that I select something to print (print to PDF, print to printer), firefox won't print anything anymore. The print options screen does pop-up when ""print"" is selected , but when ""print"" is selected on the print screen pop-up nothing happens. This includes the ""print to PDF"" function as no ""save to"" file folder pop-up opens to select where you want to save the pdf file to. After an update prior to the ""Version 145.0.2, November 26, 2025"" firefox no longer allows you to move your tabs from their original positions to the left or right along the tab bar in the browser. I use to be able to click on &amp; select one or more tabs and move those tabs anywhere to the left or right of their original position to anyplace along the tabs bar. NOW at present, the only way to move any tab's position is by ""right clicking"" on the tab, select from the drop down ""move tab"" and selecting 1 of the 3 options (""Move to start"", ""move to end"", &amp; ""move to new window""). You can also add tabs to groups through the ""right clicking"" process. Unfortunately you can't simply move tabs in any other ways without using those ""right click menu options. This is VERY frustrating because I constantly move tabs (or strings of tabs) to better group them without having to add them to specific ""groups"". And speaking of groups, you can no longer rearrange the tabs in ""groups"" either.  </p><p>These are both some of the most basic and general functions for firefox that no longer work in firefox 64 bit on windows 10 OS (my primary PC, but the same holds true on Windows 11). You should also note that recent updates also occured on both Windows 10 &amp; Windows 11. I am still currently able to print from and move tabs in the Edge browser which I have had to start using more &amp; more since these functions stopped working in the firefox browser. I've always preferred using firefox even though it is a huge resource hog, but if firefox doesn't fix these problems soon. I will have to resort to using the Edge browser over using the firefox browser. That reminds me of a 3rd problem with your ""unload tab"" function, 3. The ""unload tab"" function ONLY works if you click on and open the single tab first. The ""unload tab"" function ONLY WORKS for a SINGLE TAB at a time. When/if you select multiple tabs and select the ""unload tab"" function in the ""right click"" drop-down, ONLY the first tab selected and that you are currently on, using, and viewing will ""unload"" while NONE OF the remaining selected tabs will ""unload"". You need to make a way to ""unload"" ALL TABS that you are NOT currently viewing/using as ""unloading"" tabs one at a time is painfully tedious. The ""unload tab"" function would be a great idea to reduce firefox from being the huge memory hogger that it is, but only if you make using the ""unload tab"" function's use less tedious. Perhaps Mozilla should consider making the ""unload tab"" function less necessary, by either making the ""unload tab"" function automatic and not NEED to run every opened tab until said tabs are actually in use &amp; actively being used OR BY making firefox less of the enormous resource hog that it has become. </p>",firefox-1460;windows-10;firefox;print;,firefox,print,en-US,"",frostyfee
