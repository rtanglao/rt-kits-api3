Users should not be required to reenter their credentials to access the integrated app via a NetSuite subtab. However, this has been an ongoing issue. I thought it had something to do with cookies, but I cannot figure out what is causing this. Here's what happens: A user logs in to Netsuite, looks up a posted document, and clicks on the subtab of the integrated application. They are then prompted to enter their credentials. This prompt keeps repeating whenever the user refreshes a page or opens a tab. It seems like the browser is not retaining or saving the user's credentials. This does not happen to Chrome or Edge users. Is there anything you can do? </p><p>Your assistance is greatly appreciated. </p><p>Regards, Mac </p>",firefox-1460;windows-11;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",mlegaspi

No matter the way that I select something to print (print to PDF, print to printer), firefox won't print anything anymore. The print options screen does pop-up when ""print"" is selected , but when ""print"" is selected on the print screen pop-up nothing happens. This includes the ""print to PDF"" function as no ""save to"" file folder pop-up opens to select where you want to save the pdf file to. After an update prior to the ""Version 145.0.2, November 26, 2025"" firefox no longer allows you to move your tabs from their original positions to the left or right along the tab bar in the browser. I use to be able to click on &amp; select one or more tabs and move those tabs anywhere to the left or right of their original position to anyplace along the tabs bar. NOW at present, the only way to move any tab's position is by ""right clicking"" on the tab, select from the drop down ""move tab"" and selecting 1 of the 3 options (""Move to start"", ""move to end"", &amp; ""move to new window""). You can also add tabs to groups through the ""right clicking"" process. Unfortunately you can't simply move tabs in any other ways without using those ""right click menu options. This is VERY frustrating because I constantly move tabs (or strings of tabs) to better group them without having to add them to specific ""groups"". And speaking of groups, you can no longer rearrange the tabs in ""groups"" either.  </p><p>These are both some of the most basic and general functions for firefox that no longer work in firefox 64 bit on windows 10 OS (my primary PC, but the same holds true on Windows 11). You should also note that recent updates also occured on both Windows 10 &amp; Windows 11. I am still currently able to print from and move tabs in the Edge browser which I have had to start using more &amp; more since these functions stopped working in the firefox browser. I've always preferred using firefox even though it is a huge resource hog, but if firefox doesn't fix these problems soon. I will have to resort to using the Edge browser over using the firefox browser. That reminds me of a 3rd problem with your ""unload tab"" function, 3. The ""unload tab"" function ONLY works if you click on and open the single tab first. The ""unload tab"" function ONLY WORKS for a SINGLE TAB at a time. When/if you select multiple tabs and select the ""unload tab"" function in the ""right click"" drop-down, ONLY the first tab selected and that you are currently on, using, and viewing will ""unload"" while NONE OF the remaining selected tabs will ""unload"". You need to make a way to ""unload"" ALL TABS that you are NOT currently viewing/using as ""unloading"" tabs one at a time is painfully tedious. The ""unload tab"" function would be a great idea to reduce firefox from being the huge memory hogger that it is, but only if you make using the ""unload tab"" function's use less tedious. Perhaps Mozilla should consider making the ""unload tab"" function less necessary, by either making the ""unload tab"" function automatic and not NEED to run every opened tab until said tabs are actually in use &amp; actively being used OR BY making firefox less of the enormous resource hog that it has become. </p>",firefox-1460;windows-10;firefox;print;,firefox,print,en-US,"",frostyfee

However, with stats for nerds open on the videos, no frame drops are reported and buffer health is fine (40+ seconds).  </p><p>I'm on an up to date version of FireFox, I've tried with hardware acceleration both enabled and disabled, I've tried opening task manager to see if system usage looked weird (it doesn't, although it's not like I can have TM running while the video is playing in fullscreen so hard to tell) and am at a complete loss. All drivers for CPU and GPU are verifiably up to date (did full system check three days ago) and the only conclusion I've been able to come to is that it must be either a problem with FireFox or a problem with YouTube. I've seen no recent reports on any of the forums that I can find pointing to either as the culprit. So if anyone has any further ideas or solutions, I'd love to here them. </p>",firefox-1460;windows-10;firefox;audio-and-video;,firefox,audio-and-video,en-US,1785475;,connerpearce1216
