I got the message below, but going to settings, sync just wants me to sign in and do a cloud backup.  Doesn't sound like what is in message below that I got after updating to 146.0.  From what I found looking around going to setting, sync, click on backup and choose location.  There is no option backup, just sign on.   </p><p>Windows 10 users can now automatically protect their passwords, bookmarks, and more by turning on backup in Firefox. Your browsing data is saved daily on your device and can be encrypted with a password When you set up a fresh install of Firefox on any operating system for a new device or your current one, you can restore from this backup and pick up right where you left off. This feature is currently available on Windows devices and will be coming to other operating systems soon. </p>",firefox-1460;windows-10;firefox;backup-data;,firefox,backup-data,en-US,"",diverjer

The box you once checked to save favorite site shortcuts now says ""sites you save OR VISIT"". Thats just utterly ridiculous, especially when I have set cookies and history to be deleted on browser exit. </p><p>PLEASE FIX THIS - Not user friendly in the least Thank You </p>",firefox-1460;windows-11;firefox;home-screen;,firefox,home-screen,en-US,"",chillpill1706
