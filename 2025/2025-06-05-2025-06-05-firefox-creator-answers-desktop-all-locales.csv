However, the bar seems critically hindered by lack of keyboard accessibility. Two things in particular: </p><p>1) when quick actions appear (e.g., Clear recent history), I cannot figure out how to navigate to it with the keyboard. Down-arrowing simply skips over it. </p><p>2) I don't seem to be able to select which search engine to use. On Mac, Option+up/down used to select search engines with the old address bar, but no key combination seems to move through or activate the drop-down menu of search engine choices. </p><p>The page introducing the feature doesn't seem to explain how to use it with keyboard at all.
