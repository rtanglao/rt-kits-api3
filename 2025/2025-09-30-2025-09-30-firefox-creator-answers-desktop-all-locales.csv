I mainly keep my apps at the start menu for my convenience. </p><p>Basically the problem here is the shortcut icon, so take this Messenger web app as an example. If I pin this to taskbar, or even make a desktop shortcut, it's showing the correct icon, it's also in the start menu but unpinned. However, when I pin it to the start menu, in the app catalog, it changes to the Firefox icon (for some reason the one on the taskbar sometimes does that as well). </p><p>I've tried looking into the Properties tab of the shortcut, but apparently it's already set to the Messenger icon, so I'm guessing it's primarily the start menu problem. </p>",firefox-14301;firefox-1430;windows-10;firefox;customization;,firefox,customization,en-US,1768482;,swannah016
