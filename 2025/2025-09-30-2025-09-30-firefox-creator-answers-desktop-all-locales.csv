It's not possible to remove those blanks via customize. </p><p>I click on my ""clear"" and ""zoom"" icons hundreds of times a day and I prefer having my browser non-full-width (prefer 2/3 width). </p><p>Anyone know what caused this and/or how to fix it (apart from rolling back to 142). Once again Mozilla has broken something that worked perfectly for me for many years and I suspect it has something to do with more screwing around with tabs. (I do use a CSS file solely to keep tabs on bottom.) </p><p>Alternatively, is there a way to shorten the address bar? That might create room for my add-on icons to re-appear while leaving the spurious blank spaces on the menu bar. </p><p>Thanks in advance! --KK </p>",firefox-14303;firefox-1430;windows-10;firefox;browser-appearance;,firefox,browser-appearance,en-US,"",kakaako

Basically if you left click on something and hold the click for a second or two a menu appears that offers an AI generated list of suggestions related to the thing you were clicking on. How do I disable this? In searching I have found suggestions to open about:config and set the value for ui.click_hold_context_menus to false, which I have done a few weeks ago now and it has no affect. I also tried changing the related value of ui.click_hold_context_menus.delay to an insanely long time, but that also had no effect.  </p><p>I would appreciate some guidance on how to turn this off. This is problematic enough that I may have to switch to another browser if this can't be disabled.  Thanks!
