With the ESR (currently 128.5) and the page is working correctly. When we switched back to latest 133 and the bug is there </p><p><br> In the situations it happens, sometimes our css is NOT being loaded.  In others, it is loaded and doesn't work but I see things trying to render before the file shows up in the console network logs. When it works...it is coming up cached. So this feels like a race condition of some type </p><p><br> I'm pretty sure the rule is that css is blocking, because we discussed race conditions when we implemented this, so this might be a Firefox bug? If this is a Firefox bug that isn't in an esr yet, we want to get it filed against firefox and fixed before the next esr.  </p><p>We even tried a hacky patch on our code's method that is in question, as well as tried putting the expected css font-family style into a &lt;style&gt; tag in our index.html. The patch worked on Windows. It did not work on Mac. Stepping through the code, we see `undefined` / `null`. This definitely implies that the css styles simply have not been applied when the first component asking for the theme is routing through this code. </p><p><br> So again: our Firefox &gt; 132.  ESR up to 131 doesn't produce this issue, so something changed in Firefox 132. </p><p><br> If we tried loading our css file in a parent page (just loading, not using) to get it into the mix sooner, it doesn't help.
