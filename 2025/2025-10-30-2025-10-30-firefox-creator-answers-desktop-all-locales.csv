Co. did not work on Firefox, but did work on Microsoft Edge.  I received some suggestions on what to try, but the problem resolved itself after a couple of days.  Lo and behold, yesterday Microsoft ran an update to Windows 11, which they seem to do every two or three days!!!) and now I have the same problem with Hulu that I had before.  I get the impression Microsoft is doing that on purpose to force users to use their browser and I resent the hell out of it.  Any suggestions on how to get around this problem, short of running the updates?  I'd hate to quit using Firefox when streaming on Hulu. </p>",firefox-14402;firefox-1440;windows-11;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",ppgminark
