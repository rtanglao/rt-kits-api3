Individually I have no problems sending to and fro the tabs from desktop to iPhone and vice versa. When there are two iPhones involved (say work and personal iPhones), trouble arises. <strong>Problem#1:</strong> why does Firefox continue to refer to my iPhone-15 whose name is <strong>""ABC iPhone15""</strong> as merely <strong>""iPhone""</strong>? Thereby when I send my tabs to my device it will be <strong>""Firefox on iPhone""</strong>. It should be <strong>""Firefox on ABC iPhone15""</strong> <strong>Problem#2:</strong> Confusion furthers when there are two iPhone-15 synced with the FF Desktop. Both continue to be referred to as <strong>""Firefox on iPhone""</strong>.  How would I know which one is the personal versus work iPhone? </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",arunkumarvedavyasan

(using Wndows 11) That page does not appear. I wish to change my value for width scrollbar width from zero to 4. I have also accessed videos - with sound -but find i very hard to follow the voice of the presenter because he/she talks far too fast, and in many instances is outdated! I need a page on screen that tells me to type in specific keystroke to get to the page that lists a preference I can change. </p>",firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",colsarll

(A problem I have since discovered had nothing to do with Firefox it has to do with eBay). I had asked GPTchat for suggestions and  it had me open a terminal and run some commands (don't remember what it was). while running this command we lost power and since then I cannot resize a Firefox window. However other windows like Dolphin or LibreOffice are unaffected. All else appears to run fine </p>,firefox-13501;firefox-1350;firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",tom502

I tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox but now every time I do that it automatically imports all the saved information for both Google accounts, even when I click to restore default settings it auto imports  after that.
