The old behavior is that it opens a slightly larger preview where you were then allowed to navigate to the website where the image was hosted OR to the image location, itself, if that's what you wanted to do. And, on other browsers, this is how the behavior is still happening. What's going on with Firefox? </p>",firefox;search-tag-and-share;,firefox,search-tag-and-share,en-US,1714225;,FireFoxFan1

I also find that in settings I have the message ""Firefox Multi-Account Containers requires container tabs"".

Thereby when I send my tabs to my device it will be <strong>""Firefox on iPhone""</strong>. It should be <strong>""Firefox on ABC iPhone15""</strong> <strong>Problem#2:</strong> Confusion furthers when there are two iPhone-15 synced with the FF Desktop.
