Individually I have no problems sending to and fro the tabs from desktop to iPhone and vice versa. When there are two iPhones involved (say work and personal iPhones), trouble arises. <strong>Problem#1:</strong> why does Firefox continue to refer to my iPhone-15 whose name is <strong>""ABC iPhone15""</strong> as merely <strong>""iPhone""</strong>? Thereby when I send my tabs to my device it will be <strong>""Firefox on iPhone""</strong>. It should be <strong>""Firefox on ABC iPhone15""</strong> <strong>Problem#2:</strong> Confusion furthers when there are two iPhone-15 synced with the FF Desktop. Both continue to be referred to as <strong>""Firefox on iPhone""</strong>.  How would I know which one is the personal versus work iPhone? </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",arunkumarvedavyasan
