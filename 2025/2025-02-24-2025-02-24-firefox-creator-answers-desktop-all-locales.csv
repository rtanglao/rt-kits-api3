(A problem I have since discovered had nothing to do with Firefox it has to do with eBay). I had asked GPTchat for suggestions and  it had me open a terminal and run some commands (don't remember what it was). while running this command we lost power and since then I cannot resize a Firefox window. However other windows like Dolphin or LibreOffice are unaffected. All else appears to run fine </p>,firefox-13501;firefox-1350;firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",tom502

I tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox but now every time I do that it automatically imports all the saved information for both Google accounts, even when I click to restore default settings it auto imports  after that. How can I make it so this does not happen, I would like to just start with a clean slate. </p>",firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",danteyay
