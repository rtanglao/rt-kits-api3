I followed the instructions from the support article Multi-Account Containers link here: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/containers</a> but was unable to do anything other than install the extension. I have no access to a containers icon despite looking in my toolbox, settings, and extensions. When I click on tabs I am unable to put tabs into containers despite following the presented instructions. I also find that in settings I have the message ""Firefox Multi-Account Containers requires container tabs"". I thought that downloading the extension would allow for container tabs but I am unable to even find the option to open containers. I've attached some images to provide context as to what I am seeing. Any help you could provide would be greatly appreciated. </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",jmkamholz

Individually I have no problems sending to and fro the tabs from desktop to iPhone and vice versa. When there are two iPhones involved (say work and personal iPhones), trouble arises. <strong>Problem#1:</strong> why does Firefox continue to refer to my iPhone-15 whose name is <strong>""ABC iPhone15""</strong> as merely <strong>""iPhone""</strong>? Thereby when I send my tabs to my device it will be <strong>""Firefox on iPhone""</strong>. It should be <strong>""Firefox on ABC iPhone15""</strong> <strong>Problem#2:</strong> Confusion furthers when there are two iPhone-15 synced with the FF Desktop. Both continue to be referred to as <strong>""Firefox on iPhone""</strong>.
