This behavior differs from Safari, where pinned tabs persist across all open windows. When a Firefox window containing pinned tabs is closed, those tabs are permanently removed. This implementation undermines the intended purpose of pinned tabs, which is to provide persistent, easily access to sites regardless of session or window state. Pinned tabs should ideally remain consistent across all browser windows and persist until explicitly unpinned by the user. The current behavior results in a poor user experience and discourages users who expect cross-window and session persistence, functionality that aligns more closely with the concept of “pinning.” I have raised his limitation repeatedly, but it remains unaddressed. A more consistent, user-centric approach would ensure pinned tabs are retained globally until manually dismissed. </p>",firefox;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",t7s8dbndwj

Hello everyone, I run a website, which provides information about mobile phone prices and SIM packages in Bangladesh. Recently, I noticed that when users visit some pages in Firefox, the browser shows a “mixed-content” warning or blocks certain scripts. The same pages load fine in Chrome. All my URLs use HTTPS, and I’m using a LiteSpeed server with Cloudflare CDN. Could this issue be related to how Firefox handles external resources (like embedded operator banners or analytics scripts)? What’s the best way to debug and fix mixed-content problems in Firefox Developer Tools? Any detailed guidance or best practices would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance! </p>",windows-10;firefox;encryption;,firefox,encryption,en-US,1777252;,rahmatbl.1122
