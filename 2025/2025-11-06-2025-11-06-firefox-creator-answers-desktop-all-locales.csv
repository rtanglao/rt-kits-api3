Her üç pencere içerisinde, görmek istediğim tüm bilgiler okunaklı bir şekilde yer alıyordu. Yeni versiyonunda pencereleri yine minimum boyuta getiriyorum. Ancak üç pencereyi, aynı anda, notebook ekranıma sığdıramıyorum ve dolayısıyla tüm bilgileri aynı anda göremiyorum. İkinci veya üçüncü penceredeki verilerinin bir kısmını anlık olarak (canlı) görmekten vazgeçmem gerekiyor. Önceki versiyonların birinde yine aynı problemi yaşamıştım. Sonra gelen otomatik updateler ile sorunum kendiliğinden giderilmişti. Yardımlarınınz için şimdiden teşekkür ederim.
