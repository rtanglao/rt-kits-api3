HELP!,"<p>(If any relevance, I'm on Macos 12 Monterey) 'Installation and updates' seemed the nearest topic due to the 'update' part of it, since this seems to only have been happening since this version, or I have simply not noticed due to not having needed to know. But if you look at my two screenshots, you will see the issue. There simply is no <em>About Firefox</em> on my firefox. Neither directly listed on the menu, nor as part of the 'help' sub menu. </p><p>Is there, for the sake of learning, a simple fix, so that I donlt have to uninstall/re-install? or an 'about config' type fix? Screenshot 1 shows the menu Screenshot 2 shows help sub-menu As you can see, absolutely no <em>About Firefox</em> </p><p>And, only potential issue may be, as you'll see from the <em>share data</em> upload is that I've a lot of tabs open, as I've got a lot to get through toniught, and tomorrow. So, maybe, t=though doubtfully, it is because it isn't handling the tabs and this caused a menu entry to be missing? Surely not likely. </p>",firefox-14402;firefox-1440;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;update;,firefox,update,en-US,"",womble.dung

Hello everyone, I run a website, which provides information about mobile phone prices and SIM packages in Bangladesh. Recently, I noticed that when users visit some pages in Firefox, the browser shows a “mixed-content” warning or blocks certain scripts. The same pages load fine in Chrome. All my URLs use HTTPS, and I’m using a LiteSpeed server with Cloudflare CDN. Could this issue be related to how Firefox handles external resources (like embedded operator banners or analytics scripts)? What’s the best way to debug and fix mixed-content problems in Firefox Developer Tools? Any detailed guidance or best practices would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance! </p>",windows-10;firefox;encryption;,firefox,encryption,en-US,"",rahmatbl.1122

This could be because when I start typing in the search box, it immediately relocates what I'm typing to the address bar.  Maybe this is the behaviour I need to disable?  But how and why is it the default? </p><p>Help! </p><p>Browser details </p><p>$ &gt; snap info firefox name:      firefox summary:   Mozilla Firefox web browser publisher: Mozilla✓ store-url: <a href=""https://snapcraft.io/firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://snapcraft.io/firefox</a> contact:   <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/file-bug-report-or-feature-request-mozilla"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/file-bug-report-or-feature-request-mozilla</a> license:   unset description: | </p><pre> Firefox is a powerful, extensible web browser with support for modern web application  technologies. </pre> <p>commands: </p><pre> - firefox  - firefox.geckodriver </pre> <p>snap-id:      3wdHCAVyZEmYsCMFDE9qt92UV8rC8Wdk tracking:     latest/stable/ubuntu-24.04 refresh-date: 19 days ago, at 13:56 AEDT channels: </p><pre> latest/stable:    144.0.2-1    2025-10-29 (7177) 261MB -  latest/candidate: 145.0-1      2025-11-04 (7242) 262MB -  latest/beta:      145.0b9-1    2025-10-31 (7213) 262MB -  latest/edge:      146.0a1      2025-11-05 (7250) 298MB -  esr/stable:       140.4.0esr-2 2025-10-14 (7023) 258MB -  esr/candidate:    140.5.0esr-1 2025-11-05 (7236) 258MB -  esr/beta:         ↑                                      esr/edge:         ↑                                     </pre> <p>installed:          144.0-2                 (7084) 261MB - </p><p><br> OS Details </p><p>PRETTY_NAME=""Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS"" NAME=""Ubuntu"" VERSION_ID=""24.04"" VERSION=""24.04.3 LTS (Noble Numbat)"" VERSION_CODENAME=noble ID=ubuntu ID_LIKE=debian HOME_URL=""<a href=""https://www.ubuntu.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ubuntu.com/</a>"" SUPPORT_URL=""<a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.ubuntu.com/</a>"" BUG_REPORT_URL=""<a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/</a>"" PRIVACY_POLICY_URL=""<a href=""https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy</a>"" UBUNTU_CODENAME=noble LOGO=ubuntu-logo </p>",firefox-1440;linux;firefox;search;,firefox,search,en-US,"",ak.mozilla
