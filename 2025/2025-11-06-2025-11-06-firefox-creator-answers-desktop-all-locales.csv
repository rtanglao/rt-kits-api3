Hello everyone, I run a website, which provides information about mobile phone prices and SIM packages in Bangladesh. Recently, I noticed that when users visit some pages in Firefox, the browser shows a “mixed-content” warning or blocks certain scripts. The same pages load fine in Chrome. All my URLs use HTTPS, and I’m using a LiteSpeed server with Cloudflare CDN. Could this issue be related to how Firefox handles external resources (like embedded operator banners or analytics scripts)? What’s the best way to debug and fix mixed-content problems in Firefox Developer Tools? Any detailed guidance or best practices would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance! </p>",windows-10;firefox;encryption;,firefox,encryption,en-US,"",rahmatbl.1122

This could be because when I start typing in the search box, it immediately relocates what I'm typing to the address bar.  Maybe this is the behaviour I need to disable?  But how and why is it the default? </p><p>Help! </p><p>Browser details </p><p>$ &gt; snap info firefox name:      firefox summary:   Mozilla Firefox web browser publisher: Mozilla✓ store-url: <a href=""https://snapcraft.io/firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://snapcraft.io/firefox</a> contact:   <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/kb/file-bug-report-or-feature-request-mozilla"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/kb/file-bug-report-or-feature-request-mozilla</a> license:   unset description: | </p><pre> Firefox is a powerful, extensible web browser with support for modern web application  technologies. </pre> <p>commands: </p><pre> - firefox  - firefox.geckodriver </pre> <p>snap-id:      3wdHCAVyZEmYsCMFDE9qt92UV8rC8Wdk tracking:     latest/stable/ubuntu-24.04 refresh-date: 19 days ago, at 13:56 AEDT channels: </p><pre> latest/stable:    144.0.2-1    2025-10-29 (7177) 261MB -  latest/candidate: 145.0-1      2025-11-04 (7242) 262MB -  latest/beta:      145.0b9-1    2025-10-31 (7213) 262MB -  latest/edge:      146.0a1      2025-11-05 (7250) 298MB -  esr/stable:       140.4.0esr-2 2025-10-14 (7023) 258MB -  esr/candidate:    140.5.0esr-1 2025-11-05 (7236) 258MB -  esr/beta:         ↑                                      esr/edge:         ↑                                     </pre> <p>installed:          144.0-2                 (7084) 261MB - </p><p><br> OS Details </p><p>PRETTY_NAME=""Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS"" NAME=""Ubuntu"" VERSION_ID=""24.04"" VERSION=""24.04.3 LTS (Noble Numbat)"" VERSION_CODENAME=noble ID=ubuntu ID_LIKE=debian HOME_URL=""<a href=""https://www.ubuntu.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ubuntu.com/</a>"" SUPPORT_URL=""<a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.ubuntu.com/</a>"" BUG_REPORT_URL=""<a href=""https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/</a>"" PRIVACY_POLICY_URL=""<a href=""https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy</a>"" UBUNTU_CODENAME=noble LOGO=ubuntu-logo </p>",firefox-1440;linux;firefox;search;,firefox,search,en-US,"",ak.mozilla
