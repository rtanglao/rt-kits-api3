Ending support in september would still be sad, because people too stubborn or not willing to upgrade probably still wont when support of firefox ends.

Perhaps that is difficult for today's tech whizz-kids to understand but I can't help that. I'm not really technical but have had Firefox for nearly 30 years, so can anyone tell me if it's possible to copy my Firefox into a folder somewhere perhaps, and reconstitute it to work with my new OS?
