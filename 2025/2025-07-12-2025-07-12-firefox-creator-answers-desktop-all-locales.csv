That worked up until I got version 140.0.4 installed - now it completely ignores this setting no matter what I set. I tried using <a href=""http://cloudflare-ech.com"" rel=""nofollow"">cloudflare-ech.com</a> website for test and it confirms that my browser uses TLS 1.3 with ECH. I also tried modifying security.tls.version.fallback-limit to 0 and security.tls.version.min to 0 to get a possible range of TLS 1.0-1.2, but it still uses TLS 1.3. </p>",firefox-14004;firefox-1400;windows-11;firefox;encryption;,firefox,encryption,en-US,"",Shararamosh
