(I have hundreds of documents in Wordpad (.rtf) and MS are just cancelling it!) It'll probably be Linux based. So, simply I want to take my existing Firefox browser with passwords etc., to my new OS. I asked this question in Firefox and it seems Mozilla can't get over the fact that I don't want change my iOS browser to a synched up Firefox. I don't want my phone connected to my pc. Perhaps that is difficult for today's tech whizz-kids to understand but I can't help that. I'm not really technical but have had Firefox for nearly 30 years, so can anyone tell me if it's possible to copy my Firefox into a folder somewhere perhaps, and reconstitute it to work with my new OS?
