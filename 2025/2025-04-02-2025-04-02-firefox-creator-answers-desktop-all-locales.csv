I’m writing to asking for help about an issue with the camera not working on Mozilla Firefox during video calls. When I try to join a Google Meet session, I receive a message asking me to grant camera permissions - even though the permissions are already enabled both in the browser and my computer’s settings.   </p><p>Interestingly, the camera works perfectly fine on other browsers like Google Chrome, so the issue seems to be specific to Firefox. I’ve already checked the following:  </p><p>- Camera permissions are all allowed for Google Meet in Firefox; - The system settings (Windows) permit Firefox to access the camera; - No other applications are blocking the camera. I know that 'cause I'm using this camera on WhatsApp and TikTok Live Studio. </p><p>Could y'all please help me resolve this? I’d appreciate any troubleshooting steps or fixes you can provide. </p><p>PS.: The images are written in portuguese. But it's all how I told you before. </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",samyamesquita
