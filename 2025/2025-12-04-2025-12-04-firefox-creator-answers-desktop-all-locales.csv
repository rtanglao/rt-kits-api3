I have to sign into my email many times a day and also to the New York Times Games which I subscribe to.

I have to go through the rigamarole of signing in yet again.   </p><p>I do not have to do this on my phone as the sites recognize me.  I used to be able to do this on this computer also now I can no longer do it.
