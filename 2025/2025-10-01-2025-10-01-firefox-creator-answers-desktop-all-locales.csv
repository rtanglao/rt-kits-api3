That same ticket system continues to work fine in Safari, Edge, Chrome and Brave, etc. </p><p>Worse, when one does try to downgrade, the old profile gets removed which means you lose EVERYTHING you had (tabs, bookmarks and presumably all the settings and saved passwords, etc). You need to be keeping the old profiles around so that they can be accessed again should someone NEED to downgrade. Fortunately I was able to use Time Machine to recover the old profile --- but somebody just didn't think this through. </p><p>Much as I have loved Firefox over the years, I'm starting to feel that it's time to give up on it and move to something else. </p><p>Turning off automatic updates is not a solution because eventually one will choose to upgrade manually and most people won't remember to make a copy of their existing profile. Should one then encounter a problem, you're back to square one </p><p>Very disappointing . </p>",firefox-14301;firefox-1430;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;profiles;,firefox,profiles,en-US,"",dhjdhj

Đây là một tính năng rất cần thiết, đặc biệt là đối với tôi khi thường xuyên đọc tài liệu nước ngoài. Việc gặp phải những từ khó khiến quá trình đọc hiểu trở nên chậm hơn, vì vậy nếu có sẵn tính năng dịch từ ngôn ngữ khác sang tiếng Việt thì sẽ vô cùng tiện lợi và hữu ích. Tôi nhận thấy hiện nay trình duyệt đã hỗ trợ dịch từ tiếng Việt sang tiếng Anh, nhưng chiều ngược lại thì chưa có. Rất mong cộng đồng hoặc đội ngũ phát triển có thể chia sẻ thêm thông tin về việc liệu tính năng này có nằm trong kế hoạch phát triển tương lai hay không, và nếu có thì dự kiến khi nào sẽ ra mắt. Xin chân thành cảm ơn! </p>",firefox-14303;firefox-1430;windows-11;firefox;languages;,firefox,languages,en-US,"",thuantran.123

Is there a simpler way to stop Gmail treating my emails as spam? I can send bulk emails using my personal Gmail address. This may have nothing to do with Mozilla but I thought I would ask.
