And most often the back arrow button is grayed out and I can't get back at all. </p><p>In settings, I've tried checking the box for: 'Open links in tabs instead of new windows' but that doesn't do it. I've also tried checking the box, 'When you open a link in a new tab, switch to it immediately,' and that doesn't do it either. </p><p>I know that a work-around is to hold down the Ctrl key while clicking a link, but I'd like to set it as a default so I don't have to do that. That's a pain and not a natural function when browsing. To be sure, I want to click on links and that creates a new Tab without Ctrl Keys. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",firefox-1430;windows-10;firefox;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",StevenLAX16

Đây là một tính năng rất cần thiết, đặc biệt là đối với tôi khi thường xuyên đọc tài liệu nước ngoài. Việc gặp phải những từ khó khiến quá trình đọc hiểu trở nên chậm hơn, vì vậy nếu có sẵn tính năng dịch từ ngôn ngữ khác sang tiếng Việt thì sẽ vô cùng tiện lợi và hữu ích. Tôi nhận thấy hiện nay trình duyệt đã hỗ trợ dịch từ tiếng Việt sang tiếng Anh, nhưng chiều ngược lại thì chưa có. Rất mong cộng đồng hoặc đội ngũ phát triển có thể chia sẻ thêm thông tin về việc liệu tính năng này có nằm trong kế hoạch phát triển tương lai hay không, và nếu có thì dự kiến khi nào sẽ ra mắt.
