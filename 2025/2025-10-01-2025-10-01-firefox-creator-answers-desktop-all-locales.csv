Within roughly a minute, the internet just died on my desktop again. I grabbed my work laptop, also running Windows 11: same issue happened within 60 seconds. I checked Firefox on a desktop running Windows 10 - had no issues at all.  </p><p>Today, I installed Firefox on another laptop (the same model at the other one) running Windows 11. As soon as it synced my account, the internet stopped working. I though it may be the Sync option, so I reinstalled Firefox on my laptop but did not log in to Sync - the same issue: dead internet within 30 seconds now.  </p><p>I have: </p> <ul><li> Run anti-virus </li><li> Run network diagnostics and reset </li><li> Rebooted a multitude of times </li><li> Uninstalled, reinstalled at least twice </li><li> Run troubleshooting in Firefox (which I cannot attach the logs due to it being uninstalled right now) </li><li> Checked to make sure my modem/routers are working right (no one else in the building has this issue and we all use Firefox, but none are synced to my account) </li><li> I even asked my company's tech team (who are mostly software developers) and they said No, sorry, we don't help with that (wonderful right?) </li></ul> <p>I've attached a screenshot of the OG machine's information.

Đây là một tính năng rất cần thiết, đặc biệt là đối với tôi khi thường xuyên đọc tài liệu nước ngoài. Việc gặp phải những từ khó khiến quá trình đọc hiểu trở nên chậm hơn, vì vậy nếu có sẵn tính năng dịch từ ngôn ngữ khác sang tiếng Việt thì sẽ vô cùng tiện lợi và hữu ích. Tôi nhận thấy hiện nay trình duyệt đã hỗ trợ dịch từ tiếng Việt sang tiếng Anh, nhưng chiều ngược lại thì chưa có. Rất mong cộng đồng hoặc đội ngũ phát triển có thể chia sẻ thêm thông tin về việc liệu tính năng này có nằm trong kế hoạch phát triển tương lai hay không, và nếu có thì dự kiến khi nào sẽ ra mắt.
