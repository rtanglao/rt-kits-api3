For Deviant Art this caused an existential crises. My user name includes uppercase letters. Firefox password manager saved it in all lower case for some odd reason. And to make things even more frustrating, the username and password fields do not seem to recognize the auto fill. By the time I've realized what's going on, DA has locked me out from logging in or even attempting to recover my username and password until I clear the cache for another go... which means having to do the rounds of logging back into my e-mail and other accounts. Hopefully I've fixed the user name entry in the password file... </p><p>On the one hand, yes I'm frustrated, on the other, is there some way to fix the DA log in issue? </p><pre>..and can we please not log people out of webpages when the browser updates? If that's at all possible?  </pre> <p>Heck, I'd settle for an easy way to clear site specific cookies. And it needs to be something I'm not going to have to search for the next time I'm booted out of a finicky website. </p>",firefox-14402;firefox-1440;windows-10;firefox;password-autofill;,firefox,password-autofill,en-US,"",kittyrinn1
