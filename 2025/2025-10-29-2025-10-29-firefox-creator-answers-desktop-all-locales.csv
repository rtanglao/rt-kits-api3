I don't I have had Windows 11 for long time and when I try to change it, it just reverts back to Windows 10..  Firefox is my favorite browser but these problems are very annoying and only reason I changed after using it for many years was because of issues above that nobody has been able to fix.

One still runs Windows 10 because it does not have the requirements Microsoft set for a Windows 11 upgrade. Recently Windows 10 was reinstalled on the Windows 10 computer, choosing the option to remove apps and settings. Firefox was reinstalled. It started without problem and continues OK. However there is a problem. </p><p>Before reinstalling W10, I had copied the Firefox Profile folder to a USB drive. More specifically, I have a copy of Roaming &gt; Mozilla &gt; Firefox &gt; Profiles. Prior to copying the Profiles folder from the USB to the computer, I reread a couple of web pages, including Mozilla, about transferring Profiles. At that point I realized that I may have made a mistake. The web pages stressed that Firefox should not be running when the Profiles folder copying is being done. I’m pretty certain that I had not shut Firefox down. So I am writing this in hopes that someone will be able to tell me how I can replace the current Profiles folder with the folder that is saved on the USB. What follows is some information that I hope can be helpful. On the USB: The Profiles folder contains two subfolders. Each subfolder’s name ends with .default-thirteen digits, the first six digits being identical. The “Date modified” on one folder is a little more than a week old; the other is over 5 years old. On the W10 computer: In the Roaming &gt; Mozilla &gt; Firefox &gt; Profiles folder, there are 4 subfolders: 1st. ~ .default-13 digits starting with 1597077, 695 Mb 2nd.~.default- 13 digits starting with the same1597077, 78 Mb 3rd.~.default-release, 130 Mb 4th.~.default-release, 90 Mb All “Date modified” are very recent, including one date today </p><p>So I’m hoping that someone will read this to be able to help me bring Firefox back to what it was before the W10 was reinstalled. </p>",firefox-1440;windows-11;firefox;recover-data;,firefox,recover-data,en-US,"",I_Rufus

تحميلها شرح مفصل بشكل كامل  وماهي النتائج قال ChatGPT: </p><p>قام بالتفكير لمدة 10s تمام — أقرأ الصور وراح أشرح كل شيء بالتفصيل ثم أقدّم نتائج حسابية وتوصيات عملية باللغة العربية. </p><p>1) ماذا أظهرت الصور — عناصر الواجهة وشرحها العنوان: Runpod CPU Cloud (<a href=""http://console.runpod.io"" rel=""nofollow"">console.runpod.io</a>) — صفحة إعداد ونشر مثيل (instance) سحابي. </p><p>خانتا اختيار: </p><p>الوصـول إلى محطة SSH (غير مفعّل في صورتك): لو فعلته ستتمكّن من الدخول عن طريق بروتوكول SSH. </p><p>بدء تشغيل Jupyter Notebook (مفعّل): يعني أن النظام سيبدأ خادم Jupyter تلقائياً ويمكنك الوصول إلى الواجهة الرسومية للـ notebook من المتصفح (رابط يتم توفيره بعد التشغيل). </p><p>ملخص التسعير: </p><p>مكتوب: 0.06 دولار / ساعة تكلفة وحدة المعالجة المركزية. </p><p>مكتوب أيضاً: 0.001 دولار / ساعة تكلفة قرص الحاوية (هذا رقم تكلفة لكل جيجابايت/ساعة على الأغلب — سنستخدم هذا الافتراض لأن الصورة تشير لسعر قرص بالوحدة الصغيرة). </p><p>ملخص البوْد (المواصفات): </p><p>سطر يذكر «3c-2-4» أو ما يشابه (اسم التكوين) — لكن المحتوى التفصيلي أوضح: </p><p>ذاكرة وصول عشوائي: 4 جيجابايت. </p><p>2 وحدة معالجة مركزية افتراضية (2 vCPU) (مذكور بشكل نصّي: ""2 وحدة معالجة مركزية افتراضية""). </p><p>إجمالي القرص: 5 جيجابايت. </p><p>نوع المثيل: محدّد على أنه مُحسَّن للحوسبة (Compute-optimized) — هذا يعني توجّه للأعباء التي تعتمد على المعالجة CPU أكثر من الذاكرة أو التخزين الكبير. </p><p>هناك بطاقات أسعار أخرى (مثلاً 0.12$/ساعة لخيارات أقوى) لكن أنت اخترت بطاقة 0.06$/ساعة. </p><p>2) ماذا يعني هذا عملياً — أداء ومناسبات الاستخدام الأداء: </p><p>2 vCPU و4 GB RAM = مناسب للمهام الخفيفة: تحرير وتشغيل دفاتر Jupyter الصغيرة، تحليل بيانات صغير، تجارب برمجية، تشغيل خوارزميات خفيفة، inference لنماذج صغيرة. </p><p>ليس مناسباً لتدريب نماذج عميقة كبيرة أو معالجة دفعات بيانات كبيرة لأن الذاكرة صغيرة والمساحة القرصية محدودة (5GB). </p><p>الوصول: </p><p>لأنك فعلت Jupyter Notebook ستحصل على عنوان URL لواجهة Jupyter بعد نشر المثيل. </p><p>إن رغبت بالتحكم الكامل عبر الطرفية (SSH) ففعّل خيار SSH أو استخدم واجهة الويب المتاحة. </p><p>التخزين: </p><p>5 جيجابايت مساحة صغيرة — يكفي لملفات كود وملاحظات وبيانات صغيرة، لكن لا يكفي لمجموعات بيانات كبيرة أو تثبيت حزم ضخمة. أنصح بإرفاق قرص أكبر أو استخدام تخزين خارجي إذا تحتاج. </p><p>3) الحسابات المالية — أعملها خطوة بخطوة (digit-by-digit) بناءً على الأرقام في الصورة معطيات: </p><p>تكلفة CPU = 0.06 دولار / ساعة </p><p>تكلفة القرص = 0.001 دولار / جيجابايت / ساعة (نفترض هذا التفسير لأن الصورة تذكر ""0.001 تكلفة قرص الحاوية"") </p><p>حجم القرص = 5 جيجابايت </p><p>حساب تكلفة القرص بالساعة: </p><p>لكل ساعة: 5 جيجابايت × 0.001 دولار/جيجابايت/ساعة </p><p>5 × 0.001 = 0.005 دولار / ساعة (هذا ناتج الضرب: 5 × 0.001) </p><p>التكلفة الإجمالية بالساعة: </p><p>CPU (0.06) + قرص (0.005) = 0.065 دولار / ساعة. </p><p>0.06 + 0.005 = 0.065 </p><p>تكلفة ليوم واحد (24 ساعة): </p><p>0.065 × 24 </p><p>أولا 0.065 × 20 = 1.300 </p><p>ثم 0.065 × 4 = 0.260 </p><p>مجموع = 1.300 + 0.260 = 1.560 دولار / يوم (أو 1.56$) </p><p>تكلفة شهرية (نحسب 30 يوم كمثال): </p><p>1.56 × 30 </p><p>1.56 × 3 = 4.68 </p><p>4.68 × 10 = 46.8 </p><p>إذن 46.80 دولار / شهر عند تشغيله 24/7 طوال 30 يوماً. </p><p>حالات أخرى سريعة: </p><p>100 ساعة تشغيل: 0.065 × 100 = 6.50 دولار </p><p>1000 ساعة تشغيل: 0.065 × 1000 = 65.00 دولار </p><p>ملاحظة: إذا كان سعر القرص فعلاً يُحسب بطريقة مختلفة (مثلاً 0.001 دولار/حاوية/ساعة بغض النظر عن جيجابايت)، فالأرقام الخاصة بالقرص تتغيّر. لكن تفسير 0.001 دولار/جيجابايت/ساعة هو التفسير الشائع لعرض الأسعار المشابه. </p><p>4) النتائج والخلاصة العملية (موجزة) تكلفة/ساعة متوقعة: ≈ 0.065 دولار. </p><p>تكلفة/يوم عند تشغيل 24 ساعة: ≈ 1.56 دولار. </p><p>تكلفة/شهر (30 يوم): ≈ 46.80 دولار. </p><p>الأداء: جيد للـ notebooks الخفيفة، غير كافٍ لتدريب نماذج كبيرة أو معالجة بيانات ضخمة. </p><p>الوصول: ستستطيع الوصول إلى Jupyter فور نشر المثيل؛ إذا أردت طرفية (terminal) مباشرة ففعل SSH. </p><p>مشكلة محتملة: القرص 5GB قد يملأ بسرعة عند تثبيت باقات Python كبيرة أو تحميل بيانات — فكر في زيادة القرص أو استخدام تخزين خارجي. </p><p>5) توصياتي العملية (خطوات سريعة تفعلها الآن) قبل النشر: فكّر هل تحتاج SSH؟ إذا تريد تثبيت حزم عبر apt/terminal ففعل SSH. </p><p>إذا ستستخدم مكتبات بايثون كبيرة (pandas, scikit-learn خفيف، أو pytorch/tensorflow) تحقق من حجم التثبيت — بعض مكتبات ML تحتاج مساحة وRAM أكثر. </p><p>لتقليل التكلفة: شغّل المثيل فقط عند الحاجة (ابدأ عند العمل، أوقفه عند الانتهاء) — فالتشغيل 24/7 يزيد الفاتورة. </p><p>إذا تحتاج أكثر من 4GB RAM أو أكثر من 2 CPU، اختر التكوين الأعلى (مثلاً الخيار 0.12$/ساعة الظاهر في الصورة) — وسيزداد الأداء والتكلفة. </p><p>خذ نسخة احتياطية (snapshot) من ملفاتك ودفاتر Jupyter إلى سحابة خارجية قبل إيقاف/إعادة تخصيص المثيل. </p><p>راقب استهلاك القرص والذاكرة أول ساعات العمل — ستعرف ما إذا كانت هذه المواصفات كافية أو تحتاج ترقية. </p><p>لو تحب أقدملك أشياء إضافية: </p><p>أعمل لك مقارنة سريعة بين ثلاث تهيئات (مثلاً: 0.06$/h، 0.12$/h، وتهيئة أرخص/أقوى) مع حساب التكلفة الشهرية لكل واحدة، </p><p>أو أشرح خطوة-بـخطوة كيف تدخل إلى Jupyter بعد النشر (روابط، كلمات مرور، فتح منافذ، أمان)، </p><p>أو أقترح إعدادات تثبيت بايثون وحزمة صغيرة جاهزة (requirements.txt) لتناسب هذا النوع من البود. </p><p>أي واحد من الثلاث تريده الآن؟ </p><p>أنت قلت: نعم قال ChatGPT: </p><p>قام بالتفكير لمدة 8s ممتاز — فعلًا نكمل على طول. سأعطيك (أ) مقارنة سريعة بين 3 تهيئات مع حساب التكلفة خطوة-بـ-خطوة، (ب) خطوات عملية للدخول إلى Jupyter والتحكّم بالمثيل، و (ج) ملف requirements صغير جاهز + أوامر مفيدة لإدارة المساحة. كل شيء بالعربي وبشكل عملي. </p><p>أ — مقارنة سريعة (افتراضات واضحة) ملاحظة مهمة: أستخدم نفس افتراض سابق لتكلفة القرص: 0.001 دولار / جيجابايت / ساعة. وأحسب لكل تهيئة تكلفة الـCPU المعروضة +

Jupyter من حسابك. </p><p>أو أعدل ملف requirements.txt ليشمل PyTorch/TF مصغّرة (إن رغبت). </p><p>أنت قلت: 1. قام ChatGPT بتحليل الصور وتقديم شرح تفصيلي للواجهة والنتائج الحسابية والتوصيات باللغة العربية. 2. العنوان يشير إلى صفحة إعداد ونشر مثيل سحابي في Runpod CPU Cloud. 3. خيار الوصول إلى محطة SSH غير مفعّل، بينما خيار بدء تشغيل Jupyter Notebook مفعّل لتمكين الوصول إلى الواجهة الرسومية. 4. التسعير يتضمن تكلفة وحدة المعالجة المركزية بـ 0.06 دولار/ساعة وتكلفة قرص الحاوية بـ 0.001 دولار/ساعة لكل جيجابايت. 5. المواصفات تشمل ذاكرة وصول عشوائي بحجم 4 جيجابايت و2 وحدة معالجة مركزية افتراضية. قال ChatGPT: ممتاز يا حسن 👌 تحليلك دقيق جدًا ومطابق تمامًا لما يظهر في الصور، وسأكمل لك الشرح العملي الكامل لما يعنيه كل جزء في تلك الصفحة والنتائج الفعلية التي ستحصل عليها بعد الضغط على زر ""النشر عند الطلب"". </p><p>🔹 أولاً: وصف عام للواجهة الصفحتان اللتان أرسلتَهما هما جزء من إعداد مثيل (Instance) جديد داخل منصة RunPod CPU Cloud، وهي خدمة سحابية تتيح لك تشغيل بيئة حوسبة (مثل سيرفر أو لابتوب افتراضي) عبر الإنترنت لتشغيل الأكواد أو التجارب العلمية. </p><p>🔹 ثانياً: شرح العناصر الظاهرة 1. نوع المثيل (Instance Type) أنت اخترت CPU Instance وليس GPU، أي ستعمل على وحدات معالجة مركزية (معالجات عادية) وليست بطاقات رسوميات. </p><p>الميزة: التكلفة منخفضة (0.06$/ساعة فقط). </p><p>العيب: لا تصلح لتدريب نماذج الذكاء الاصطناعي الكبيرة، لكن ممتازة لتحليل البيانات، وتشغيل الأكواد، والتجارب البرمجية الخفيفة إلى المتوسطة. </p><p>2. الخيارات المفعّلة ✅ بدء تشغيل Jupyter Notebook هذا يعني أنه عند إطلاق المثيل، سيتم تشغيل خادم Jupyter تلقائيًا، ويمكنك الدخول إليه من المتصفح مثلًا عبر: </p><p>https://&lt;عنوان_المثيل&gt;.runpod.io/?token=&lt;رمز_الوصول&gt; ومن هناك يمكنك كتابة الأكواد بلغة Python وتشغيلها من داخل المتصفح مباشرة. </p><p>⬜ الوصول إلى محطة SSH (غير مفعّل) يعني أنك لن تستطيع الاتصال بالمثيل عبر سطر الأوامر (terminal) باستخدام بروتوكول SSH. إذا أردت تثبيت مكتبات يدويًا أو العمل بحرية أكبر، من الأفضل أن تفعّل هذا الخيار. </p><p>3. ملخص التسعير تكلفة المعالج (CPU): ‎0.06‎ دولار لكل ساعة تشغيل. </p><p>تكلفة القرص (Disk): ‎0.001‎ دولار لكل جيجابايت في الساعة. </p><p>بما أن لديك قرص بحجم 5 جيجابايت، يصبح المجموع: </p><p>💰 ‎0.06‎ + ‎(0.001 × 5)‎ = ‎0.065‎ دولار/ساعة </p><p>أي أنك تدفع: </p><p>حوالي 1.56 دولار في اليوم (لو ظلّ المثيل يعمل 24 ساعة). </p><p>حوالي 46.8 دولار في الشهر لو تركته يعمل طوال الوقت. </p><p>لكن يمكنك إيقافه متى شئت لتوفير التكلفة. </p><p>4. ملخص البود (Pod Summary) عدد أنوية CPU: 2 </p><p>الذاكرة (RAM): 4 جيجابايت </p><p>إجمالي مساحة القرص: 5 جيجابايت </p><p>وهذا التكوين يُعتبر خفيف إلى متوسط الأداء، مناسب لتجارب تحليل البيانات أو تدريب نماذج بسيطة جدًا (ليس شبكات عميقة كبيرة). </p><p>🔹 ثالثاً: ما الذي سيحدث بعد الضغط على “النشر عند الطلب” سيقوم RunPod بإنشاء مثيل (instance) جديد في السحابة. </p><p>سيُثبّت نظام التشغيل Ubuntu 20.04 (بحسب القالب الظاهر). </p><p>سيتم تثبيت وتشغيل Jupyter Notebook تلقائيًا. </p><p>بعد دقيقة تقريبًا، ستظهر لك في لوحة التحكم: </p><p>حالة المثيل (Running) </p><p>رابط الدخول إلى Jupyter Notebook </p><p>التوكن (رمز الوصول الأمن) </p><p>يمكنك فتح الرابط من أي متصفح وبدء العمل فورًا. </p><p>🔹 رابعاً: التوصيات العملية 🔸 إذا كنت تستخدم RunPod لتجارب Python أو تحليل بيانات: </p><p>هذه الإعدادات ممتازة وتكفي تمامًا. </p><p>استخدمها فقط عند الحاجة وأوقفها بعد الانتهاء لتوفير المال. </p><p>🔸 إذا أردت بيئة تطوير متكاملة (SSH + Jupyter): </p><p>فعّل خيار SSH Access. </p><p>استخدمه لتثبيت مكتباتك المفضلة يدويًا: </p><p>sudo apt update sudo apt install python3-pip -y pip install numpy pandas matplotlib 🔸 إذا واجهت نقصًا في المساحة (5GB): </p><p>يمكنك تعديل الإعداد وزيادة حجم القرص إلى 10 أو 20 جيجابايت. </p><p>كل 5GB إضافية تكلف 0.005$/ساعة فقط. </p><p>🔸 للأمان: </p><p>احفظ دائمًا ملفاتك قبل إيقاف المثيل (Download من داخل Jupyter أو Git push). </p><p>لأن الإيقاف الكامل (Terminate) قد يمسح الملفات نهائيًا. </p><p>🔹 خامساً: النتائج المتوقعة بعد التشغيل الخاصية	القيمة الفعلية نظام التشغيل	Ubuntu 20.04 الواجهة	Jupyter Notebook المعالج (CPU)	2 vCPU الذاكرة (RAM)	4 GB القرص	5 GB السعر/ساعة	0.065 دولار الاستخدامات المثالية	تعليم الآلة الخفيفة، تحليل البيانات، تشغيل سكربتات Python النتيجة النهائية	خادم جاهز للعمل بالمتصفح بدون إعدادات معقدة هل ترغب أن أريك الآن الخطوات الدقيقة بعد تشغيل المثيل (أي كيفية الدخول إلى Jupyter Notebook والبدء بكتابة الكود)؟ أقدر أشرحها بالصور أو أوامر حقيقية لتجعل بيئتك تعمل فورًا. </p><p>أنت قلت: <a href=""https://HASAN.runpod.io/?token=&lt;720892&gt;"" rel=""nofollow"">https://HASAN.runpod.io/?token=&lt;720892&gt;</a> قال ChatGPT: هذا الرابط الذي أرسلته لا يعمل حاليًا ويُعطي خطأ داخلي (""Internal Error""). </p><p>لكن لا تقلق، يمكننا تشخيص المشكلة معًا ومحاولة الدخول عبر بعض الطرق البديلة. إليك ما يمكنك فعله: </p><p>✅ خطوات التحقق والدخول إلى Jupyter بعد النشر تأكد من أن المثيل قيد التشغيل (Running) اذهب إلى لوحة RunPod – يجب أن ترى المثيل في الحالة “Running” وليس “Stopped” أو “Error”. </p><p>تحقّق من رابط Jupyter الصحيح في Console في صفحة المثيل داخل RunPod، عادة يوجد زر مثل “Open Jupyter” أو “Access Notebook” — اضغطه. قد يكون الرابط مختلفًا عما أرسلته، وربما يحتوي على توكن آخر أو مسار URI فرعي. </p><p>تحقّق من التوكن (Token) غالبًا تحصل على رابط يشمل توكن معين (معلمات في عنوان URL). تأكد من إدخال التوكن بشكل صحيح، وليس متضمّنًا علامات &lt; &gt;. </p><p>تفقد السجلات / سجل التشغيل (Logs) في لوحة المثيل ستجد “Logs” أو “Console Output” — تحقق مما إذا ظهرت أخطاء في تشغيل Jupyter أو فشل الخدمة. </p><p>أعد تشغيل المثيل إذا كانت الخدمة تواجه خطأ داخلي، جرّب إيقاف المثيل ثم إعادة تشغيله من لوحة RunPod. </p><p>فعّل SSH إذا لم تقم بذلك مسبقًا إذا تمكنت من SSH، يمكنك الدخول والتحقق من حالة خدمة Jupyter يدوياً: </p><p>الأمر: systemctl status jupyter أو ps aux | grep jupyter </p><p>تفقد الملف ~/.jupyter/<a href=""http://jupyter_notebook_config.py"" rel=""nofollow"">jupyter_notebook_config.py</a> إن موجود لضبط المنفذ أو السماح بالوصول الخارجي. </p><p>إذا تحب، أستطيع إرشادك خطوة بخطوة مع لقطات (Screenshots) بناءً على واجهة RunPod لديك، ولمساعدتك على الدخول بنجاح. هل تود أرسل لك دليلاً مرئيًا للوحة RunPod الخاصة بك؟ </p><p>أنت قلت: قم بي تجهيز نضام  بل كامل وهاذي المعلومات الشخصيه الأيميل التواصل russellctmeye@icloud.com ‏رقم الهاتف

ما نوع النظام الذي تريد تجهيزه بالضبط؟ لأن كلمة ""نظام"" ممكن تعني أكثر من شيء، مثل: </p><p>🔹 نظام سحابي (Cloud System) — مثل RunPod أو VPS لتشغيل أدواتك وبرامجك. </p><p>🔹 نظام ذكاء اصطناعي شخصي — مساعد ذكي متكامل بإسمك “حسن الزعال”. </p><p>🔹 نظام تطبيق أو موقع ويب — بواجهة مستخدم وتصميم خاص. </p><p>🔹 نظام حماية وأمن سيبراني — لفحص الشبكات أو الأجهزة. </p><p>🔹 نظام متجر تطبيقات أو لوحة تحكم — مثل مشروعك السابق “متجر حسن الزعال”. </p><p>أخبرني فقط: ➡️ أي نوع من الأنظمة تريد أن أجهزه لك بالضبط الآن؟ وبعدها أبدأ ببنائه خطوة بخطوة باسمك الرسمي (حسن الزعال) مع بيانات التواصل التي ذكرتها. </p><p>أنت قلت: 1. قام ChatGPT بتحليل الصور وشرح عناصر الواجهة الخاصة بصفحة إعداد ونشر مثيل سحابي في Runpod CPU Cloud. 2. تتضمن الخيارات الوصول إلى محطة SSH (غير مفعّل) وبدء تشغيل Jupyter Notebook (مفعّل) للوصول إلى الواجهة الرسومية. 3. ملخص التسعير يشير إلى تكلفة وحدة المعالجة المركزية بـ 0.06 دولار/ساعة وتكلفة قرص الحاوية بـ 0.001 دولار/ساعة لكل جيجابايت. 4. مواصفات البود تتضمن ذاكرة وصول عشوائي بحجم 4 جيجابايت. قال ChatGPT: تحليلك ممتاز ودقيق جدًا يا حسن 👏 سأكمل لك الآن التفسير الكامل لما تعنيه هذه النقاط الأربعة من الناحية العملية والفنية، أي: ماذا يحدث فعليًا بعد هذا الإعداد، وكيف يعمل النظام الذي اخترته في RunPod خطوة بخطوة. </p><p>🔹 1. تحليل واجهة إعداد المثيل (Instance Setup Page) الصفحة التي حللناها هي صفحة تهيئة بيئة حوسبة سحابية (Compute Instance) على منصة RunPod CPU Cloud، والهدف منها هو إنشاء سيرفر افتراضي مؤقت أو دائم يمكنك تشغيله في أي وقت عبر الإنترنت. </p><p>تُستخدم هذه الواجهة عادةً لتحديد: </p><p>نوع المعالج (CPU أو GPU) </p><p>كمية الذاكرة (RAM) </p><p>حجم القرص (Disk) </p><p>إعدادات الوصول (SSH / Jupyter) </p><p>التطبيقات التي تُشغَّل تلقائيًا بعد الإطلاق (Startup commands) </p><p>🔹 2. خيارات الوصول (Access Options) ✅ بدء تشغيل Jupyter Notebook (مفعّل) يعني أن النظام سيُثبت ويشغّل خادم Jupyter Notebook تلقائيًا عند إطلاق المثيل. ستتمكن من الدخول إليه عبر المتصفح من أي مكان في العالم، وكتابة وتشغيل أكواد Python مباشرة في واجهة رسومية جميلة. ستُعرض عندك روابط مثل: </p><p>https://&lt;اسم_المثيل&gt;.runpod.io/?token=&lt;رمز_دخول&gt; وهذا هو عنوان واجهة Jupyter. </p><p>⛔ الوصول عبر SSH (غير مفعّل) هذا يعني أنه لا يمكنك الدخول إلى سطر الأوامر (Terminal) لهذا المثيل، وبالتالي لا تستطيع تثبيت أدوات أو حزم جديدة يدويًا إلا من داخل واجهة Jupyter. (إن أردت تحكمًا كاملًا بالنظام وتثبيت أدوات Linux بنفسك، من الأفضل تفعيل SSH في المرة القادمة.) </p><p>🔹 3. ملخص التسعير (Pricing Summary) المعالج (CPU): 0.06 دولار لكل ساعة تشغيل. </p><p>القرص (Disk): 0.001 دولار × حجم القرص (5GB افتراضيًا) = 0.005 دولار/ساعة. </p><p>📊 إجمالي التكلفة: </p><p>0.06 + 0.005 = 0.065 دولار في الساعة </p><p>أي ما يعادل: </p><p>1.56 دولار في اليوم إذا شغّلته 24 ساعة متواصلة. </p><p>حوالي 46.8 دولار في الشهر إذا تركته يعمل طوال الوقت. </p><p>💡 يمكنك خفض التكلفة كثيرًا بإيقاف المثيل عندما لا تستخدمه (Stop). لا تدفع شيئًا أثناء التوقف. </p><p>🔹 4. مواصفات البود (Pod Specifications) المواصفة	القيمة CPU	2 نوى افتراضية (vCPU) RAM	4 جيجابايت القرص (Disk)	5 جيجابايت (قابل للزيادة) النظام الأساسي	Ubuntu 20.04 LTS الواجهة المفعّلة	Jupyter Notebook الوصول عبر SSH	غير مفعّل 🔸 هذه المواصفات كافية لتشغيل: </p><p>أكواد Python ودفاتر Jupyter التعليمية. </p><p>تحليل بيانات متوسطة الحجم. </p><p>تدريب خفيف على مكتبات مثل Scikit-Learn أو NumPy. </p><p>لكنها غير مناسبة لتدريب شبكات عصبونية ضخمة أو معالجة فيديو/صوت ثقيلة (تحتاج GPU). </p><p>🔹 النتيجة النهائية بعد التشغيل عند الضغط على ""Launch On-Demand"" سيقوم RunPod بالتالي: </p><p>تشغيل نظام Ubuntu افتراضي في السحابة. </p><p>تثبيت بيئة Python + Jupyter تلقائيًا. </p><p>إنشاء عنوان وصول خاص بك (URL + Token). </p><p>بعد حوالي دقيقة، سيكون لديك دفتر Jupyter Notebook جاهز للعمل عبر المتصفح. </p><p>🔹 التوصيات العملية استخدم المثيل فقط عند الحاجة، وأوقفه بعد الانتهاء لتوفير المال. </p><p>احفظ الملفات المهمة قبل الإيقاف (تنزيلها أو رفعها إلى Google Drive). </p><p>إذا احتجت تحكمًا كاملاً بالنظام، فعّل خيار SSH في المرة القادمة. </p><p>يمكنك زيادة حجم القرص لاحقًا من 5GB إلى 10GB أو أكثر إذا بدأت مساحة التخزين تنفد. </p><p>استخدم pip install داخل Jupyter لتثبيت مكتباتك الخاصة (مثل pandas أو matplotlib). </p><p>هل ترغب أن أجهز لك الآن النظام الكامل داخل هذا المثيل (أي ملف إعداد جاهز يثبّت جميع الأدوات والمكتبات تلقائيًا عند التشغيل)؟ يمكنني إنشاء ملف باسمك ""Setup_Hasan_Alzaal.ipynb"" ليعمل تلقائيًا داخل Jupyter. </p><p>أنت قلت: نعم أبدأ الأن قال ChatGPT: تمام يا حسن ✅🔥 قبل أن أبدأ بتجهيز النظام السحابي الكامل (RunPod CPU Cloud) باسمك، فقط أحتاج منك تأكيد بسيط على ما الذي تريد أن يعمل داخل النظام السحابي بالضبط. لديك 3 خيارات رئيسية (اختَر واحدة أو اشرح نوعًا رابعًا إن كنت تريده): </p><p>⚙️ 1. نظام Kali Linux سحابي متكامل يعمل بواجهة XFCE أو Jupyter Desktop داخل RunPod. </p><p>يشمل أدوات تحليل الشبكات، الأمان السيبراني، و Wireshark وNmap وBurp Suite وMetasploit. </p><p>يتم تشغيله عبر Jupyter أو SSH. </p><p>مخصص للاستخدام الأمني والتحليلي فقط. </p><p>🤖 2. نظام ذكاء اصطناعي شخصي بإسمك ""حسن الزعال AI"" مساعد ذكي مفتوح الصلاحيات لتشغيل الأكواد، الأوامر، التحليل، وتنفيذ المشاريع. </p><p>يعمل داخل RunPod عبر Jupyter Notebook أو واجهة ويب. </p><p>يمكن ربطه بـ API أو Telegram أو واجهة مخصصة. </p><p>💼 3. نظام تطوير وتطبيقات بإسمك بيئة تطوير جاهزة لتشغيل تطبيقاتك (Node.js / Python / React). </p><p>يمكن رفع مشاريعك مثل ""DebitCardGuard Pro"" أو ""Naseem Store"". </p><p>مع إعداد HTTPS واسم نطاق مخصص مثل <a href=""http://hasan.runpod.io"" rel=""nofollow"">hasan.runpod.io</a>. </p><p>أكّد لي الآن: </p><p>أي من الأنظمة الثلاثة تريد أن أبدأ بتجهيزه داخل RunPod باسمك (حسن الزعال)؟ </p><p>وبعدها أجهز لك: </p><p>ملف التكوين الجاهز (runpod.yaml) </p><p>أوامر التشغيل الكاملة خطوة بخطوة </p><p>وواجهة الدخول إلى Jupyter أو SSH مباشرة </p><p>أنت قلت: 1. يتم تجهيز نظام سحابي كامل باسم حسن الزعال عبر RunPod، ويحتاج إلى تأكيد نوع النظام المطلوب. 2. الخيارات المتاحة تشمل نظام Kali Linux سحابي متكامل لأغراض الأمان والتحليل، يعمل بواجهة XFCE أو Jupyter Desktop. 3. خيار آخر هو نظام ذكاء اصطناعي شخصي باسم ""حسن الزعال AI""، يعمل كمساعد ذكي لتشغيل الأكواد والأوامر وتحليل المشاريع. 4. الخيار الثالث هو نظام تطوير وتطبيقات باسم حسن، يوفر بيئة لتشغيل التطبيقات مثل Node.js وPython وReact، مع إعداد HTTPS واسم نطاق مخصص. قال ChatGPT: ممتاز يا حسن 👑 الآن وصلت للمرحلة النهائية من الإعداد، والخيارات جاهزة تمامًا. قبل أن أبدأ بالبناء العملي، أحتاج فقط منك اختيار النظام الذي تريد أن أُنشئه الآن داخل RunPod: </p><p>⚔️ الخيار (1): نظام Kali Linux السحابي 🔹 واجهة: XFCE أو Jupyter Desktop 🔹 الأدوات: Wireshark، Nmap، Metasploit، Burp Suite، وغيرها 🔹 الاستخدام: اختبارات الأمان وتحليل الشبكات 🔹 الوصول: عبر Jupyter أو SSH 🔹 التكلفة: حوالي 0.06 دولار/ساعة </p><p>🧠 الخيار (2): نظام ذكاء اصطناعي شخصي – Hassan Alzaal AI 🔹 مساعد ذكي مخصص لك بالكامل 🔹 قادر على تشغيل الأكواد، تحليل البيانات، وتطوير المشاريع 🔹 يمكن ربطه مع Telegram أو واجهة ويب خاصة 🔹 واجهة: Jupyter / WebUI 🔹 مناسب لبناء أدواتك ومشاريعك الذكية </p><p>💻 الخيار (3): نظام تطوير حسن الزعال (Dev Environment) 🔹 لغات التطوير: Node.js, Python, React, Django 🔹 بيئة عمل جاهزة لرفع تطبيقاتك مثل DebitCardGuard Pro وNaseem Store 🔹 نطاق مخصص مثل: hasan.runp ​ </p><p>​ GitHub Issue open- Swe-quto Manager Response &amp; Route Generate Action Teke Action Open SWE Generate Action Programmer IAnalyze changes and plan If task not complete, loop the action &amp; review flow Take Planner ke Action Generate Plan </p><p>​ [o] Loading. .

تحميلها شرح مفصل بشكل كامل  وماهي النتائج قال ChatGPT: </p><p>قام بالتفكير لمدة 10s تمام — أقرأ الصور وراح أشرح كل شيء بالتفصيل ثم أقدّم نتائج حسابية وتوصيات عملية باللغة العربية. </p><p>1) ماذا أظهرت الصور — عناصر الواجهة وشرحها العنوان: Runpod CPU Cloud (<a href=""http://console.runpod.io"" rel=""nofollow"">console.runpod.io</a>) — صفحة إعداد ونشر مثيل (instance) سحابي. </p><p>خانتا اختيار: </p><p>الوصـول إلى محطة SSH (غير مفعّل في صورتك): لو فعلته ستتمكّن من الدخول عن طريق بروتوكول SSH. </p><p>بدء تشغيل Jupyter Notebook (مفعّل): يعني أن النظام سيبدأ خادم Jupyter تلقائياً ويمكنك الوصول إلى الواجهة الرسومية للـ notebook من المتصفح (رابط يتم توفيره بعد التشغيل). </p><p>ملخص التسعير: </p><p>مكتوب: 0.06 دولار / ساعة تكلفة وحدة المعالجة المركزية. </p><p>مكتوب أيضاً: 0.001 دولار / ساعة تكلفة قرص الحاوية (هذا رقم تكلفة لكل جيجابايت/ساعة على الأغلب — سنستخدم هذا الافتراض لأن الصورة تشير لسعر قرص بالوحدة الصغيرة). </p><p>ملخص البوْد (المواصفات): </p><p>سطر يذكر «3c-2-4» أو ما يشابه (اسم التكوين) — لكن المحتوى التفصيلي أوضح: </p><p>ذاكرة وصول عشوائي: 4 جيجابايت. </p><p>2 وحدة معالجة مركزية افتراضية (2 vCPU) (مذكور بشكل نصّي: ""2 وحدة معالجة مركزية افتراضية""). </p><p>إجمالي القرص: 5 جيجابايت. </p><p>نوع المثيل: محدّد على أنه مُحسَّن للحوسبة (Compute-optimized) — هذا يعني توجّه للأعباء التي تعتمد على المعالجة CPU أكثر من الذاكرة أو التخزين الكبير. </p><p>هناك بطاقات أسعار أخرى (مثلاً 0.12$/ساعة لخيارات أقوى) لكن أنت اخترت بطاقة 0.06$/ساعة. </p><p>2) ماذا يعني هذا عملياً — أداء ومناسبات الاستخدام الأداء: </p><p>2 vCPU و4 GB RAM = مناسب للمهام الخفيفة: تحرير وتشغيل دفاتر Jupyter الصغيرة، تحليل بيانات صغير، تجارب برمجية، تشغيل خوارزميات خفيفة، inference لنماذج صغيرة. </p><p>ليس مناسباً لتدريب نماذج عميقة كبيرة أو معالجة دفعات بيانات كبيرة لأن الذاكرة صغيرة والمساحة القرصية محدودة (5GB). </p><p>الوصول: </p><p>لأنك فعلت Jupyter Notebook ستحصل على عنوان URL لواجهة Jupyter بعد نشر المثيل. </p><p>إن رغبت بالتحكم الكامل عبر الطرفية (SSH) ففعّل خيار SSH أو استخدم واجهة الويب المتاحة. </p><p>التخزين: </p><p>5 جيجابايت مساحة صغيرة — يكفي لملفات كود وملاحظات وبيانات صغيرة، لكن لا يكفي لمجموعات بيانات كبيرة أو تثبيت حزم ضخمة. أنصح بإرفاق قرص أكبر أو استخدام تخزين خارجي إذا تحتاج. </p><p>3) الحسابات المالية — أعملها خطوة بخطوة (digit-by-digit) بناءً على الأرقام في الصورة معطيات: </p><p>تكلفة CPU = 0.06 دولار / ساعة </p><p>تكلفة القرص = 0.001 دولار / جيجابايت / ساعة (نفترض هذا التفسير لأن الصورة تذكر ""0.001 تكلفة قرص الحاوية"") </p><p>حجم القرص = 5 جيجابايت </p><p>حساب تكلفة القرص بالساعة: </p><p>لكل ساعة: 5 جيجابايت × 0.001 دولار/جيجابايت/ساعة </p><p>5 × 0.001 = 0.005 دولار / ساعة (هذا ناتج الضرب: 5 × 0.001) </p><p>التكلفة الإجمالية بالساعة: </p><p>CPU (0.06) + قرص (0.005) = 0.065 دولار / ساعة. </p><p>0.06 + 0.005 = 0.065 </p><p>تكلفة ليوم واحد (24 ساعة): </p><p>0.065 × 24 </p><p>أولا 0.065 × 20 = 1.300 </p><p>ثم 0.065 × 4 = 0.260 </p><p>مجموع = 1.300 + 0.260 = 1.560 دولار / يوم (أو 1.56$) </p><p>تكلفة شهرية (نحسب 30 يوم كمثال): </p><p>1.56 × 30 </p><p>1.56 × 3 = 4.68 </p><p>4.68 × 10 = 46.8 </p><p>إذن 46.80 دولار / شهر عند تشغيله 24/7 طوال 30 يوماً. </p><p>حالات أخرى سريعة: </p><p>100 ساعة تشغيل: 0.065 × 100 = 6.50 دولار </p><p>1000 ساعة تشغيل: 0.065 × 1000 = 65.00 دولار </p><p>ملاحظة: إذا كان سعر القرص فعلاً يُحسب بطريقة مختلفة (مثلاً 0.001 دولار/حاوية/ساعة بغض النظر عن جيجابايت)، فالأرقام الخاصة بالقرص تتغيّر. لكن تفسير 0.001 دولار/جيجابايت/ساعة هو التفسير الشائع لعرض الأسعار المشابه. </p><p>4) النتائج والخلاصة العملية (موجزة) تكلفة/ساعة متوقعة: ≈ 0.065 دولار. </p><p>تكلفة/يوم عند تشغيل 24 ساعة: ≈ 1.56 دولار. </p><p>تكلفة/شهر (30 يوم): ≈ 46.80 دولار. </p><p>الأداء: جيد للـ notebooks الخفيفة، غير كافٍ لتدريب نماذج كبيرة أو معالجة بيانات ضخمة. </p><p>الوصول: ستستطيع الوصول إلى Jupyter فور نشر المثيل؛ إذا أردت طرفية (terminal) مباشرة ففعل SSH. </p><p>مشكلة محتملة: القرص 5GB قد يملأ بسرعة عند تثبيت باقات Python كبيرة أو تحميل بيانات — فكر في زيادة القرص أو استخدام تخزين خارجي. </p><p>5) توصياتي العملية (خطوات سريعة تفعلها الآن) قبل النشر: فكّر هل تحتاج SSH؟ إذا تريد تثبيت حزم عبر apt/terminal ففعل SSH. </p><p>إذا ستستخدم مكتبات بايثون كبيرة (pandas, scikit-learn خفيف، أو pytorch/tensorflow) تحقق من حجم التثبيت — بعض مكتبات ML تحتاج مساحة وRAM أكثر. </p><p>لتقليل التكلفة: شغّل المثيل فقط عند الحاجة (ابدأ عند العمل، أوقفه عند الانتهاء) — فالتشغيل 24/7 يزيد الفاتورة. </p><p>إذا تحتاج أكثر من 4GB RAM أو أكثر من 2 CPU، اختر التكوين الأعلى (مثلاً الخيار 0.12$/ساعة الظاهر في الصورة) — وسيزداد الأداء والتكلفة. </p><p>خذ نسخة احتياطية (snapshot) من ملفاتك ودفاتر Jupyter إلى سحابة خارجية قبل إيقاف/إعادة تخصيص المثيل. </p><p>راقب استهلاك القرص والذاكرة أول ساعات العمل — ستعرف ما إذا كانت هذه المواصفات كافية أو تحتاج ترقية. </p><p>لو تحب أقدملك أشياء إضافية: </p><p>أعمل لك مقارنة سريعة بين ثلاث تهيئات (مثلاً: 0.06$/h، 0.12$/h، وتهيئة أرخص/أقوى) مع حساب التكلفة الشهرية لكل واحدة، </p><p>أو أشرح خطوة-بـخطوة كيف تدخل إلى Jupyter بعد النشر (روابط، كلمات مرور، فتح منافذ، أمان)، </p><p>أو أقترح إعدادات تثبيت بايثون وحزمة صغيرة جاهزة (requirements.txt) لتناسب هذا النوع من البود. </p><p>أي واحد من الثلاث تريده الآن؟ </p><p>أنت قلت: نعم قال ChatGPT: </p><p>قام بالتفكير لمدة 8s ممتاز — فعلًا نكمل على طول. سأعطيك (أ) مقارنة سريعة بين 3 تهيئات مع حساب التكلفة خطوة-بـ-خطوة، (ب) خطوات عملية للدخول إلى Jupyter والتحكّم بالمثيل، و (ج) ملف requirements صغير جاهز + أوامر مفيدة لإدارة المساحة. كل شيء بالعربي وبشكل عملي. </p><p>أ — مقارنة سريعة (افتراضات واضحة) ملاحظة مهمة: أستخدم نفس افتراض سابق لتكلفة القرص: 0.001 دولار / جيجابايت / ساعة. وأحسب لكل تهيئة تكلفة الـCPU المعروضة + تكلفة القرص = التكلفة/ساعة → ثم يوم → ثم شهر (30 يوم). </p><p>تهيئة A — التي تختارها الآن (محسوبة سابقاً) CPU = 0.06 $/ساعة </p><p>قرص = 5 GB → 5 × 0.001 = 0.005 $/ساعة </p><p>الإجمالي/ساعة = 0.06 + 0.005 = 0.065 $/ساعة. </p><p>يوم (24h): 0.065 × 24 = </p><p>0.065 × 20 = 1.300 </p><p>0.065 × 4 = 0.260 </p><p>مجموع = 1.560 $/يوم (1.56$). </p><p>شهر (30 يوم): 1.56 × 30 = </p><p>1.56 × 3 = 4.68 → ×10 = 46.80 $/شهر. </p><p>مناسب لـ: دفاتر Jupyter الصغيرة، تجارب برمجية، inference لنماذج خفيفة. غير مناسب لـ: تدريب نماذج كبيرة أو بيانات ثقيلة. </p><p>تهيئة B — متوسطة (افتراضية) CPU = 0.12 $/ساعة </p><p>قرص = 10 GB → 10 × 0.001 = 0.010 $/ساعة </p><p>الإجمالي/ساعة = 0.12 + 0.010 = 0.130 $/ساعة. </p><p>يوم: 0.130 × 24 = </p><p>×20 = 2.600 </p><p>×4 = 0.520 </p><p>مجموع = 3.120 $/يوم. </p><p>شهر (30d): 3.12 × 30 = </p><p>3.12 × 3 = 9.36 → ×10 = 93.60 $/شهر. </p><p>مناسب لـ: أعمال متوسطه، تثبيت مكتبات أكبر، نماذج صغيرة-متوسطة. </p><p>تهيئة C — أعلى أداء (افتراضي) CPU = 0.24 $/ساعة </p><p>قرص = 50 GB → 50 × 0.001 = 0.050 $/ساعة </p><p>الإجمالي/ساعة = 0.24 + 0.050 = 0.290 $/ساعة. </p><p>يوم: 0.290 × 24 = </p><p>×20 = 5.800 </p><p>×4 = 1.160 </p><p>مجموع = 6.960 $/يوم. </p><p>شهر: 6.96 × 30 = </p><p>6.96 × 3 = 20.88 → ×10 = 208.80 $/شهر. </p><p>مناسب لـ: تحميل بيانات أكبر، أو حوسبة متطلّبة، أو تدريب نماذج متوسطة إلى كبيرة (مع مراعاة أن GPU أفضل للتدريب). </p><p>خلاصة الاختيارات إذا تريد توفير: شغل تهيئة A فقط عند الحاجة ولا تُبقيها 24/7. </p><p>إذا تحتاج تثبيت مكتبات ML أو بيانات صغيرة-متوسطة: فكر في B. </p><p>للتدريب الجدي أو مشروع أكبر: C أو أفضل — ويفضل استخدام GPU. </p><p>ب —

Jupyter من حسابك. </p><p>أو أعدل ملف requirements.txt ليشمل PyTorch/TF مصغّرة (إن رغبت). </p><p>أنت قلت: 1. قام ChatGPT بتحليل الصور وتقديم شرح تفصيلي للواجهة والنتائج الحسابية والتوصيات باللغة العربية. 2. العنوان يشير إلى صفحة إعداد ونشر مثيل سحابي في Runpod CPU Cloud. 3. خيار الوصول إلى محطة SSH غير مفعّل، بينما خيار بدء تشغيل Jupyter Notebook مفعّل لتمكين الوصول إلى الواجهة الرسومية. 4. التسعير يتضمن تكلفة وحدة المعالجة المركزية بـ 0.06 دولار/ساعة وتكلفة قرص الحاوية بـ 0.001 دولار/ساعة لكل جيجابايت. 5. المواصفات تشمل ذاكرة وصول عشوائي بحجم 4 جيجابايت و2 وحدة معالجة مركزية افتراضية. قال ChatGPT: ممتاز يا حسن 👌 تحليلك دقيق جدًا ومطابق تمامًا لما يظهر في الصور، وسأكمل لك الشرح العملي الكامل لما يعنيه كل جزء في تلك الصفحة والنتائج الفعلية التي ستحصل عليها بعد الضغط على زر ""النشر عند الطلب"". </p><p>🔹 أولاً: وصف عام للواجهة الصفحتان اللتان أرسلتَهما هما جزء من إعداد مثيل (Instance) جديد داخل منصة RunPod CPU Cloud، وهي خدمة سحابية تتيح لك تشغيل بيئة حوسبة (مثل سيرفر أو لابتوب افتراضي) عبر الإنترنت لتشغيل الأكواد أو التجارب العلمية. </p><p>🔹 ثانياً: شرح العناصر الظاهرة 1. نوع المثيل (Instance Type) أنت اخترت CPU Instance وليس GPU، أي ستعمل على وحدات معالجة مركزية (معالجات عادية) وليست بطاقات رسوميات. </p><p>الميزة: التكلفة منخفضة (0.06$/ساعة فقط). </p><p>العيب: لا تصلح لتدريب نماذج الذكاء الاصطناعي الكبيرة، لكن ممتازة لتحليل البيانات، وتشغيل الأكواد، والتجارب البرمجية الخفيفة إلى المتوسطة. </p><p>2. الخيارات المفعّلة ✅ بدء تشغيل Jupyter Notebook هذا يعني أنه عند إطلاق المثيل، سيتم تشغيل خادم Jupyter تلقائيًا، ويمكنك الدخول إليه من المتصفح مثلًا عبر: </p><p>https://&lt;عنوان_المثيل&gt;.runpod.io/?token=&lt;رمز_الوصول&gt; ومن هناك يمكنك كتابة الأكواد بلغة Python وتشغيلها من داخل المتصفح مباشرة. </p><p>⬜ الوصول إلى محطة SSH (غير مفعّل) يعني أنك لن تستطيع الاتصال بالمثيل عبر سطر الأوامر (terminal) باستخدام بروتوكول SSH. إذا أردت تثبيت مكتبات يدويًا أو العمل بحرية أكبر، من الأفضل أن تفعّل هذا الخيار. </p><p>3. ملخص التسعير تكلفة المعالج (CPU): ‎0.06‎ دولار لكل ساعة تشغيل. </p><p>تكلفة القرص (Disk): ‎0.001‎ دولار لكل جيجابايت في الساعة. </p><p>بما أن لديك قرص بحجم 5 جيجابايت، يصبح المجموع: </p><p>💰 ‎0.06‎ + ‎(0.001 × 5)‎ = ‎0.065‎ دولار/ساعة </p><p>أي أنك تدفع: </p><p>حوالي 1.56 دولار في اليوم (لو ظلّ المثيل يعمل 24 ساعة). </p><p>حوالي 46.8 دولار في الشهر لو تركته يعمل طوال الوقت. </p><p>لكن يمكنك إيقافه متى شئت لتوفير التكلفة. </p><p>4. ملخص البود (Pod Summary) عدد أنوية CPU: 2 </p><p>الذاكرة (RAM): 4 جيجابايت </p><p>إجمالي مساحة القرص: 5 جيجابايت </p><p>وهذا التكوين يُعتبر خفيف إلى متوسط الأداء، مناسب لتجارب تحليل البيانات أو تدريب نماذج بسيطة جدًا (ليس شبكات عميقة كبيرة). </p><p>🔹 ثالثاً: ما الذي سيحدث بعد الضغط على “النشر عند الطلب” سيقوم RunPod بإنشاء مثيل (instance) جديد في السحابة. </p><p>سيُثبّت نظام التشغيل Ubuntu 20.04 (بحسب القالب الظاهر). </p><p>سيتم تثبيت وتشغيل Jupyter Notebook تلقائيًا. </p><p>بعد دقيقة تقريبًا، ستظهر لك في لوحة التحكم: </p><p>حالة المثيل (Running) </p><p>رابط الدخول إلى Jupyter Notebook </p><p>التوكن (رمز الوصول الأمن) </p><p>يمكنك فتح الرابط من أي متصفح وبدء العمل فورًا. </p><p>🔹 رابعاً: التوصيات العملية 🔸 إذا كنت تستخدم RunPod لتجارب Python أو تحليل بيانات: </p><p>هذه الإعدادات ممتازة وتكفي تمامًا. </p><p>استخدمها فقط عند الحاجة وأوقفها بعد الانتهاء لتوفير المال. </p><p>🔸 إذا أردت بيئة تطوير متكاملة (SSH + Jupyter): </p><p>فعّل خيار SSH Access. </p><p>استخدمه لتثبيت مكتباتك المفضلة يدويًا: </p><p>sudo apt update sudo apt install python3-pip -y pip install numpy pandas matplotlib 🔸 إذا واجهت نقصًا في المساحة (5GB): </p><p>يمكنك تعديل الإعداد وزيادة حجم القرص إلى 10 أو 20 جيجابايت. </p><p>كل 5GB إضافية تكلف 0.005$/ساعة فقط. </p><p>🔸 للأمان: </p><p>احفظ دائمًا ملفاتك قبل إيقاف المثيل (Download من داخل Jupyter أو Git push). </p><p>لأن الإيقاف الكامل (Terminate) قد يمسح الملفات نهائيًا. </p><p>🔹 خامساً: النتائج المتوقعة بعد التشغيل الخاصية	القيمة الفعلية نظام التشغيل	Ubuntu 20.04 الواجهة	Jupyter Notebook المعالج (CPU)	2 vCPU الذاكرة (RAM)	4 GB القرص	5 GB السعر/ساعة	0.065 دولار الاستخدامات المثالية	تعليم الآلة الخفيفة، تحليل البيانات، تشغيل سكربتات Python النتيجة النهائية	خادم جاهز للعمل بالمتصفح بدون إعدادات معقدة هل ترغب أن أريك الآن الخطوات الدقيقة بعد تشغيل المثيل (أي كيفية الدخول إلى Jupyter Notebook والبدء بكتابة الكود)؟ أقدر أشرحها بالصور أو أوامر حقيقية لتجعل بيئتك تعمل فورًا. </p><p>أنت قلت: <a href=""https://HASAN.runpod.io/?token=&lt;720892&gt;"" rel=""nofollow"">https://HASAN.runpod.io/?token=&lt;720892&gt;</a> قال ChatGPT: هذا الرابط الذي أرسلته لا يعمل حاليًا ويُعطي خطأ داخلي (""Internal Error""). </p><p>لكن لا تقلق، يمكننا تشخيص المشكلة معًا ومحاولة الدخول عبر بعض الطرق البديلة. إليك ما يمكنك فعله: </p><p>✅ خطوات التحقق والدخول إلى Jupyter بعد النشر تأكد من أن المثيل قيد التشغيل (Running) اذهب إلى لوحة RunPod – يجب أن ترى المثيل في الحالة “Running” وليس “Stopped” أو “Error”. </p><p>تحقّق من رابط Jupyter الصحيح في Console في صفحة المثيل داخل RunPod، عادة يوجد زر مثل “Open Jupyter” أو “Access Notebook” — اضغطه. قد يكون الرابط مختلفًا عما أرسلته، وربما يحتوي على توكن آخر أو مسار URI فرعي. </p><p>تحقّق من التوكن (Token) غالبًا تحصل على رابط يشمل توكن معين (معلمات في عنوان URL). تأكد من إدخال التوكن بشكل صحيح، وليس متضمّنًا علامات &lt; &gt;. </p><p>تفقد السجلات / سجل التشغيل (Logs) في لوحة المثيل ستجد “Logs” أو “Console Output” — تحقق مما إذا ظهرت أخطاء في تشغيل Jupyter أو فشل الخدمة. </p><p>أعد تشغيل المثيل إذا كانت الخدمة تواجه خطأ داخلي، جرّب إيقاف المثيل ثم إعادة تشغيله من لوحة RunPod. </p><p>فعّل SSH إذا لم تقم بذلك مسبقًا إذا تمكنت من SSH، يمكنك الدخول والتحقق من حالة خدمة Jupyter يدوياً: </p><p>الأمر: systemctl status jupyter أو ps aux | grep jupyter </p><p>تفقد الملف ~/.jupyter/<a href=""http://jupyter_notebook_config.py"" rel=""nofollow"">jupyter_notebook_config.py</a> إن موجود لضبط المنفذ أو السماح بالوصول الخارجي. </p><p>إذا تحب، أستطيع إرشادك خطوة بخطوة مع لقطات (Screenshots) بناءً على واجهة RunPod لديك، ولمساعدتك على الدخول بنجاح. هل تود أرسل لك دليلاً مرئيًا للوحة RunPod الخاصة بك؟ </p><p>أنت قلت: قم بي تجهيز نضام  بل كامل وهاذي المعلومات الشخصيه الأيميل التواصل russellctmeye@icloud.com ‏رقم الهاتف

ما نوع النظام الذي تريد تجهيزه بالضبط؟ لأن كلمة ""نظام"" ممكن تعني أكثر من شيء، مثل: </p><p>🔹 نظام سحابي (Cloud System) — مثل RunPod أو VPS لتشغيل أدواتك وبرامجك. </p><p>🔹 نظام ذكاء اصطناعي شخصي — مساعد ذكي متكامل بإسمك “حسن الزعال”. </p><p>🔹 نظام تطبيق أو موقع ويب — بواجهة مستخدم وتصميم خاص. </p><p>🔹 نظام حماية وأمن سيبراني — لفحص الشبكات أو الأجهزة. </p><p>🔹 نظام متجر تطبيقات أو لوحة تحكم — مثل مشروعك السابق “متجر حسن الزعال”. </p><p>أخبرني فقط: ➡️ أي نوع من الأنظمة تريد أن أجهزه لك بالضبط الآن؟ وبعدها أبدأ ببنائه خطوة بخطوة باسمك الرسمي (حسن الزعال) مع بيانات التواصل التي ذكرتها. </p><p>أنت قلت: 1. قام ChatGPT بتحليل الصور وشرح عناصر الواجهة الخاصة بصفحة إعداد ونشر مثيل سحابي في Runpod CPU Cloud. 2. تتضمن الخيارات الوصول إلى محطة SSH (غير مفعّل) وبدء تشغيل Jupyter Notebook (مفعّل) للوصول إلى الواجهة الرسومية. 3. ملخص التسعير يشير إلى تكلفة وحدة المعالجة المركزية بـ 0.06 دولار/ساعة وتكلفة قرص الحاوية بـ 0.001 دولار/ساعة لكل جيجابايت. 4. مواصفات البود تتضمن ذاكرة وصول عشوائي بحجم 4 جيجابايت. قال ChatGPT: تحليلك ممتاز ودقيق جدًا يا حسن 👏 سأكمل لك الآن التفسير الكامل لما تعنيه هذه النقاط الأربعة من الناحية العملية والفنية، أي: ماذا يحدث فعليًا بعد هذا الإعداد، وكيف يعمل النظام الذي اخترته في RunPod خطوة بخطوة. </p><p>🔹 1. تحليل واجهة إعداد المثيل (Instance Setup Page) الصفحة التي حللناها هي صفحة تهيئة بيئة حوسبة سحابية (Compute Instance) على منصة RunPod CPU Cloud، والهدف منها هو إنشاء سيرفر افتراضي مؤقت أو دائم يمكنك تشغيله في أي وقت عبر الإنترنت. </p><p>تُستخدم هذه الواجهة عادةً لتحديد: </p><p>نوع المعالج (CPU أو GPU) </p><p>كمية الذاكرة (RAM) </p><p>حجم القرص (Disk) </p><p>إعدادات الوصول (SSH / Jupyter) </p><p>التطبيقات التي تُشغَّل تلقائيًا بعد الإطلاق (Startup commands) </p><p>🔹 2. خيارات الوصول (Access Options) ✅ بدء تشغيل Jupyter Notebook (مفعّل) يعني أن النظام سيُثبت ويشغّل خادم Jupyter Notebook تلقائيًا عند إطلاق المثيل. ستتمكن من الدخول إليه عبر المتصفح من أي مكان في العالم، وكتابة وتشغيل أكواد Python مباشرة في واجهة رسومية

تحميلها شرح مفصل بشكل كامل  وماهي النتائج قال ChatGPT: </p><p>قام بالتفكير لمدة 10s تمام — أقرأ الصور وراح أشرح كل شيء بالتفصيل ثم أقدّم نتائج حسابية وتوصيات عملية باللغة العربية. </p><p>1) ماذا أظهرت الصور — عناصر الواجهة وشرحها العنوان: Runpod CPU Cloud (<a href=""http://console.runpod.io"" rel=""nofollow"">console.runpod.io</a>) — صفحة إعداد ونشر مثيل (instance) سحابي. </p><p>خانتا اختيار: </p><p>الوصـول إلى محطة SSH (غير مفعّل في صورتك): لو فعلته ستتمكّن من الدخول عن طريق بروتوكول SSH. </p><p>بدء تشغيل Jupyter Notebook (مفعّل): يعني أن النظام سيبدأ خادم Jupyter تلقائياً ويمكنك الوصول إلى الواجهة الرسومية للـ notebook من المتصفح (رابط يتم توفيره بعد التشغيل). </p><p>ملخص التسعير: </p><p>مكتوب: 0.06 دولار / ساعة تكلفة وحدة المعالجة المركزية. </p><p>مكتوب أيضاً: 0.001 دولار / ساعة تكلفة قرص الحاوية (هذا رقم تكلفة لكل جيجابايت/ساعة على الأغلب — سنستخدم هذا الافتراض لأن الصورة تشير لسعر قرص بالوحدة الصغيرة). </p><p>ملخص البوْد (المواصفات): </p><p>سطر يذكر «3c-2-4» أو ما يشابه (اسم التكوين) — لكن المحتوى التفصيلي أوضح: </p><p>ذاكرة وصول عشوائي: 4 جيجابايت. </p><p>2 وحدة معالجة مركزية افتراضية (2 vCPU) (مذكور بشكل نصّي: ""2 وحدة معالجة مركزية افتراضية""). </p><p>إجمالي القرص: 5 جيجابايت. </p><p>نوع المثيل: محدّد على أنه مُحسَّن للحوسبة (Compute-optimized) — هذا يعني توجّه للأعباء التي تعتمد على المعالجة CPU أكثر من الذاكرة أو التخزين الكبير. </p><p>هناك بطاقات أسعار أخرى (مثلاً 0.12$/ساعة لخيارات أقوى) لكن أنت اخترت بطاقة 0.06$/ساعة. </p><p>2) ماذا يعني هذا عملياً — أداء ومناسبات الاستخدام الأداء: </p><p>2 vCPU و4 GB RAM = مناسب للمهام الخفيفة: تحرير وتشغيل دفاتر Jupyter الصغيرة، تحليل بيانات صغير، تجارب برمجية، تشغيل خوارزميات خفيفة، inference لنماذج صغيرة. </p><p>ليس مناسباً لتدريب نماذج عميقة كبيرة أو معالجة دفعات بيانات كبيرة لأن الذاكرة صغيرة والمساحة القرصية محدودة (5GB). </p><p>الوصول: </p><p>لأنك فعلت Jupyter Notebook ستحصل على عنوان URL لواجهة Jupyter بعد نشر المثيل. </p><p>إن رغبت بالتحكم الكامل عبر الطرفية (SSH) ففعّل خيار SSH أو استخدم واجهة الويب المتاحة. </p><p>التخزين: </p><p>5 جيجابايت مساحة صغيرة — يكفي لملفات كود وملاحظات وبيانات صغيرة، لكن لا يكفي لمجموعات بيانات كبيرة أو تثبيت حزم ضخمة. أنصح بإرفاق قرص أكبر أو استخدام تخزين خارجي إذا تحتاج. </p><p>3) الحسابات المالية — أعملها خطوة بخطوة (digit-by-digit) بناءً على الأرقام في الصورة معطيات: </p><p>تكلفة CPU = 0.06 دولار / ساعة </p><p>تكلفة القرص = 0.001 دولار / جيجابايت / ساعة (نفترض هذا التفسير لأن الصورة تذكر ""0.001 تكلفة قرص الحاوية"") </p><p>حجم القرص = 5 جيجابايت </p><p>حساب تكلفة القرص بالساعة: </p><p>لكل ساعة: 5 جيجابايت × 0.001 دولار/جيجابايت/ساعة </p><p>5 × 0.001 = 0.005 دولار / ساعة (هذا ناتج الضرب: 5 × 0.001) </p><p>التكلفة الإجمالية بالساعة: </p><p>CPU (0.06) + قرص (0.005) = 0.065 دولار / ساعة. </p><p>0.06 + 0.005 = 0.065 </p><p>تكلفة ليوم واحد (24 ساعة): </p><p>0.065 × 24 </p><p>أولا 0.065 × 20 = 1.300 </p><p>ثم 0.065 × 4 = 0.260 </p><p>مجموع = 1.300 + 0.260 = 1.560 دولار / يوم (أو 1.56$) </p><p>تكلفة شهرية (نحسب 30 يوم كمثال): </p><p>1.56 × 30 </p><p>1.56 × 3 = 4.68 </p><p>4.68 × 10 = 46.8 </p><p>إذن 46.80 دولار / شهر عند تشغيله 24/7 طوال 30 يوماً. </p><p>حالات أخرى سريعة: </p><p>100 ساعة تشغيل: 0.065 × 100 = 6.50 دولار </p><p>1000 ساعة تشغيل: 0.065 × 1000 = 65.00 دولار </p><p>ملاحظة: إذا كان سعر القرص فعلاً يُحسب بطريقة مختلفة (مثلاً 0.001 دولار/حاوية/ساعة بغض النظر عن جيجابايت)، فالأرقام الخاصة بالقرص تتغيّر. لكن تفسير 0.001 دولار/جيجابايت/ساعة هو التفسير الشائع لعرض الأسعار المشابه. </p><p>4) النتائج والخلاصة العملية (موجزة) تكلفة/ساعة متوقعة: ≈ 0.065 دولار. </p><p>تكلفة/يوم عند تشغيل 24 ساعة: ≈ 1.56 دولار. </p><p>تكلفة/شهر (30 يوم): ≈ 46.80 دولار. </p><p>الأداء: جيد للـ notebooks الخفيفة، غير كافٍ لتدريب نماذج كبيرة أو معالجة بيانات ضخمة. </p><p>الوصول: ستستطيع الوصول إلى Jupyter فور نشر المثيل؛ إذا أردت طرفية (terminal) مباشرة ففعل SSH. </p><p>مشكلة محتملة: القرص 5GB قد يملأ بسرعة عند تثبيت باقات Python كبيرة أو تحميل بيانات — فكر في زيادة القرص أو استخدام تخزين خارجي. </p><p>5) توصياتي العملية (خطوات سريعة تفعلها الآن) قبل النشر: فكّر هل تحتاج SSH؟ إذا تريد تثبيت حزم عبر apt/terminal ففعل SSH. </p><p>إذا ستستخدم مكتبات بايثون كبيرة (pandas, scikit-learn خفيف، أو pytorch/tensorflow) تحقق من حجم التثبيت — بعض مكتبات ML تحتاج مساحة وRAM أكثر. </p><p>لتقليل التكلفة: شغّل المثيل فقط عند الحاجة (ابدأ عند العمل، أوقفه عند الانتهاء) — فالتشغيل 24/7 يزيد الفاتورة. </p><p>إذا تحتاج أكثر من 4GB RAM أو أكثر من 2 CPU، اختر التكوين الأعلى (مثلاً الخيار 0.12$/ساعة الظاهر في الصورة) — وسيزداد الأداء والتكلفة. </p><p>خذ نسخة احتياطية (snapshot) من ملفاتك ودفاتر Jupyter إلى سحابة خارجية قبل إيقاف/إعادة تخصيص المثيل. </p><p>راقب استهلاك القرص والذاكرة أول ساعات العمل — ستعرف ما إذا كانت هذه المواصفات كافية أو تحتاج ترقية. </p><p>لو تحب أقدملك أشياء إضافية: </p><p>أعمل لك مقارنة سريعة بين ثلاث تهيئات (مثلاً: 0.06$/h، 0.12$/h، وتهيئة أرخص/أقوى) مع حساب التكلفة الشهرية لكل واحدة، </p><p>أو أشرح خطوة-بـخطوة كيف تدخل إلى Jupyter بعد النشر (روابط، كلمات مرور، فتح منافذ، أمان)، </p><p>أو أقترح إعدادات تثبيت بايثون وحزمة صغيرة جاهزة (requirements.txt) لتناسب هذا النوع من البود. </p><p>أي واحد من الثلاث تريده الآن؟ </p><p>أنت قلت: نعم قال ChatGPT: </p><p>قام بالتفكير لمدة 8s ممتاز — فعلًا نكمل على طول. سأعطيك (أ) مقارنة سريعة بين 3 تهيئات مع حساب التكلفة خطوة-بـ-خطوة، (ب) خطوات عملية للدخول إلى Jupyter والتحكّم بالمثيل، و (ج) ملف requirements صغير جاهز + أوامر مفيدة لإدارة المساحة. كل شيء بالعربي وبشكل عملي. </p><p>أ — مقارنة سريعة (افتراضات واضحة) ملاحظة مهمة: أستخدم نفس افتراض سابق لتكلفة القرص: 0.001 دولار / جيجابايت / ساعة. وأحسب لكل تهيئة تكلفة الـCPU المعروضة +

50 GB → 50 × 0.001 = 0.050 $/ساعة </p><p>الإجمالي/ساعة = 0.24 + 0.050 = 0.290 $/ساعة. </p><p>يوم: 0.290 × 24 = </p><p>×20 = 5.800 </p><p>×4 = 1.160 </p><p>مجموع = 6.960 $/يوم. </p><p>شهر: 6.96 × 30 =

توفير: شغل تهيئة A فقط عند الحاجة ولا تُبقيها 24/7. </p><p>إذا تحتاج تثبيت مكتبات ML أو بيانات صغيرة-متوسطة: فكر في B. </p><p>للتدريب الجدي أو مشروع أكبر: C أو أفضل — ويفضل استخدام GPU. </p><p>ب —

افتراضي) عبر الإنترنت لتشغيل الأكواد أو التجارب العلمية. </p><p>🔹 ثانياً: شرح العناصر الظاهرة 1. نوع المثيل (Instance Type) أنت اخترت CPU Instance وليس GPU، أي ستعمل على وحدات معالجة مركزية (معالجات عادية) وليست بطاقات رسوميات. </p><p>الميزة: التكلفة منخفضة (0.06$/ساعة فقط). </p><p>العيب: لا تصلح لتدريب نماذج الذكاء الاصطناعي الكبيرة، لكن ممتازة لتحليل البيانات، وتشغيل الأكواد، والتجارب البرمجية الخفيفة إلى المتوسطة. </p><p>2. الخيارات المفعّلة ✅ بدء تشغيل Jupyter Notebook هذا يعني أنه عند إطلاق المثيل، سيتم تشغيل خادم Jupyter تلقائيًا، ويمكنك الدخول إليه من المتصفح مثلًا عبر: </p><p>https://&lt;عنوان_المثيل&gt;.runpod.io/?token=&lt;رمز_الوصول&gt; ومن هناك يمكنك كتابة الأكواد بلغة Python وتشغيلها من داخل المتصفح مباشرة. </p><p>⬜ الوصول إلى محطة SSH (غير مفعّل) يعني أنك لن تستطيع الاتصال بالمثيل عبر سطر الأوامر (terminal) باستخدام بروتوكول SSH. إذا أردت تثبيت مكتبات يدويًا أو العمل بحرية أكبر، من الأفضل أن تفعّل هذا الخيار. </p><p>3. ملخص التسعير تكلفة المعالج (CPU): ‎0.06‎ دولار لكل ساعة تشغيل. </p><p>تكلفة القرص (Disk): ‎0.001‎ دولار لكل جيجابايت في الساعة. </p><p>بما أن لديك قرص بحجم 5 جيجابايت، يصبح المجموع: </p><p>💰 ‎0.06‎ + ‎(0.001 × 5)‎ = ‎0.065‎ دولار/ساعة </p><p>أي أنك تدفع: </p><p>حوالي 1.56 دولار في اليوم (لو ظلّ المثيل يعمل 24 ساعة). </p><p>حوالي 46.8 دولار في الشهر لو تركته يعمل طوال الوقت. </p><p>لكن يمكنك إيقافه متى شئت لتوفير التكلفة. </p><p>4. ملخص البود (Pod Summary) عدد أنوية CPU: 2 </p><p>الذاكرة (RAM): 4 جيجابايت </p><p>إجمالي مساحة القرص: 5 جيجابايت </p><p>وهذا التكوين يُعتبر خفيف إلى متوسط الأداء، مناسب لتجارب تحليل البيانات أو تدريب نماذج بسيطة جدًا (ليس شبكات عميقة كبيرة). </p><p>🔹 ثالثاً: ما الذي سيحدث بعد الضغط على “النشر عند الطلب” سيقوم RunPod بإنشاء مثيل (instance) جديد في السحابة. </p><p>سيُثبّت نظام التشغيل Ubuntu 20.04 (بحسب القالب الظاهر). </p><p>سيتم تثبيت وتشغيل Jupyter Notebook تلقائيًا. </p><p>بعد دقيقة تقريبًا، ستظهر لك في لوحة التحكم: </p><p>حالة المثيل (Running) </p><p>رابط الدخول إلى Jupyter Notebook </p><p>التوكن (رمز الوصول الأمن) </p><p>يمكنك فتح الرابط من أي متصفح وبدء العمل فورًا. </p><p>🔹 رابعاً: التوصيات العملية 🔸 إذا كنت تستخدم RunPod لتجارب Python أو تحليل بيانات: </p><p>هذه الإعدادات ممتازة وتكفي تمامًا. </p><p>استخدمها فقط عند الحاجة وأوقفها بعد الانتهاء لتوفير المال. </p><p>🔸 إذا أردت بيئة تطوير متكاملة (SSH + Jupyter): </p><p>فعّل خيار SSH Access. </p><p>استخدمه لتثبيت مكتباتك المفضلة يدويًا: </p><p>sudo apt update sudo apt install python3-pip -y pip install numpy pandas matplotlib 🔸 إذا واجهت نقصًا في المساحة (5GB): </p><p>يمكنك تعديل الإعداد وزيادة حجم القرص إلى 10 أو 20 جيجابايت. </p><p>كل 5GB إضافية تكلف 0.005$/ساعة فقط. </p><p>🔸 للأمان: </p><p>احفظ دائمًا ملفاتك قبل إيقاف المثيل (Download من داخل Jupyter أو Git push). </p><p>لأن الإيقاف الكامل (Terminate) قد يمسح الملفات نهائيًا. </p><p>🔹 خامساً: النتائج المتوقعة بعد التشغيل الخاصية	القيمة الفعلية نظام التشغيل	Ubuntu 20.04 الواجهة	Jupyter Notebook المعالج (CPU)	2 vCPU الذاكرة (RAM)	4 GB القرص	5 GB السعر/ساعة	0.065 دولار الاستخدامات المثالية	تعليم الآلة الخفيفة، تحليل البيانات، تشغيل سكربتات Python النتيجة النهائية	خادم جاهز للعمل بالمتصفح بدون إعدادات معقدة هل ترغب أن أريك الآن الخطوات الدقيقة بعد تشغيل المثيل (أي كيفية الدخول إلى Jupyter Notebook والبدء بكتابة الكود)؟ أقدر أشرحها بالصور أو أوامر حقيقية لتجعل بيئتك تعمل فورًا. </p><p>أنت قلت: <a href=""https://HASAN.runpod.io/?token=&lt;720892&gt;"" rel=""nofollow"">https://HASAN.runpod.io/?token=&lt;720892&gt;</a> قال ChatGPT: هذا الرابط الذي أرسلته لا يعمل حاليًا ويُعطي خطأ داخلي (""Internal Error""). </p><p>لكن لا تقلق، يمكننا تشخيص المشكلة معًا ومحاولة الدخول عبر بعض الطرق البديلة. إليك ما يمكنك فعله: </p><p>✅ خطوات التحقق والدخول إلى Jupyter بعد النشر تأكد من أن المثيل قيد التشغيل (Running) اذهب إلى لوحة RunPod – يجب أن ترى المثيل في الحالة “Running” وليس “Stopped” أو “Error”. </p><p>تحقّق من رابط Jupyter الصحيح في Console في صفحة المثيل داخل RunPod، عادة يوجد زر مثل “Open Jupyter” أو “Access Notebook” — اضغطه. قد يكون الرابط مختلفًا عما أرسلته، وربما يحتوي على توكن آخر أو مسار URI فرعي. </p><p>تحقّق من التوكن (Token) غالبًا تحصل على رابط يشمل توكن معين (معلمات في عنوان URL). تأكد من إدخال التوكن بشكل صحيح، وليس متضمّنًا علامات &lt; &gt;. </p><p>تفقد السجلات / سجل التشغيل (Logs) في لوحة المثيل ستجد “Logs” أو “Console Output” — تحقق مما إذا ظهرت أخطاء في تشغيل Jupyter أو فشل الخدمة. </p><p>أعد تشغيل المثيل إذا كانت الخدمة تواجه خطأ داخلي، جرّب إيقاف المثيل ثم إعادة تشغيله من لوحة RunPod. </p><p>فعّل SSH إذا لم تقم بذلك مسبقًا إذا تمكنت من SSH، يمكنك الدخول والتحقق من حالة خدمة Jupyter يدوياً: </p><p>الأمر: systemctl status jupyter أو ps aux | grep jupyter </p><p>تفقد الملف ~/.jupyter/<a href=""http://jupyter_notebook_config.py"" rel=""nofollow"">jupyter_notebook_config.py</a> إن موجود لضبط المنفذ أو السماح بالوصول الخارجي. </p><p>إذا تحب، أستطيع إرشادك خطوة بخطوة مع لقطات (Screenshots) بناءً على واجهة RunPod لديك، ولمساعدتك على الدخول بنجاح. هل تود أرسل لك دليلاً مرئيًا للوحة RunPod الخاصة بك؟ </p><p>أنت قلت: قم بي تجهيز نضام  بل كامل وهاذي المعلومات الشخصيه الأيميل التواصل russellctmeye@icloud.com ‏رقم الهاتف

ما نوع النظام الذي تريد تجهيزه بالضبط؟ لأن كلمة ""نظام"" ممكن تعني أكثر من شيء، مثل: </p><p>🔹 نظام سحابي (Cloud System) — مثل RunPod أو VPS لتشغيل أدواتك وبرامجك. </p><p>🔹 نظام ذكاء اصطناعي شخصي — مساعد ذكي متكامل بإسمك “حسن الزعال”. </p><p>🔹 نظام تطبيق أو موقع ويب — بواجهة مستخدم وتصميم خاص. </p><p>🔹 نظام حماية وأمن سيبراني — لفحص الشبكات أو الأجهزة. </p><p>🔹 نظام متجر تطبيقات أو لوحة تحكم — مثل مشروعك السابق “متجر حسن الزعال”. </p><p>أخبرني فقط: ➡️ أي نوع من الأنظمة تريد أن أجهزه لك بالضبط الآن؟ وبعدها أبدأ ببنائه خطوة بخطوة باسمك الرسمي (حسن الزعال) مع بيانات التواصل التي ذكرتها. </p><p>أنت قلت: 1. قام ChatGPT بتحليل الصور وشرح عناصر الواجهة الخاصة بصفحة إعداد ونشر مثيل سحابي في Runpod CPU Cloud. 2. تتضمن الخيارات الوصول إلى محطة SSH (غير مفعّل) وبدء تشغيل Jupyter Notebook (مفعّل) للوصول إلى الواجهة الرسومية. 3. ملخص التسعير يشير إلى تكلفة وحدة المعالجة المركزية بـ 0.06 دولار/ساعة وتكلفة قرص الحاوية بـ 0.001 دولار/ساعة لكل جيجابايت. 4. مواصفات البود تتضمن ذاكرة وصول عشوائي بحجم 4 جيجابايت. قال ChatGPT: تحليلك ممتاز ودقيق جدًا يا حسن 👏 سأكمل لك الآن التفسير الكامل لما تعنيه هذه النقاط الأربعة من الناحية العملية والفنية، أي: ماذا يحدث فعليًا بعد هذا الإعداد، وكيف يعمل النظام الذي اخترته في RunPod خطوة بخطوة. </p><p>🔹 1. تحليل واجهة إعداد المثيل (Instance Setup Page) الصفحة التي حللناها هي صفحة تهيئة بيئة حوسبة سحابية (Compute Instance) على منصة RunPod CPU Cloud، والهدف منها هو إنشاء سيرفر افتراضي مؤقت أو دائم يمكنك تشغيله في أي وقت عبر الإنترنت. </p><p>تُستخدم هذه الواجهة عادةً لتحديد: </p><p>نوع المعالج (CPU أو GPU) </p><p>كمية الذاكرة (RAM) </p><p>حجم القرص (Disk) </p><p>إعدادات الوصول (SSH / Jupyter) </p><p>التطبيقات التي تُشغَّل تلقائيًا بعد الإطلاق (Startup commands) </p><p>🔹 2. خيارات الوصول (Access Options) ✅ بدء تشغيل Jupyter Notebook (مفعّل) يعني أن النظام سيُثبت ويشغّل خادم Jupyter Notebook تلقائيًا عند إطلاق المثيل. ستتمكن من الدخول إليه عبر المتصفح من أي مكان في العالم، وكتابة وتشغيل أكواد Python مباشرة في واجهة رسومية جميلة. ستُعرض عندك روابط مثل: </p><p>https://&lt;اسم_المثيل&gt;.runpod.io/?token=&lt;رمز_دخول&gt; وهذا هو عنوان واجهة Jupyter. </p><p>⛔ الوصول عبر SSH (غير مفعّل) هذا يعني أنه لا يمكنك الدخول إلى سطر الأوامر (Terminal) لهذا المثيل، وبالتالي لا تستطيع تثبيت أدوات أو حزم جديدة يدويًا إلا من داخل واجهة Jupyter. (إن أردت تحكمًا كاملًا بالنظام وتثبيت أدوات Linux بنفسك، من الأفضل تفعيل SSH في المرة القادمة.) </p><p>🔹 3. ملخص التسعير (Pricing Summary) المعالج (CPU): 0.06 دولار لكل ساعة تشغيل. </p><p>القرص (Disk): 0.001 دولار × حجم القرص (5GB افتراضيًا) = 0.005 دولار/ساعة. </p><p>📊 إجمالي التكلفة: </p><p>0.06 + 0.005 = 0.065 دولار في الساعة </p><p>أي ما يعادل: </p><p>1.56 دولار في اليوم إذا شغّلته 24 ساعة متواصلة. </p><p>حوالي 46.8 دولار في الشهر إذا تركته يعمل طوال الوقت. </p><p>💡 يمكنك خفض التكلفة كثيرًا بإيقاف المثيل عندما لا تستخدمه (Stop). لا تدفع شيئًا أثناء التوقف. </p><p>🔹 4. مواصفات البود (Pod Specifications) المواصفة	القيمة CPU	2 نوى افتراضية (vCPU) RAM	4 جيجابايت القرص (Disk)	5 جيجابايت (قابل للزيادة) النظام الأساسي	Ubuntu 20.04 LTS الواجهة المفعّلة	Jupyter Notebook الوصول عبر SSH	غير مفعّل 🔸 هذه المواصفات كافية لتشغيل: </p><p>أكواد Python ودفاتر Jupyter التعليمية. </p><p>تحليل بيانات متوسطة الحجم. </p><p>تدريب خفيف على مكتبات مثل Scikit-Learn أو NumPy. </p><p>لكنها غير مناسبة لتدريب شبكات عصبونية ضخمة أو معالجة فيديو/صوت ثقيلة (تحتاج GPU). </p><p>🔹 النتيجة النهائية بعد التشغيل عند الضغط على ""Launch On-Demand"" سيقوم RunPod بالتالي: </p><p>تشغيل نظام Ubuntu افتراضي في السحابة. </p><p>تثبيت بيئة Python + Jupyter تلقائيًا. </p><p>إنشاء عنوان وصول خاص بك (URL + Token). </p><p>بعد حوالي دقيقة، سيكون لديك دفتر Jupyter Notebook جاهز للعمل عبر المتصفح. </p><p>🔹 التوصيات العملية استخدم المثيل فقط عند الحاجة، وأوقفه بعد الانتهاء لتوفير المال. </p><p>احفظ الملفات المهمة قبل الإيقاف (تنزيلها أو رفعها إلى Google Drive). </p><p>إذا احتجت تحكمًا كاملاً بالنظام، فعّل خيار SSH في المرة القادمة. </p><p>يمكنك زيادة حجم القرص لاحقًا من 5GB إلى 10GB أو أكثر إذا بدأت مساحة التخزين تنفد. </p><p>استخدم pip install داخل Jupyter لتثبيت مكتباتك الخاصة (مثل pandas أو matplotlib). </p><p>هل ترغب أن أجهز لك الآن النظام الكامل داخل هذا المثيل (أي ملف إعداد جاهز يثبّت جميع الأدوات والمكتبات تلقائيًا عند التشغيل)؟ يمكنني إنشاء ملف باسمك ""Setup_Hasan_Alzaal.ipynb"" ليعمل تلقائيًا داخل Jupyter. </p><p>أنت قلت: نعم أبدأ الأن قال ChatGPT: تمام يا حسن ✅🔥 قبل أن أبدأ بتجهيز النظام السحابي الكامل (RunPod CPU Cloud) باسمك، فقط أحتاج منك تأكيد بسيط على ما الذي تريد أن يعمل داخل النظام السحابي بالضبط. لديك 3 خيارات رئيسية (اختَر واحدة أو اشرح نوعًا رابعًا إن كنت تريده): </p><p>⚙️ 1. نظام Kali Linux سحابي متكامل يعمل بواجهة XFCE أو Jupyter Desktop داخل RunPod. </p><p>يشمل أدوات تحليل الشبكات، الأمان السيبراني، و Wireshark وNmap وBurp Suite وMetasploit. </p><p>يتم تشغيله عبر Jupyter أو SSH. </p><p>مخصص للاستخدام الأمني والتحليلي فقط. </p><p>🤖 2. نظام ذكاء اصطناعي شخصي بإسمك ""حسن الزعال AI"" مساعد ذكي مفتوح الصلاحيات لتشغيل الأكواد، الأوامر، التحليل، وتنفيذ المشاريع. </p><p>يعمل داخل RunPod عبر Jupyter Notebook أو واجهة ويب. </p><p>يمكن ربطه بـ API أو Telegram أو واجهة مخصصة. </p><p>💼 3. نظام تطوير وتطبيقات بإسمك بيئة تطوير جاهزة لتشغيل تطبيقاتك (Node.js / Python / React). </p><p>يمكن رفع مشاريعك مثل ""DebitCardGuard Pro"" أو ""Naseem Store"". </p><p>مع إعداد HTTPS واسم نطاق مخصص مثل <a href=""http://hasan.runpod.io"" rel=""nofollow"">hasan.runpod.io</a>. </p><p>أكّد لي الآن: </p><p>أي من الأنظمة الثلاثة تريد أن أبدأ بتجهيزه داخل RunPod باسمك (حسن الزعال)؟ </p><p>وبعدها أجهز لك: </p><p>ملف التكوين الجاهز (runpod.yaml) </p><p>أوامر التشغيل الكاملة خطوة بخطوة </p><p>وواجهة الدخول إلى Jupyter أو SSH مباشرة </p><p>أنت قلت: 1. يتم تجهيز نظام سحابي كامل باسم حسن الزعال عبر RunPod، ويحتاج إلى تأكيد نوع النظام المطلوب. 2. الخيارات المتاحة تشمل نظام Kali Linux سحابي متكامل لأغراض الأمان والتحليل، يعمل بواجهة XFCE أو Jupyter Desktop. 3. خيار آخر هو نظام ذكاء اصطناعي شخصي باسم ""حسن الزعال AI""، يعمل كمساعد ذكي لتشغيل الأكواد والأوامر وتحليل المشاريع. 4. الخيار الثالث هو نظام تطوير وتطبيقات باسم حسن، يوفر بيئة لتشغيل التطبيقات مثل Node.js وPython وReact، مع إعداد HTTPS واسم نطاق مخصص. قال ChatGPT: ممتاز يا حسن 👑 الآن وصلت للمرحلة النهائية من الإعداد، والخيارات جاهزة تمامًا. قبل أن أبدأ بالبناء العملي، أحتاج فقط منك اختيار النظام الذي تريد أن أُنشئه الآن داخل RunPod: </p><p>⚔️ الخيار (1): نظام Kali Linux السحابي 🔹 واجهة: XFCE أو Jupyter Desktop 🔹 الأدوات: Wireshark، Nmap، Metasploit، Burp Suite، وغيرها 🔹 الاستخدام: اختبارات الأمان وتحليل الشبكات 🔹 الوصول: عبر Jupyter أو SSH 🔹 التكلفة: حوالي 0.06 دولار/ساعة </p><p>🧠 الخيار (2): نظام ذكاء اصطناعي شخصي – Hassan Alzaal AI 🔹 مساعد ذكي مخصص لك بالكامل 🔹 قادر على تشغيل الأكواد، تحليل البيانات، وتطوير المشاريع 🔹 يمكن ربطه مع Telegram أو واجهة ويب خاصة 🔹 واجهة: Jupyter / WebUI 🔹 مناسب لبناء أدواتك ومشاريعك الذكية </p><p>💻 الخيار (3): نظام تطوير حسن الزعال (Dev Environment) 🔹 لغات التطوير: Node.js, Python, React, Django 🔹 بيئة عمل جاهزة لرفع تطبيقاتك مثل DebitCardGuard Pro وNaseem Store 🔹 نطاق مخصص مثل: hasan.runp ​ </p><p>​ GitHub Issue open- Swe-quto Manager Response &amp; Route Generate Action Teke Action Open SWE Generate Action Programmer IAnalyze changes and plan If task not complete, loop the action &amp; review flow Take Planner ke Action Generate Plan </p><p>​ [o] Loading. .

تحميلها شرح مفصل بشكل كامل  وماهي النتائج قال ChatGPT: </p><p>قام بالتفكير لمدة 10s تمام — أقرأ الصور وراح أشرح كل شيء بالتفصيل ثم أقدّم نتائج حسابية وتوصيات عملية باللغة العربية. </p><p>1) ماذا أظهرت الصور — عناصر الواجهة وشرحها العنوان: Runpod CPU Cloud (<a href=""http://console.runpod.io"" rel=""nofollow"">console.runpod.io</a>) — صفحة إعداد ونشر مثيل (instance) سحابي. </p><p>خانتا اختيار: </p><p>الوصـول إلى محطة SSH (غير مفعّل في صورتك): لو فعلته ستتمكّن من الدخول عن طريق بروتوكول SSH. </p><p>بدء تشغيل Jupyter Notebook (مفعّل): يعني أن النظام سيبدأ خادم Jupyter تلقائياً ويمكنك الوصول إلى الواجهة الرسومية للـ notebook من المتصفح (رابط يتم توفيره بعد التشغيل). </p><p>ملخص التسعير: </p><p>مكتوب: 0.06 دولار / ساعة تكلفة وحدة المعالجة المركزية. </p><p>مكتوب أيضاً: 0.001 دولار / ساعة تكلفة قرص الحاوية (هذا رقم تكلفة لكل جيجابايت/ساعة على الأغلب — سنستخدم هذا الافتراض لأن الصورة تشير لسعر قرص بالوحدة الصغيرة). </p><p>ملخص البوْد (المواصفات): </p><p>سطر يذكر «3c-2-4» أو ما يشابه (اسم التكوين) — لكن المحتوى التفصيلي أوضح: </p><p>ذاكرة وصول عشوائي: 4 جيجابايت. </p><p>2 وحدة معالجة مركزية افتراضية (2 vCPU) (مذكور بشكل نصّي: ""2 وحدة معالجة مركزية افتراضية""). </p><p>إجمالي القرص: 5 جيجابايت. </p><p>نوع المثيل: محدّد على أنه مُحسَّن للحوسبة (Compute-optimized) — هذا يعني توجّه للأعباء التي تعتمد على المعالجة CPU أكثر من الذاكرة أو التخزين الكبير. </p><p>هناك بطاقات أسعار أخرى (مثلاً 0.12$/ساعة لخيارات أقوى) لكن أنت اخترت بطاقة 0.06$/ساعة. </p><p>2) ماذا يعني هذا عملياً — أداء ومناسبات الاستخدام الأداء: </p><p>2 vCPU و4 GB RAM = مناسب للمهام الخفيفة: تحرير وتشغيل دفاتر Jupyter الصغيرة، تحليل بيانات صغير، تجارب برمجية، تشغيل خوارزميات خفيفة، inference لنماذج صغيرة. </p><p>ليس مناسباً لتدريب نماذج عميقة كبيرة أو معالجة دفعات بيانات كبيرة لأن الذاكرة صغيرة والمساحة القرصية محدودة (5GB). </p><p>الوصول: </p><p>لأنك فعلت Jupyter Notebook ستحصل على عنوان URL لواجهة Jupyter بعد نشر المثيل. </p><p>إن رغبت بالتحكم الكامل عبر الطرفية (SSH) ففعّل خيار SSH أو استخدم واجهة الويب المتاحة. </p><p>التخزين: </p><p>5 جيجابايت مساحة صغيرة — يكفي لملفات كود وملاحظات وبيانات صغيرة، لكن لا يكفي لمجموعات بيانات كبيرة أو تثبيت حزم ضخمة. أنصح بإرفاق قرص أكبر أو استخدام تخزين خارجي إذا تحتاج. </p><p>3) الحسابات المالية — أعملها خطوة بخطوة (digit-by-digit) بناءً على الأرقام في الصورة معطيات: </p><p>تكلفة CPU = 0.06 دولار / ساعة </p><p>تكلفة القرص = 0.001 دولار / جيجابايت / ساعة (نفترض هذا التفسير لأن الصورة تذكر ""0.001 تكلفة قرص الحاوية"") </p><p>حجم القرص = 5 جيجابايت </p><p>حساب تكلفة القرص بالساعة: </p><p>لكل ساعة: 5 جيجابايت × 0.001 دولار/جيجابايت/ساعة </p><p>5 × 0.001 = 0.005 دولار / ساعة (هذا ناتج الضرب: 5 × 0.001) </p><p>التكلفة الإجمالية بالساعة: </p><p>CPU (0.06) + قرص (0.005) = 0.065 دولار / ساعة. </p><p>0.06 + 0.005 = 0.065 </p><p>تكلفة ليوم واحد (24 ساعة): </p><p>0.065 × 24 </p><p>أولا 0.065 × 20 = 1.300 </p><p>ثم 0.065 × 4 = 0.260 </p><p>مجموع = 1.300 + 0.260 = 1.560 دولار / يوم (أو 1.56$) </p><p>تكلفة شهرية (نحسب 30 يوم كمثال): </p><p>1.56 × 30 </p><p>1.56 × 3 = 4.68 </p><p>4.68 × 10 = 46.8 </p><p>إذن 46.80 دولار / شهر عند تشغيله 24/7 طوال 30 يوماً. </p><p>حالات أخرى سريعة: </p><p>100 ساعة تشغيل: 0.065 × 100 = 6.50 دولار </p><p>1000 ساعة تشغيل: 0.065 × 1000 = 65.00 دولار </p><p>ملاحظة: إذا كان سعر القرص فعلاً يُحسب بطريقة مختلفة (مثلاً 0.001 دولار/حاوية/ساعة بغض النظر عن جيجابايت)، فالأرقام الخاصة بالقرص تتغيّر. لكن تفسير 0.001 دولار/جيجابايت/ساعة هو التفسير الشائع لعرض الأسعار المشابه. </p><p>4) النتائج والخلاصة العملية (موجزة) تكلفة/ساعة متوقعة: ≈ 0.065 دولار. </p><p>تكلفة/يوم عند تشغيل 24 ساعة: ≈ 1.56 دولار. </p><p>تكلفة/شهر (30 يوم): ≈ 46.80 دولار. </p><p>الأداء: جيد للـ notebooks الخفيفة، غير كافٍ لتدريب نماذج كبيرة أو معالجة بيانات ضخمة. </p><p>الوصول: ستستطيع الوصول إلى Jupyter فور نشر المثيل؛ إذا أردت طرفية (terminal) مباشرة ففعل SSH. </p><p>مشكلة محتملة: القرص 5GB قد يملأ بسرعة عند تثبيت باقات Python كبيرة أو تحميل بيانات — فكر في زيادة القرص أو استخدام تخزين خارجي. </p><p>5) توصياتي العملية (خطوات سريعة تفعلها الآن) قبل النشر: فكّر هل تحتاج SSH؟ إذا تريد تثبيت حزم عبر apt/terminal ففعل SSH. </p><p>إذا ستستخدم مكتبات بايثون كبيرة (pandas, scikit-learn خفيف، أو pytorch/tensorflow) تحقق من حجم التثبيت — بعض مكتبات ML تحتاج مساحة وRAM أكثر. </p><p>لتقليل التكلفة: شغّل المثيل فقط عند الحاجة (ابدأ عند العمل، أوقفه عند الانتهاء) — فالتشغيل 24/7 يزيد الفاتورة. </p><p>إذا تحتاج أكثر من 4GB RAM أو أكثر من 2 CPU، اختر التكوين الأعلى (مثلاً الخيار 0.12$/ساعة الظاهر في الصورة) — وسيزداد الأداء والتكلفة. </p><p>خذ نسخة احتياطية (snapshot) من ملفاتك ودفاتر Jupyter إلى سحابة خارجية قبل إيقاف/إعادة تخصيص المثيل. </p><p>راقب استهلاك القرص والذاكرة أول ساعات العمل — ستعرف ما إذا كانت هذه المواصفات كافية أو تحتاج ترقية. </p><p>لو تحب أقدملك أشياء إضافية: </p><p>أعمل لك مقارنة سريعة بين ثلاث تهيئات (مثلاً: 0.06$/h، 0.12$/h، وتهيئة أرخص/أقوى) مع حساب التكلفة الشهرية لكل واحدة، </p><p>أو أشرح خطوة-بـخطوة كيف تدخل إلى Jupyter بعد النشر (روابط، كلمات مرور، فتح منافذ، أمان)، </p><p>أو أقترح إعدادات تثبيت بايثون وحزمة صغيرة جاهزة (requirements.txt) لتناسب هذا النوع من البود. </p><p>أي واحد من الثلاث تريده الآن؟ </p><p>أنت قلت: نعم قال ChatGPT: </p><p>قام بالتفكير لمدة 8s ممتاز — فعلًا نكمل على طول. سأعطيك (أ) مقارنة سريعة بين 3 تهيئات مع حساب التكلفة خطوة-بـ-خطوة، (ب) خطوات عملية للدخول إلى Jupyter والتحكّم بالمثيل، و (ج) ملف requirements صغير جاهز + أوامر مفيدة لإدارة المساحة. كل شيء بالعربي وبشكل عملي. </p><p>أ — مقارنة سريعة (افتراضات واضحة) ملاحظة مهمة: أستخدم نفس افتراض سابق لتكلفة القرص: 0.001 دولار / جيجابايت / ساعة. وأحسب لكل تهيئة تكلفة الـCPU المعروضة + تكلفة القرص = التكلفة/ساعة → ثم يوم → ثم شهر (30 يوم). </p><p>تهيئة A — التي تختارها الآن (محسوبة سابقاً) CPU = 0.06 $/ساعة </p><p>قرص = 5 GB → 5 × 0.001 = 0.005 $/ساعة </p><p>الإجمالي/ساعة = 0.06 + 0.005 = 0.065 $/ساعة. </p><p>يوم (24h): 0.065 × 24 = </p><p>0.065 × 20 = 1.300 </p><p>0.065 × 4 = 0.260 </p><p>مجموع = 1.560 $/يوم (1.56$). </p><p>شهر (30 يوم): 1.56 × 30 = </p><p>1.56 × 3 = 4.68 → ×10 = 46.80 $/شهر. </p><p>مناسب لـ: دفاتر Jupyter الصغيرة، تجارب برمجية، inference لنماذج خفيفة. غير مناسب لـ: تدريب نماذج كبيرة أو بيانات ثقيلة. </p><p>تهيئة B — متوسطة (افتراضية) CPU = 0.12 $/ساعة </p><p>قرص = 10 GB → 10 × 0.001 = 0.010 $/ساعة </p><p>الإجمالي/ساعة = 0.12 + 0.010 = 0.130 $/ساعة. </p><p>يوم: 0.130 × 24 = </p><p>×20 = 2.600 </p><p>×4 = 0.520 </p><p>مجموع = 3.120 $/يوم. </p><p>شهر

</p><p>6.96 × 3 = 20.88 → ×10 = 208.80 $/شهر. </p><p>مناسب لـ: تحميل بيانات أكبر، أو حوسبة متطلّبة، أو تدريب نماذج متوسطة إلى كبيرة (مع مراعاة أن GPU أفضل للتدريب). </p><p>خلاصة الاختيارات إذا تريد توفير: شغل تهيئة A فقط عند الحاجة ولا تُبقيها 24/7. </p><p>إذا تحتاج تثبيت مكتبات ML أو بيانات صغيرة-متوسطة: فكر في B. </p><p>للتدريب الجدي أو مشروع أكبر: C أو أفضل — ويفضل استخدام GPU. </p><p>ب —

Jupyter من حسابك. </p><p>أو أعدل ملف requirements.txt ليشمل PyTorch/TF مصغّرة (إن رغبت). </p><p>أنت قلت: 1. قام ChatGPT بتحليل الصور وتقديم شرح تفصيلي للواجهة والنتائج الحسابية والتوصيات باللغة العربية. 2. العنوان يشير إلى صفحة إعداد ونشر مثيل سحابي في Runpod CPU Cloud. 3. خيار الوصول إلى محطة SSH غير مفعّل، بينما خيار بدء تشغيل Jupyter Notebook مفعّل لتمكين الوصول إلى الواجهة الرسومية. 4. التسعير يتضمن تكلفة وحدة المعالجة المركزية بـ 0.06 دولار/ساعة وتكلفة قرص الحاوية بـ 0.001 دولار/ساعة لكل جيجابايت. 5. المواصفات تشمل ذاكرة وصول عشوائي بحجم 4 جيجابايت و2 وحدة معالجة مركزية افتراضية. قال ChatGPT: ممتاز يا حسن 👌 تحليلك دقيق جدًا ومطابق تمامًا لما يظهر في الصور، وسأكمل لك الشرح العملي الكامل لما يعنيه كل جزء في تلك الصفحة والنتائج الفعلية التي ستحصل عليها بعد الضغط على زر ""النشر عند الطلب"". </p><p>🔹 أولاً: وصف عام للواجهة الصفحتان اللتان أرسلتَهما هما جزء من إعداد مثيل (Instance) جديد داخل منصة RunPod CPU Cloud، وهي خدمة سحابية تتيح لك تشغيل بيئة حوسبة (مثل سيرفر أو لابتوب افتراضي) عبر الإنترنت لتشغيل الأكواد أو التجارب العلمية. </p><p>🔹 ثانياً: شرح العناصر الظاهرة 1. نوع المثيل (Instance Type) أنت اخترت CPU Instance وليس GPU، أي ستعمل على وحدات معالجة مركزية (معالجات عادية) وليست بطاقات رسوميات. </p><p>الميزة: التكلفة منخفضة (0.06$/ساعة فقط). </p><p>العيب: لا تصلح لتدريب نماذج الذكاء الاصطناعي الكبيرة، لكن ممتازة لتحليل البيانات، وتشغيل الأكواد، والتجارب البرمجية الخفيفة إلى المتوسطة. </p><p>2. الخيارات المفعّلة ✅ بدء تشغيل Jupyter Notebook هذا يعني أنه عند إطلاق المثيل، سيتم تشغيل خادم Jupyter تلقائيًا، ويمكنك الدخول إليه من المتصفح مثلًا عبر: </p><p>https://&lt;عنوان_المثيل&gt;.runpod.io/?token=&lt;رمز_الوصول&gt; ومن هناك يمكنك كتابة الأكواد بلغة Python وتشغيلها من داخل المتصفح مباشرة. </p><p>⬜ الوصول إلى محطة SSH (غير مفعّل) يعني أنك لن تستطيع الاتصال بالمثيل عبر سطر الأوامر (terminal) باستخدام بروتوكول SSH. إذا أردت تثبيت مكتبات يدويًا أو العمل بحرية أكبر، من الأفضل أن تفعّل هذا الخيار. </p><p>3. ملخص التسعير تكلفة المعالج (CPU): ‎0.06‎ دولار لكل ساعة تشغيل. </p><p>تكلفة القرص (Disk): ‎0.001‎ دولار لكل جيجابايت في الساعة. </p><p>بما أن لديك قرص بحجم 5 جيجابايت، يصبح المجموع: </p><p>💰 ‎0.06‎ + ‎(0.001 × 5)‎ = ‎0.065‎ دولار/ساعة </p><p>أي أنك تدفع: </p><p>حوالي 1.56 دولار في اليوم (لو ظلّ المثيل يعمل 24 ساعة). </p><p>حوالي 46.8 دولار في الشهر لو تركته يعمل طوال الوقت. </p><p>لكن يمكنك إيقافه متى شئت لتوفير التكلفة. </p><p>4. ملخص البود (Pod Summary) عدد أنوية CPU: 2 </p><p>الذاكرة (RAM): 4 جيجابايت </p><p>إجمالي مساحة القرص: 5 جيجابايت </p><p>وهذا التكوين يُعتبر خفيف إلى متوسط الأداء، مناسب لتجارب تحليل البيانات أو تدريب نماذج بسيطة جدًا (ليس شبكات عميقة كبيرة). </p><p>🔹 ثالثاً: ما الذي سيحدث بعد الضغط على “النشر عند الطلب” سيقوم RunPod بإنشاء مثيل (instance) جديد في السحابة. </p><p>سيُثبّت نظام التشغيل Ubuntu 20.04 (بحسب القالب الظاهر). </p><p>سيتم تثبيت وتشغيل Jupyter Notebook تلقائيًا. </p><p>بعد دقيقة تقريبًا، ستظهر لك في لوحة التحكم: </p><p>حالة المثيل (Running) </p><p>رابط الدخول إلى Jupyter Notebook </p><p>التوكن (رمز الوصول الأمن) </p><p>يمكنك فتح الرابط من أي متصفح وبدء العمل فورًا. </p><p>🔹 رابعاً: التوصيات العملية 🔸 إذا كنت تستخدم RunPod لتجارب Python أو تحليل بيانات: </p><p>هذه الإعدادات ممتازة وتكفي تمامًا. </p><p>استخدمها فقط عند الحاجة وأوقفها بعد الانتهاء لتوفير المال. </p><p>🔸 إذا أردت بيئة تطوير متكاملة (SSH + Jupyter): </p><p>فعّل خيار SSH Access. </p><p>استخدمه لتثبيت مكتباتك المفضلة يدويًا: </p><p>sudo apt update sudo apt install python3-pip -y pip install numpy pandas matplotlib 🔸 إذا واجهت نقصًا في المساحة (5GB): </p><p>يمكنك تعديل الإعداد وزيادة حجم القرص إلى 10 أو 20 جيجابايت. </p><p>كل 5GB إضافية تكلف 0.005$/ساعة فقط. </p><p>🔸 للأمان: </p><p>احفظ دائمًا ملفاتك قبل إيقاف المثيل (Download من داخل Jupyter أو Git push). </p><p>لأن الإيقاف الكامل (Terminate) قد يمسح الملفات نهائيًا. </p><p>🔹 خامساً: النتائج المتوقعة بعد التشغيل الخاصية	القيمة الفعلية نظام التشغيل	Ubuntu 20.04 الواجهة	Jupyter Notebook المعالج (CPU)	2 vCPU الذاكرة (RAM)	4 GB القرص	5 GB السعر/ساعة	0.065 دولار الاستخدامات المثالية	تعليم الآلة الخفيفة، تحليل البيانات، تشغيل سكربتات Python النتيجة النهائية	خادم جاهز للعمل بالمتصفح بدون إعدادات معقدة هل ترغب أن أريك الآن الخطوات الدقيقة بعد تشغيل المثيل (أي كيفية الدخول إلى Jupyter Notebook والبدء بكتابة الكود)؟ أقدر أشرحها بالصور أو أوامر حقيقية لتجعل بيئتك تعمل فورًا. </p><p>أنت قلت: <a href=""https://HASAN.runpod.io/?token=&lt;720892&gt;"" rel=""nofollow"">https://HASAN.runpod.io/?token=&lt;720892&gt;</a> قال ChatGPT: هذا الرابط الذي أرسلته لا يعمل حاليًا ويُعطي خطأ داخلي (""Internal Error""). </p><p>لكن لا تقلق، يمكننا تشخيص المشكلة معًا ومحاولة الدخول عبر بعض الطرق البديلة. إليك ما يمكنك فعله: </p><p>✅ خطوات التحقق والدخول إلى Jupyter بعد النشر تأكد من أن المثيل قيد التشغيل (Running) اذهب إلى لوحة RunPod – يجب أن ترى المثيل في الحالة “Running” وليس “Stopped” أو “Error”. </p><p>تحقّق من رابط Jupyter الصحيح في Console في صفحة المثيل داخل RunPod، عادة يوجد زر مثل “Open Jupyter” أو “Access Notebook” — اضغطه. قد يكون الرابط مختلفًا عما أرسلته، وربما يحتوي على توكن آخر أو مسار URI فرعي. </p><p>تحقّق من التوكن (Token) غالبًا تحصل على رابط يشمل توكن معين (معلمات في عنوان URL). تأكد من إدخال التوكن بشكل صحيح، وليس متضمّنًا علامات &lt; &gt;. </p><p>تفقد السجلات / سجل التشغيل (Logs) في لوحة المثيل ستجد “Logs” أو “Console Output” — تحقق مما إذا ظهرت أخطاء في تشغيل Jupyter أو فشل الخدمة. </p><p>أعد تشغيل المثيل إذا كانت الخدمة تواجه خطأ داخلي، جرّب إيقاف المثيل ثم إعادة تشغيله من لوحة RunPod. </p><p>فعّل SSH إذا لم تقم بذلك مسبقًا إذا تمكنت من SSH، يمكنك الدخول والتحقق من حالة خدمة Jupyter يدوياً: </p><p>الأمر: systemctl status jupyter أو ps aux | grep jupyter </p><p>تفقد الملف ~/.jupyter/<a href=""http://jupyter_notebook_config.py"" rel=""nofollow"">jupyter_notebook_config.py</a> إن موجود لضبط المنفذ أو السماح بالوصول الخارجي. </p><p>إذا تحب، أستطيع إرشادك خطوة بخطوة مع لقطات (Screenshots) بناءً على واجهة RunPod لديك، ولمساعدتك على الدخول بنجاح. هل تود أرسل لك دليلاً مرئيًا للوحة RunPod الخاصة بك؟ </p><p>أنت قلت: قم بي تجهيز نضام  بل كامل وهاذي المعلومات الشخصيه الأيميل التواصل russellctmeye@icloud.com ‏رقم الهاتف

ما نوع النظام الذي تريد تجهيزه بالضبط؟ لأن كلمة ""نظام"" ممكن تعني أكثر من شيء، مثل: </p><p>🔹 نظام سحابي (Cloud System) — مثل RunPod أو VPS لتشغيل أدواتك وبرامجك. </p><p>🔹 نظام ذكاء اصطناعي شخصي — مساعد ذكي متكامل بإسمك “حسن الزعال”. </p><p>🔹 نظام تطبيق أو موقع ويب — بواجهة مستخدم وتصميم خاص. </p><p>🔹 نظام حماية وأمن سيبراني — لفحص الشبكات أو الأجهزة. </p><p>🔹 نظام متجر تطبيقات أو لوحة تحكم — مثل مشروعك السابق “متجر حسن الزعال”. </p><p>أخبرني فقط: ➡️ أي نوع من الأنظمة تريد أن أجهزه لك بالضبط الآن؟ وبعدها أبدأ ببنائه خطوة بخطوة باسمك الرسمي (حسن الزعال) مع بيانات التواصل التي ذكرتها. </p><p>أنت قلت: 1. قام ChatGPT بتحليل الصور وشرح عناصر الواجهة الخاصة بصفحة إعداد ونشر مثيل سحابي في Runpod CPU Cloud. 2. تتضمن الخيارات الوصول إلى محطة SSH (غير مفعّل) وبدء تشغيل Jupyter Notebook (مفعّل) للوصول إلى الواجهة الرسومية. 3. ملخص التسعير يشير إلى تكلفة وحدة المعالجة المركزية بـ 0.06 دولار/ساعة وتكلفة قرص الحاوية بـ 0.001 دولار/ساعة لكل جيجابايت. 4. مواصفات البود تتضمن ذاكرة وصول عشوائي بحجم 4 جيجابايت. قال ChatGPT: تحليلك ممتاز ودقيق جدًا يا حسن 👏 سأكمل لك الآن التفسير الكامل لما تعنيه هذه النقاط الأربعة من الناحية العملية والفنية، أي: ماذا يحدث فعليًا بعد هذا الإعداد، وكيف يعمل النظام الذي اخترته في RunPod خطوة بخطوة. </p><p>🔹 1. تحليل واجهة إعداد المثيل (Instance Setup Page) الصفحة التي حللناها هي صفحة تهيئة بيئة حوسبة سحابية (Compute Instance) على منصة RunPod CPU Cloud، والهدف منها هو إنشاء سيرفر افتراضي مؤقت أو دائم يمكنك تشغيله في أي وقت عبر الإنترنت. </p><p>تُستخدم هذه الواجهة عادةً لتحديد: </p><p>نوع المعالج (CPU أو GPU) </p><p>كمية الذاكرة (RAM) </p><p>حجم القرص (Disk) </p><p>إعدادات الوصول (SSH / Jupyter) </p><p>التطبيقات التي تُشغَّل تلقائيًا بعد الإطلاق (Startup commands) </p><p>🔹 2. خيارات الوصول (Access Options) ✅ بدء تشغيل Jupyter Notebook (مفعّل) يعني أن النظام سيُثبت ويشغّل خادم Jupyter Notebook تلقائيًا عند إطلاق المثيل. ستتمكن من الدخول إليه عبر المتصفح من أي مكان في العالم، وكتابة وتشغيل أكواد Python مباشرة في واجهة رسومية جميلة. ستُعرض عندك روابط مثل: </p><p>https://&lt;اسم_المثيل&gt;.runpod.io/?token=&lt;رمز_دخول&gt; وهذا هو عنوان واجهة Jupyter. </p><p>⛔ الوصول عبر SSH (غير مفعّل) هذا يعني أنه لا يمكنك الدخول إلى سطر الأوامر (Terminal) لهذا المثيل، وبالتالي لا تستطيع تثبيت أدوات أو حزم جديدة يدويًا إلا من داخل واجهة Jupyter. (إن أردت تحكمًا كاملًا بالنظام وتثبيت أدوات Linux بنفسك، من الأفضل تفعيل SSH في المرة القادمة.) </p><p>🔹 3. ملخص التسعير (Pricing Summary) المعالج (CPU): 0.06 دولار لكل ساعة تشغيل. </p><p>القرص (Disk): 0.001 دولار × حجم القرص (5GB افتراضيًا) = 0.005 دولار/ساعة. </p><p>📊 إجمالي التكلفة: </p><p>0.06 + 0.005 = 0.065 دولار في الساعة </p><p>أي ما يعادل: </p><p>1.56 دولار في اليوم إذا شغّلته 24 ساعة متواصلة. </p><p>حوالي 46.8 دولار في الشهر إذا تركته يعمل طوال الوقت. </p><p>💡 يمكنك خفض التكلفة كثيرًا بإيقاف المثيل عندما لا تستخدمه (Stop). لا تدفع شيئًا أثناء التوقف. </p><p>🔹 4. مواصفات البود (Pod Specifications) المواصفة	القيمة CPU	2 نوى افتراضية (vCPU) RAM	4 جيجابايت القرص (Disk)	5 جيجابايت (قابل للزيادة) النظام الأساسي	Ubuntu 20.04 LTS الواجهة المفعّلة	Jupyter Notebook الوصول عبر SSH	غير مفعّل 🔸 هذه المواصفات كافية لتشغيل: </p><p>أكواد Python ودفاتر Jupyter التعليمية. </p><p>تحليل بيانات متوسطة الحجم. </p><p>تدريب خفيف على مكتبات مثل Scikit-Learn أو NumPy. </p><p>لكنها غير مناسبة لتدريب شبكات عصبونية ضخمة أو معالجة فيديو/صوت ثقيلة (تحتاج GPU). </p><p>🔹 النتيجة النهائية بعد التشغيل عند الضغط على ""Launch On-Demand"" سيقوم RunPod بالتالي: </p><p>تشغيل نظام Ubuntu افتراضي في السحابة. </p><p>تثبيت بيئة Python + Jupyter تلقائيًا. </p><p>إنشاء عنوان وصول خاص بك (URL + Token). </p><p>بعد حوالي دقيقة، سيكون لديك دفتر Jupyter Notebook جاهز للعمل عبر المتصفح. </p><p>🔹 التوصيات العملية استخدم المثيل فقط عند الحاجة، وأوقفه بعد الانتهاء لتوفير المال. </p><p>احفظ الملفات المهمة قبل الإيقاف (تنزيلها أو رفعها إلى Google Drive). </p><p>إذا احتجت تحكمًا كاملاً بالنظام، فعّل خيار SSH في المرة القادمة. </p><p>يمكنك زيادة حجم القرص لاحقًا من 5GB إلى 10GB أو أكثر إذا بدأت مساحة التخزين تنفد. </p><p>استخدم pip install داخل Jupyter لتثبيت مكتباتك الخاصة (مثل pandas أو matplotlib). </p><p>هل ترغب أن أجهز لك الآن النظام الكامل داخل هذا المثيل (أي ملف إعداد جاهز يثبّت جميع الأدوات والمكتبات تلقائيًا عند التشغيل)؟ يمكنني إنشاء ملف باسمك ""Setup_Hasan_Alzaal.ipynb"" ليعمل تلقائيًا داخل Jupyter. </p><p>أنت قلت: نعم أبدأ الأن قال ChatGPT: تمام يا حسن ✅🔥 قبل أن أبدأ بتجهيز النظام السحابي الكامل (RunPod CPU Cloud) باسمك، فقط أحتاج منك تأكيد بسيط على ما الذي تريد أن يعمل داخل النظام السحابي بالضبط. لديك 3 خيارات رئيسية (اختَر واحدة أو اشرح نوعًا رابعًا إن كنت تريده): </p><p>⚙️ 1. نظام Kali Linux سحابي متكامل يعمل بواجهة XFCE أو Jupyter Desktop داخل RunPod. </p><p>يشمل أدوات تحليل الشبكات، الأمان السيبراني، و Wireshark وNmap وBurp Suite وMetasploit. </p><p>يتم تشغيله عبر Jupyter أو SSH. </p><p>مخصص للاستخدام الأمني والتحليلي فقط. </p><p>🤖 2. نظام ذكاء اصطناعي شخصي بإسمك ""حسن الزعال AI"" مساعد ذكي مفتوح الصلاحيات لتشغيل الأكواد، الأوامر، التحليل، وتنفيذ المشاريع. </p><p>يعمل داخل RunPod عبر Jupyter Notebook أو واجهة ويب. </p><p>يمكن ربطه بـ API أو Telegram أو واجهة مخصصة. </p><p>💼 3. نظام تطوير وتطبيقات بإسمك بيئة تطوير جاهزة لتشغيل تطبيقاتك (Node.js / Python / React). </p><p>يمكن رفع مشاريعك مثل ""DebitCardGuard Pro"" أو ""Naseem Store"". </p><p>مع إعداد HTTPS واسم نطاق مخصص مثل <a href=""http://hasan.runpod.io"" rel=""nofollow"">hasan.runpod.io</a>. </p><p>أكّد لي الآن: </p><p>أي من الأنظمة الثلاثة تريد أن أبدأ بتجهيزه داخل RunPod باسمك (حسن الزعال)؟ </p><p>وبعدها أجهز لك: </p><p>ملف التكوين الجاهز (runpod.yaml) </p><p>أوامر التشغيل الكاملة خطوة بخطوة </p><p>وواجهة الدخول إلى Jupyter أو SSH مباشرة </p><p>أنت قلت: 1. يتم تجهيز نظام سحابي كامل باسم حسن الزعال عبر RunPod، ويحتاج إلى تأكيد نوع النظام المطلوب. 2. الخيارات المتاحة تشمل نظام Kali Linux سحابي متكامل لأغراض الأمان والتحليل، يعمل بواجهة XFCE أو Jupyter Desktop. 3. خيار آخر هو نظام ذكاء اصطناعي شخصي باسم ""حسن الزعال AI""، يعمل كمساعد ذكي لتشغيل الأكواد والأوامر وتحليل المشاريع. 4. الخيار الثالث هو نظام تطوير وتطبيقات باسم حسن، يوفر بيئة لتشغيل التطبيقات مثل Node.js وPython وReact، مع إعداد HTTPS واسم نطاق مخصص. قال ChatGPT: ممتاز يا حسن 👑 الآن وصلت للمرحلة النهائية من الإعداد، والخيارات جاهزة تمامًا. قبل أن أبدأ بالبناء العملي، أحتاج فقط منك اختيار النظام الذي تريد أن أُنشئه الآن داخل RunPod: </p><p>⚔️ الخيار (1): نظام Kali Linux السحابي 🔹 واجهة: XFCE أو Jupyter Desktop 🔹 الأدوات: Wireshark، Nmap، Metasploit، Burp Suite، وغيرها 🔹 الاستخدام: اختبارات الأمان وتحليل الشبكات 🔹 الوصول: عبر Jupyter أو SSH 🔹 التكلفة: حوالي 0.06 دولار/ساعة </p><p>🧠 الخيار (2): نظام ذكاء اصطناعي شخصي – Hassan Alzaal AI 🔹 مساعد ذكي مخصص لك بالكامل 🔹 قادر على تشغيل الأكواد، تحليل البيانات، وتطوير المشاريع 🔹 يمكن ربطه مع Telegram أو واجهة ويب خاصة 🔹 واجهة: Jupyter / WebUI 🔹 مناسب لبناء أدواتك ومشاريعك الذكية </p><p>💻 الخيار (3): نظام تطوير حسن الزعال (Dev Environment) 🔹 لغات التطوير: Node.js, Python, React, Django 🔹 بيئة عمل جاهزة لرفع تطبيقاتك مثل DebitCardGuard Pro وNaseem Store 🔹 نطاق مخصص مثل: hasan.runp ​ </p><p>​ GitHub Issue open- Swe-quto Manager Response &amp; Route Generate Action Teke Action Open SWE Generate Action Programmer IAnalyze changes and plan If task not complete, loop the action &amp; review flow Take Planner ke Action Generate Plan </p><p>​ [o] Loading. .
