Since then, when I click the arrow symbol to download all attachments, nothing happens. The only way to download attachments now is to click the magnifying glass, then save. For my work I need to download multiple attachments from multiple emails a day so it's pretty inconvenient. </p>",firefox-14201;firefox-1420;windows-11;firefox;download-failure;,firefox,download-failure,en-US,"",admin606

And I thought that was true. However, I just discovered that Firefox DOES SAVE Private Mode URL/Site visits - in this specific place. I don't know how long the history will be saved - it looks like at least as long as the Window is open. I want to keep most of my open Private Tabs open - but want to Delete/Clear the ones I'm done with. I thought/understood that Private window/tab/visit info was not tracked/saved - and it's not saved in History, or Searchable. But it appears that this doesn't apply to the Recently Closed Tabs MenuItem. And there seems to be NO 'delete' or 'clear' option for this field. I can't find any reference to the subject in the Forum or Articles. The picture I've attached is NOT of the Recently Closed Tabs while in Private Browsing, but is the same MenuItem and field contents. Thanks for your interest. I'm hoping someone can help me figure out how to delete/clear this specific history. </p>",firefox-1420;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;history;,firefox,history,en-US,"",antiquetuck
