I can open it, but if I try to go to any web site it just has a dot bouncing back and forth like it looks like it's trying to go to the site, but then it times out. I have deleted and re-installed Firefox several times - the last one being version 137.0.2 for Mac, but it still won't open any site. I don't know what to do to get it working and Mac tech support had no ideas other than to contact Mozilla tech support, so here I am. Can you help me? This has never happened before and it makes no sense that it would not work. You can see by the enclosed screen shot that it opens, but fails to open any photos or go beyond that. The 'checking for updates' alert just keeps spinning and spinning. Rick Garside </p>",firefox-13702;firefox-1370;firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",sidebyside
