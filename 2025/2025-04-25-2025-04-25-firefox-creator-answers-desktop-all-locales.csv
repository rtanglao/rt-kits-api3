The only thing keeping me using chrome is the intelligent autofill. Many websites do not autofill. This issue is also present on firefox for android. Single sign on applications have difficulties on android as well when using mozilla password manager, as it does not get its secure ""unlocked"" status from the android system. This results in needing to unlock the password manager on the keyboard every time, often making the user lose the text field they had their cursor on. </p>",firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",gj98awsm

Gisteren heb ik Firefox 'opgefrist', met de button daarvoor. Alle Add-ons was ik kwijt en ik moest ook verder alles opnieuw instellen. Dat was al vervelend, er was geen melding daarover als je dat deed. In ieder geval, ik heb onder andere mijn geliefde Cookie AutoDelete weer toegevoegd, maar kon die verder niet instellen, zoals ik eerder kon aangeven dat cookies tien seconden na het sluiten van een tabblad moeten worden verwijderd. Verder lijkt het alsof cookies überhaupt niet worden verwijderd, want als ik met diverse websites wat testjes doe en die tabbladen sluit om vervolgens die websites in nieuwe tabbladen te openen, zie ik allereerst niet dat prettige CAD-meldinkje rechtsonder in mijn scherm dat de cookies zijn verwijderd en bij opnieuw laden van de websites wordt er ook niet weer om cookie-toestemming gevraagd, ook een inlog blijft hangen. Tegelijkertijd is het rare dat ik geen cookies vermeld zie staan, ook van openstaande websites/tabbladen, als ik kijk bij Instellingen - Privacy&amp;Beveiliging-Cookies en websitesgegevens - Gegevens beheren. Over het algemeen red ik me prima met dit soort dingen, maar nu snap ik het niet meer. Aan degene die dit leest en hier iets over kan zeggen, bij voorbaat mijn dank.
