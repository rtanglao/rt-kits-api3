Today, suddenly, a video player disappeared on the Twitch streaming service (see screenshot), but the stream sound is playing. I tried clearing Firefox data and later reinstalled the browser completely - didn't fix the problem. I installed two versions (115.17.0esr and 115.23.1esr) because I thought the problem was an update. Both versions of the browser have a problem. In another browser, this problem is missing, Twitch is working! Operating system Windows 7 Pro SP1.
