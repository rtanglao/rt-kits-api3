However with the last couple of releases something has changed.  The number of tabs I keep open and what they are connected to have changed very little over the years.  The CPU utilization has never been much but now it has become huge - utilizing multiple CPU cores and running them at 100% whether I am using the browser or not.  I have gone thru each individual tab/web page removing it, waiting for a period of time and them re-adding it assuming this was a website coding issue.  Nothing changed.  So I gave up and move 98% of my web browsing to another browser (Opera) - moving one website at a time until what was left on Firefox was 11 tabs.  Finally the CPU utilization went away. I got the latest Firefox version update today, installed it and now Firefox has changed behavior yet again.  Those same 11 tabs will not use any CPU as long as I keep Firefox open and visible on screen, but if I minimize the Firefox window it immediately jumps up in CPU utilization.  This makes no sense to me. </p><p>What adds to all this frustration is I am running on a system76 Thelio desktop. While extremely fast they have a known issue with their somewhat loud CPU cooling fan kicking in too fast when high CPU utilization occurs.  Firefox never used to cause the fans to run but now the latest couple of versions cause the fan to run continuously. </p><p>Here is a paste from ""top"" showing the top 2 cpu processes - both from Firefox and the browser is minimized: </p><pre>416154 greeves   20   0 3796844 612012 260196 R 109.6   0.9 147:49.17 firefox-bin                              416394 greeves   20   0 3537408 822456 130500 R  89.7   1.3 146:40.46 Web Content  </pre> <pre> My apologies if I have run on with too much info that is of no help.

Now, my Mozilla account was registered via DMU (technically set up by the university’s ITMS) to run as my default browser, which opened automatically logged-in and ready to go each time I started the computer. This is how it has worked for the last four years and through many, many updates… until yesterday. </p><p>Since the last update on Monday, May 19th, all my access records, settings and bookmarks have been completely wiped off. In fact, it appears that my university-registered account has been wiped in its entirety. Strangely, Mozilla Firefox is still my default browser but only opens with a standard default window. More importantly, I was no longer able to log into my account, as if my account no longer exists… which also means that all my bookmarks and links to important websites within DMU and externally have all disappeared. It will take me at least 1 week (if I focus on nothing else) to find and restore them. </p><p>So, how was such a car crash of an update actually possible? Please note that ITMS at DMU is placing the blame and responsibility of this fuckup squarely on you. Furthermore, why was this update actually necessary? Mozilla Firefox was until yesterday a far superior browser in terms of user-friendliness and style compared to Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Apple Safari. Now it’s little more than a cheap, equally flawed Microsoft Edge copycat both in style and user-unfriendliness!  </p><p>But even worse, I now find out that Mozilla like all those ""revolutionary, democratizing"" tech companies cannot even be bothered to be accessible for contact when in need for support. Anyway, I would like to know how your update could wipe out my account and all the bookmarks just like that, as if they never existed in the first place. And how do I get my my original settings back? </p><p>Very disappointing. </p><p>Regards, </p><p>Markus </p>",windows-11;firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",markus.wohlfeil
