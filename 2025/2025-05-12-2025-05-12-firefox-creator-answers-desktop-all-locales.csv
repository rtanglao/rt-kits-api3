This made me suspect that the data might be stored locally or that the devices were syncing separately. </p><p>A few days ago, I deleted all saved passwords from my work computer (after backing them up to a spreadsheet) and then logged out of the Firefox account on that device. Later, when I checked Firefox on my personal computer, the 33 passwords were still there and unchanged, which confirmed my suspicion that I might be using two Firefox accounts that look identical but are not actually connected. </p><p>I also noticed that I can no longer log back into the version of the account I was using at work ‚Äî the system rejects the password I currently use on my personal device, despite both using the same email address. </p><p>Could you please verify whether there are two separate Firefox accounts linked to this email address or help me recover access to the original Sync data? </p><p>Thank you very much for your support. </p><p>Kind regards, Ingrid Hurtado </p>",firefox;accounts;,firefox,accounts,en-US,1732052;,inhucr
