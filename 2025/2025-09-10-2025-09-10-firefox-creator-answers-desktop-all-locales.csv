Here's what’s going on and how to mitigate it: </p><p>What’s Happening with Firefox Snap? </p><p>2. Browser Hangs or Locks the System on Close </p><pre>On Linux (especially Ubuntu), users have reported that closing Firefox can lead to it hanging in memory, sometimes unresponsive and still consuming resources. Super User Ask Ubuntu A stark example from Reddit illustrates the severity: “About 50% of the time I open Firefox, it'll reach 100% CPU usage in about 30 seconds… PC completely unusable unless I shutdown.” Reddit </pre> <p>3. Known Wayland Sway Bug </p><pre>On Wayland/Sway setups, reloading Sway while Firefox is open can trigger intense logging, causing high CPU use and an enormous syslog. Fix: Set MOZ_DISABLE_WAYLAND_PROXY=1, or upgrade to FF 125 where the issue is addressed. Reddit+1 </pre> <p>Alternative Approach </p><p>Many users, particularly on Ubuntu, opt out of Snap completely in favor of the .deb package or PPA builds. These alternatives often avoid these specific issues. Ask Ubuntu Reddit </p><p>Thoughts?
