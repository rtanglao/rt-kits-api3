For a native English speaker and student of the language, brought up in the UK, having an app confined to US English is troublesome and unacceptable; so please, Mozilla, sign your own language pack for your own email client app so that your own browser no longer blocks it for users of your own update site. The present situation doesn't do a lot for users' confidence in your products, as it looks as though you don't have confidence in your own products. </p>",firefox-14103;firefox-1410;windows-10;firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",guy_james

They asked several multiple choice questions about features, but they didn't ask a very important question: Would you use Firefox more if it used less system memory?  I currently use Google Chrome for about 2/3 of my web browsing because Firefox uses up too much system memory.  I would prefer to use Firefox most of the time, but can't, since it bogs down when memory usage gets too high. </p><p>The survey should have included a text input box so users could enter any comments for the developers, and the survey did NOT do that. </p><p>So, after completing the survey, I was disappointed that I couldn't comment on the most important issue I have with Firefox.  I would like the Firefox dev team to try get Firefox's use of system memory down.  A short while ago, I opened 4 websites in Google Chrome, then opened the exact same 4 websites in Firefox.  The attached shows the memory usage of each browser. </p>",windows-10;firefox;app-responsiveness;,firefox,app-responsiveness,en-US,"",mikeschwarz85018
