Now when I open my saved pages it turns it into a 2 step process. Now it opens up a side bar and then I have to click on the star to open my saved pages. Before I just clicked on the folder and it opened them up. I have searched on help but none of it helped. One solution was to got to settings and to hide side bar but I don't have that option. Tried to customized toolbars, nothing seems to work. I use the favorites all the time and to turn it into a 2 step process is a pain. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",rfc716
