Water Use Efficiency (WUE): Measures the amount of crop produced per unit of water used. 2. Irrigation Efficiency (IE): Evaluates the proportion of water supplied that is actually used by the crop. 3. Crop Water Productivity (CWP): Assesses the amount of crop produced per unit of water consumed. 4. Relative Water Supply (RWS): Compares the actual water supply to the potential crop water requirement. 5. Cropped Area Ratio (CAR): Measures the proportion of the command area that is actually cropped. 6. Yield Gap (YG): Evaluates the difference between the actual and potential crop yields. </p><p>Step 2: Computing the Indicators Season 1: 1. WUE: 3 tons / (100 mm + 470 mm - 70 mm) = 3 tons / 500 mm = 0.006 tons/mm 2. IE: (100 mm + 70 mm) / 100 mm = 1.7 (approx.) 3. CWP: 3 tons / (100 mm + 470 mm - 70 mm) = 3 tons / 500 mm = 0.006 tons/mm 4. RWS: (100 mm + 470 mm - 70 mm) / 480 mm = 1.02 (approx.) 5. CAR: 80 ha / 100 ha = 0.8 6. YG: (3 tons - 3 tons) / 3 tons = 0 (no yield gap) </p><p>Season 2: 1. WUE: 2 tons / (100 mm + 350 mm - 70 mm) = 2 tons / 380 mm = 0.0053 tons/mm 2. IE: (100 mm + 70 mm) / 100 mm = 1.7 (approx.) 3. CWP: 2 tons / (100 mm + 350 mm - 70 mm) = 2 tons / 380 mm = 0.0053 tons/mm 4. RWS: (100 mm + 350 mm - 70 mm) / 600 mm = 0.63 (approx.) 5. CAR: 50 ha / 100 ha = 0.5 6. YG: (2 tons - 3 tons) / 3 tons = -0.33 (yield gap of 33%) </p><p>Step 3: Commenting on the Performance of the Irrigation Scheme Based on the indicators: </p><p>- WUE and CWP are relatively low, indicating room for improvement in water use efficiency. - IE is high, suggesting that the irrigation system is efficient in delivering water to the crop. - RWS is near optimal in Season 1 but lower in Season 2, indicating a potential water supply issue. - CAR is lower in Season 2, indicating underutilization of the command area. - YG shows a significant yield gap in Season 2, indicating potential for yield improvement. </p><p>Step 4: Management Actions to Improve Performance 1. Improve WUE and CWP: Implement water-saving technologies, optimize irrigation scheduling, and promote crop varieties with improved water use efficiency. 2. Maintain IE: Regularly inspect and maintain the irrigation system to ensure efficient water delivery. 3. Address RWS: Investigate water supply issues and explore alternative water sources or storage options. 4. Increase CAR: Encourage farmers to cultivate more area within the command area. 5. Close YG: Provide training on best agricultural practices, soil management, and fertilizer application to improve crop yields. </p><p>By addressing these areas, the irrigation scheme can improve its performance, increase crop yields, and optimize water use. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",evansmazulu

My 'Adblocker for Youtube' just  stopped working &amp; I get the  warning saying if I don't disable it, YT will stop the videos. I wouldn't mind so much since Youtube obviously need to make money from the ads but mostly they don't vet the advertisers qpting for money over customer protection as priority ( Stephen Ridley has multiple ads with his 'Play piano like Mozart in 3 months' BS.)  More than two thirds of ads I get are either scams or offering a some product about extending the size of my manhood etc. It gets really annoying when my young kids often use my PC for homework!! </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",seanhayes7
