Changing layout.css.devPixelsPerPx works as expected, but layout.css.dpi seems to be a red herring--changing it has no effect in old or new profile.  I vaguely remember replacing it with something else after a design change, but I'm not finding it either in about:config or in my userContent.css.  It must be something that applies to the page content and not the UI, because my old settings don't affect the menu text and I had to adjust that size in userChrome.css. </p><p>(I'm trying to figure this out to diagnose a problem with a web site at work, which doesn't compute the window size correctly with my settings and refuses to display a menu sidebar at my usual window width.) </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",NotR

This functionality is extremely useful for quickly switching between the last two active tabs without needing to cycle through all open tabs.  </p><p>Currently, I use Ctrl+Tab to cycle through tabs in order and Ctrl+Shift+Tab to cycle in reverse order. While this works, it is not ideal for scenarios where I frequently need to switch between two specific tabs (e.g., tab #25 for monitoring the progress of a web app and tab #129 for working on an email). In such cases, having a dedicated shortcut to jump directly to the last used tab would significantly improve productivity and usability.  </p><p>Proposed Solution:  Add a new keyboard shortcut (e.g., Ctrl+Backtick or a user-configurable option) that allows users to instantly switch to the last used tab.  </p><p>Benefits:     </p><pre>   Reduces the need to manually cycle through tabs, saving time.    Enhances workflow efficiency when multitasking across multiple tabs.    Aligns Firefox with features available in other modern browsers.      </pre> <p>Use Case Example:     </p><pre>   I‚Äôm actively working on a task in tab #129 (e.g., writing an email).    I periodically check the progress of a web app in tab #25.    Instead of cycling through tabs using Ctrl+Tab or searching for the desired tab, I could simply press a ""Recall"" shortcut to toggle between these two tabs instantly.      </pre> <p>This feature would greatly enhance the user experience, especially for power users who frequently switch between tabs. </p>",firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,1723279;,radek11

Water Use Efficiency (WUE): Measures the amount of crop produced per unit of water used. 2. Irrigation Efficiency (IE): Evaluates the proportion of water supplied that is actually used by the crop. 3. Crop Water Productivity (CWP): Assesses the amount of crop produced per unit of water consumed. 4. Relative Water Supply (RWS): Compares the actual water supply to the potential crop water requirement. 5. Cropped Area Ratio (CAR): Measures the proportion of the command area that is actually cropped. 6. Yield Gap (YG): Evaluates the difference between the actual and potential crop yields. </p><p>Step 2: Computing the Indicators Season 1: 1. WUE: 3 tons / (100 mm + 470 mm - 70 mm) = 3 tons / 500 mm = 0.006 tons/mm 2. IE: (100 mm + 70 mm) / 100 mm = 1.7 (approx.) 3. CWP: 3 tons / (100 mm + 470 mm - 70 mm) = 3 tons / 500 mm = 0.006 tons/mm 4. RWS: (100 mm + 470 mm - 70 mm) / 480 mm = 1.02 (approx.) 5. CAR: 80 ha / 100 ha = 0.8 6. YG: (3 tons - 3 tons) / 3 tons = 0 (no yield gap) </p><p>Season 2: 1. WUE: 2 tons / (100 mm + 350 mm - 70 mm) = 2 tons / 380 mm = 0.0053 tons/mm 2. IE: (100 mm + 70 mm) / 100 mm = 1.7 (approx.) 3. CWP: 2 tons / (100 mm + 350 mm - 70 mm) = 2 tons / 380 mm = 0.0053 tons/mm 4. RWS: (100 mm + 350 mm - 70 mm) / 600 mm = 0.63 (approx.) 5. CAR: 50 ha / 100 ha = 0.5 6. YG: (2 tons - 3 tons) / 3 tons = -0.33 (yield gap of 33%) </p><p>Step 3: Commenting on the Performance of the Irrigation Scheme Based on the indicators: </p><p>- WUE and CWP are relatively low, indicating room for improvement in water use efficiency. - IE is high, suggesting that the irrigation system is efficient in delivering water to the crop. - RWS is near optimal in Season 1 but lower in Season 2, indicating a potential water supply issue. - CAR is lower in Season 2, indicating underutilization of the command area. - YG shows a significant yield gap in Season 2, indicating potential for yield improvement. </p><p>Step 4: Management Actions to Improve Performance 1. Improve WUE and CWP: Implement water-saving technologies, optimize irrigation scheduling, and promote crop varieties with improved water use efficiency. 2. Maintain IE: Regularly inspect and maintain the irrigation system to ensure efficient water delivery. 3. Address RWS: Investigate water supply issues and explore alternative water sources or storage options. 4. Increase CAR: Encourage farmers to cultivate more area within the command area. 5. Close YG: Provide training on best agricultural practices, soil management, and fertilizer application to improve crop yields. </p><p>By addressing these areas, the irrigation scheme can improve its performance, increase crop yields, and optimize¬†water¬†use. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",evansmazulu
