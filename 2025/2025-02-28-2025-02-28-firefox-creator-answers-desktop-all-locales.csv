We have 115.18.0esr and were getting notifications at the top of Firefox saying this would stop working on 14th March. We got 128.7.0esr but it core dumped on loading even in safe mode and when creating a new profile. So downgraded and then found another coworker faced same issue so go him to also downgrade.  I then went to recreate my issue get logs and screenshots to provide to my supplier but 128.7.0esr has disappeared from the amazon linux yum repo and the notification about the need to upgrade before 14th March has also gone and gone from co worker machines. I think it was needed for plugin and cert issues but I am not sure.  I realise I should reach out to the supplier for them to then contact Amazon and find out what the issues are from their yum repo and see if it is anything to do with their provided vm. But has anyone got any info on the reason to upgrade from 115.18.0esr so I can add to the issue? I know it's EOL but the message was specific and came from Firefox and links which took you to info about why it was needed but it seems weird the notification has disappeared. </p>,firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,1714970;,safersuk
