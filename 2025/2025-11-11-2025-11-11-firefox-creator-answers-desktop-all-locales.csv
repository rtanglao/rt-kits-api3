Firstly I have NO troubles accessing the internet via Firefox (my Default browser).  My problem is that none of my ""saved"" websites (including those appearing on the Bookmarks Toolbar) will open on the internet when I click on them. If I type the internet address into the address bar, the site opens as normal.  I do not have this problem if I use Chrome.  The problem only commenced today following an update by Norton via Norton 360.  I have attempted all the suggestions that Norton have supplied other than re-installing Firefox - and none of their suggestions have solved my predicament.  Any assistance would be gratefully appreciated to fix this most annoying problem.
