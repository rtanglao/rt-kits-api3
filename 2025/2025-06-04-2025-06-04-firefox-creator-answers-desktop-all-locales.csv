1515418,2025-06-04 08:54:47 -0700,2025-06-04 08:54:47 -0700,Firefox is missing a crucial feature.,"<p>I have been using Firefox for the last 5 years, I have been content with their services and for that reason I keep using it. Lately I had computer issues so I had to reset my computer and start over this includes Firefox as well. Anyhow because of my lifestyle i do different things like school work, farming, and other stuff. Windows has a feature called ""Desktops"" this feature is very handy to me as it lets me organize my tabs and windows base on the topic like school or work, (To illustrate this I included a picture of how I have it organize.) well, sometimes my computer shuts down by accident or intentional. Regardless if it was shut down by accident or not, I would boot my computer up and lunch Firefox, and Firefox would open my tabs and windows in the Desktop that It was previously at. For example, I would have all of my school related tabs and windows in the School Desktop, and all of my Work related stuff in the work Desktop, after booting Firefox would automatically place my tabs windows in those compartments, well now Firefox doesn't do that anymore and it is frustrating because every time I boot my computer up after an update or a restart, when Firefox is lunch Firefox will place all of my tabs and windows in the first Desktop, and this is frustrating because every time that happens I have spend time on sorting my tabs out to the right compartment, and to be honest I'm getting sick and tired of doing it because i lose time. So to anyone who reads this, can you please help me figure out what is wrong, because if it is a setting then that's is understandable but if it is Firefox then it would break my heart because as an user and a fan It would break my heart to stop using Firefox as my primary app. </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",sotini0504

The idea here essentially is to somehow sandbox certain tabs or windows entirely and to be able to pick up where u left off. this paired with the Firefox advanced features and all the amazing extension still available here instead of chrome will make the experience even safer.  Hopefully this is something you guys can actually do. More than that i hope this reaches the relevant people at the company not just drowned in a pool of support tickets. I expect no credits or anything like that. I just want to know if its possible and this reach the devs so maybe they make it happen. I do think this is a great idea and a possible feature on here.  i can think of more ways to use sandboxing like that but this is just how i want to use it.

They are not in history anymore at all, they are gone. What opened up instead after the restart, was 2 lots of Windows &amp; tabs that just disappeared in the same way, from 3 years ago, &amp; they reappeared on the browsers. Can you tell me what is going on please &amp; how to fix this problem in losing them in the first place? This problem has happened several times before &amp; is very upsetting. Can you help in finding my recent loss of windows/tabs please? Regards Doug </p>",windows-10;firefox-13901;firefox-1390;firefox;recover-data;,firefox,recover-data,en-US,"",grimco
