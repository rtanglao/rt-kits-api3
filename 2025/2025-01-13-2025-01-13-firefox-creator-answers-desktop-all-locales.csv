My password and username have not changed in years. Can log on via iphone and iPad without a problem and also using thew same username/password combination on other desktop browsers so problem seems to be only with Firefox. Have done all the usual cache clearing etc. Would a recent upgrade have affected this? </p>,firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",david69
