After awhile, things begin to slow down substantially such as delays in clicking on links and having it respond, or right clicking, etc.  Browsing speeds slow down substantially also. </p><p>Here is what I then usually do: </p><p>1.  Create a new tab and type in ""about:memory""  and click on the save memory command. </p><p>2.  Go into settings and delete cache. </p><p>This normally does nothing to speed up things, and I find I have to just close out the browser, wait a few seconds, and bring it back up to things to get back to normal. </p><p>This has me speculating - ""Could"" it be that having a variety of Firefox based browsers with similar data conflict with each other in some strange sort of way""   Or is it something else? I know that having a bunch of tabs up can deplete memory usage, but as I mentioned above, I have 64 Gigs of RAM and never had this issue before. </p><p>My SSD drive has 500 Gigs of storage, and only half is being used. </p><p>Any suggestions or recommendations would be truly appreciated. </p><p>Ben Herrmann Fuquay-Varina, NC </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1703292;,willowcreekhoafv

However, the problem arises when I open new tabs — they also load from the disk cache instead of requesting fresh content from the server. </p><p><strong>What I’m looking for:</strong> </p><pre>   A way to have Firefox: </pre> <p>Load webpages from the disk cache when restarting the browser (which I want, and I have set browser.cache.disk.enable to true for this). But always make fresh requests from the server when opening new tabs, no matter what the cache settings are. </p><p>In Chrome, this behavior is more intuitive — it loads from the cache after restart but always fetches from the server for new tabs, which I find to be much more reasonable. </p><p>I understand that about:config provides settings like browser.sessionstore.restore_on_demand, but adjusting this option makes Firefox fetch content from the server for all tabs, including those opened after a restart. This doesn’t seem like a perfect solution because it takes away the ability to use the disk cache after restarting the browser. </p><p>I would really appreciate it if Firefox could offer more granular control over this behavior, so users could get the benefits of both caching and real-time requests based on the type of tab (restart vs. new tab). </p><p>Thanks for your attention, and I hope to see some improvements in future updates! </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1703158;1703278;,suzhengchun
