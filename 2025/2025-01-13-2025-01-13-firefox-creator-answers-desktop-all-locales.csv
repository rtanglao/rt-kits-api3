I hate google chrome.  how difficult would it be for firefox to support usb devices like a minidisc recorder player.  I guess its down to drivers or some form of plug in?  Could firefox be made to support my minidisc or is it too much of a security/software performance issue?  Cheers Mark </p>,firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,1703120;1703121;,g0nmy
