However, the problem arises when I open new tabs — they also load from the disk cache instead of requesting fresh content from the server. </p><p><strong>What I’m looking for:</strong> </p><pre>   A way to have Firefox: </pre> <p>Load webpages from the disk cache when restarting the browser (which I want, and I have set browser.cache.disk.enable to true for this). But always make fresh requests from the server when opening new tabs, no matter what the cache settings are. </p><p>In Chrome, this behavior is more intuitive — it loads from the cache after restart but always fetches from the server for new tabs, which I find to be much more reasonable. </p><p>I understand that about:config provides settings like browser.sessionstore.restore_on_demand, but adjusting this option makes Firefox fetch content from the server for all tabs, including those opened after a restart. This doesn’t seem like a perfect solution because it takes away the ability to use the disk cache after restarting the browser. </p><p>I would really appreciate it if Firefox could offer more granular control over this behavior, so users could get the benefits of both caching and real-time requests based on the type of tab (restart vs. new tab). </p><p>Thanks for your attention, and I hope to see some improvements in future updates! </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1703158;,suzhengchun
