It will be disheartening to abandon the browser I've been using for years, but I value my personal data (and cpu) too much to let an AI handle it. I appreciated his words that it would be ""Completely opt-in, you have full control, and if you try it and find it’s not for you, you can choose to switch it off"", but I strongly believe that all AI browsers are inherently insecure. The first AI feature that I can't make completely disappear forever with one click will be my sign to switch browsers. Hopefully, Firefox re-thinks its approach and decides not to destroy the exact thing that makes it so valuable - the commitment to protect the users' privacy. </p>",firefox-1440;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;browser-security;,firefox,browser-security,en-US,"",naxabceva

I JUST started moving to firefox to escape the shoving down my throat of AI and ADs that plagues everything. And now to hear that the new CEO wants to shove down even more AI? That's infuriating. No one really wants this, the people that do have something to gain, ulterior motives or don't understand just how bad it is. Not to mention the data scraping that I don't consent to.  </p><p>I've seen that this browser has potential, that has a relative ease of access for people to get the experience they want. But this AI shoving is ruining that, and it's driving users away. I do not like having to jump through hoops to avoid AI but I will. It's slowing down the browser and causing even more lack of privacy! We already have so little in this modern area, it's terrible to do more. </p><p>The sad part is, is that I know there are people that run the browser that don't want this. It's the people up top who put their money into AI, thinking it's the next big thing, and are trying to make it that so their money doesn't just get yanked away. When it will anyway. AI, generative specifically, is awful. I hate the AI overviews, I hate AI 'support' in everything. In social media, in online shopping, in just damn chats. I refuse to use it. It's horrible, it's nothing but bloatware. </p><p>So I hope that this new guy will actually listen to the people that use the browser and stop it with his stupid AI stuff. There is NO room for AI browsers, there never will be room for them. And I will NEVER trust an AI browser or whatever stuff an AI pulls up, because they will pull up nonsense. They will pull up what you WANT to hear, not the actual facts. Do better, this is a disappointment. </p>",firefox-1460;windows-10;firefox;undefined;,firefox,undefined,en-US,"",ghostguardian

It will evolve into a modern AI browser and support a portfolio of new and trusted software additions."" </p><p>Firefox's appeal as an alternative to Edge, Chrome, etc. is its respect for user privacy and control. Adopting AI tools into the browser itself is a betrayal of that respect, and will eliminate Firefox's advantages over rival browsers. If users want an AI browser, they already have that option. They want, instead, a browser that allows then to control their own experience and data. I beg the Mozilla foundation to actually do some research into your own market so you will learn that people hate LLM slop in their internet browsing. </p><p>Adopting AI tools will damage Mozilla's reputation as an organization worthy of respect. What's more, it will contribute to the further erosion of trust in information on the internet that AI has caused, because *LLMs lie and steal*. This is more than just a market mistake, this is an ethical mistake.  </p><p>There is still time to change course. Do not follow Chrome and Edge into AI delusion. </p>",firefox-1460;linux;firefox;undefined;,firefox,undefined,en-US,"",jdrion

I stopped using other browsers, such as chrome and other chromium based browsers, because they eventually got filled with AI bloatware slop that didn't really add anything to how we use the internet browsers </p><p>Firefox literally had something going on that stood out from rest of the market, and now you're willing enough to throw it all away for short-term gains to be made off the AI bubble? Firefox could've been the market leader in having a simple browser with no AI slop or general bloat added. </p><p>Not to mention the fact that AI is just straight up invasive as its basically just thinly veiled attempt to get more sensitive data harvested off users, to produce more money without paying compensation for the time used on the browser. In addition to opening up vectors for identity theft and fraud. </p><p>Once again, why is it absolutely necessary to have AI in the browser? </p>",firefox-1460;windows-11;firefox;browser-security;,firefox,browser-security,en-US,"",mydefaultaccount
