He's mentioned this a few times before, but now we've both really noticed the push towards using generative AI in roles in IT where it's really unsuitable, and honestly quite a risk to security and privacy, not to mention quite a waste of time having to fact check things properly because I cannot even be sure that the first result in a Google search for ""how far away is the moon"" will be correct. We're quite concerned that Firefox is following suit, especially with the new CEO evidently not understanding some of the fundamentals of why this browser has such a dedicated user base. Just wondering if saving the money by not having to hire competent, trained professionals who can provide the human touch needed to run a browser is truly worth eroding Firefox's reputation of being the genuinely good alternative to Chrome? How long before the AI stops being optional? How much of the code is going to end up written by some language learning algorithm and passed off as safe? If this push is to continue, what alternatives does anyone in the community suggest?

Many people share my concerns, and have voiced them across social media, and have gone out of their way to criticise and take a stand against what we see as a plague. </p><p>So it is with much frustration that I find out Mozilla are aiming to turn Firefox into ""a modern AI browser"", per <a href=""https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/leadership/mozillas-next-chapter-anthony-enzor-demeo-new-ceo/"" rel=""nofollow"">new Mozilla CEO Anthony Enzor-Demeo's first blog post in the role</a>. I have already gone out of my way to turn off as much of the AI nonsense in Firefox as I can — even downloading a plugin to remove the Google Gemini summaries, because they're all less than useless and absolutely defeat the point of using Google in the first place — and now here we are; it's going to be shoved down our throats, whether we wanted it or not (which, of course, many of us didn't). </p><p>I didn't anticipate that this would be the thing that forces me to make an account for the support forum of all things, because my experience of Firefox up to this point (an experience spanning almost as long as Firefox has existed) has been a largely positive experience, and I even make use of Thunderbird for my email needs. Now, all of this is being swept aside because of corporate greed and an outright rejection of its userbase. </p><p>This same userbase is very strongly and vocally against this, and it is within our power — even if we don't necessarily want to have to do so — to move elsewhere. Therefore, I urge Mozilla and its leadership to read the goddamn room and recognise that we don't want this, stop forcing it upon us, and focus on being a browser that is nice to use <em>without having to rely on the Infinite Plagiarism Machine to do it</em>. </p><p>If there is no about-turn on this or almost prostrated assurances that you would have to <strong>directly opt in</strong> (not out, but in, specifically; as in, I would have to turn everything on myself to even see a single bit of it) to this otherwise seemingly enforced ""modern AI browser"" experience, <em>I will stop using both Firefox and Thunderbird and will actively recommend against them</em>. I've already gone some distance towards excising the likelihood of encountering AI in my life, and I will continue to do so if I have to, even if it comes at the cost of software I've been using ever since I was a teenager. </p><p>Your call, Mozilla. </p><p>Choose responsibly. </p>",firefox-1460;windows-11;firefox;undefined;seg-incident;,firefox,undefined,en-US,"",daniell5583

I JUST started moving to firefox to escape the shoving down my throat of AI and ADs that plagues everything. And now to hear that the new CEO wants to shove down even more AI? That's infuriating. No one really wants this, the people that do have something to gain, ulterior motives or don't understand just how bad it is. Not to mention the data scraping that I don't consent to.  </p><p>I've seen that this browser has potential, that has a relative ease of access for people to get the experience they want. But this AI shoving is ruining that, and it's driving users away. I do not like having to jump through hoops to avoid AI but I will. It's slowing down the browser and causing even more lack of privacy! We already have so little in this modern area, it's terrible to do more. </p><p>The sad part is, is that I know there are people that run the browser that don't want this. It's the people up top who put their money into AI, thinking it's the next big thing, and are trying to make it that so their money doesn't just get yanked away. When it will anyway. AI, generative specifically, is awful. I hate the AI overviews, I hate AI 'support' in everything. In social media, in online shopping, in just damn chats. I refuse to use it. It's horrible, it's nothing but bloatware. </p><p>So I hope that this new guy will actually listen to the people that use the browser and stop it with his stupid AI stuff. There is NO room for AI browsers, there never will be room for them. And I will NEVER trust an AI browser or whatever stuff an AI pulls up, because they will pull up nonsense. They will pull up what you WANT to hear, not the actual facts. Do better, this is a disappointment. </p>",firefox-1460;windows-10;firefox;undefined;seg-incident;,firefox,undefined,en-US,"",ghostguardian

It will evolve into a modern AI browser and support a portfolio of new and trusted software additions."" </p><p>Firefox's appeal as an alternative to Edge, Chrome, etc. is its respect for user privacy and control. Adopting AI tools into the browser itself is a betrayal of that respect, and will eliminate Firefox's advantages over rival browsers. If users want an AI browser, they already have that option. They want, instead, a browser that allows then to control their own experience and data. I beg the Mozilla foundation to actually do some research into your own market so you will learn that people hate LLM slop in their internet browsing. </p><p>Adopting AI tools will damage Mozilla's reputation as an organization worthy of respect. What's more, it will contribute to the further erosion of trust in information on the internet that AI has caused, because *LLMs lie and steal*. This is more than just a market mistake, this is an ethical mistake.  </p><p>There is still time to change course. Do not follow Chrome and Edge into AI delusion. </p>",firefox-1460;linux;firefox;undefined;seg-incident;,firefox,undefined,en-US,"",jdrion

I stopped using other browsers, such as chrome and other chromium based browsers, because they eventually got filled with AI bloatware slop that didn't really add anything to how we use the internet browsers </p><p>Firefox literally had something going on that stood out from rest of the market, and now you're willing enough to throw it all away for short-term gains to be made off the AI bubble? Firefox could've been the market leader in having a simple browser with no AI slop or general bloat added. </p><p>Not to mention the fact that AI is just straight up invasive as its basically just thinly veiled attempt to get more sensitive data harvested off users, to produce more money without paying compensation for the time used on the browser. In addition to opening up vectors for identity theft and fraud. </p><p>Once again, why is it absolutely necessary to have AI in the browser? </p>",firefox-1460;windows-11;firefox;browser-security;seg-incident;,firefox,browser-security,en-US,"",mydefaultaccount
