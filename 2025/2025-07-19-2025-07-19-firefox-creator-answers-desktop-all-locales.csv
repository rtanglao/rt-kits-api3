As part of that, I use rust and verify that its ""major packages"" still build, firefox among them.  Recently I found (ref. <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/143904"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/143904</a>) that by default, firefox would no longer build natively on NetBSD/i386 (really i586 / i686, in 32-bit mode).  I found a workaround, namely to turn off address-space layout randomization, but this indicates we are already balancing too close to the border of the 3GB per-process data segment size for comfort.  A hint given there was that I could try to turn off LTO (link-time optimization), since it reportedly gives at best modest gains for considerable cost in terms of build time and VM space requirements during the build. </p><p>So...  This is my first encounter with the firefox configure machinery which is different from most other similar things, and I appear to be unable to find a way to instruct the configure machinery to build without LTO.  The configure script accepts `--disable-lto` (no, that is not present in the `--help` output), but evidently this option does not do what it implies: I still see rustc threads during the build which set their name to a string containing ""lto"". </p><p>So...

When I did, I noticed that none of my passwords, bookmarks, and such had transferred over. I tried hitting the 'Sync Now' button in the settings, but nothing happened. I then checked my phone as I had Firefox installed on it, and all my data was still there, and tried hitting the sync button, but nothing happened, the button just highlighted every time I hit it. </p><p>Going through the 'connect devices' route in the desktop settings, it popped up a qr code for me to scan, but the steps it outlined didn't make sense as there was no 'sync and save data' button to hit, as apparently with a recent update they removed that and folded it into the account menu - the same 'Sync' button I had tried fruitlessly before. I also noticed that no matter how many times I hit the button, it just said 'Updated 1 hour ago', indicating it was not actually syncing. Even when I changed the device name on my phone to 'Firefox Mobile' and then hit sync, my passwords and bookmarks didn't copy over, only the new name it seemed. </p><p>I then tried uninstalling Firefox from my phone and reinstalling it, and this time the option to scan came up during the install, but now my phone doesn't have any of the data I had been trying to recover. Additionally, in my Mozilla Account page it shows the desktop app, the new phone install of Firefox as 'Firefox on samsung SM-S921W', and the original 'Firefox Mobile', which presumably still has all the data I have been trying to recover with no success. </p><p>Please help me get my data back, I need my bookmarks and passwords primarily and believe they may be locked onto the 'Firefox Mobile' device, if they are stored anywhere at all. Even if there's an older partition of my bookmarks and passwords from a week past or some such that could be recovered would be greatly appreciated. Additionally I would greatly appreciate if you could make the Sync feature actually functional, as this has been rather stressful and aggravating - that data has been collecting over the past ten years, minimum, and some of it is rather critical. </p><p>Thank you for your time. </p>",firefox-14004;firefox-1400;windows-11;firefox;recover-data;,firefox,recover-data,en-US,"",Vivienne_G.
