But now Firefox downloads the image preview that I use to enable the drag&amp;drop with into a temp folder, giving it a serial name. Is there any setting to revert back to the old behaviour? And if, not can you implement one please? </p><p>Regards, Åke Samuelson </p>",firefox-14402;firefox-1440;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;downloads;,firefox,downloads,en-US,"",ake.samuelson
