I implemented the new profiles feature a few days ago, and have three profiles.  The issue is that my main profile, every time I reboot my computer/open firefox forgets all my logins.

This is happening on sites even when I have clicked 'keep me logged in'. There is no site/login that is unaffected - it seems to reset my login status I want to reiterate this is all happening on the same profile - this is not an issue of logins not carrying between different profiles The only other setting I changed is auto-storing passwords on firefox [It had saved my master password accidentally, so.] But there were very few passwords actually stored there, and those sites worked before.
