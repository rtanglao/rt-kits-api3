(Unless I'm missing something?) Prior to this UI update, I was able to fully navigate the drop-down and select my custom search engine of choice using only my arrow keys and enter key. Now, the ""search with XYZ"" button that pops up if you type the site name is only selectable if you click on it, and cannot be highlighted with the arrow keys. </p><p>I am not personally disabled in a way that prevents me from using my trackpad, but having to stop what I'm typing and go out of my way to click on various UI elements is a real stymie in terms of flow, ease of use, and efficiency. At least for me. </p><p>Is there some kind of secret key combo I can use? Or an about:config setting to enable keyboard navigation in custom searches? Is it a bug? Or simply the removal of a feature? </p><p>I hope I will be able to use my arrow keys to select my search engine again in the future— Thanks </p>",firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,1745374;,eiedail
