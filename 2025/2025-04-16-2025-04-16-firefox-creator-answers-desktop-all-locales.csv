This allowed a suppied password, which was the same as before. ?","<p>My issue is that if I access the upper right corner of the screen, titled ""Open Application Menu"" and go to Settings I'm told my Browser is not the default AFTER THE PROCESS OF JUST MAKING IT THE DEFAULT. </p><p>It seems there is an effort to try and drive all of us nuts. This never happened before, and if it continues it will be the end of electronic communications (which it is suspected is the plan by those who engage in violence to achieve their objectives). </p><p>What I came here for was to have my settings, after the process (done many times previously) show a response in Settings that, ""Yes"" my browser (Firefox) is the default, which it did for a time today. Obviously there is no persistence. </p><p>When I got help on this issue previously, my response was I already tried that, and it didn't work. There used to be a lot of different browsers. Now I haven't come across any of them currently. Some are having great success in seeing to it that only their browser will survive. That seems like a ""gangland"" type of mentality to me.<a href=""http://example.com"" rel=""nofollow"">link text</a> I believe I spent enough of my time on this issue and explained it in detail. There's really nothing else I can ""contribute"". </p><p>I, by the way, went to my Internet provider today who found an email under Preferences that she said had the capability to steel my emails. It had an extension in Australia (*.AU). If that has anything to do with this problem I'd like to buy a pair of handcuffs to see if that individual(s) being constrained from using a PC keyboard is a cure for this problem. </p>",windows11;firefox-13702;firefox-1370;firefox;download-and-save;,firefox,download-and-save,en-US,"",MozillaFirefoxNewbie

Several months ago (January or February, maybe?) I had to delete Firefox from my laptop and reinstall it to fix an issue. No big deal. However, whenever I check my synced tabs on my mobile device, it still shows the tabs from before I uninstalled it on my laptop as well as the taps currently opened on my laptop. It appears as if they're two separate devices. I already checked the ""Connected Services"" section of my account settings, and my laptop does not appear twice. I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction of how to remove the previous version of Firefox from appearing on sync on my mobile device.
