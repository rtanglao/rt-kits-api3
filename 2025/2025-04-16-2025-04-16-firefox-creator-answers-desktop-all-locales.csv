Several months ago (January or February, maybe?) I had to delete Firefox from my laptop and reinstall it to fix an issue. No big deal. However, whenever I check my synced tabs on my mobile device, it still shows the tabs from before I uninstalled it on my laptop as well as the taps currently opened on my laptop. It appears as if they're two separate devices. I already checked the ""Connected Services"" section of my account settings, and my laptop does not appear twice. I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction of how to remove the previous version of Firefox from appearing on sync on my mobile device. TIA for any help! </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",galaxyacerose
