Suddenly tonight, Microsoft Edge became my default.  When I go into Windows Settings and try to change back to Firefox, Windows offers me only Microsoft browsers as alternatives (or offers to let me into the Microsoft Store): Windows Edge or Internet Explorer. </p><p>The Control Panel / Settings page ""Set Default Apps"" is the only way that I know that Windows lets users set default browsers, but it suddenly seems to be restricting me to only MS browsers. </p><p>Firefox works normally in every other way, but warns me now every time I launch it that I have a different default browser.  When I click the button in the warning (or in Firefox's Tools / Settings) I just get put back to the Windows ""Set Default Apps"" page, which, again, only lets me choose Microsoft browsers. </p><p>What could have happened?  I haven't altered my Firefox configuration or installed extensions or plug-ins in a long time.  If I uninstall &amp; reinnstall Firefox, will I lose my many configuration &amp; interface settings and will I have to reinstall all my extensions -- or will the reinstalled Firefox remember its existing configuration?  Or would that probably not help at all. </p><p>I'm very computer-savvy, but have run out of ideas.  Can you help?? </p><p>DJL </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",donlabzd
