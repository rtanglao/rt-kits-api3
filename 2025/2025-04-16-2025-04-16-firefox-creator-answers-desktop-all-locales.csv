I sync all of items that can be synced and this has served me well for many years. What happened: </p> <ol><li> I logged on the admin account of a Mac where I previously logged in before and used Firefox with sync enabled. The machine had the initial Firefox short cuts: AP, Amazon, etc. </li><li> I enabled sync and did a 2FA but the my normal Firefox home page did not appear. So pressed the Sync now button to no effect. </li><li> When Firefox started, I did see the usual message that ""It looks like you haven't started Firefox in a while. Would you like to refresh Firefox."" I think that I closed that message but I could have accidentally refreshed Firefox for that account on that system. </li><li> I gave up and did what I needed to, closed Firefox, and logged out.  </li><li> That evening when I was using Firefox on a Windows machine I could see that the sync information reduced to almost nothing from before the last day. The day I saw the saw the same and started to worry. </li><li> However, the Firefox on my main two Macs still had all the data. As a test, I deliberately closed Firefox on one of those two Macs. When I restarted, the synced data was wiped. This leads me to believe that somehow Mozilla's servers are holding the data based for the almost empty content of Firefox that I had on the administrative account that I synced. </li></ol> <p>So in other words rather than importing my data from Firefox when I connected sync, sync exported the settings of the Firefox account I was using in the admin account. I am writing this from my other main Mac which still has full information and I would like to force the synced information on this Mac to override or at least merge with what is on the Mozilla servers. Can this be done? I am 99% sure that if I close Firefox on this machine all my settings will be wiped. For now a I believe that I still have the correct sync data on at least this Mac, my iPhone, and few other Windows and Linux machines. I am in particular worried about losing the hundreds of passwords that I have saved. I forgot to check if the passwords were overwritten when I restarted the first Mac but I'll bet they were. </p><p>Thanks for any help... </p><p>Fred </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,1726092;,fredluehring

Several months ago (January or February, maybe?) I had to delete Firefox from my laptop and reinstall it to fix an issue. No big deal. However, whenever I check my synced tabs on my mobile device, it still shows the tabs from before I uninstalled it on my laptop as well as the taps currently opened on my laptop. It appears as if they're two separate devices. I already checked the ""Connected Services"" section of my account settings, and my laptop does not appear twice. I was hoping someone could point me in the right direction of how to remove the previous version of Firefox from appearing on sync on my mobile device. TIA for any help! </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,1726093;,galaxyacerose
