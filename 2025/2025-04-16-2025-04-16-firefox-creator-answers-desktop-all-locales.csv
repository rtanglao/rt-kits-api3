Since then, I can only load a certain, variable number of tabs and/or pages without every new or reactivated tab or page claiming to have crashed (although about:crashes says that no reports have been submitted). Restoring those pages seems impossible without restarting Firefox or the whole computer. The problem persists in Troubleshoot mode, but as far as I can tell doesn't affect Chrome, although that used even more RAM. I've tried culling open tabs (of which I still probably have far too many, but it's never been an issue before), using the OneTab extension to reduce them to lists of URLs, disabling and re-enabling hardware acceleration, updating Firefox, checking for file corruption and RAM errors and even uninstalling and reinstalling the program, but nothing's worked so far.

For many years other translation tools have been fairly good at detecting source language.

I sync all of items that can be synced and this has served me well for many years. What happened: </p> <ol><li> I logged on the admin account of a Mac where I previously logged in before and used Firefox with sync enabled. The machine had the initial Firefox short cuts: AP, Amazon, etc. </li><li> I enabled sync and did a 2FA but the my normal Firefox home page did not appear. So pressed the Sync now button to no effect. </li><li> When Firefox started, I did see the usual message that ""It looks like you haven't started Firefox in a while. Would you like to refresh Firefox."" I think that I closed that message but I could have accidentally refreshed Firefox for that account on that system. </li><li> I gave up and did what I needed to, closed Firefox, and logged out.  </li><li> That evening when I was using Firefox on a Windows machine I could see that the sync information reduced to almost nothing from before the last day. The day I saw the saw the same and started to worry. </li><li> However, the Firefox on my main two Macs still had all the data. As a test, I deliberately closed Firefox on one of those two Macs. When I restarted, the synced data was wiped. This leads me to believe that somehow Mozilla's servers are holding the data based for the almost empty content of Firefox that I had on the administrative account that I synced. </li></ol> <p>So in other words rather than importing my data from Firefox when I connected sync, sync exported the settings of the Firefox account I was using in the admin account. I am writing this from my other main Mac which still has full information and I would like to force the synced information on this Mac to override or at least merge with what is on the Mozilla servers. Can this be done? I am 99% sure that if I close Firefox on this machine all my settings will be wiped. For now a I believe that I still have the correct sync data on at least this Mac, my iPhone, and few other Windows and Linux machines. I am in particular worried about losing the hundreds of passwords that I have saved. I forgot to check if the passwords were overwritten when I restarted the first Mac but I'll bet they were. </p><p>Thanks for any help... </p><p>Fred </p>",firefox;sync-data;,firefox,sync-data,en-US,1726092;,fredluehring

While typing, a dark overlay or block appears behind the current word or text I'm typing, which makes it very hard to read. It looks like some kind of highlight or shadow, possibly related to spellcheck or text recognition. </p><p>This issue occurs across different websites and makes it uncomfortable to type for long periods. I'm currently using Firefox [137.0.2] on Windows 10. </p><p>I've attached a screenshot that shows the problem clearly. </p><p>Things I've tried so far: - Disabling spellcheck - Changing themes - Disabling extensions - Testing in private window </p><p>None of these solved the issue. </p><p>Notably, switching to the **light theme** makes the issue disappear — the text input background becomes clear and easy to read again. However, I prefer to use the **dark theme**, so I’m looking for a solution that works in dark mode as well. </p><p>Can anyone help identify what's causing this or suggest a way to disable this effect while keeping the dark theme? </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",firefox;browser-appearance;seg-bug-performance-issue;,firefox,browser-appearance,en-US,"",peacepiece
