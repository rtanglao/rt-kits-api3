Every 7 to 9 seconds while playing my game I get kicked to the task bar and it stops responding for a few seconds and when I click to put it back on my screen and again 7 or 9 seconds I have to repeat the same thing. Bottom line is the gaming program keeps starting and stopping for a few second. This is the only program doing this. This started doing this on June 28 2025 after a new Firefox update.  I played this same game on Google and it worked just fine. </p>,firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",jdcron

I am using the default (horizontal) tab group layout. Because I have a lot of tabs in the window, I collapse each existing tab group and sort tabs between tab groups. </p><p>I can move a tab into an expanded tab group with drag and drop. But I tried dragging and dropping a tab onto a collapsed tab group, even holding it over the collapsed tab group to see if that would work. Nothing seems to register, is it possible? </p><p>I would like to move a tab by drag and drop without expanding the collapsed tab group and move the window focus to the next tab. This would save time when I am organizing tabs! </p><p>The alternative is to Add a tab to a collapsed tab group, which also expands it and consumes horizontal real estate, forcing me to scroll (further) to return where I was organizing tabs. So I collapse the newly expanded tab group, scroll back to the next tab I want to organize into a different tab group, and repeat but this causes a lot of scrolling navigation to my workflow. It makes complete sense and I really like using menu navigation to add tabs to a specific group because it is discreet and I wish I could move tabs with the same method. </p><p>I searched Settings &gt; Tabs and then about:config for browser.tabs.groups.* (and then every preference with tab in it) and couldn't find anything that made sense to me. </p><p>Thank you for any help! </p>",firefox;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1745649;1745652;,drummer_nrg

I tried the UFO Test as well but there I was getting 100Hz but whenever I visited any website (say LinkedIn or even Youtube) the page seem very very laggy and it made me switch back to Chrome (Honestly I wanted to stay on Zen only) but the problem forced me to switch back.

I cannot go to various sites or login to Gmail, as Firefox either will not let me, or will only after I press the ""advanced"" button, and then click on ""accept the risk &amp; continue."" I am getting a confusing error screen, have  x2 screenshots showing it, &amp; would like to fix this. But how? I cannot tell if the issue is due to a security certificate, or a misconfiguration. It says to check my PC's clock, which is fine. It seems all websites are misconfigured now or so it says. Is anyone familar with this, please? I'm typing this on my S24 because I can't from my PC. I have an HP Windows 11 laptop. This did not happen until today, when the update went through. Thank you. I have tried to download both pictures, but this site is not letting both download. Hopefully they will, eventually. </p>",android;firefox-1400;firefox;web-certificates;,firefox,web-certificates,en-US,"",eladamick
