I've begun to encounter an error in handling a login process that requires a Yubikey.  Prior to the update if I logged into google or github, after the password prompt those services would request that I insert my security key, and then Firefox would offer a pop-up requesting that I touch my key.  Now the behavior is that Firefox doesn't offer a prompt at the security key request screen, instead it seems that something happens immediately and automatically without my ever even entering the physical key into the USB port.  Google/github then report that there has been an error in the sign in process without any input from me. </p><p>To troubleshoot I entered ""Troubleshoot mode.."" and tried signing in again with the same results.  I've restarted my machine as well. </p><p>Ultimately, I've been able to get around this error to access my services by using alternate means of authentication.  However I can't anticipate that this will be the case for all of my services. </p><p>Can anyone help me troubleshoot?

The reason it's so frustrating is the captcha keeps going through multiple pictures, even though the captured screens are accurate for the requested pics.

I tried the UFO Test as well but there I was getting 100Hz but whenever I visited any website (say LinkedIn or even Youtube) the page seem very very laggy and it made me switch back to Chrome (Honestly I wanted to stay on Zen only) but the problem forced me to switch back.

I cannot go to various sites or login to Gmail, as Firefox either will not let me, or will only after I press the ""advanced"" button, and then click on ""accept the risk &amp; continue."" I am getting a confusing error screen, have  x2 screenshots showing it, &amp; would like to fix this. But how? I cannot tell if the issue is due to a security certificate, or a misconfiguration. It says to check my PC's clock, which is fine. It seems all websites are misconfigured now or so it says. Is anyone familar with this, please? I'm typing this on my S24 because I can't from my PC. I have an HP Windows 11 laptop. This did not happen until today, when the update went through. Thank you. I have tried to download both pictures, but this site is not letting both download. Hopefully they will, eventually. </p>",android;firefox-1400;firefox;web-certificates;,firefox,web-certificates,en-US,"",eladamick
