Although I really loved the fresh vibe of the Browser in comparison to what I was accustomed of which is Chrome. But after some initial hassle of setting up the browser I figured one thing that although I have a 100Hz external monitor and a 90Hz Panel on the Laptop the Webpages while scrolling it felt that it was somewhere 45-60Hz. I tried the UFO Test as well but there I was getting 100Hz but whenever I visited any website (say LinkedIn or even Youtube) the page seem very very laggy and it made me switch back to Chrome (Honestly I wanted to stay on Zen only) but the problem forced me to switch back. I understand that the browser is still in its Beta Phase but still the experience I had it was not good. Hope I can get some resolution and hop back to Zen as I really want to.  </p><p>PS - I have tried all the fixes from reddit pages, Hardware Acceleration, Smooth Scrolling, etc. none works. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",panigrahi0702
