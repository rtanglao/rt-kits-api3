Although I really loved the fresh vibe of the Browser in comparison to what I was accustomed of which is Chrome. But after some initial hassle of setting up the browser I figured one thing that although I have a 100Hz external monitor and a 90Hz Panel on the Laptop the Webpages while scrolling it felt that it was somewhere 45-60Hz. I tried the UFO Test as well but there I was getting 100Hz but whenever I visited any website (say LinkedIn or even Youtube) the page seem very very laggy and it made me switch back to Chrome (Honestly I wanted to stay on Zen only) but the problem forced me to switch back. I understand that the browser is still in its Beta Phase but still the experience I had it was not good. Hope I can get some resolution and hop back to Zen as I really want to.  </p><p>PS - I have tried all the fixes from reddit pages, Hardware Acceleration, Smooth Scrolling, etc. none works. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",panigrahi0702

I cannot go to various sites or login to Gmail, as Firefox either will not let me, or will only after I press the ""advanced"" button, and then click on ""accept the risk &amp; continue."" I am getting a confusing error screen, have  x2 screenshots showing it, &amp; would like to fix this. But how? I cannot tell if the issue is due to a security certificate, or a misconfiguration. It says to check my PC's clock, which is fine. It seems all websites are misconfigured now or so it says. Is anyone familar with this, please? I'm typing this on my S24 because I can't from my PC. I have an HP Windows 11 laptop. This did not happen until today, when the update went through. Thank you. I have tried to download both pictures, but this site is not letting both download.
