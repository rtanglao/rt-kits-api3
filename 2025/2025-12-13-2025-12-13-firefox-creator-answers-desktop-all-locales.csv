The only way out of this is to refresh the pdf (after saving otherwise all changes will be lost) and then starting all over again only for the error to repeat itself making the editor almost unusable.  Would really appreciate knowing how to work around this especially since to make my notes clearer, I change the color and the font size which is all lost everytime I have to refresh the PDF&nbsp;:-(  </p><p>Incidentally, why are there so many updates?

I waited about 15 minutes, but still no download. I closed the window. Next, I tried the menu option: ""Help-&gt;About Firefox"".  ""About"" screen came up. I clicked the button ""update to 146.0"".

Yes, I did close and restart Firefox, I even rebooted the devices, and tried again. Same problem. </p><p>Now while my workaround (see below) helped, there is still the question of the update process failing in the first place. For me, that brings up two pressing issues at least: 1. Has anyone external tampered with the update process, maybe with malicious intent? It has happened to several software distributors, most recently the guy behind Notepad ++. 2. What happened to people relying on automatic (i.e. not prompting) updates? Did they even notice they were not being updated?  </p><p>Not a solution, but a workaround: I synced all my setting to my Firefox-account (worked just fine, no problems), downloaded the newest installer, installed the new version on top of the old (worked like a charm), started new version, all just fine.

They handle passwords, payments, private conversations, and sensitive data every single day. With rising cyber threats and smarter tracking methods, choosing a safe browser matters more than ever. In 2025, many users are comparing Mozilla Firefox with the newer Comet AI Browser, asking a simple but important question: which one is actually safer? Let’s break this down clearly, honestly, and without hype. </p><p><strong>Why Browser Safety Matters More Than Ever</strong> Every click you make leaves a digital footprint. Browsers sit at the center of that activity, deciding what data gets shared, blocked, or stored. A secure browser protects you from trackers, malicious scripts, phishing attempts, and silent background data collection. A weak one exposes you without you even realizing it. That’s why comparing Firefox and Comet AI isn’t just a tech debate, it’s a privacy decision. </p><p><strong>Overview of Mozilla Firefox</strong> Mozilla Firefox has been around for decades and is built by Mozilla, a non-profit organization focused on internet privacy and openness. Unlike many competitors, Firefox does not rely on selling user data or aggressive advertising models. Its open-source nature allows security researchers worldwide to inspect its code, identify vulnerabilities, and fix issues quickly. Over the years, Firefox has earned a reputation as one of the most privacy-respecting browsers available. </p><p><strong>Overview of Comet AI Browser</strong> Comet AI Browser is a newer entrant designed around artificial intelligence. It focuses on smart search, AI-powered summaries, automated browsing assistance, and predictive user behavior features. While these features can improve convenience and productivity, they also raise serious questions about how much user data is collected, processed, and stored. Since Comet AI is relatively new, its long-term security practices are still being evaluated. </p><p><strong>Security Architecture Comparison</strong> Firefox uses a hardened security architecture with sandboxing, site isolation, and frequent security patches. It separates processes to prevent malicious sites from accessing sensitive system resources. Comet AI also claims sandboxing and encryption, but because much of its AI processing depends on cloud-based analysis, data often leaves the local device, increasing exposure risk if not handled properly. </p><p><strong>Privacy and Data Collection Policies</strong> Firefox is extremely transparent about what data it collects, and most of it can be disabled. Telemetry is optional, tracking protection is enabled by default, and enhanced privacy modes block fingerprinting, cryptominers, and cross-site trackers. Comet AI, on the other hand, relies heavily on user interaction data to improve its AI models. While it may anonymize data, the collection itself introduces a larger privacy surface. </p><p><strong>Built-In Protection Features</strong> Firefox includes Enhanced Tracking Protection, HTTPS-only mode, DNS over HTTPS, and regular security updates. These features work quietly in the background without requiring user intervention. Comet AI focuses more on intelligent browsing assistance than defensive security layers. While it may warn users about suspicious sites, its protection mechanisms are not yet as mature or widely audited as Firefox’s. </p><p><strong>Real-World Risk Scenario</strong> Imagine you go to a website to <a href=""https://a-apkdownload.com"" rel=""nofollow"">download apk</a>, a hacker puts a secret malicious script inside the page that quietly tries to track keystrokes and browser behavior in the background without showing any warning. In this situation, Firefox’s strict script isolation and tracking protection significantly reduce the chance of silent execution, while an AI-driven browser that prioritizes content analysis may still process parts of that page before blocking it. </p><p><strong>Update Frequency and Vulnerability Response</strong> Firefox releases frequent security updates, often responding to vulnerabilities within days. Because it is open-source, issues are publicly disclosed and patched transparently. Comet AI updates less predictably, and because much of its backend is proprietary, users must trust the company’s internal security audits rather than independent verification. </p><p><strong>Extension and Add-on Safety</strong> Firefox has one of the most carefully moderated extension ecosystems. Add-ons go through review processes and permission checks. Users can also limit extension access per site. Comet AI currently supports fewer extensions, which limits attack vectors but also reduces user control over security customization. </p><p><strong>AI Convenience vs Security Control</strong> Comet AI shines when it comes to automation, summaries, and smart assistance. However, AI convenience often trades off with privacy because models require behavioral data. Firefox intentionally avoids deep AI profiling, choosing instead to give users full control over what information leaves their device. If safety is your priority, control matters more than automation. </p><p><strong>Transparency and Trust Factor</strong> Firefox’s long-standing reputation, non-profit mission, and public audits give it a strong trust advantage. Users know how Firefox operates and why it exists. Comet AI, while innovative, is still building trust. Its closed-source components and AI data handling policies need more time and independent review before earning the same confidence level. </p><p><strong>Performance vs Protection Balance</strong> Firefox balances performance and protection efficiently, offering speed without sacrificing safety. Comet AI may feel smarter in some tasks, but increased background processing can introduce performance overhead and additional attack surfaces. From a pure security perspective, simplicity often equals strength. </p><p><strong>Which Browser Is More Safer Overall?</strong> When safety is measured by transparency, proven defenses, minimal data collection, and fast vulnerability response, Mozilla Firefox clearly comes out ahead. Comet AI Browser may evolve into a safer option in the future, but right now it prioritizes intelligence and convenience over hardened security design. </p><p><strong>Who Should Choose Firefox?</strong> Firefox is ideal for users who value privacy, security, and control over their browsing environment. If you frequently access sensitive accounts, manage online payments, or explore unfamiliar websites, Firefox offers stronger protection by default. </p><p><strong>Who Might Prefer Comet AI Browser?</strong> Comet AI may appeal to users who prioritize AI assistance, smart summaries, and automated browsing workflows, as long as they are comfortable with increased data processing and potential privacy trade-offs. </p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong> In the battle of Mozilla Firefox vs Comet AI Browser, safety is not just about features, it’s about philosophy. Firefox is built around protecting users, while Comet AI is built around enhancing productivity through intelligence. For users who want maximum safety, transparency, and long-term trust, Mozilla Firefox remains the safer choice in 2025. </p><p><strong>FAQs</strong> <strong>Is Firefox safer than AI-based browsers?</strong> Yes, Firefox offers stronger privacy controls and less data collection than most AI-driven browsers. <strong>Does Comet AI collect user data?</strong> Comet AI collects behavioral data to improve AI features, which may increase privacy risks. <strong>Can Firefox block malicious scripts automatically?</strong> Yes, Firefox blocks many malicious scripts through built-in tracking and script protection. <strong>Is Comet AI browser unsafe?</strong> Not unsafe, but it carries higher uncertainty due to limited transparency and newer infrastructure. <strong>Which browser should privacy-focused users choose?</strong> Privacy-focused users should choose Mozilla Firefox for its proven security and transparency. </p>",windows-10;firefox;browser-security;,firefox,browser-security,en-US,"",tasnimanasasl

I figured out how to do that once but I forgot how I did that and can't find it in help. Can someone please tell me how to do that. Mozilla, if you are reading this you might want to improve the support in your Linux version. </p>",firefox-1460;firefox;extensions;,firefox,extensions,en-US,"",Steve7253
