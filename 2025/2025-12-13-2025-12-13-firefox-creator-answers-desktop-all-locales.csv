I tried support but the support in Firefox doesn't seem to have much help for OSes beyond Windows even though they make a native Linux version. I subscribe to several extensions and use Firefox sync to get the extensions onto a new computer but they don't automatically pin to the menu bar. I figured out how to do that once but I forgot how I did that and can't find it in help. Can someone please tell me how to do that.
