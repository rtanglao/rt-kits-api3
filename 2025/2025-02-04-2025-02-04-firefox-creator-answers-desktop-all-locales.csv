I am a college student and my university's course portal, Brightspace (similar to Blackboard or Canvas) offers Zoom meeting recordings as an embedded webpage on its website, calling 3rd party cookies. Up till last semester, Firefox was able to open that. However, maybe because of the latest Firefox, web server, or macOS Sonoma update, this is no longer happening.  </p><p>The webpage is able to be called in Chrome and Safari, but it asks you to redirect to <a href=""http://zoom.us"" rel=""nofollow"">zoom.us</a> instead of directly calling <a href=""http://zoom.us"" rel=""nofollow"">zoom.us</a>. Chrome was able to call <a href=""http://zoom.us"" rel=""nofollow"">zoom.us</a> directly into the website once I enable 3rd part cookies, which makes me think this is a 3rd party cookie issue.  </p><p>NOTE: In the past, Firefox never asked to redirect either, so it seems to me that they updated the webpage security which might be inhibiting Firefox functionality. </p><p>I have tried the following: 1. Redownloading Firefox  2. Using ""Custom"" Protection to allow all cookies 3. Switching off Enhanced Protection on the website  4. Using Firefox on iOS (iPad and iPhone) -&gt; Zoom inside Brightspace will work normally on these two but not my macbook which is weird </p><p>Here are some images attached of what it appears like. The Firefox one is blank; Chrome directly calls the zoom webpage, and Safari redirects with an apt link. But Firefox is simply blank.  </p><p>Please help me figure out whether Firefox is unable to send an appropriate request, Brightspace/Zoom is not allowing that request, or Firefox is unable to load up the website. And what can I do to get the Zoom back on. All suggestions are helpful! Thank you guys so much. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",yadavr1
