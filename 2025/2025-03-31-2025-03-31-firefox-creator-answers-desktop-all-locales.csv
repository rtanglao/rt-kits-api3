For almost two weeks, every Fandom site I've visited looks different from normal. There's no sidebar, which is one less annoyance factor from Fandom, but other things I've noticed that aren't usable are expandable sections and some categorizing features. Specifically, the Yu-Gi-Oh! Fandom had expandable boxes with some card details and these are now white space, and the Duel Masters Fandom had a list of categories each card belonged to near the top of each entry, which seems to be missing. It seems like a Firefox-specific thing because I checked a couple of sites with Chrome and they looked normal, but I wouldn't want to view them regularly with Chrome because it discourages adblockers and Fandom's ads are dire. I haven't tried any other browsers. Once I started checking what version of Firefox I had during this time I've seen that the problem exists on 136.0.3 and 136.0.4.
