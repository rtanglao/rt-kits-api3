This has of course happened before, so I restarted, but that didn't help. So then I have to restore all the pages myself, boring. BUT, when firefox doesn't remember any of my usual pages, I'm starting to worry. Then I think I want to update Firefox, and that's when I discover my main problem.....I can't access the menu in the three symbols at the top right (shown in the picture/attachment). I can't open my profile, can't open extensions, can't download anything or open the downloads icon, and most importantly, CAN NOT open the ""Open application menu"" (the icon with three horizontal lines), so THEN I have a big problem. The menu bar and everything there is available, but without access to ""Open application menu"" I can't reinstall Firefox. I can't save bookmarks either, or see if the bookmarks are in a backup or something. So, I don't dare delete firefox, then reinstall it, without knowing if I'll find my bookmarks again. I've tried saving them to a file, but I've never heard of a JSON file, and I don't know how to process it. I should also add that I deleted all my AVAST anti virus programs and files two days ago. And I have found out that I do have the latest firefox update. Hope someone can help me or give me some tips. I'm not particularly computer savvy either, just so you know. And I'm norwegian&nbsp;:) Thanx, Bendik. </p>",firefox-1420;windows-10;firefox;app-responsiveness;,firefox,app-responsiveness,en-US,"",bengalakk
