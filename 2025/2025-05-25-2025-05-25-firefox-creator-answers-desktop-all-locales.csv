By not working, i mean neither Super Resolution neither HDR enhancements work at all, not even the badge shows up, and the NVIDIA app reports the status as ""inactive"". The video is not upscaled, and the content isn't getting put into HDR. It is on globally on my system, and does work on all the chromium based browsers installed on my system, even on the discord app itself. </p><p>I tried a latest firefox fresh install, with youtube playback, or just opening a video file directly with the browser. This worked on chromium browsers, but not on firefox. </p><p>I'm on windows 10 64bit with a 3060 gpu. (the only gpu in the system.) I have 4 monitors connected, but still get the same issue with only one. Hardware decoding is force enabled, and about:support reports that hardware decoding is supported for H264, VP8, VP9 and AV1 too. I even get the same amount of video-decode usage in task manager on both chromium and firefox while video is playing. </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",lenr0k.mail

When one of these websites is accessed for the first time, a second tab opens and quickly closes, as if a popup was blocked. One way I can observe this behaviour is that the NoScript extension will detect script for that website on ALL tabs, even blank ones, with the ""(sidebar?)"" annotation. With Youtube I managed to prevent this by disabling Service Workers in about:config, but for example with <a href=""http://tenor.com"" rel=""nofollow"">tenor.com</a> the behaviour continues to occur even then. </p><p>Websites I observed this behaviour on so far: <a href=""http://youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com</a> (until Service Workers were disabled) <a href=""http://tenor.com"" rel=""nofollow"">tenor.com</a> nami.news </p><p>Is this a bug? I have also observed the same behaviour on a different PC for Youtube until I disabled Service Workers on that installation. What should I do? </p>",firefox-13804;firefox-1380;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",Clovers
