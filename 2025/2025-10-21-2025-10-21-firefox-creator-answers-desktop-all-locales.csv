However, if I use any other device the website address works fine. I looked to see if I have the website blocked, but cannot find where to do that in Firefox. I know I have not blocked this website address. Can you help give me some suggestions?

Typically, the settings gear is supposed to be situated near the bottom of bar. However, as demonstrated in the attached image, it is at the top near the bookmarks and history buttons. I have tried reinstalling the browser from scratch, turning the sidebar on and off, turning vertical tabs on and off, and even getting rid of my custom CSS theme for a time. None of these have worked. If anyone knows what the root of this issue is, I'd really appreciate the help. </p>",firefox-1450;beta;windows-11;firefox;browser-appearance;,firefox,browser-appearance,en-US,"",medievalpsx
