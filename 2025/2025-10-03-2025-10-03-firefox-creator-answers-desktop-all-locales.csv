My mouse works fine with Chrome but with Firefox there are frequent long delays (60-120 sec.) when moving from one web site to another. The mouse just freezes up and I have to struggle to close Firefox. No problem with the mouse with Chrome, but I prefer Firefox and its features.

They are as follows: </p><p>- Discord. When I have Discord open, and then I click another tab, when I go back to Discord the whole screen is black. When I refresh it it's fine, but I have to do this repeatedly each time I go to another tab. </p><p>- PDFs. I use Blackboard for my college assignments, and Firefox no longer allows me to open PDFs that teachers post- I just get a blank page when I click on one. </p><p>- Black images. Most images show fine, but with some websites (for eg. home depot) the image of the product is black. </p><p>I've cleared history, cache, cookies, disabled extensions, and still no dice.
