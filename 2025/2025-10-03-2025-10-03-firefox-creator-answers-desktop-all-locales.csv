I did an update recently but I still have all of my bookmarks, that's not the problem.  The problem is, although the space for the bookmarks toolbar appears when I click ""always show"" (and disapears when I select ""never show""), I see nothing.  Nothing shows up in this space and so I have to go menu diving to get to my bookmarks.  Do you have an idea how to fix this? </p>",firefox-14303;firefox-1430;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",phil.cassel
