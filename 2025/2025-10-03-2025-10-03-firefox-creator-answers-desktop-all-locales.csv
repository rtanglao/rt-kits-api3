They are as follows: </p><p>- Discord. When I have Discord open, and then I click another tab, when I go back to Discord the whole screen is black. When I refresh it it's fine, but I have to do this repeatedly each time I go to another tab. </p><p>- PDFs. I use Blackboard for my college assignments, and Firefox no longer allows me to open PDFs that teachers post- I just get a blank page when I click on one. </p><p>- Black images. Most images show fine, but with some websites (for eg. home depot) the image of the product is black. </p><p>I've cleared history, cache, cookies, disabled extensions, and still no dice. Not sure what happened/how to solve this&nbsp;:( </p><p>Thanks for any help! zoe </p>",firefox-1430;windows-10;firefox;site-breakages;,firefox,site-breakages,en-US,"",custard9

I tried to change it according to the directions I found earlier, but the only drop-down for my city was another city in the US but none in any other countries. So now I can't change my location. How do I change my location? It wasn't like this yesterday and I have no memory as to how it became ""Portland, Oregon"" since last night. I don't even have a VPN so it isn't that.
