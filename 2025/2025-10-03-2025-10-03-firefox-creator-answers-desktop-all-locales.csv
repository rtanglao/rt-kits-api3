When I selected to option to be shown what to do, this page was replaced with other which deleted all this text, and now I am entering it all in again, which is severely frustrating. On a page where the user has entered possibly a volume of information, there should not be any sloppy risk of deleting that information due to page mishandling.

Since switching over in 2010 from Windows to Linux I have never had protection of any kind and unlike Windows have never had a single problem. In addition when I was using Windows the protection that I had was never McAfee. I suspect that these warnings are not from Firefox given the misprints, spelling errors and the poor English.
