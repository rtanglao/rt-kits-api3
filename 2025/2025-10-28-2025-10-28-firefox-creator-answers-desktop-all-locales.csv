As I am a retired head of IT, I closed internet and uninstalled Firefox. I then scanned my Pc with 3 different antivirus packages, My default installed is Sophos. Then there  is teh standard MS , plus I installed ESET. All cleared my machine with no issues. I then re- installed Firefox, , it picked up my data and the virus message popped up again. I immediately uninstalled it again. I use REVO to uninstall, which scans for left overs, which I delete as well. Now I HAVE TO ASSUME that Revo is NOT clearing ALL FIREFOX files/data off my PC. Please advise where it is and how I can delete it completely, which is causing the messages to pop up again as soon as i install Firefox. </p>",windows-10;firefox;browser-security;,firefox,browser-security,en-US,"",selwyn1957
