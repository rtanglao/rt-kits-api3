Fine, whatever. Seemed like they didn't download, then they did. I deleted them afterwards. Now whenever I open Firefox (and it's not running in another window) I get a popup showing the program downloads and warning, as if I just tried to download them. I deleted them from history, but still get the popup, so they keep showing in my download history. I've tried ALL the usual fixes in Settings, looked for the files stored in Mozilla folders, rebooted and restarted the modem, no luck. Maybe it's a Windows Defender update causing this. How to stop this annoyance? </p>",firefox-1410;windows-10;firefox;downloads;,firefox,downloads,en-US,"",spiritgumm1
