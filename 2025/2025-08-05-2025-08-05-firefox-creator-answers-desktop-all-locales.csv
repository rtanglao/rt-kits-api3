Since version 141.0 the translate button no longer appears in the navigation bar, whereas the pop-up has been fixed with 141.0.1. This then forces you to press the 3 dots-translate or activate the pop-up. 2. Since version 141.0.1 if I press and hold on the app icon on the phone's home screen and press incognito navigation it is firefox in incognito navigation but shows the shortcut panes. That would also be nice but if I click on a pane the site is opened flowers from incognito 3. Since version 141.0 it often happens to me in both Wi-Fi and 4g that the sites don't carinacate, a white screen remains. As soon as I tap or scroll on the screen the website is shown loaded away 4. With all versions the reddit site is not recognised for automatic translation. Probably because it detects the interface in the system language but the content of the posts is in English. I then have to open the translation manually and set the original language to English and the site is translated correctly </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,it,1754204;,gabrielegobbo15+mozzilla
