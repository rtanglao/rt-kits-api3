It was probably some minor issue and I know sometimes my computer will open two of the same app simultaneously for games and stuff. However, here is where the issue begins. So, I, for some reason, moved the Firefox that was closed and at its normal position on the doc into the trash can and I moved the Firefox that was newly opened from the position right of the divider into the place where the original Firefox was. I then emptied the trash can. Later that day, I opened up Firefox as I usually would and went to check my saved tab groups and there was absolutely nothing there. I went on a few forums and listened to directions and input code into the Firefox console and still nothing turned up and nothing worked. It seems as though my extremely important and crucial saved tab groups are unrecoverable. </p><p>I would like to know what happened and how to recover my saved tab groups if possible.
