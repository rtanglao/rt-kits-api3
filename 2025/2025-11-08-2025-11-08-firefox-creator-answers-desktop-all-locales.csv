I made a screenshot of my standard pinned tabs so I can restore it from that, which is a nuisance in itself. But the tab groups are gone forever along with the urls I painstakingly researched. I read the answers to two previous queries along these lines, both of which gave extensive, tedious procedures to recover them. I'm not willing to go through all that just to use Firefox. I've switched my tab groups to Edge just to keep them safe and although I prefer not to be captured by Google or Microsoft, am thinking about just switching to either of them.  </p><p>Over the last couple of updates, FF has seemed less and less stable.

The computer itself worked fine, but the screen needed to be replaced. Stupidly, I went to the Bestbuy I bought it from to use the warranty for repair. They sent it out, I just got it back, and it says they replaced my motherboard for whatever reason. My downloads and such back up automatically, but because I didn't expect them to do something so drastic, I neglected to create a backup key for my tabs and bookmarks. Obviously, they're all gone now. Is there any way I could possibly get any of this back, or am I screwed out of luck because those morons made a drastic decision that did not need to be made? I'll apologize ahead of time for my lack of technical know-how. </p><p>Thanks </p>",firefox-14402;firefox-1440;windows-11;firefox;recover-data;,firefox,recover-data,en-US,"",Bolsh44
