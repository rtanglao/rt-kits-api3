It's taken me days to track this one down, but deleting the file `~/.mozilla/firefox/&lt;profile&gt;/extensions/newtab@mozilla.org.xpi` enabled me to load my session again without having to copy-paste tons of tab URLs or reinstall and reconfigure all my extensions, etc. </p><p>Would have been a nightmare, and after the debacle with Exposé wiping nearly 1000 open tabs, I've never quite trusted Firefox. Since then Chromium has wiped &gt; 600 _thrice_ though so I'm seriously considering switching back to Firefox... if it can respect my data and stop suggesting a corrupt profile should be fixed by a ""refresh"" (aka ""delete all your data since we treated it poorly""). </p><p>Anyway, the file timestamp is 5 Nov (2 days ago), and correlates with a system update I did around the same time. I'm on Arch Linux which is rolling release, so I might serve as a dead canary to warn that something should get fixed <em>now</em> before it hurts more users. </p>",linux;firefox;extensions;,firefox,extensions,es,"",Iiridayn
