When I rebooted, Firefox loaded my windows but no tabs, and had some very strange graphical glitches. However, it loaded everything in safe mode, then nothing again in normal mode, back and forth. It's taken me days to track this one down, but deleting the file `~/.mozilla/firefox/&lt;profile&gt;/extensions/newtab@mozilla.org.xpi` enabled me to load my session again without having to copy-paste tons of tab URLs or reinstall and reconfigure all my extensions, etc. </p><p>Would have been a nightmare, and after the debacle with Exposé wiping nearly 1000 open tabs, I've never quite trusted Firefox. Since then Chromium has wiped &gt; 600 _thrice_ though so I'm seriously considering switching back to Firefox... if it can respect my data and stop suggesting a corrupt profile should be fixed by a ""refresh"" (aka ""delete all your data since we treated it poorly""). </p><p>Anyway, the file timestamp is 5 Nov (2 days ago), and correlates with a system update I did around the same time. I'm on Arch Linux which is rolling release, so I might serve as a dead canary to warn that something should get fixed <em>now</em> before it hurts more users. </p>",linux;firefox;extensions;,firefox,extensions,es,"",Iiridayn

The computer itself worked fine, but the screen needed to be replaced. Stupidly, I went to the Bestbuy I bought it from to use the warranty for repair. They sent it out, I just got it back, and it says they replaced my motherboard for whatever reason. My downloads and such back up automatically, but because I didn't expect them to do something so drastic, I neglected to create a backup key for my tabs and bookmarks. Obviously, they're all gone now. Is there any way I could possibly get any of this back, or am I screwed out of luck because those morons made a drastic decision that did not need to be made? I'll apologize ahead of time for my lack of technical know-how. </p><p>Thanks </p>",firefox-14402;firefox-1440;windows-11;firefox;recover-data;,firefox,recover-data,en-US,"",Bolsh44
