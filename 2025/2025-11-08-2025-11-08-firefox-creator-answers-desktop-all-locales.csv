The computer itself worked fine, but the screen needed to be replaced. Stupidly, I went to the Bestbuy I bought it from to use the warranty for repair. They sent it out, I just got it back, and it says they replaced my motherboard for whatever reason. My downloads and such back up automatically, but because I didn't expect them to do something so drastic, I neglected to create a backup key for my tabs and bookmarks. Obviously, they're all gone now. Is there any way I could possibly get any of this back, or am I screwed out of luck because those morons made a drastic decision that did not need to be made? I'll apologize ahead of time for my lack of technical know-how. </p><p>Thanks </p>",firefox-14402;firefox-1440;windows-11;firefox;recover-data;,firefox,recover-data,en-US,"",Bolsh44
