My New Tab Favorites Icons now have Push Pins in their upper left corners, leaving less space for the icons, so of course my icons are now smaller than before.  Why do the people maintaining the system at Mozilla keep messing with the New Tabs?  Last time, they thought they needed to include a large image of the Firefox icon, again shrinking the remaining screen real estate for my icons.  That got fixed.  Now they decided each favorite icon needs a rather large push pin to indicate that it belongs there.  Somebody thought this would be a good idea?  Why can't they just leave it alone? </p><p>I'm posting two screenshot images of my New Tab screen.  You will know which is before and which is after. </p>",firefox-13901;firefox-1390;firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,1738285;,Prentice3
