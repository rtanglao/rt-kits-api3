I've looked around online and found people with similar issues, though not that exact fault. At first I was concerned about viruses but I've run multiple virus scans of my computer and there's no other signs I'd associate with one, so I assume it's another variation on that problem. It happens randomly, no specific triggers I can think of. I use three Firefox profiles, and it's happened on two of them. A ton of search results (the attached is just one example, the top results of reddit had this as well) will have seemingly random words replaced like this. This also occured on a page in my university's website. When I try to copy these, they copy as their original words and not the weird symbols. I'm very confused, basically. It doesn't go away on reload, ctrl+shift+r, or cache clearing, but closing and reopening the tab fixes it. </p>",firefox;search-tag-and-share;,firefox,search-tag-and-share,en-US,"",wandasromanovpriv

Last time, they thought they needed to include a large image of the Firefox icon, again shrinking the remaining screen real estate for my icons.  That got fixed.  Now they decided each favorite icon needs a rather large push pin to indicate that it belongs there.  Somebody thought this would be a good idea?
