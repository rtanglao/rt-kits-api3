The Problem Currently, Firefox lacks the ability to translate web pages into Ukrainian. Ukrainian is not available in the list of supported languages for translation, and users have no way to add it manually through browser settings. Why This Matters </p><p>Large user base: Ukrainian is the native language of over 40 million people worldwide Information accessibility: Many Ukrainian users need to translate English and other foreign language content Competitiveness: Other browsers (such as Google Chrome) already support translation into Ukrainian Inclusivity: Adding Ukrainian language would make Firefox more accessible to Ukrainian-speaking users Injustice of current situation: Firefox includes Russian language - the language of an aggressor country that is waging war against Ukraine, bombing civilians, and occupying Ukrainian territories. Meanwhile, the language of the heroic Ukrainian people, who are defending their independence and democratic values, remains unavailable in the browser </p><p>Technical Feasibility Mozilla Firefox uses its own Firefox Translations tool based on machine learning technology. Given that quality machine translation systems for Ukrainian already exist (Google Translate, DeepL, and others), technical implementation of this feature is entirely feasible. Important note: If Firefox already supports Russian language, then adding Ukrainian should not present significant technical challenges, as both languages belong to the Slavic group and have similar linguistic characteristics. This makes the absence of Ukrainian even more puzzling. Our Request We ask you to consider: </p><p>Adding Ukrainian to the list of supported translation languages Ensuring quality translation from major European languages (English, German, French, Spanish, etc.) into Ukrainian Providing the ability to translate from Ukrainian into other languages </p><p>Benefits for Mozilla Adding Ukrainian language support would: </p><p>Expand Firefox's audience in Ukraine and among the Ukrainian diaspora Increase loyalty among existing users Demonstrate Mozilla's commitment to linguistic diversity and inclusivity Strengthen Firefox's market position in the region Show support for democratic values: Adding the language of people defending freedom and democracy would be positively received by the international community Make a morally correct decision: At a time when Ukraine is heroically resisting aggression, supporting the Ukrainian language would be an act of solidarity with the Ukrainian people </p><p>Alternative Solutions If full integration of Ukrainian requires significant resources, please consider: </p><p>Partnering with Ukrainian tech companies to develop a translation module Creating an API for integrating external translation services Adding an option to select external translation services in settings </p><p>Thank you for your attention to this matter and for your work in creating a better internet experience for all users. With respect and hope for a positive decision, useronelex! </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,1738500;1738513;1738519;1738530;,useronelex

It was even possible to specify how many link levels to copy along with the main page. </p><p>when web page sidebars became popular this became problematic for a while since sidebars often linked to ads or unrelated content (Wikipedia or GitHub for example). Then browsers started providing a means to disable webpage sidebars and display only the main page. </p><p>I can't find any of that capability in Firefox. I have searched the settings, extensions, Firefox support pages and found almost nothing related to simply saving web pages. </p><p>I fear that some day the website 'UESPWiiki' which provides support for my favorite game which is now (2025) 19  years old will some day go away.

I've looked around online and found people with similar issues, though not that exact fault. At first I was concerned about viruses but I've run multiple virus scans of my computer and there's no other signs I'd associate with one, so I assume it's another variation on that problem. It happens randomly, no specific triggers I can think of. I use three Firefox profiles, and it's happened on two of them. A ton of search results (the attached is just one example, the top results of reddit had this as well) will have seemingly random words replaced like this. This also occured on a page in my university's website. When I try to copy these, they copy as their original words and not the weird symbols. I'm very confused, basically.
