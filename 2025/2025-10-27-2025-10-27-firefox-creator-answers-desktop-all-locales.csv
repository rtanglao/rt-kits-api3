I just found out the about:memory page in Firefox, which allows the users to manually free up the system memory by clicking the ""Minimize memory usage"" button. This is great and it does its job well, however for many years I've wondered why doesn't the browser clean up the memory taken by web pages like Twitch, Kick, Youtube, etc., which take a lot of memory, especially when people leave them open for hours, then when they close the tabs, the memory stays buffered until the browser has been completely closed. </p><p>The ""Minimize memory usage"" button does clean up the memory, so won't it be possible to implement such functionality that can be enabled/disabled somewhere in Settings, to allow the users to choose the browser to unload all memory taken by any tab when they close the tab, but not the whole browser? </p><p>This will help a lot, because I personally leave my PC and browser open for days, and sometimes I have to either close and re-open it, or go to about:memory and do a ""Minimize memory usage"" to free up the memory, that was taken few days ago by a single Twitch stream tab or some other tab, and the information in this buffer is absolutely pointless, but it sometimes takes all of my 96GB of RAM. </p><p>Thank you for any information on the subject&nbsp;:). </p><p>All the best, Borislav. </p>",firefox-1440;windows-10;firefox;crashing-and-slow-performance;,firefox,crashing-and-slow-performance,en-US,"",wysiwygbg

I still have 2 bookmarks and those can't be deleted no matter what I do, I kept trying to delete them however they are stuck there no matter what I try. This laptop is a new one I got on the cheap after my laptop had a problem with it's hard drive, I made the backup right before the switch. </p><p>Does anyone have any ideas about what exactly happened and keeps happening? </p>",firefox-1440;windows-10;firefox;recover-data;,firefox,recover-data,en-US,1775030;1775043;1775088;1775201;1775230;,andrei_c888

Unfortunately, according to Netflix help pages, Firefox Linux is limited to 720p, unlike Windows or macOS version. Opera is the only linux browser allowed to stream Netflix at 1080p. </p><p>This is a Netflix side limitation because using a fake user-agent is a workaround. </p><p>I have reported this problem to Netflix, it appears to be a DRM limitation. My report to Netflix have been share with their tech team, but I doubt that leads to anywhere.  </p><p><strong>Question&nbsp;:</strong> why this limitation&nbsp;?
