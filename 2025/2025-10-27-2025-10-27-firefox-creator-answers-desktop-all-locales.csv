I still have 2 bookmarks and those can't be deleted no matter what I do, I kept trying to delete them however they are stuck there no matter what I try. This laptop is a new one I got on the cheap after my laptop had a problem with it's hard drive, I made the backup right before the switch. </p><p>Does anyone have any ideas about what exactly happened and keeps happening? </p>",firefox-1440;windows-10;firefox;recover-data;,firefox,recover-data,en-US,"",andrei_c888

Unfortunately, according to Netflix help pages, Firefox Linux is limited to 720p, unlike Windows or macOS version. Opera is the only linux browser allowed to stream Netflix at 1080p. </p><p>This is a Netflix side limitation because using a fake user-agent is a workaround. </p><p>I have reported this problem to Netflix, it appears to be a DRM limitation. My report to Netflix have been share with their tech team, but I doubt that leads to anywhere.  </p><p><strong>Question&nbsp;:</strong> why this limitation&nbsp;? Is the Widewine codec implemented differently in linux version&nbsp;? Is there a way to make Netflix change their rules from Firefox team&nbsp;? </p>",firefox-1440;linux;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",anat.ole
