Today, I can launch Firefox, select the container titled with the number I want to use, and immediately place or accept a call via my desktop. I can close the browser completely when I am done. I also changed the icon and name to reflect this purpose. This has been most beneficial when I have been on a call with a financial institution and they want to call me back at a specific number which they have on file. Opening the browser and being immediately ready is better than connecting to Google Voice; opening my password manager; inserting my credentials; providing 2FA; accessing the account; allowing my microphone; and accepting the call.
