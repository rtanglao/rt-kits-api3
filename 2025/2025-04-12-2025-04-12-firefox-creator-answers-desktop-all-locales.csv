However, when I directly copy the file to the browser/extensions directory, the browser disables the add-on as untrusted. How can I properly install a signed extension in Firefox version 50.0b2? I can confirm that the extension works correctly when temporarily loaded (via temporary installation), but it fails to install after being officially signed. </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",zhang.lihuan
