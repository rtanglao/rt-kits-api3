The video will only start to play if i click on the window/tab and that window/tab is the ""active"" one im looking at. </p><p>It worked fine before but some firefox update f***ed this up (and yes the official firefox updates are the only thing that changed), no i dont know which update it was because i didnt recognize the problem right away. </p><p>The autoplay option is set to allow media and audio. </p><p>The weird thing is that when i open a video in the vlc player and do the mouseover, everything works just fine. So my conclusion is that some setting was messed up on the new firefox version. </p><p>Some data of my pc, everything is updated: - Windows 11 Pro - CPU is AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D  3,4GHz - GPU is AMD Radeon RX 7900XT - RAM is 32GB DDR4 CL16 - Internet is wired connection with 250K speed - Firefox Version is 137.0.1 </p><p>Sorry for my bad english and thank you in advance. </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",max.sharingan222
