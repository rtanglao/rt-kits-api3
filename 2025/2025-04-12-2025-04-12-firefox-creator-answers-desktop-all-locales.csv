I cannot access Pocket just now so cannot give you any data about its version. Below is a screenshot of the Firefox version that I just loaded yesterday but which is  also refusing to load any link, incl. Pocket. No error message now; yesterday when Firefox refused to load anything, a message saying  ""Not Secure"" showed up atop my screen left of the link I was attempting; it showed up for every link I tried, but is no longer showing up at all, though Firefox continues to be unable to load any link. Second screenshot below is my current attempt to load 2 links plus Pocket, a video of it would show all 3  loading attempts on the screenshot having the little dot moving back and forth side-to-side but never loading. Hope this helps! And thank you kindly for assisting me, Alasdair Coyne </p><p>Attachment(s) Screen Shot 2025-04-10 at 4.17.50 PM.png Screen Shot 2025-04-10 at 4.09.23 PM.png </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",sespecoyne
