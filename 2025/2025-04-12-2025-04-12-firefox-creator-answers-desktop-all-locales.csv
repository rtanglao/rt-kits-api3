I just wanted to suggest that you have an option to write notes in each password profile that can also be secure.  My iPhone has a notes section under each password profile.  I use it to write info such as my airline advantage number, the email I used with that particular website, membership numbers, etc.  I'm getting up there in age, so while I'm working on simplifying my life it helps to make notes to remember stuff.  Can you suggest this idea to the right people at Firefox or Mozilla? Thank you for your help and consideration.

I cannot access Pocket just now so cannot give you any data about its version. Below is a screenshot of the Firefox version that I just loaded yesterday but which is  also refusing to load any link, incl. Pocket. No error message now; yesterday when Firefox refused to load anything, a message saying  ""Not Secure"" showed up atop my screen left of the link I was attempting; it showed up for every link I tried, but is no longer showing up at all, though Firefox continues to be unable to load any link. Second screenshot below is my current attempt to load 2 links plus Pocket, a video of it would show all 3  loading attempts on the screenshot having the little dot moving back and forth side-to-side but never loading. Hope this helps!
