I have 2 Microsoft accounts. I am logged in to my Windows 11 computer with my primary Microsoft account. I can log in to my secondary Microsoft account on Edge (Windows), Chrome (Windows), Safari (on iPhone), but not when using Firefox. I can log in to my primary Microsoft account on Firefox. </p><p>Both primary and secondary Microsoft accounts require phishing resistant MFA - physical security key, or passkey via authenticator app on mobile phone - of which I have both set up for my secondary account to try to resolve this issue. </p><p>When I log in to <a href=""http://office.com"" rel=""nofollow"">office.com</a> on Firefox using my secondary account I receive a message that says, ""We couldn't sign you in. If you're using a passkey from another mobile device, make sure Bluetooth is turned on for both devices."" </p><p>I've got bluetooth turned on for both devices, I've even connected both devices via bluetooth but this doesn't help. I've tried clicking the option to ""Other ways to sign in"" but it doesn't give me a choice of whether I want to use my security key, or my iPhone passkey. </p><p>Alternatively on my primary account, I get the option to use my security key, my iPhone device, or even the pin through Windows Hello, and they all work. </p><p>Again, this failure on my secondary account only happens in Firefox, no other browser has the same behavior. I know I can use Chrome or Edge instead of Firefox, but I prefer Firefox so I want to resolve this.

On 15th March, add-ons stopped working. I use many of them, so I read that the solution was to update Firefox but in ESR version. I use userChrome.css to change some settings. Before update, I had my context menu items in order. Now I can't. For example, ""Open image in new tab"" is the first, and ""save image"" is second. I'm used to the inverted order and now it's difficult for me. Also, I use ""desk cut"" to create shortcuts a lot. Before, it was the last option, now, it's over ""Translate page"". If someone could help me with an script for userChrome.css that works, it would be great. Also, I don't know how to find the name of all the CSS selectors. I have some of them written down, but other not, and using develper console with context menu doens't work for me... (probably I'm doing something wrong, as I've managed to leave context menu open but when I try to select, it doesn't work, it's like if I clicked normally and, for example, it opens a picture in new tab. </p><p>Many thanks!! </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,es,"",nemesis1334

My watchlist page is working fine, I can scroll down and everything is loading, photo's, text etc but, I go to search for an item and it's all over the place, not loading, filter buttons have a mind of their own, slow or non existent listings and filter side bar etc, etc. When I exit Ebay, Firefox won't reload. I have to wait for it to get itself back together, usually a few minutes later. Yet on other browsers it's running fine. I've done everything! (I've had a lot of experience with this issue) I've disabled enhanced tracking, cleared cache etc, uninstalled Ebay and Firefox and re-installed them. It works fine on ipad, phone and other browsers just not Firefox desktop! WHAT IS THE PROBLEM??? AND WHY SO @@@@@@@ OFTEN!!! I really can't take it any more. for over 15 years I've been fighting with this, I'm tired! PLEASE!!! SOMEONE AT FIREFOX, HELP!!!
