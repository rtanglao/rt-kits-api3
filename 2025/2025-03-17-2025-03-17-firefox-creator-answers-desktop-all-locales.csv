Office, Kitchen, Lounge, Bedroom, Man-Cave etc etc etc. I do most of my work on my main PC, but I move around a bit. So I would like to be able to copy My entire Firefox Nightly Build across all my PCs. I have about 16 profiles set up for various jobs. I have seen a few posts that tell me to copy the User/appdata/roaming/firefox folder from one pc to another, but after trying this I ended up with nothing.

Every time I launch the desktop browser it gives me a blank page. I can type in addresses but they never take me anywhere. No google. Can't access settings. Nothing. I've tried seemingly everything. Safe mode. Administrator. Deleted everything and installer at least 5 times to try and start from scratch to no avail. Tried Revo. Tried multiple anti-malware cleans. System updates. Tried using older versions of Firefox. Everything short of a factory reset on the whole desktop which I'm really trying to avoid. I've checked every Reddit thread and forum post I could get my hands on and nothing is working. Does anyone know how to get Firefox working again? I've tried other browsers and hate them I would really like to keep using FF if I can.

Been at it for some days now.... The old PC's C drive is now installed on the new PC (as a spare drive) so all the original Thunderbird files are still intact I believe. I have always kept my email files in separate dated folders on the old PC HD and so have about 27Gb of data (965 files in 111 folders) all under     AppData/Roaming/Thunderbird/Profiles/xxxxdefault However after installing latest Thunderbird version and trying to substitute the above original profile I find the old stored files are not visible on opening Thunderbird. the software tries to download huge number of files from the server, and there is no Address Book data from previous old PC install.  Appreciate all ideas to stop me losing more of my scarce hair&nbsp;:-) Thanks in anticipation.
