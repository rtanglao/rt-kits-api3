I was receiving the 'Bad Image' error code for Firefox as well as other software such as my pdf reader and iTunes. I took my computer to my local shop where they told me my computer was running out of memory and so they've installed some more as well as upgrading my 8gb RAM to 16gb. </p><p>I'm now able to run Firefox again, and my other software, but I've since lost the profile, with my tabs/bookmarks/history all gone. I'm super ADHD and so was very reliant on my bookmarks and my many tabs to organise my life. </p><p>I've tried importing old profiles from an 'Old Firefox Data' folder but none of them have my old bookmarks etc. The 'Old Firefox Data' folder seems to be dated after the crash.  </p><p>I also did not have a Mozilla account at the time of crash.

I have to wait for it to get itself back together, usually a few minutes later. Yet on other browsers it's running fine. I've done everything! (I've had a lot of experience with this issue) I've disabled enhanced tracking, cleared cache etc, uninstalled Ebay and Firefox and re-installed them. It works fine on ipad, phone and other browsers just not Firefox desktop! WHAT IS THE PROBLEM??? AND WHY SO @@@@@@@ OFTEN!!!

Every time I launch the desktop browser it gives me a blank page. I can type in addresses but they never take me anywhere. No google. Can't access settings. Nothing. I've tried seemingly everything. Safe mode. Administrator. Deleted everything and installer at least 5 times to try and start from scratch to no avail. Tried Revo. Tried multiple anti-malware cleans. System updates. Tried using older versions of Firefox. Everything short of a factory reset on the whole desktop which I'm really trying to avoid. I've checked every Reddit thread and forum post I could get my hands on and nothing is working. Does anyone know how to get Firefox working again? I've tried other browsers and hate them I would really like to keep using FF if I can. Picture shows what the app has looked like every time I boot it up or try to search anything for the past week. </p>,firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",emikavanagh

Been at it for some days now.... The old PC's C drive is now installed on the new PC (as a spare drive) so all the original Thunderbird files are still intact I believe. I have always kept my email files in separate dated folders on the old PC HD and so have about 27Gb of data (965 files in 111 folders) all under     AppData/Roaming/Thunderbird/Profiles/xxxxdefault However after installing latest Thunderbird version and trying to substitute the above original profile I find the old stored files are not visible on opening Thunderbird. the software tries to download huge number of files from the server, and there is no Address Book data from previous old PC install.  Appreciate all ideas to stop me losing more of my scarce hair&nbsp;:-) Thanks in anticipation.
