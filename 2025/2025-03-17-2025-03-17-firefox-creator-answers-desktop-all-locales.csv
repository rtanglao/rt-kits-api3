Been at it for some days now.... The old PC's C drive is now installed on the new PC (as a spare drive) so all the original Thunderbird files are still intact I believe. I have always kept my email files in separate dated folders on the old PC HD and so have about 27Gb of data (965 files in 111 folders) all under     AppData/Roaming/Thunderbird/Profiles/xxxxdefault However after installing latest Thunderbird version and trying to substitute the above original profile I find the old stored files are not visible on opening Thunderbird. the software tries to download huge number of files from the server, and there is no Address Book data from previous old PC install.  Appreciate all ideas to stop me losing more of my scarce hair&nbsp;:-) Thanks in anticipation.
