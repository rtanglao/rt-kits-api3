Firefox refuses to keep me logged in to my Mozilla/Firefox account. Every few hours -- or at the very least, after a machine shut-down -- I have to re-login if I re-start Firefox. </p><p>I do not use the Firefox Password Manager; it's unchecked in Settings. Nor do I use the Autofill options in Settings. I use the Bitwarden Extension (set to Never for locking/logout -- because this is a home computer) for Firefox to log in to my sites, with a separate authenticator app, Authy. </p><p>The Firefox Privacy &amp; Security Settings for tracking cookie blocking are the Standard ones; I haven't done anything to customize them. Further down on that page, I've tried leaving the box blank for clearing cookies on exit. I've tried checking the box and setting up exceptions for those few sites I'd like to login to without having to go through the 2FA rigamarole. I've done multiple Refreshes, clearing of History, uninstall/reinstalls including deletion of every Firefox profile and anything hinting at a connection to Mozilla or Firefox in all Users on the computer, including all the AppData folders. A few days ago, I even deleted the Mozilla/Firefox account and set up a new one with a different email address. </p><p>Nothing seems to work. Most recently, Firefox still had all the relevant cookies after the computer was shut down overnight, but an hour into my day's work, after closing Firefox and re-opening it a short while later, all the cookies are gone once again! </p><p>None of this was an issue about three months ago. I could save the desired cookies, get rid of other ones, use private browsing, etc. etc., with basically the same set-up and with the Mozilla/Firefox account I had had for years. Now, I've had to delete that account in an apparently vain effort to try to clear out anything ""Mozilla"" from this computer -- and it didn't work anyhow. </p><p>(I posted about this same issue a week or so ago, but didn't receive any responses and have now deleted that Mozilla/Firefox account -- see above -- so this message is an update.) </p>",firefox-14301;firefox-1430;windows-11;firefox;cookies-history;,firefox,cookies-history,en-US,"",kinglp2339

И вдруг браузер САМ выводит меня из полноэкранного режима, начинает обновлять вкладку с игрой. Из за этого весь игровой процесс прерывается и мне снова загружает игру! Честно сказать это уже надоело. Не возможно играть нормально, в любую минуту браузер начинает сам обновлять вкладки. Пишу вам второй раз, исправьте это.

It seems Firefox also attempts this, but for some reason it only does this when it is <em>not</em> in fullscreen mode.
