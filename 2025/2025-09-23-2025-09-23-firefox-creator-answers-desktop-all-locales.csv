When I right click on a tab I can create a new tab group.  Below this option is a button labeled ""Closed Groups"".  If I want to use one of these and check it, the tab I want to assign to it is closed and the group name is not listed in the sidebar.  It seems the ""Closed Groups"" can no longer be used.  There is no way to get rid of them and I end up creating duplicates as new tab groups with the same names.  I want to either delete the Closed Groups or be able to reuse them.  Any solution for this problem? </p>",firefox-14301;firefox-1430;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",matloffm
