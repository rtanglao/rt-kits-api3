I've been having trouble with Firefox.  </p><p>When I enter a certain website (<a href=""https://app.helpwise.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://app.helpwise.io/</a>) using my PC, after a few minutes my internet connection gets disabled. When I try to run 'Diagnose Network Problems' in Win11, no issues.  </p><p>First time this happened, a restart fixed the problem. Second time, a DNS flush fixed it. But after that, those solutions don't work anymore. </p><p>I initially thought it was that website (which I use for work) but I tried running that website on my Android phone using Firefox as well and I did not have any connectivity issues.  </p><p>So, I tried running the website in Chrome - no issues. I did work side by side with Firefox opened as all my bookmarks for work are there, and eventually after a few hours my internet was disconnected again - even though <a href=""https://app.helpwise.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://app.helpwise.io/</a> was not opened in Firefox. </p><p>I have tried refreshing Firefox, then disabling all extensions and running <a href=""https://app.helpwise.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://app.helpwise.io/</a> and still it immediately disabled my internet.  </p><p>There are some times that it even turned OFF my Avast anti-virus.  </p><p>I have tried running Avast and Malwarebytes and no virus or malware was detected.  </p><p>I still want to use Firefox and I'm now thinking of formatting my computer. But when I run Firefox again after formatting, I may have the same issue.  </p><p>Can anyone help? </p>",firefox-14301;firefox-1430;windows-11;firefox;connectivity;,firefox,connectivity,en-US,"",eduforonda

When I right click on a tab I can create a new tab group.  Below this option is a button labeled ""Closed Groups"".  If I want to use one of these and check it, the tab I want to assign to it is closed and the group name is not listed in the sidebar.  It seems the ""Closed Groups"" can no longer be used.  There is no way to get rid of them and I end up creating duplicates as new tab groups with the same names.  I want to either delete the Closed Groups or be able to reuse them.
