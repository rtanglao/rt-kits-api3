Today I got the message about bookmarks and history not functioning and eventually found something in Firefox that said it was probably due to ""some security software."" I have now gone into Windows settings and my security updates are done, but I have no idea what I'm supposed to do now. This is an extremely annoying and disruptive issue. I see that several other people are experiencing it, so it's interesting that the note next to their posts state that no one else is having the same problem. Can someone please help us all to get our bookmarks and history back? </p>",firefox-1450;windows-10;firefox;security-software;,firefox,security-software,en-US,"",nmbourne

I generally use my computer on and off all day and I never lock it until the evening when I turn it off. I went out for several hours today and when I came back there was a new version of Firefox installed. When I opened Firefox I realized it was a new version because it would not let me logon until I had completed a profile. My old version never did this. In addition all of my saved passwords had disappeared as well as my bookmarks. I'm using a Dell laptop running Win 11, about 2 years old. I don't understand how this could happen. There was no one here while I was out. I looked to see if there was a saved  profile but only the one in use showed up. The current version appears to be 145.0.1. One thing that might have something to do with it. I might have been asked yesterday if I wanted to synch firefox on my computers but I'm not sure how I answered this (I'm almost 90 and my memory is a bit imperfect).  </p><p>I do have Firefox on a second desktop which is running Win 10. Is it possible to use that profile. That computer has not been turned on since this happebd and is currently asleep. Any help or suggestions will really be appreciated! </p>",firefox-14501;firefox-1450;windows-11;firefox;sync-and-backup-confusion;,firefox,sync-and-backup-confusion,en-US,"",wls4
