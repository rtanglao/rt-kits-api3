I generally use my computer on and off all day and I never lock it until the evening when I turn it off. I went out for several hours today and when I came back there was a new version of Firefox installed. When I opened Firefox I realized it was a new version because it would not let me logon until I had completed a profile. My old version never did this. In addition all of my saved passwords had disappeared as well as my bookmarks. I'm using a Dell laptop running Win 11, about 2 years old. I don't understand how this could happen. There was no one here while I was out. I looked to see if there was a saved  profile but only the one in use showed up. The current version appears to be 145.0.1. One thing that might have something to do with it. I might have been asked yesterday if I wanted to synch firefox on my computers but I'm not sure how I answered this (I'm almost 90 and my memory is a bit imperfect).  </p><p>I do have Firefox on a second desktop which is running Win 10.
