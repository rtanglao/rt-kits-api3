I've signed out of both accounts on that computer. I've signed out and relogged in on my computer. This is not a temporary issue. All of her data is somehow in my account. This seems like a MAJOR security flaw of the software. Were both using Windows 11 computers. </p>",firefox-1430;windows-11;firefox;sync-failure;,firefox,sync-failure,en-US,"",twanto

I always turn off automatic update for all software I use.  I even turn off Windows updates.  These updates always break something I regularly use and offer me little if anything that improves my experience. </p><p>Recently, the update modified my configurations to allow automatic updating.  So I had to turn that off.  A recent update removed the simple ""!gm"" shortcut to Google Maps.  I had to create a new shortcut for Google Maps so I could type into the URL bar something like ""!gm Missouri"" to get the map to display.  It wasn't displaying before this and returned search results like ""General Motors"".  Ugh. </p><p>Can't Firefox stop updating my configurations and making life difficult for me? </p>",firefox-14301;firefox-1430;windows-10;firefox;customization;,firefox,customization,en-US,"",BPaul_H
