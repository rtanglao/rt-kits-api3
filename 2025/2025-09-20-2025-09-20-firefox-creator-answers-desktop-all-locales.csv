(Since upd. 141.0),<p>Since the newest wave of firefox updates my icons on startup are gone. When i click new tab they show up again or when restarting the page. I tried reinstalling firefox &amp; changing icons with no help. The previous update before 141.0 had no issues. I tried searching around and didn't find anything helpful. Anyone else have this issue or know of a fix? </p>,firefox-1430;windows-10;firefox;new-tab;,firefox,new-tab,en-US,"",MaximumDPS

I always turn off automatic update for all software I use.  I even turn off Windows updates.  These updates always break something I regularly use and offer me little if anything that improves my experience. </p><p>Recently, the update modified my configurations to allow automatic updating.  So I had to turn that off.  A recent update removed the simple ""!gm"" shortcut to Google Maps.  I had to create a new shortcut for Google Maps so I could type into the URL bar something like ""!gm Missouri"" to get the map to display.  It wasn't displaying before this and returned search results like ""General Motors"".  Ugh. </p><p>Can't Firefox stop updating my configurations and making life difficult for me? </p>",firefox-14301;firefox-1430;windows-10;firefox;customization;,firefox,customization,en-US,"",BPaul_H
