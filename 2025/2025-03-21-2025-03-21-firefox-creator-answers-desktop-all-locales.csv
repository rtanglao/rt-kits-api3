Office, Kitchen, Lounge, Bedroom, Man-Cave etc etc etc. I do most of my work on my main PC, but I move around a bit. So I would like to be able to copy My entire Firefox Nightly Build across all my PCs. I have about 16 profiles set up for various jobs. I have seen a few posts that tell me to copy the User/appdata/roaming/firefox folder from one pc to another, but after trying this I ended up with nothing.  Is there a simple folder selection I can sync across my network? Thanks </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",ozdrdj

I am not your slave, servant, nor do I owe you my personal information. This is the second time I've contacted you about firefox browser. the last time was approx 10-11 years ago when your market share TANKED  because you rejected simplicity and ergonomics in favor of requiring seven mouse clicks to remove history and data instead of three previously required.  when EVERYONE said they hated it and asked WHY Mozilla decided to stop taking customer feedback. you were successful BECAUSE you were different. then you shifted into being the same as chrome and IE. making yourself pretty useless. I had to create a fake account and email address to contact you because somehow you believe as donald trump does  "" corporations are the masters and users/consumers are the slaves""  WE'RE SUPPOSED TO  just take WHATEVER you offer whether it is what people want or not. I use a linux PC and firefox solely because i can use the noscript add on,  firefox focus on my phone because until this week it blocked video ads and sign in to google pop ups. If there was a noscript option for safari you would have been gone a decade ago when all of my bookmarks were suddenly relegated to the ""other bookmarks""  folder in favor of sponsoring crap from whatever piper played your tune and threw money at you.  good luck 20 year user </p>",firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",yahiba4304
