However, for some reason, Firefox's behavior with regards to PDF files is inconsistent.  </p> <ul><li> If I set the Action to Save File, Firefox downloads all PDF files, including those that it can normally open in the browser when I click a link (e.g. files hosted in servers that allow direct access to PDF files). As such, my Downloads folder is cluttered and needs to be cleaned regularly to delete the PDF files that were downloaded even if I could have opened them in the browser. </li><li> If I set the Action to Open in Firefox, Firefox can now open those hosted PDF files in the browser instead of downloading them to disk. However, every time I download a file, Firefox then opens the file in Firefox after downloading, even though I need to edit the PDF file somewhere else. </li></ul> <p>Would it be possible to set Firefox's behavior so that it does BOTH of these things: </p> <ol><li> Open PDF files that can be opened in the browser without downloading in Firefox without needing to be downloaded, AND </li><li> Do not open downloaded PDF files in Firefox after downloading is complete. </li></ol>",windows-10;firefox-13602;firefox-1360;firefox;download-and-save;,firefox,download-and-save,en-US,"",drpacial

Office, Kitchen, Lounge, Bedroom, Man-Cave etc etc etc. I do most of my work on my main PC, but I move around a bit. So I would like to be able to copy My entire Firefox Nightly Build across all my PCs. I have about 16 profiles set up for various jobs. I have seen a few posts that tell me to copy the User/appdata/roaming/firefox folder from one pc to another, but after trying this I ended up with nothing.  Is there a simple folder selection I can sync across my network? Thanks </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",ozdrdj

I am not your slave, servant, nor do I owe you my personal information. This is the second time I've contacted you about firefox browser. the last time was approx 10-11 years ago when your market share TANKED  because you rejected simplicity and ergonomics in favor of requiring seven mouse clicks to remove history and data instead of three previously required.  when EVERYONE said they hated it and asked WHY Mozilla decided to stop taking customer feedback. you were successful BECAUSE you were different. then you shifted into being the same as chrome and IE. making yourself pretty useless. I had to create a fake account and email address to contact you because somehow you believe as donald trump does  "" corporations are the masters and users/consumers are the slaves""  WE'RE SUPPOSED TO  just take WHATEVER you offer whether it is what people want or not. I use a linux PC and firefox solely because i can use the noscript add on,  firefox focus on my phone because until this week it blocked video ads and sign in to google pop ups. If there was a noscript option for safari you would have been gone a decade ago when all of my bookmarks were suddenly relegated to the ""other bookmarks""  folder in favor of sponsoring crap from whatever piper played your tune and threw money at you.  good luck 20 year user </p>",firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",yahiba4304
