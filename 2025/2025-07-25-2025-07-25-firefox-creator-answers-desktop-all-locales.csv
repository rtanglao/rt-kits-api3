Firefox seems to have added support for the similar situation on linux with flatpak and snap. <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1785278"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1785278</a> There isn't a way to use autoconfig on Windows if we choose to install Firefox from the store of the OS? </p>",firefox-1410;windows-11;firefox;install;,firefox,install,en-US,1751516;,erebus675
