Long story short, it does not work; I did the following. </p><p>Before closing FireFox I went into FireFox settings and click on all catagories of History - and cleared. I then closed FireFox then in Windows Explorer went to where the original file (exported html bookmarks), and deleted that file directly from windows. </p><p>I then opened up FireFox again and exported the my bookmarks as html to the same location again. Even though that destination no longer has a file from before - when I reopen the just now newly export html bookmark file - I see the contents are the same as before - (I has the appended/duplicated html bookmarks). </p><p>It's like instead of exporting the bookmarks I actually see in FireFox, it is referring to some saved information somewhere instead and saving that. </p><p>How can I export what bookmarks and folders I actually see in FireFox instead of some internal bookmarks/folders FireFox thinks I have - In other words - is there some file I can delete or setting to clear? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",jaiy

I lose all cookies and browsing history and it logs me out of my Mozilla account, logs me out of my Google account, etc. I have been struggling with this for two days how to set it up, but I cannot get it to a state where I do not have to log in to my Mozilla account when I turn on the computer again and the cookies and browsing history are not deleted. I do not know if the Windows 11 system or the Mozilla browser deletes cookies when restarting my PC. Please let me know how to fix this problem. I also solved this problem with my IT programmer, but he couldn't set it up correctly either and together we came to the conclusion that it must be some kind of bug in the Windows update or in the Mozilla update. I would be very happy if you could help me. I have an old computer at work that still has Windows 7 and I also have Mozilla installed and everything works fine there. I turn on the PC and then Mozilla and all my accounts stay logged in and my entire browsing history is saved and I can continue working. </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",minco.soska
