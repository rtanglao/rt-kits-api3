On iPads and Android devices, this doesn't seem possible.  Yes, there are the circular-arrow buttons, but they only work with Firefox (and Chrome;-) on my MacOS or my linux server, but not on my iPads or Android gadgets.  They act like they're doing something, but the page on their screen doesn't change. (With FF or Chrome on the ""real"" computers, it does change).  The only advice I find online is to use CTL-R or something similar but those ""devices"" don't have CTL buttons. Nothing else I guess at works, either.   </p><p>When I ask online, I get replies that work for linux, MacOS or Windows, but clearly saying ""iPad or Android doesn't help; the answers don't apply to those systems. </p><p>Am I missing something?  Web developers need ways debug their code or html or whatever they're working on, and this requires checking how it works on the actual users' screens. </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",jc1742
