Thinking extensions may be to blame, I tried opening those particular websites in a new private window.  But I still was unable to see the reviews. It works fine on Edge.  Is there any way to fix this? </p>",firefox-14002;firefox-1400;windows-11;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",Ladyjay12

Now it only keeps the address bar visible. Even after moving the search bar to the far left it still disappears unless I make the window slightly bigger, which is impractical. I just want to be able to quickly use other various search engines that I have installed as addons by pressing the up or down key, even when the window is half my screen again. </p>",firefox-14002;firefox-1400;windows-10;firefox;browser-appearance;,firefox,browser-appearance,en-US,"",nathanmlevesque

All the block colours seem to work. However, there's an option for custom background, which the preview within the creator app shows nicely. When trying one image type, it notified me that it wasn't compatible and to choose another. So the one I chose should therefore be compatible and therefore would assume it should work.  Yet, when the theme is applied, the custom background isn't there, just the block colour. Perhaps the block background colour is overriding the custom background? If so, though, I have no idea how to stop it from doing that so that I can actually see my custom one.
