It really p--- me off! • This has happened at least 4 or 5 times in the past year to year and a half and on both computers. And I do stay on top of my FFx updates.  If a Notice appears on my screen, I usually install within 24 hours. • This last time (today) I had previously updated FFx a few hours earlier and then I needed to run a Restart of the computer.... • MBPro fires back up, I open FFx and nothing in the Tabs Header.  GONE!   Poof! • I go to Browsing History - no Restore Previous Session (by any other term) • Doesn't it seem logical?  THAT fundamental function would be right there, top of the list?!?! • HERE IS THE KICKER:  In FFx I opened the FFx ""About Firefox"" menu and noticed it says, amidst all the provided information, ""Failed to check for updates.""   • BS!  It was following the update that FFx Tabs vanished!  How can it insert that statement? Was I suppose to do something other than click ""OKAY"". And then the new version begins when FFx is reopened. Right? • If this comes down to the older OS on the computer (10.13.6)  I should not be receiving update notices from FFx.  If so, a notice of, ""Your Mac's OS is too old to run FireFox's latest version"" would be what I should receive. So, as you can tell, I'm frustrated and baffled at the same time.  Any thoughts?  I would appreciate it.  Thanks </p>",firefox-14002;firefox-1400;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",DWrightB
