I am developing a web server, from which users can download large files. These files take a few seconds to generate, and cannot be generated ahead-of-time; only when a user requests them. The server therefore responds to such requests by first sending the HTTP response headers (without ""Content-Length""), which can be written immediately, then generating the file, and sending the generated file as the response body.  </p><p>In Chromium, this leads to the ""Save As..."" dialog appearing instantly, so the file can be generated &amp; downloaded in the background while the user picks a location. </p><p>In Firefox (v132, linux x64), the ""Save As..."" dialog waits for the file to be generated before appearing, which is not user-friendly. During deeper testing, I discovered that Firefox appears to wait for my server to send at least 1 byte of data from the file (in the response body, after sending the HTTP response headers), before the ""Save As..."" dialog appears. </p><p>I have searched the Firefox settings and documentation but did not find anything that would explain this behavior.
