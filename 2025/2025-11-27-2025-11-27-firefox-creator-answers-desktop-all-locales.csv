I ask my question once again:  How is it possible that after I log in to Mozilla Firefox and sync my account, instead of recovering the information, all of it is deleted from other connected devices as well?  I didn't even have time to make any changes in the sync menu and my account, and as soon as the sync was done, instead of recovering the information on the device that I had just synced, the information was deleted from my old devices such as my Android mobile phone, without my intervention. This is a very big and important problem and rest assured that there is no explanation in the help section about this. Please understand the problem and refrain from sending me links to re-read all the articles I've read. </p>",firefox-14502;firefox-1450;windows-11;firefox;sync-failure;,firefox,sync-failure,en-US,"",m.yosefpour82
