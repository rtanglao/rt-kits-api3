Canva and Google Teachable Machine (GTM) are the only site I've noticed having issues as of now, but I assume there may be others. Canva loaded perfectly fine in the past, but recently it has stopped loading the images of most graphics. (See included images)  I have disabled all extensions; deleted cache, cookies, and site data; reset firefox to default settings, ""Refreshed"" firefox (the alternative option given when trying to uninstall it), restarted my PC, ensured firefox is up to date, and ensured my settings do not block cookies. I'm at a loss as to what is causing this issue. Both Canva and GTM display different reasons for content not being displayed, but I have a hunch that their issues are related. I have confirmed these sites load correctly on other browsers. I only experience these issues on firefox (both regular and developer edition). All suggestions and advice are appreciated, Thanks! </p><p>Some common errors on Canva that I see: Failed to load ‘<a href=""https://media-public.canva.com/t_gKw/MAFSBct_gKw/1/s-1.svg’"" rel=""nofollow"">https://media-public.canva.com/t_gKw/MAFSBct_gKw/1/s-1.svg’</a>.

This intervention ensures that such entries, unless interacted with by the user, are skipped when using the back and forward buttons.<strong> </strong> </p><p>I can no longer click on the back button to go back to the home page - '<a href=""https://copilot.microsoft.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://copilot.microsoft.com</a>'. </p><p>I can still click the Copilot icon 'Go to home' button element which does take me back to the home page '<a href=""https://copilot.microsoft.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://copilot.microsoft.com</a>', but clicking the actual back button to go to: '<a href=""https://copilot.microsoft.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://copilot.microsoft.com</a>' (which was achievable on the 134.0.2 version), was much more convenient. </p><p>I can confirm that this is a problem with the 135.0 version of Firefox because not only was this problem not happening with the 134.0.2 version of Firefox, but the problem also does not happen with Brave or Edge either. </p><p>Using Brave or Edge I can navigate to <a href=""https://copilot.microsoft.com/chats/https://copilot.microsoft.com/chats/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://copilot.microsoft.com/chats/https://copilot.microsoft.com/chats/</a>        *insert random bunch of numbers and letters here* and they enable me to click the back button which proceeds to take me back to the home page which is '<a href=""https://copilot.microsoft.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://copilot.microsoft.com</a>'. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",PocketRocket

It just shows white in the space where the player should be. No video, no audio, no nothing. No matter what video I click, the same thing happens. The only workaround I have found is that if I go to a page with an embedded youtube video, and click the ""watch on youtube"" link that appears in it, it will load a youtube page that can play videos normally. I can use that page to navigate youtube and it will operate normally. However if I type in <a href=""http://youtube.com"" rel=""nofollow"">youtube.com</a> or get to the site some other way, the issue happens where it is only white space. It is very frustrating. </p>",firefox-1350;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1710815;1710820;,verdant.rivertree
