However, a recent update (which happened a few days ago) seems to have messed up the UI when it comes to homepage shortcuts. They became much smaller and narrower, while the font seemingly became larger. Now only a few letters fit in the descriptions of every shortcut, which makes it frustratingly difficult to identify them. Please fix this! I've included a screenshot of what my homepage looks now at 100% zoom and with minimum font size 9 selected. There's so much unused space to the sides, while the shortcuts text gets cut after only a few symbols. Increasing the zoom doesn't help. </p>",firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",kzvc

I can use that page to navigate youtube and it will operate normally.
