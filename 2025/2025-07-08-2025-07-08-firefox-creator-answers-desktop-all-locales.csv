Please advise, as your recent online instruction allow windows laptop to set automatically using security and privacy to go to Https setting to enable it. Not so, for android devices, even using chrome://geckoview/content/config.xhtmi, it does not go directly to enable Https setting. Any recent updates to do it.  I understand that the restrictions are good to prevent most users and not developers to adjust the defaults. But why not making simpler only for most users to tweak or enable DOT setting, just like brave. Thank you for your understanding and attention.

Nothing seams to happen. </p><p>Google disability has shown me a couple of video or audio files proving that it can be done, they've even said that they tried creating an account with an outlook account, what <a href=""http://live.co.uk"" rel=""nofollow"">live.co.uk</a> is called now from my understanding. </p><p>SO I'm really confused as to why they can do it and I can't. </p><p>I can't show you with OBS because it messes with my screen readers speech so if you have another way I can show you; please let me know. </p><p>I've already tried the following, suggested by disability support: 1. uninstalling and reinstalling firefox. </p><p>2. making sure addons are disabled, the only one I left enabled was a volume booster but I doubt that would be the issue. </p><p>3. Setting NVDA back to factory settings and disabling all addons. </p><p>This has been confusing me on and off for up to a year now. </p>",firefox-1400;windows-10;firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",bradleybrown2

This would be really helpful and immersive since the user wouldn't have to deal with sounds collision and focus on his thing, not interrupting his flow to mute a music or a podcast or whatever. Also if you guys could add this feature, let the users choose between two options: pause (which completely pauses the background media) or fade-to-mute (which quickly fades the background audio until it is completely muted, but not paused. When the principal media stops playing, it will fade in again). </p>",windows-11;firefox;audio-and-video;,firefox,audio-and-video,en-US,"",mandrakerenegado
