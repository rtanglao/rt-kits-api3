This would be really helpful and immersive since the user wouldn't have to deal with sounds collision and focus on his thing, not interrupting his flow to mute a music or a podcast or whatever. Also if you guys could add this feature, let the users choose between two options: pause (which completely pauses the background media) or fade-to-mute (which quickly fades the background audio until it is completely muted, but not paused.
