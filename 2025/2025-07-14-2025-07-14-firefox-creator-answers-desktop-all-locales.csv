But it has given this problem that I have run into before which the only way I was able to fix it was a full wipe of my computer to factory settings. So with this I started to troubleshoot on what I could do and reinstall was the first and send commands to refresh the dns but I found to what seems to be a startup incomplete file in the Firefox software and it seems to create itself even when deleted. It could be this which is causing problems but all I know for certain that when I click on Firefox it won't open at all or startup. With the only evidence that it responded from task manager or a popup talking about wanting to refresh Firefox for 0.1 milliseconds </p>,windows-11;firefox;launch-failure;,firefox,launch-failure,en-US,1748841;,ihatethensa.gov

Usually after about 10 minutes. Closing and reopening Firefox restarts the cycle. Works for a bit, then stops. Other browsers like Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome work fine. </p><p>I've checked my Firewall, deleted and re-added Firefox, made sure it had both Public and Private Network access. Also tried using Firefox in Troubleshoot mode and tried resetting Firefox. Same behavior, made no difference. </p><p>I don't see any error messages when this happens.
