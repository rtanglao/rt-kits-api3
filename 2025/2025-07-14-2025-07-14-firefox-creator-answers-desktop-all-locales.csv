Usually after about 10 minutes. Closing and reopening Firefox restarts the cycle. Works for a bit, then stops. Other browsers like Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome work fine. </p><p>I've checked my Firewall, deleted and re-added Firefox, made sure it had both Public and Private Network access. Also tried using Firefox in Troubleshoot mode and tried resetting Firefox. Same behavior, made no difference. </p><p>I don't see any error messages when this happens. Tabs just spin and load indefinitely with nothing ever appearing in the window. Anyone have any ideas? </p>",windows-10;firefox;loading-speed;,firefox,loading-speed,en-US,"",pineshrike
