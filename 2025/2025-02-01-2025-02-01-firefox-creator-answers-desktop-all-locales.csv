I use linkedin almost like the entire day and it never seems to work right in firefox. Same options, filters, searches seems to work well in chrome and ARC.

The site crashes. </p><p>I could say that, it happens for almost any of the function in LinkedIn. But some other job portals works fine. Also,  I've tried opening in privacy mode  (where it works well) and I have also removed the extensions like ublock and privacy badger. Still, no positive signs. </p><p>So what's the issue here?
