I am automating end-to-end testing with playwright for python, using the official Docker image from the microsoft artifact repository (using `playwright/python:v1.49.1`). </p><p>As I have signed certificates for my local domains with my own certificate authority, I am trying to have Firefox automatically install the certificates via a policies file. However, Firefox seems to ignore the policies file no matter what. </p><p>To ensure that the file itself is used, I simplified it to a single boolean value, and ensured that it's copied correctly inside the container via the `cat` command. Here are the current contents: </p><p>{ </p><pre> ""policies"": {    ""DisableTelemetry"": true </pre> <p>} </p><p>I know that the CA certificate is installed correctly, as it works out of the box using the WebKit browser and Curl command. I have gotten it to work in Chromium by installing it to nssdb using `certutil`. </p><p>I have converted the file from ASCII to the `utf-8` charset. </p><p>The file has the expected content, and I have copied it to both `/etc/firefox/policies/policies.json` and `/ms-playwright/firefox-1466/firefox/distribution/policies.json` (the path to the binary is `/ms-playwright/firefox-1466/firefox/firefox`). </p><p>Opening `about:policies` shows the text ""The Enterprise Policies service is inactive."", which is sadly not very informative. It would be nice to have a list of locations it looks in, and any problems it encountered. </p><p>The container uses Firefox Nightly 132. </p><p>Are these locations incorrect? Is there any way to debug this? Does anyone have any other suggestions?
