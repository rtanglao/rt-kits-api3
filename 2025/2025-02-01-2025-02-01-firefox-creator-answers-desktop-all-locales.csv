I recently got a message saying firefox had been updated.  Ever since, whenever I search for something it keeps using yahoo as the default search engine instead of google.  I checked the settings and google IS selected as the default search engine. The weird thing is, if I set the default search engine to something like ebay or wikipedia it will use that correctly.  It's just that when google is selected it goes to yahoo instead.  I appreciate any help, thank you. </p>",firefox;search-tag-and-share;,firefox,search-tag-and-share,en-US,"",chasewalbaum
