For example, I can try accessing <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> right from here as I'm typing this, and nothing will happen, I will just stay on this page. The only visible activity is that the current website's icon (at the left of the tab) changes to the loading animation for a few seconds and then permanently changes to the hourglass icon.
