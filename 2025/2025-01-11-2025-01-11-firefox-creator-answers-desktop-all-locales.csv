To obtain Farm Cash or FC you either earn the dollars slowly by achieving goals or by going to the FT Bank and buying FC dollars with actual U.S. dollars.  Example:  You can buy 250 FC dollars for $39.99 U.S. dollars.  You can pay by PayPal or by certain credit cards.  Here is my problem.  I live in Canada but have a U.S. dollar savings account.  I put U.S. dollars into the account and when I make a withdrawal it is in U.S. dollars.  My bank, where I have the U.S. account also offers a U.S. dollar Visa.  I thought I could pay for items that are priced in U.S. dollars with my U.S. dollar Visa.  Example:  When I buy FT Farm Cash it costs 39.99 U.S.dollars and I could pay in U.S. dollars with my U.S. dollar Visa.  When I get my bill and am charged 39.99 U.S. I would pay that bill through my U.S. bank account.  I thought this would be easy peasy.  Not so.  The whole idea of having a U.S. Visa is to avoid paying the exchange rate that is charged for changing CDN dollars into U.S. dollars at the game level or FT level as I have already paid the exchange once by changing my CDN dollars into U.S. dollars and depositing them into my U.S. account.  Now I am trying to buy Farm Town dollars and the game will not accept my U.S. Visa at all.  Does anyone out there have any ideas as to how I can amend my problem?  I'm frozen in the game till I find a way around this issue.  I thank each and every one of you for taking them time and effort to try to help me with this.

Aynı şekilde, telefonumda bir şifre kaydedersem, bu şifre bilgisayarımda da görünmüyor. </pre> <p>Bu durum, şifrelerin cihazlar arasında düzgün bir şekilde senkronize olmamasına neden oluyor ve günlük kullanımda oldukça zahmetli bir hal alıyor. Şifrelerin doğru şekilde senkronize olması, cihazlar arası geçişi daha verimli hale getirecektir. </p><p>Edge tarayıcısında şifre senkronizasyonu bu konuda oldukça gelişmiş durumda ve şifreler arasında herhangi bir senkronizasyon problemi yaşamıyorum. Bu sorun devam ettiği takdirde, verimliliği sağlamak için Edge tarayıcısına geçiş yapmayı düşünmek zorunda kalacağım. </p><p>Yardımcı olabileceğiniz bir çözüm öneriniz var mı?

When I save a password on my computer, I expect it to automatically be saved on my phone as well. However, I am currently facing an issue: the password I create and save on my computer does not appear on my phone in the Firefox app. </p><p>Here’s the situation: </p><pre>   I save a password in Firefox on my computer and expect it to sync through my Firefox account.    However, the password does not automatically get saved or appear on my phone when I open Firefox.    Similarly, if I save a password on my phone, it does not appear on my computer. </pre> <p>This is causing an issue where passwords are not syncing properly between devices, making it quite cumbersome for daily use. Proper password synchronization would make switching between devices much more efficient. </p><p>The Edge browser has advanced significantly in terms of password synchronization, and I do not experience any synchronization issues there. If this problem persists, I may be forced to switch to Edge for better efficiency. </p><p>Is there a solution or any configuration changes that might be needed to resolve this issue? I would appreciate any guidance regarding the password synchronization settings. </p><p>Thank you for your attention and support. </p><p>Best regards, Bilgi </p>",firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,tr,"",profesör

After trying ""Increased Protection"" DoH mode once, I have <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> working only under this ""Increased Protection"" now. It no longer works under ""Default Protection"" or ""Off"". It's exactly the same in the Troubleshoot Mode and in private windows. </p><p>If I type <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> in the address bar, or if I search for anything (regardless if it's in the address bar or the search bar), absolutely nothing happens now. If I'm on a new tab, it stays empty. If I'm on an existing tab, it just stays open on whatever website I'm at. For example, I can try accessing <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> right from here as I'm typing this, and nothing will happen, I will just stay on this page. The only visible activity is that the current website's icon (at the left of the tab) changes to the loading animation for a few seconds and then permanently changes to the hourglass icon. That's it. </p><p>Any local google domains, such as <a href=""http://google.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">google.ca</a>, DO load. Any <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> subdomains, such as <a href=""http://mail.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.google.com</a>, also DO load. It's exclusive to <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a>. When typing <strong>dig <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a></strong> in my system's Terminal, it successfully resolves. Moreover, it also successfully resolves in Firefox's own DNS Lookup Tool (located at about:networking#dnslookuptool). What I'm seeing is Google's IP address 142.250.190.46. </p><p>Now, I have <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> working in absolutely all other browsers, it also seems to resolve through the terminal, as mentioned previously, but it no longer opens directly in Firefox, unless I enable ""Increased Protection"" again. As soon as I disable it and return to either ""Default Protection"" or ""Off"", <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> (and it alone) immediately stops loading. </p><p>Have I uncovered a hidden bug? I'm really depressed right now, because ""Increased Protection"" messed with certain websites and so I decided to disable it upon finding out, but unfortunately at the cost of Google Search not working anymore.
