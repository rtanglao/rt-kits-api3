ChatGPT gave me a laundry list of things to check, and after exhausting that list, I decided that the great developers at Mozilla might be able to steer me in the right direction. Below is what ChatGPT suggested: </p><p>I asked: </p><p>&gt; When  trying to log into any resource that uses the CloudFlare CDN I get the following response: &gt; &gt; Icon for <a href=""http://givewp.comgivewp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">givewp.comgivewp.com</a> &gt; &gt; Verify you are human by completing the action below. &gt; <a href=""http://givewp.com"" rel=""nofollow"">givewp.com</a> needs to review the security of your connection before proceeding. &gt; Ray ID: 90067ba77ed70ff1 &gt; Performance &amp; security by Cloudflare &gt; &gt; After checking if I am human or not, the login proc fails with no error message and then just presents the captcha again. &gt; &gt; This only occurs when I attempt to login to resources that use the CloudFlare CDN. &gt; &gt; Is this a known issue with CloudFlare. If it is, is there a known solution to the issue? </p><p>ChatGPT replied: </p><p>&gt; Experiencing a recurring CAPTCHA verification loop when attempting to access websites utilizing Cloudflare's security services is a known issue that can arise due to various factors. To address this problem, consider the following steps: &gt; &gt;     Disable Browser Extensions: Certain browser extensions, particularly those related to privacy, security, or ad-blocking, may interfere with Cloudflare's verification process. Temporarily disable these extensions to determine if they are the cause. &gt; &gt;         For Firefox: &gt;             Click on the three horizontal lines in the top-right corner. &gt;             Select ""Add-ons and themes"". &gt;             Disable the relevant extensions. &gt; &gt;     Clear Browser Cache and Cookies: Accumulated cache and cookies can sometimes lead to verification issues. Clearing them may resolve the problem. &gt; &gt;         For Firefox: &gt;             Click on the three horizontal lines in the top-right corner. &gt;             Select ""Settings"" &gt; ""Privacy &amp; Security"". &gt;             Scroll to ""Cookies and Site Data"" and click ""Clear Data"". &gt; &gt;     Update Your Browser: Ensure that your browser is up to date, as outdated versions may have compatibility issues with certain security features. &gt; &gt;         For Firefox: &gt;             Click on the three horizontal lines in the top-right corner. &gt;             Select ""Help"" &gt; ""About Firefox"". &gt;             Firefox will check for updates and install them automatically. &gt; &gt;     Check Browser Settings: Ensure that JavaScript is enabled and that your browser is configured to accept cookies, as disabling these can impede the verification process. &gt; &gt;         For Firefox: &gt;             Click on the three horizontal lines in the top-right corner. &gt;             Select ""Settings"" &gt; ""Privacy &amp; Security"". &gt;             Ensure that ""Enhanced Tracking Protection"" is set to ""Standard"" and that cookies are enabled. &gt; &gt;     Try Incognito or Private Browsing Mode: Accessing the website in incognito mode can help determine if the issue is related to browser settings or extensions, as this mode typically runs without extensions and uses default settings. &gt; &gt;         For Firefox: &gt;             Click on the three horizontal lines in the top-right corner. &gt;             Select ""New Private Window"". &gt; &gt;     Avoid Using VPNs or Proxies: Some VPNs or proxy servers can trigger security challenges. If you're using one, try disconnecting it to see if the issue persists. &gt; &gt;     Check Your IP Address: Occasionally, certain IP addresses may be flagged by security systems. Restarting your router can assign a new IP address, potentially resolving the issue. &gt; &gt;     Contact Website Support: If the problem continues, consider reaching out to the website's support team for further assistance. &gt; &gt; Implementing these steps should help resolve the CAPTCHA loop issue you're encountering. If the problem persists, it may be indicative of a more complex issue requiring further investigation. </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1702693;,tmichel1

To obtain Farm Cash or FC you either earn the dollars slowly by achieving goals or by going to the FT Bank and buying FC dollars with actual U.S. dollars.  Example:  You can buy 250 FC dollars for $39.99 U.S. dollars.  You can pay by PayPal or by certain credit cards.  Here is my problem.  I live in Canada but have a U.S. dollar savings account.  I put U.S. dollars into the account and when I make a withdrawal it is in U.S. dollars.  My bank, where I have the U.S. account also offers a U.S. dollar Visa.  I thought I could pay for items that are priced in U.S. dollars with my U.S. dollar Visa.  Example:  When I buy FT Farm Cash it costs 39.99 U.S.dollars and I could pay in U.S. dollars with my U.S. dollar Visa.  When I get my bill and am charged 39.99 U.S. I would pay that bill through my U.S. bank account.  I thought this would be easy peasy.  Not so.  The whole idea of having a U.S. Visa is to avoid paying the exchange rate that is charged for changing CDN dollars into U.S. dollars at the game level or FT level as I have already paid the exchange once by changing my CDN dollars into U.S. dollars and depositing them into my U.S. account.  Now I am trying to buy Farm Town dollars and the game will not accept my U.S. Visa at all.  Does anyone out there have any ideas as to how I can amend my problem?  I'm frozen in the game till I find a way around this issue.  I thank each and every one of you for taking them time and effort to try to help me with this.

When I save a password on my computer, I expect it to automatically be saved on my phone as well. However, I am currently facing an issue: the password I create and save on my computer does not appear on my phone in the Firefox app. </p><p>Here‚Äôs the situation: </p><pre>   I save a password in Firefox on my computer and expect it to sync through my Firefox account.    However, the password does not automatically get saved or appear on my phone when I open Firefox.    Similarly, if I save a password on my phone, it does not appear on my computer. </pre> <p>This is causing an issue where passwords are not syncing properly between devices, making it quite cumbersome for daily use. Proper password synchronization would make switching between devices much more efficient. </p><p>The Edge browser has advanced significantly in terms of password synchronization, and I do not experience any synchronization issues there. If this problem persists, I may be forced to switch to Edge for better efficiency. </p><p>Is there a solution or any configuration changes that might be needed to resolve this issue? I would appreciate any guidance regarding the password synchronization settings. </p><p>Thank you for your attention and support. </p><p>Best regards, Bilgi </p>",firefox;sync-failure;seg-bug-performance-issue;,firefox,sync-failure,tr,"",profes√∂r

After trying ""Increased Protection"" DoH mode once, I have <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> working only under this ""Increased Protection"" now. It no longer works under ""Default Protection"" or ""Off"". It's exactly the same in the Troubleshoot Mode and in private windows. </p><p>If I type <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> in the address bar, or if I search for anything (regardless if it's in the address bar or the search bar), absolutely nothing happens now. If I'm on a new tab, it stays empty. If I'm on an existing tab, it just stays open on whatever website I'm at. For example, I can try accessing <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> right from here as I'm typing this, and nothing will happen, I will just stay on this page. The only visible activity is that the current website's icon (at the left of the tab) changes to the loading animation for a few seconds and then permanently changes to the hourglass icon. That's it. </p><p>Any local google domains, such as <a href=""http://google.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">google.ca</a>, DO load. Any <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> subdomains, such as <a href=""http://mail.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.google.com</a>, also DO load. It's exclusive to <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a>. When typing <strong>dig <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a></strong> in my system's Terminal, it successfully resolves. Moreover, it also successfully resolves in Firefox's own DNS Lookup Tool (located at about:networking#dnslookuptool). What I'm seeing is Google's IP address 142.250.190.46. </p><p>Now, I have <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> working in absolutely all other browsers, it also seems to resolve through the terminal, as mentioned previously, but it no longer opens directly in Firefox, unless I enable ""Increased Protection"" again. As soon as I disable it and return to either ""Default Protection"" or ""Off"", <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> (and it alone) immediately stops loading. </p><p>Have I uncovered a hidden bug? I'm really depressed right now, because ""Increased Protection"" messed with certain websites and so I decided to disable it upon finding out, but unfortunately at the cost of Google Search not working anymore. Do I really have to use other browsers to use Google Search now? And what kind of witchcraft is it?
