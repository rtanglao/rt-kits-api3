It used to be that when I received an email with a attachment I could choose to open or download to a particular file. Now my only choice is to download the file which happens automatically as soon as I click on the attachment. I am using Windows 11 and read my email while it remains on the ACENTEC website. That seems to be a good security move. The email never is downloaded into my computer and remains accessible from any of the several computers I use. </p>,windows-11;firefox-1340;firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",sullivanarthur31

After trying ""Increased Protection"" DoH mode once, I have <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> working only under this ""Increased Protection"" now. It no longer works under ""Default Protection"" or ""Off"". It's exactly the same in the Troubleshoot Mode and in private windows. </p><p>If I type <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> in the address bar, or if I search for anything (regardless if it's in the address bar or the search bar), absolutely nothing happens now. If I'm on a new tab, it stays empty. If I'm on an existing tab, it just stays open on whatever website I'm at. For example, I can try accessing <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> right from here as I'm typing this, and nothing will happen, I will just stay on this page. The only visible activity is that the current website's icon (at the left of the tab) changes to the loading animation for a few seconds and then permanently changes to the hourglass icon. That's it. </p><p>Any local google domains, such as <a href=""http://google.ca"" rel=""nofollow"">google.ca</a>, DO load. Any <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> subdomains, such as <a href=""http://mail.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.google.com</a>, also DO load. It's exclusive to <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a>. When typing <strong>dig <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a></strong> in my system's Terminal, it successfully resolves. Moreover, it also successfully resolves in Firefox's own DNS Lookup Tool (located at about:networking#dnslookuptool). What I'm seeing is Google's IP address 142.250.190.46. </p><p>Now, I have <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> working in absolutely all other browsers, it also seems to resolve through the terminal, as mentioned previously, but it no longer opens directly in Firefox, unless I enable ""Increased Protection"" again. As soon as I disable it and return to either ""Default Protection"" or ""Off"", <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> (and it alone) immediately stops loading. </p><p>Have I uncovered a hidden bug? I'm really depressed right now, because ""Increased Protection"" messed with certain websites and so I decided to disable it upon finding out, but unfortunately at the cost of Google Search not working anymore. Do I really have to use other browsers to use Google Search now? And what kind of witchcraft is it? I really don't understand what's going on. </p>",firefox-1340;firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",coolak
