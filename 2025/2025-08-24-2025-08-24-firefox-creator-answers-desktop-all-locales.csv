Yesterday I took the latest Firefox update and after installing it, the Windows Magnifier will no longer follow the text cursor on web pages rendered in Firefox. It will follow typing in the address bar and the search bar on the task bar, but it will not on web pages rendered in Firefox. </p><p>I do not have this problem with Chrome or Librewolf. </p><p>I had made two earlier posts with no response from Support. I have been trying desperately to figure out what waws going on as I was moving links, bookmarks &amp; passwords into Librewolf. </p><p>I tried to refresh Firefox. It didn't work. I tried safe mode. It didn't work. I even tried a different profile. It didn't work. I even tired uninstall &amp; reinstall Firefox. It didn't work. </p><p>I even called the Microsoft Disability desk and had them check my magnifier settings, and they are fine, and yet even if I toggled them on &amp; of--it still didn't work. </p><p>So finally, out of desperation, I did the dreaded System Restore. </p><p>I rolled it back to August 18th and sat and waited. </p><p>And though I had to relog into Firefox--it worked! </p><p>and i have been surfing happily all evening until I loaded the Spotify player page and it wouldn't play. Okay this was weird because I had been using it all week and suddenly it wouldn't play. I did a search, and apparently it wasn't just me. I opened the About Firefox and there it was--the dreaded update. </p><p>Believe me, I really didn't want to restaret the browser, but it was doomed to happen anyway. </p><p>And guess what--the Windows Magnifier view won't follow the text cursor in web pages rendered in Firefox--Again! </p><p>The Spotify player plays again but.....  </p><p>If you don't believe me, open the Windows Magnifier, dock it on your task bar, and try to type into a web page. The view just goes cockeyed. </p><p>So yes, the update has a bug. And for all the people who are visually handicapped and use the Windows Magnifier we are cursing you right now and hoping for a quick fix before we all have to move to Chrome. </p><p>You sighted people have no idea how frustrating this is. </p><p>At least I'm glad it's not my PC. </p><p>But if it doesn't get fixed, I""m absolutely done with this browser. It is now unusable for people with visual disabilities. </p><p>Good luck. </p><p>Thank you.

However, recently it will no longer let me fill in the boxes on the app to allow me to enter my 6 digit token from my authenticator app.  I am using Firefox ver 142.0 and Mac OS Monterrey 12.7.6 (which can not be updated because of my older iMac)   BTW, on my Macbook pro, also running Monterrey, and using firefox, I do not experience this problem. </p><p>Lynn at  Peregrine02@hotmail.com </p>",firefox-1420;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",garylreynolds

So I've been stuck at that version and build of 10 for basically the last five years. While I'm trying to see if I can update it to 22h2, the last known version of Windows 10 with the hopes of enrolling in the extended security updates, that may not be feasible due to how old the mahcine itself is. Will Firefox continue to support <em>all</em> versions of 10 for the foreseeable future and not just those on the ESU? If so, great. If not, what version will be the last that can support the version I'm on? I don't have a Windows 11 machine yet on a full time basis (I'm testing an 11 machine out, but I may not end up keeping it) and I prefer 10 to begin with, so I would like to know when I need to stop updating Firefox itself, so that I can be sure I'll be able to keep using the browser with my current OS. </p>",firefox-1420;windows-10;firefox;esr;,firefox,esr,en-US,"",Marc7
