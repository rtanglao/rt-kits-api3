I frequently need to modify or create GPX files, and I usually do it on my phone because the map never fully loads&nbsp;: by that I mean there is a <em>massive grey square in the middle</em> and the <em>map only loads on the side</em>, like I can see names, routes, etc but not in the middle.  </p><p>Even if I zoom in or zoom out it's only the middle which is grey.  If i move to the side, the previously centered area will be displayed on the side of the map. And it only does that on Firefox, not on Edge or Chrome or Safari etc.  </p><p>I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling Firefox and deactivating all addons but nothing works.   If you have some ideas on how to solve this problem id gladly try them out (sorry for the crappy english) </p>",firefox-1420;windows-10;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,1759273;1759275;,WitchKing_ANGMAR

However, recently it will no longer let me fill in the boxes on the app to allow me to enter my 6 digit token from my authenticator app.  I am using Firefox ver 142.0 and Mac OS Monterrey 12.7.6 (which can not be updated because of my older iMac)   BTW, on my Macbook pro, also running Monterrey, and using firefox, I do not experience this problem. </p><p>Lynn at  Peregrine02@hotmail.com </p>",firefox-1420;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",garylreynolds

So I've been stuck at that version and build of 10 for basically the last five years. While I'm trying to see if I can update it to 22h2, the last known version of Windows 10 with the hopes of enrolling in the extended security updates, that may not be feasible due to how old the mahcine itself is. Will Firefox continue to support <em>all</em> versions of 10 for the foreseeable future and not just those on the ESU? If so, great. If not, what version will be the last that can support the version I'm on? I don't have a Windows 11 machine yet on a full time basis (I'm testing an 11 machine out, but I may not end up keeping it) and I prefer 10 to begin with, so I would like to know when I need to stop updating Firefox itself, so that I can be sure I'll be able to keep using the browser with my current OS. </p>",firefox-1420;windows-10;firefox;esr;,firefox,esr,en-US,1759221;,Marc7
