I can't get my profile into Thunderbird because (presumably) I'd backed it up using my cloud backup service (and forgot that most of the time it's incremental), with the possibility of a straight copy from the old SSD if it's not fried. </p><p>How can I at least retrieve the data in there, (and/or convert it to a readable format) i.e. emails, that are in the Mail folder, including Local Folders?  Some of that goes back to early 2000's, and some accounts that I no longer have. It's probably better to have most of that out of Thunderbird anyway, since my profile is ~99GB on disk. </p><p>Currently I have at least 7 active email accounts, and that fluctuates with .edu addresses. In the profile IMAP Mail folder, there are 20 .com account folders, a few of which are inactive or from changes, and a couple from setting up my main account just to see if that would link up with the associated files in the old profile (not). I can't tell what they all are except for those for which I'd made subfolders under the IMAP Inbox. </p><p>So since I don't only have 1-2 accounts, this is a big deal, and having to keep multiple browsers/private tabs open is not easy to work with. I'd even tried the Firefox Containers as a temporary work-around, but I'm having troubles with that. </p><p>Any help is appreciated!

My browser have updated to the new version two days ago. When I open it yesterday it did not restore my session, I checked resently closed windows but it was clean. I looked on the forums and found out that I can use old copies of the session to restore it, unfortunately the ""previous.jsonlz4"" had already been overwritten, but I found three  upgrade.jsonlz4 which may be suitable for restoration, I saved it and others files in another folder. It is a list of files that I have saved: 1.previous.jsonlz4 2.recovery.baklz4 3.recovery.jsonlz4 4. upgrade.jsonlz4-2025.... 5. upgrade.jsonlz4-2025.... 6. upgrade.jsonlz4-2025.... Then the forum said that I need to select one of the appropriate files, rename it to sessionstore.jsonlz4 and replace the old one. The problem is that I can't find sessionstore.jsonlz4. It was said that it appears after closing the browser, but I couldn't find it.  Now after this introduction I can move on to my questions. Is it possible that this file is now called differently and this method of recovery can still be implemented? And are there other ways to restore the session? I would be very grateful for help. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",2002.alex.red.2002
