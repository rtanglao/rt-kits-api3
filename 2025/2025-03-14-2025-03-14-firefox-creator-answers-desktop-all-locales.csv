This does not happen to me in other browsers such as brave/edge. Things I have tried are refreshing firefox, turning off extensions, installing windows media pack, trying a different sound device, adjusting sound mixer, allowing autoplay, update drivers. This started happening after I did a clean install of windows. Any help would be appreciated. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",alanjzamora

Then one day it would not start up, i got a message that a copy of Thunderbird is running and I should close it. I clicked the close button and the same message kept reappearing. It never could close. I tried uninstalling Thunderbird, it would not install and I kept getting the same message. How can I fix this and install a new copy of Thunderbird? Do I have to erase some registry? </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",walter136

The symptom when I see it is I can't get to a website I then go over to the the help desk (open in firefox), which auto refreshes every couple minutes, is spinning (not updating).   If I open a new instance the UI never completely loads.  When I close things, then try to open, it says firefox already running and if to quit, yes, and just no UI completely loads.    In the end, it will only start working again if I reboot.  Several reports were sent to microsoft (the automatic notifying microsoft of issue). </p><p>I tried disabling all plugins and same thing still happens. </p><p>I do know the helpdesk website had a new certificate installed yesterday.
