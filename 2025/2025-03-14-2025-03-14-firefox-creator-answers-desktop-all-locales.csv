After at most 2 seconds the screen repeatedly began flashing to a black screen. The screen would stay black for up to 10 seconds then clear for maybe 1 to 2 seconds and then blackscreen again repeatedly. It did it on several consecutive occasions so is no one-off </p><p>Similar problems  occur with Amazon Prime and Spotify but the black screen last significantly longer (over a minute or more) and the cleared screen shorter (milliseconds). </p><p>On no occasions have  I seen anything that resembles and error message or code. </p><p>I restarted Firefox in safe mode loading about:support again with no other tab loaded and it continued to happen. It clearly is not a add-on or extension that is responsible. Sometimes shutting down Firefox (if you can see the screen long enough to do so) clears the problem but not always.  Equally switching windows using &lt;ALT&gt;&lt;TAB&gt; can relieve the problem but only on some occasions. I've not identified which applications might relieve the issue in such circumstances but suffice to say were I to return to the problem web page it would begin again. </p><p>Trying to reset the video card (Windows key Ctrl Shift B) has no effect. </p><p>Clearing the cache, cookies etc seems to make no difference and other temporary files </p><p>I only clear my history periodically leaving several months of entries available.   </p><p>I have tried to update the video drivers on numerous occasions and been advised they are up to date on every occasion. </p><p>It occurs with hardware acceleration checked on and without it. </p><p>Reinstalling Firefox makes no difference and the black screen issues have been happening now for probably 2 years or so across multiple versions of Firefox and before today (when I used about:support which I have not used before) I had assumed it was purely down to third party sites but now having experienced these problems it's clear that at least in part Firefox is part of the problem. </p><p>It does not happen with other 'about' functions (profiles,config,processes,memory) so seems specific to the about:support function in terms of Firefox related pages. </p><p>Turning the monitor off and disconnecting the monitor from the power supply for the obligatory 10 seconds is the most certain and least disruptive way of resolving the problem. Just turning the monitor off and on again without disconnecting the power does not seem to resolve the issue. Obviously rebooting the system which can waste more than an hour of my time all told shutting down and bringing up software will also clear the issue. Rebooting a PC is no resolution to any software problem. </p><p>I am using an HP24i FHD monitor connected to a Dell Optiplex 7060 SFF running Windows 10 Pro Version 22H2 OS Build 19045.5487 and an up to date version of Firefox (version 136.0.1 [64-bit]) </p><p>The system is regularly scanned for malware and viruses and as far as I am concerned is clean. Standard WIndows maintenance and repair tasks (eg fsck, sfc, DISM) are carried out periodically and there is currently one windows update released earlier this week outstanding. </p><p>Please can you advise what other steps I can take (or if it is a 'feature' linked to the about:support page provide a work around in your next release) to address a problem that is becoming an increasing nuisance and yet another reason to abandon Firefox whose performance is becoming increasingly flakey in a number of ways. </p><p>PS Your 'educated guesses' about software versions in the help form page are blank.
