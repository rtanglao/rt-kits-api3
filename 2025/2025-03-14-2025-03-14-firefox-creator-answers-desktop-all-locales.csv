It's fine to bury ""settings"" in a menu because I only use it once or twice. But things that we constantly use daily should be prominently displayed front and center. When I make a user interface I always make the daily use items as easy as possible. Rare use items can be hidden away in a submenu because it will only rarely irritate users, and in fact, if it can be destructive, it should be buried deep in the menu tree so you don't click it by accident. </p>",firefox-1360;firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,1718059;,ericcanzler

The symptom when I see it is I can't get to a website I then go over to the the help desk (open in firefox), which auto refreshes every couple minutes, is spinning (not updating).   If I open a new instance the UI never completely loads.  When I close things, then try to open, it says firefox already running and if to quit, yes, and just no UI completely loads.    In the end, it will only start working again if I reboot.  Several reports were sent to microsoft (the automatic notifying microsoft of issue). </p><p>I tried disabling all plugins and same thing still happens. </p><p>I do know the helpdesk website had a new certificate installed yesterday.   Not sure if that has anything to do with it.  It's not like firefox doesn't work when first bringing it up, it works for a while then all of a sudden doesn't?  and then starts crashing. </p><p>Is anyone else having an issue with the latest version on Win10 x64 using the x64 version of FireFox? </p><p>I'm using chrome right now since it just crashed again in ""not responding"" state.  I'd rather stay with FireFox. </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,1718034;,dfatff
