Ich habe keine gute Ausbildung in meinem nun 69jährigen Alter gehabt. ""Computerarbeit""  habe ich nötigerweise mir selbst beigebracht. Bereits über viele , viele Jahre habe ich voller Freude mit meinem LG Smartphone und diesem ACER PC gehabt. Nun habe ich noch immer meinen ACER, aber zwar noch das LG, in das ich ab und an schauen wollte, obwohl ich dort einen Akku habe der nicht mehr ganz o.k. ist. Ich brachte dieses alte Gerät, um Dinge zu finden, die notwendig waren, da unsere Schwester verstarb. Auf/ in meinem neuen XIAOMI Smartphone sind diese Notwendigkeiten nicht. Google und sein chinesischer Partner sind mir ein Graus. Angeblich soll die Simkarte kaputt sein vom LG. Egal..... ich schaffte es. Das FIESE ist, das Google mit meinen Daten und immer wieder,  seiner Datensucht unangenehm umgeht. Ich will dieses TECHUNTERNEHMEN hier auf dem ACER nicht mehr sehen und haben wollen. Alleine schon, die lila Farbe im Hintergrund macht mich nervös&nbsp;! Nehmt mir bitte Google raus.Auf dem Chinesensmartphone ertrage ich es noch. Und um sicherer zu sein, habe ich nun auf dem ACER Malwarebytes gekauft bis 08/2026 läuft das Abonnement. Mc Afee hat bis 08/2025 VPN als Abonnement auf Acer und Xiamonie.  Ich fühle mich dabei sicherer. Bitte versteht es nicht als Dummheit, aber dieses Techunternehmen ist mir nicht angenehm genug. </p><p>Freundliche Grüße an Euch alle, bitte um Verstandniss&nbsp;!!........Michael der Techhasser........llllaccchhhh..... </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",kruegerm8

However today i noticed that breakpoints aren't getting hit. I have downgraded to version 132.0.2 and breakpoints work once again. I think this has something to do with debug sources, since the load process adds 2 sources, webpack containing uncompiled code and where i set break points, and webpack-internal which i think is built js library before getting minified.

So, checking the Downloads history, I realized that I had a few archives (they were majorly image-type files, and they weren't many, maybe just 10-15 distributed in three months as I don't download much nowadays) that were marked down as ""failed"", for some reason. </p><p>But, I go to my desktop's Downloads folder and, well, no one of these files looked like they had errors or similar (I opened them up in Paint, in the Photos? app from Windows 11, and I even opened them up in Firefox and I ran the antivirus on them, just to be sure they were fine). So, I decided to download ""copy"" files and, although, they <em><strong>now</strong></em> appeared as complete (""fine"", ""good"") in the Downloads history manager, when opening them and contrasting them, I didn't see any kind of difference between the original file and the new one, they even shared the same property data and they looked the same, so, everything looked fine to me. </p><p>These past few days I decided to observe the history manager a little more cautiously to see that every file I downloaded and/or saved were fine and complete (with the ""X KB - download url link - time/day""), before I logged out from the session. But, early today I got slightly worried, so I opened Firefox again, and surprisingly, a few of the files I downloaded the previous session that were ""complete"", now were marked down as ""failed"" (it's a shame I couldn't screenshot them to indicate visual examples, but it really took me off guard when I digged up the history again). </p><p><em><strong>Is this a bug or something?</strong></em> </p><p>I am a newbie when using Firefox as a browser, so this is the kind of things that intrigue me, because I also tend to open the private browser sessions and, for obvious reasons, I don't have access to the downloads list from them after I close the private window, and I imagine it would be the same situation in very normal circumstances if I used a normal browser window. So, basically, I want to know if this is a bug or something, because now you are leaving quite curious and worried that even any other of those files might have some errors or something, as well. This has NEVER happened to me with other browsers (like Chrome), if a file I saved, downloaded wrong - it downloaded wrong and I could even have a temp file in my Downloads folder - <em>this is NOT the case</em>. </p><p>(Btw - two things. This is an English translated version of the post I just did in Spanish for the Spanish-speaking language community, and I guess I wanted it to have a larger reach. Hopefully it is okay to do so. Also, although I indicate that my current Firefox version is the 134.0 version that got updated yesterday, January 8th, 2025, this happened before the launch of the updated version. I hope that I selected the right topic to describe this issue because I'm not sure how to describe it? It looks like a bug to me, I tried to look out for similar problems related to Downloads, but some of them do not apply to me (all my files do download, appear as downloaded in my desktop folder as well, and they do not seem to have any other issues, except for this thing in the Downloads history manager that I describe in the whole post) </p><p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I tried to do a test, and lo and behold. I have screenshots that exemplify what I mean (more or less): these were the files I saved/downloaded before I closed the Firefox window, hence closing the session. The first is how they appeared in the Downloads panelm the second in the history manager window and the third one shows that one of the files I had to ""download"" again (although it's a copy from the original) because it appeared as it ""failed"" when I opened the Firefox window again (started a new session), and opened the Downloads history manager window. </p>",windows-11;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",senderosvioletas

Así que checando el historial de las Descargas, me di cuenta de que tenía marcados varios archivos (en su mayoría de tipo imagen, y que la verdad tampoco eran muchas, como 10 o 15 distribuidas en tres meses porque no bajo muchos archivos tampoco) como ""fallido"", por alguna razón. </p><p>Pero voy a mi folder de Descargas en el escritorio, y, pues ninguno de esos archivos representaba como que tuvieran errores o algo similar (los abrí en Paint, en la aplicación de Fotos de Windows 11, inclusive también los abrí en Firefox, y también corrí el antivirus para ver que no tuvieran nada). Decidí descargar archivos ""copia"" y... aunque ya me dijeran en el historial que las Descargas de los archivos estaban completas (o sea, ""bien""), al abrirlos y contrastarlos ¿no veo como alguna diferencia realmente entre el original y la ""copia"" nueva? Comparten los mismos datos de propiedades y vista, todo. </p><p>Estos días tampoco he dejado de observar el historial, y ver que algún que otro archivo bajó bien (o sea, viendo el formato de ""X KB - URL de descarga - la hora/día""), antes de cerrar sesión... pero temprano también me surgió como que la duda, así que abrí Firefox - y oh, sorpresa, un par de esos archivos que me marcó en la sesión como ""completos"", ahora resulta que estaban ""fallidos"" (lástima que no pude tomarles captura para indicar los ejemplos en forma visual, pero es que me tomó muy sorpresa cuando vi de nuevo el historial). </p><p>¿Es esto un bug o algo así? </p><p>No llevo mucho tiempo usando Firefox como navegador, así que este tipo de cosas me dejan intrigada, porque también manejo las sesiones privadas del navegador y, por obvias razones, no tengo acceso a esa lista de historial de descarga después de cerrar la sesión, y me imagino que en circunstancias mucho más normales, también vería algún que otro ejemplo similar. Básicamente, quiero saber si es un bug, porque ahora me dejan intrigada de que posiblemente alguno que otro de esos archivos tengan fallas o algo así también. Nunca me había ocurrido con otros navegadores antes. </p><p>(Por cierto, aunque indico en la solicitud que uso la versión 134.0 de Firefox, que fue actualizada el 7 de enero del 2025, este problema lo empecé a presentar con la versión anterior a ésta, también. Espero que también haya seleccionado bien el tópico que representa mi problema, porque ¿no sé cómo describirlo de verdad? Me parece un bug, pero busqué y busqué y no comparto el problema con otros problemas de Descargas -que no bajan, que siempre están ""fallidos"", etc.-, ¿quizás tenga que ver con Ajustes/Settings?). </p><p><strong>EDICIÓN </strong>: Intenté hacer una prueba, y he aquí mis resultados. Tengo capturas que ejemplifican lo que me refiero (más o menos): estos son archivos que salvé/bajé antes de cerrar la ventana de Firefox, por lo tanto, cerrando la sesión. La primera es de cómo aparecía el panel de Descargas, el segundo es cómo aparecían en la ventana del historial, y la tercera indica que uno de los archivos lo tuve que ""volver"" a bajar de nuevo (aunque lo nombré como una copia del original), porque me apareció como ""fallido"" cuando abrí la ventana de Firefox de nuevo (indicando que empecé una nueva sesión) y abrí el historial. </p>",windows-11;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,es,"",senderosvioletas
