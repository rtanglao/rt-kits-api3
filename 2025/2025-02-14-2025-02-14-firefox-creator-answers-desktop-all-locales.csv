How do I get this crap to PERMANENTLY stop from downloading and just opening directly with my torrent client? </p><p>Mozilla (and this feature of Firefox forcibly downloading files to my drives after being specifically marked to be opened DIRECTLY), is just Mozilla and FireFox purposely &amp; forcefully shortening the lifespan of my SSD's. By forcing these link files to be downloaded to my Downloads folder (filling it up with crap) which in turn is forcing me to constantly delete these (link files) is causing unnecessary extra wear on my SSD!! I live in South Africa where an SSD costs the same as 8 MONTHS worth of utilities (electricity and gas). So we tend not to look kindly on unnecessary wear and tear... especially if there is a function to minimize this but it simply doesn't work as it's supposed to. </p><p>Please give me a way to completely and permanently STOP FireFox from downloading these magnet links to my SSD or kindly recommend a better/different browser that doesn't do this.... just like the ""old FireFox"" didn't. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",firefox;download-and-save;,firefox,download-and-save,en-US,1712198;,neljnico

Word documents as well as non-PDF documents print correctly and cleanly from 3rd party applications as well as Firefox. That is until I open up a PDF document and attempt to print it and see: ""Printer in an error state."" Clearing out the print cue and or restarting the printer, does nothing to resolve this issue. </p><p>See attached image from the printer cue. </p><p>Digging into my system (Windows 11) everything appears fine, drivers are up-2-date, and all other applications that can use the printer do so without issue. Briefly re-installing Chrome, I'm able to print the PDF without issue. Which strongly suggests that this is an issue native to the Firefox browser. Odds are if I'm seeing this issue, loads of other users are as well. </p><p>Looking forward to your replies....
