Word documents as well as non-PDF documents print correctly and cleanly from 3rd party applications as well as Firefox. That is until I open up a PDF document and attempt to print it and see: ""Printer in an error state."" Clearing out the print cue and or restarting the printer, does nothing to resolve this issue. </p><p>See attached image from the printer cue. </p><p>Digging into my system (Windows 11) everything appears fine, drivers are up-2-date, and all other applications that can use the printer do so without issue. Briefly re-installing Chrome, I'm able to print the PDF without issue. Which strongly suggests that this is an issue native to the Firefox browser. Odds are if I'm seeing this issue, loads of other users are as well. </p><p>Looking forward to your replies....
