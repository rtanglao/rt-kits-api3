I didn't notice the first time and lost my pinned tabs that had been there for months, I immediately put them back but now everytime I try exiting firefox it informs me i'm about to close however many tabs are open + the pinned tabs. Does anyone know how to solve the problem/what might be causing it. </p>",firefox-1350;firefox;,firefox,browse,en-US,1711963;,heavenandhellsblog
