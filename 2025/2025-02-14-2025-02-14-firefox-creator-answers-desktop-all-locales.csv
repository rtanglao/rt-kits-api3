While the menu isn't entirely gluten-free, there are still several items you can enjoy. Some of the gluten-free choices include grilled chicken sandwiches (if ordered without the bun), classic fries (though it's important to ask about cross-contamination), and salads with grilled chicken. Sonic also has a selection of drinks, like their Slushes and milkshakes, which are typically gluten-free. It’s always a good idea to ask staff about ingredient details and potential cross-contamination risks, as recipes and preparation methods can vary by location.
