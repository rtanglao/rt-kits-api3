I use the Dropbox Desktop App on my PC as well, and if Firefox is set to my default browser, I get the same connectivity issues.  I've been in contact with Dropbox, and they're trying to troubleshoot the issue on their end, but they suggested that I reach out to Firefox as well. </p><p>Here's a more detailed summary of the problem: </p><p>I am having internet connectivity issues if Firefox is set to my default browser and/or I try to use the Dropbox website on Firefox. When Firefox is my default browser and the Dropbox Desktop App tries to login, I lose internet connectivity. I'm not sure exactly what's happening, because my PC says I'm connect to the wifi with internet and all my other connected devices are connected to the internet on the same wifi and work fine; however, all webpages I try to load give me errors for connectivity issues, the Dropbox Desktop App can't login because it's ""waiting to connect"", and no other programs on my PC (i.e. Outlook, Chrome, etc.) can use the internet. It's very strange, because if I look at my network connection for my PC, it looks like it should be connected like normal, but nothing works. When I reboot, the internet works perfectly fine until the Dropbox Desktop App loads and tries to sign in again. I have found that if I change my default browser to Chrome, the Dropbox desktop app can login properly and I experience no internet interruptions. I am currently using Chrome as my default browser as a work around to this issue; however, if I simply try to access the Dropbox website on Firefox, all of my internet connectivity issue return. There seems to be some sort of conflict between Dropbox and Firefox.  </p><p>In the past several weeks while trying to resolve the issue internally and with Dropbox, I've done the following with no success: - verified Dropbox, Firefox, and Windows 11 are all up-to-date - temporarily disabled Norton's Auto-Protect and Firewall - cleared my cache &amp; cookies in Firefox - disabled extensions &amp; add-ons in Firefox - tried using an incognito window in Firefox - uninstalled &amp; reinstalled the Dropbox Desktop App - uninstalled &amp; reinstalled the Firefox Desktop browser </p><p>Prior to 9/26, Firefox had been my default browser and the Dropbox Desktop App and website had worked as expected for the entire life of my PC.  At the end of the day on 9/29 I did a system restore to 9/24 (before the Dropbox update), and everything worked perfectly before I shut down.  When I turned my PC on the next morning, Dropbox auto-updated again and the issue returned. </p><p>I know this appears to be a Dropbox created issue, but if you have any ideas or suggestions, I would appreciate your help. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",firefox-1440;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",samantha.jescovitch

In that case, i usually press the sidebar button so it's expanded by default, waits a while and try again.  </p><p>Sometimes i notice that it doesn't trigger when the firefox download section or history ""pop-up"" are open - it would be nice if it did, sometimes i need to move a downloaded file into a webpage on another tab, but can't remember what favicon - but that's not really the cause of this question. </p><p>Is there any way for me to debug the problem when it's bugging out? Or is it something known? I can't find any else complaining about it, but as said, it's on all three of my computers (Win11), which all of them have two different instances of Firefox (Normal Firefox and Dev Edition) which are all synced between computers, so all 6 browsers are ""doing it"", and i can't seem to find a pattern or a cause. </p>",firefox-1440;windows-11;firefox;browser-appearance;,firefox,browser-appearance,en-US,"",ln7

I have unchecked the recommended performance settings as well as hardware acceleration boxes. However, I cannot find where to set the content process limit to 1. Please tell me how to do this and if there anything else I can try to stop it opening multiple processes or I may be forced to ditch Firefox altogether for an alternate such as Bing, Chrome or DuckDuckGo.

I am a web developer and I have created a couple of web-based systems for my employer. In typical fashion, when a form is submitted, we use JavaScript to first verify the form as well as handle the submission. For the first three years or so, there were never any issues with any of the browsers. </p><p>The past two months or so, though, my Firefox users have been reporting problems as their forms will sometimes not submit. </p><p>Below is the final bit of code that performs the submission: 	if (formvalid) { 		console.log(""test 1""); 		document.getElementById('mainForm').submit(); 		console.log(""test 2""); 		document.getElementById('submitbutton').disabled = true; 		console.log(""test 3""); 	} </p><p>It outputs test 1, test 2, test 3 to the console, so I know it has passed my verification and is reaching this part of the code. And the button with id ""submitbutton"" disables, but the form's submit() action does not get carried out. </p><p>If I manually re-enable the button from the console and press the button again, it submits properly in every test case so far. </p><p>I tested in my environment using Firefox, and initially it seemed to be working fine for me, but after about 20-30 tests, it did display the above behavior on my system, as well (I have tested to this extent and reproduced the situation about 5 times, just to ensure it wasn't a fluke). For my regular Firefox users, though, they run into the problem more often, maybe 5-10x times per week through typical usage. But it doesn't *usually* happen to them, just often enough to be a nuisance. </p><p>It does not output any errors to the console when it fails to submit. </p><p>What I've tried: switching order of disable action and submit action Button type of ""button"" vs. button type of ""submit"" inline onClick="""" method vs. addEventListener document.getElementById('mainForm') vs. document.forms['mainForm'] adding a delay to prevent race conditions (although I don't think it really applies here) </p><p>All of the above had no noticeable impact. </p><p>We are all now on Windows 11, but this happened when ones of my users was still in Windows 10, so it seems unrelated to the OS version. </p><p>My Chrome and Edge users don't experience this behavior. </p><p>I should mention just in case there is any codebase difference as opposed to strictly localization, we are in an all-Japanese environment and use Firefox in Japanese. </p>",windows-11;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",Sean
