Ten years of meticulously filed and regularly culled references that I use multiple times daily. I rarely log out of Firefox sync, so that I can keep them up to date. </p><p>I now have no bookmarks and no tags. </p><p>For some context, two things just happened simultaneously. So, I'm not entirely sure which is the culprit.  </p><p>1) Firefox just updated and I rebooted my computer. </p><p>2) Norton 360 updated sometime in the past two days. I attempted to familiarise myself with the new interface. Foolishly, given the track record of Norton-360-for-breaking-your-games, I ran the disc cleanup, which recommended I remove approximately 400 Mb of data. Norton stated this data was temporary files. If they were indeed my bookmark history, nowhere did Norton indicate they were bookmarks. Also, never have I encountered a disc cleanup that wholesale wipes bookmarks. I do hope Norton is not the culprit and this is just a glitch, because if this were due to Norton having no safety net for deleting an entire library of bookmarks - and they can't help me restore them - then that will be the final nail in the coffin for me doing business with Norton.  </p><p>The suggestion to go to Import and Backup in Firefox, then click Restore, offers only the option of Choose file... - and then launches nothing. </p><p>Currently, I'm seeking any means of restoring my bookmarks. Any help would be appreciated. </p><p>I had presumed that I was taking reasonable measures through my Firefox Sync settings to protect my bookmarks and ensure they could be restored in the event of accidents. If these bookmarks are permanently lost, the amount of work I've just lost is quite the blow. </p><p>Edit No. 01: After writing this, my Bookmarks Toolbar is also now empty. Perhaps it had wiped earlier, but was merely waiting for a refresh to take effect. </p><p>Edit No. 02: Also, it seems I am unable to create any new bookmarks. I shall read the help suggestions relating to that now, to see if it's a relevant issue. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,1724491;,devolvio

I am working on a brand new computer (i7 14700F, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Super, 32GB DDR5) with a brand new install of Firefox and sometimes it just won't load certain pages without me stopping it, refreshing, and then (most of the time) it all pops in. Browsing the web works perfectly in Edge, but in Firefox it has been a struggle. Some sites, like Discord, load VERY slowly and most of the time I need to force a refresh via shift and hitting refresh. Discord will take so long to load any image that I see it as a colorful blur before the photo fully loads in for view. </p><p>I'm running the most recent version of Windows 11, Firefox v137.0.1 (also had this issue with v137). </p><p>I have tried things in Troubleshoot Mode and didn't make a difference. I uninstalled Firefox, removed the %APPDATA%\Mozilla\ folder, and reinstalled but no change. What I haven't tried is Refresh Firefox, but that's because since Troubleshoot Mode didn't make a difference it's a bit hard to imagine Refresh Firefox will -- but if people think it's worth trying I certainly will give it a go! </p><p>I've been a FF user for as long as I can remember and I really don't want to give it up so hopefully someone can help me figure out what's going on here because I am currently at a loss and it's a big bummer. </p><p>Thanks in advance for the help! </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",stands.forgotten
