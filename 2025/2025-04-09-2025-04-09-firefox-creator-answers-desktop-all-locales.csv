I had a previous tab group, but when i deleted it, there was no way to make another. I tried dragging tabs on top of each other, tried right clicking a tab to ""Add Tab to New Group"" but there wasn't an option. I updated to 137.0.1 to see if that would fix it, and it didn't. I then tried to uninstall and reinstall still no. I turned my computer off and then on again and also no. </p><p>I'd really appreciate any help with this because i'm kinda tearing my hair out trying to find out what changed. </p>",windows-11;firefox-13701;firefox-1370;firefox;search-tag-and-share;,firefox,search-tag-and-share,en-US,"",wolfdude1111

I am working on a brand new computer (i7 14700F, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Super, 32GB DDR5) with a brand new install of Firefox and sometimes it just won't load certain pages without me stopping it, refreshing, and then (most of the time) it all pops in. Browsing the web works perfectly in Edge, but in Firefox it has been a struggle. Some sites, like Discord, load VERY slowly and most of the time I need to force a refresh via shift and hitting refresh. Discord will take so long to load any image that I see it as a colorful blur before the photo fully loads in for view. </p><p>I'm running the most recent version of Windows 11, Firefox v137.0.1 (also had this issue with v137). </p><p>I have tried things in Troubleshoot Mode and didn't make a difference. I uninstalled Firefox, removed the %APPDATA%\Mozilla\ folder, and reinstalled but no change. What I haven't tried is Refresh Firefox, but that's because since Troubleshoot Mode didn't make a difference it's a bit hard to imagine Refresh Firefox will -- but if people think it's worth trying I certainly will give it a go! </p><p>I've been a FF user for as long as I can remember and I really don't want to give it up so hopefully someone can help me figure out what's going on here because I am currently at a loss and it's a big bummer. </p><p>Thanks in advance for the help! </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",stands.forgotten
