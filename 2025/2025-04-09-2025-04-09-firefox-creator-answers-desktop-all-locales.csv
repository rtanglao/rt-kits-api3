I am working on a brand new computer (i7 14700F, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Super, 32GB DDR5) with a brand new install of Firefox and sometimes it just won't load certain pages without me stopping it, refreshing, and then (most of the time) it all pops in. Browsing the web works perfectly in Edge, but in Firefox it has been a struggle. Some sites, like Discord, load VERY slowly and most of the time I need to force a refresh via shift and hitting refresh. Discord will take so long to load any image that I see it as a colorful blur before the photo fully loads in for view. </p><p>I'm running the most recent version of Windows 11, Firefox v137.0.1 (also had this issue with v137). </p><p>I have tried things in Troubleshoot Mode and didn't make a difference. I uninstalled Firefox, removed the %APPDATA%\Mozilla\ folder, and reinstalled but no change. What I haven't tried is Refresh Firefox, but that's because since Troubleshoot Mode didn't make a difference it's a bit hard to imagine Refresh Firefox will -- but if people think it's worth trying I certainly will give it a go! </p><p>I've been a FF user for as long as I can remember and I really don't want to give it up so hopefully someone can help me figure out what's going on here because I am currently at a loss and it's a big bummer. </p><p>Thanks in advance for the help! </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",stands.forgotten

When I look into the Settings I notice in the Startup that both options available are greyed out.  Under that that notice 'Firefox is currently your default browser' is displayed normally.  So far I have done the following;  re-installed v137.00, restarted with my antivirus &amp; VPN (BitDefender)both on &amp; off with no success.  It thens drops an error file crash report but I have no idea what all that code means.  Any ideas out there? Thanx In Advance! </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",55boitoi55
