I have antivirus that include anti-tracking services but I would not know how this could interfere with Firefox settings or if my antivirus has anything to do with it.  The issue is so annoying to me that I'm thinking to switch to another browser if I find no solution. I noticed more people complaining about the same issue but it seems not enough for it to be taken seriously in order to solve or be given an explanation.

There are so many courses available that it can be hard to know which one is truly worth your time and effort. After researching and going through multiple reviews, I finally enrolled in what I now call the <a href=""https://bivs.com/numerology-course/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Best numerology course online</strong></a>, and the experience was incredible. </p><p>The course began with a strong foundation, explaining the core principles of numerology in a way that even a beginner could easily follow. Gradually, it introduced advanced concepts, which made my learning journey smooth and structured. The lessons were detailed yet easy to understand, supported by examples, charts, and practical exercises that helped me apply the knowledge immediately. </p><p>One of the things I loved most was the guidance provided by the instructors. Even though it was an online program, I never felt alone in my learning. My questions were always answered promptly, and the interactive community allowed me to connect with fellow learners, share experiences, and practice readings together. What truly set this course apart was its focus on real-life application. I didn’t just learn theories; I learned how to use numerology for personal growth, decision-making, and helping others. By the end, I felt confident enough to perform accurate readings and even offer consultations. </p><p>If you are looking for the best numerology course online, I highly recommend considering the one offered by <a href=""https://bivs.com/"" rel=""nofollow""><strong>Bhartiya Institute of Vedic Science</strong></a>. It is well-structured, beginner-friendly, and comprehensive enough for those who want to go deeper into the subject. </p><p>Overall, this course has been a life-changing experience for me — one that has not only given me a new skill but also opened my mind to a fascinating world of numbers and their hidden meanings. </p>",seg-spam;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",sonuroy.bivs

Firefox version: 141.0.3 (64-bit) The laptop has 16GB of RAM, an AMD 4600H processor, and a GTX 1650 graphics card. </p><p>When opening web pages in Firefox (this time it crashed after opening three regular pages), there is a chance it will freeze with a white screen and display a “not responding” pop-up window, while also causing the system audio driver to malfunction. Clicking the speaker icon in the bottom-right corner takes a long time to display the volume slider, but the slider cannot be moved, or adjusting the volume does not produce any sound. Forcing Firefox to close and reopening it also causes it to freeze. The only way to avoid the white screen and unresponsive state is for Firefox to automatically detect the crash and prompt whether to open a new page. The audio driver issue requires restarting the computer to resolve. So what is the underlying issue? How can I report this bug to the official team for analysis and resolution? If it's difficult to resolve, I'll consider switching to the ESR version of Firefox. </p><p>(Annoying past experience: This situation has occurred several times before when using Firefox. At that time, I had 2-3 web pages with videos open, mainly video websites, and the speaker icon was directly crossed out with an X, causing the computer desktop to crash as well. The computer became extremely laggy, and the Task Manager and security options were difficult to open. After restarting the computer, Firefox automatically reopened the previously unclosed page, causing the desktop to crash immediately upon startup, entering a loop. It seemed that even Windows Safe Mode didn't work, and a forced upgrade to a major Windows version was required to resolve the issue, followed by reinstalling a bunch of software.) </p>",firefox-1410;windows-10;firefox;app-crash;,firefox,app-crash,en-US,"",Know233
