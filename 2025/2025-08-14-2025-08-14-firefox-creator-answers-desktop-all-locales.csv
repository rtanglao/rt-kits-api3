Firefox version: 141.0.3 (64-bit) The laptop has 16GB of RAM, an AMD 4600H processor, and a GTX 1650 graphics card. </p><p>When opening web pages in Firefox (this time it crashed after opening three regular pages), there is a chance it will freeze with a white screen and display a “not responding” pop-up window, while also causing the system audio driver to malfunction. Clicking the speaker icon in the bottom-right corner takes a long time to display the volume slider, but the slider cannot be moved, or adjusting the volume does not produce any sound. Forcing Firefox to close and reopening it also causes it to freeze. The only way to avoid the white screen and unresponsive state is for Firefox to automatically detect the crash and prompt whether to open a new page. The audio driver issue requires restarting the computer to resolve. So what is the underlying issue? How can I report this bug to the official team for analysis and resolution? If it's difficult to resolve, I'll consider switching to the ESR version of Firefox. </p><p>(Annoying past experience: This situation has occurred several times before when using Firefox. At that time, I had 2-3 web pages with videos open, mainly video websites, and the speaker icon was directly crossed out with an X, causing the computer desktop to crash as well. The computer became extremely laggy, and the Task Manager and security options were difficult to open. After restarting the computer, Firefox automatically reopened the previously unclosed page, causing the desktop to crash immediately upon startup, entering a loop. It seemed that even Windows Safe Mode didn't work, and a forced upgrade to a major Windows version was required to resolve the issue, followed by reinstalling a bunch of software.) </p>",firefox-1410;windows-10;firefox;app-crash;,firefox,app-crash,en-US,"",Know233
