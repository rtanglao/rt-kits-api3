Recently, I got a new Mac M mini with the M4 chip and I’m trying to use Firefox as my primary browser because many websites don’t seem to work with Safari. Now, I’m facing a big dilemma. I don’t remember the password for Firefox from the past. It doesn’t seem to remember it, and I can’t change it. Every time I try to use Firefox, it keeps asking for this password. Can you please help me reset the password and set up a Firefox account that works seamlessly with my fingerprint as a password? If this is not possible, I’ll have to choose not to use the service. </p>",firefox-14304;firefox-1430;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;reset-passwords;,firefox,reset-passwords,en-US,1769588;,netgear9500

How do I do if I want to delete cookies from the past week? The clear history option only seems to have last hour, last two hours, last four hours, since midnight and ""All history"". I have a website that doesn't work that I suspect doesn't work due to a cookie issue (as it is a website that I have visited with other browsers and whenever I get the behaviour I just clear the cookies from the past visit and it starts working). I therefore need to remove cookies from the past week (or some other time period that I can specify myself), because only since midnight won't do and I do not want to remove all cookies since I got Firefox. Selectively removing cookies from one specific site is not an option etiher, unless I can remove them from the past week, as I don't want to remove older cookies from that site. </p>",firefox-1430;windows-10;firefox;cookies-history;,firefox,cookies-history,en-US,"",b.martin.ulander
