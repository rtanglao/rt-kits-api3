Everything went OK. (It was the first time I enabled it.  I've been negligent.) The ""name"" (email) on the token generated by my 2FA App was the primary email of my Firefox Account. </p><p>Then I clicked on ""Change"", and followed through the same steps as when 2FA was ""Added"". Now, the ""name"" on the generated token was neither the primary or the secondary email of my Firefox Account&nbsp;! The name on the token was the email I used as the primary email of my Firefox account back in 2020&nbsp;! Despite the wrong name (email), the 2FA code worked fine for signing in. How and why does this happen?  What is the intended purpose of the ""Change"" option?  </p><p>I fixed the name on the token by Disabling then Adding 2FA again. </p><p>A Curiosity?:  When I try to sign into Firefox account, 2 emails are offered by Firefox - the current primary email for the account, and the previous primary email for the account. The second email IS in Logins, but not for <a href=""http://accounts.firefox.com"" rel=""nofollow"">accounts.firefox.com</a>. The 2nd email is rejected if it is tried to be used.

The ridiculous aspect came from having to take screen shots of the list of sites from the manage data list after deleting everything not wanted, scrolling down a windows worth at a time, copying that screen shot into multiple copies of a graphics program then shrinking each copy of the graphics program and Firefox so each can be seen so I can manually type each address across. </p><p>I know I am supposed to be nice but this is just insane. It is 2025. There is a thing called copy and paste. Apparently some people at Mozilla are not aware of this. </p><p>Having got that off my chest the next issue is that the deletion of cookies and data only occurs when Firefox is closed. Who closes Firefox? Why would you close Firefox? I currently have 24 tabs open. Why on earth would I want to close them down just so they have to be selected one at a time and reloaded? What is the thinking behind this stupidity? </p><p>The only time I close Firefox down is when Windows is restarted for updates (every application) or when IDM needs to update as I found this negates the need to restart Windows (Firefox only). </p><p>Other than those situations I am trying to work out how to fit this cookies/data deletion into the normal operation of my computer. There appears to be a lack of a suitable way to deal with this situation. Would it be considered acceptable to just wait for those times Firefox has to be closed? This would be far better than what I have been doing up to now but why wouldn't Firefox delete this data when the last tab for a site is closed? There are a huge number of sites I bring up due to searching for something and close them immediately or after reading what they have to say. </p><p>I have been using computers for about 30 years and have long lost the inclination and to be honest the ability to delve deep into them. Today I just want to have them do what I want/need without unnecessary complications. </p><p>Have I got this situation right or is there something I have missed? At the moment IDM has been having a lot of updates thanks to YouTube's greed but before that I found I generally only had to restart my computer for MS updates and when strange  things started to happen. </p>",firefox-14301;firefox-1430;windows-11;firefox;cookies-history;,firefox,cookies-history,en-US,1769638;,Oldneweng
