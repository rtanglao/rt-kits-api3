Every time I see it, I thumbs it down, and have been doing so for years, hoping that eventually the algorithm would stop recommending that junk to me. I have NEVER clicked a link to ""The Guardian"" from the recommended stories page either, not even once. I'll often see 2-3 links from this virulently antisemitic paper and thumb each one down. Why does the algorithm keep recommending it to me?  I know that I can turn off Recommended stories, however I like the content, and have found a lot of interesting stuff through it. Why is Firefox relentlessly pushing Nazis propaganda? </p><p>(If you don't think The Guardian pushes virulently antisemitic Nazi propaganda, I would be happy to share links demonstrating how it does exactly that, but since this is a new account, I don't want the algorithm to think I'm spamming.) </p>",firefox-1420;windows-10;firefox;new-tab;,firefox,new-tab,en-US,1766087;,LaurenS

They are generated and then quickly removed from the display by something in Firefox.  I am not running any adblocker software or extensions other than anything that is native to Firefox.  I have tried changing about everything possible in the privacy settings and have not been able to fix it. </p><p>Here is what Gemini says it does when it generates a graph versus a AI generated picture. </p><p>Data Visualization (The ""Graph"") 📊 </p><p>When you ask me to ""graph,"" ""plot,"" or ""chart"" data (like a drag polar), I use a Code Interpreter. </p><p>My Process: I write and execute Python code using a data visualization library (Matplotlib). This code performs calculations and generates a brand-new chart from scratch. </p><p>Why It Fails to Display: The resulting image is a piece of procedurally generated content. The way it's embedded in the page is more complex than a standard image. Aggressive ad blockers or strict browser privacy settings often mistake this type of dynamic content for a pop-up, an ad, or a tracker, and they actively block it from appearing—which is what causes the ""appears and then disappears"" issue you described. </p><p>Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.
