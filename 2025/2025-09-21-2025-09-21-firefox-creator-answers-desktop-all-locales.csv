Each application is a simple .scpt file that runs the shell script (see image 2). </p><p>This allows me to have specific app icons for the different firefox profiles in my user dock (see image 3). </p><p>The issue is that once the applet is used and firefox has been opened, there are issues with permissions. In settings, it is clear that both microphone and speaker permissions have been shared with the applets AND firefox itself (see image 4). </p><p>However, any time I navigate to a page, I get a dialogue asking if the applet (Firefox_Professional, in this case) can access the microphone (see image 5). Depending on the page, I can get 1-20 dialogues in a row. This makes firefox practically unusable since I am closing an average of 5 dialogues before I can view any page. </p><p>Does anyone know any solutions to this? </p><p>Thanks so much for the help! ~Alex </p>",firefox-14201;firefox-1420;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;device-permissions;,firefox,device-permissions,en-US,"",alexrsathler

They are generated and then quickly removed from the display by something in Firefox.  I am not running any adblocker software or extensions other than anything that is native to Firefox.  I have tried changing about everything possible in the privacy settings and have not been able to fix it. </p><p>Here is what Gemini says it does when it generates a graph versus a AI generated picture. </p><p>Data Visualization (The ""Graph"") üìä </p><p>When you ask me to ""graph,"" ""plot,"" or ""chart"" data (like a drag polar), I use a Code Interpreter. </p><p>My Process: I write and execute Python code using a data visualization library (Matplotlib). This code performs calculations and generates a brand-new chart from scratch. </p><p>Why It Fails to Display: The resulting image is a piece of procedurally generated content. The way it's embedded in the page is more complex than a standard image. Aggressive ad blockers or strict browser privacy settings often mistake this type of dynamic content for a pop-up, an ad, or a tracker, and they actively block it from appearing‚Äîwhich is what causes the ""appears and then disappears"" issue you described. </p><p>Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

I would appreciate any help anyone can give me.  Thank you, Steve </p>",firefox-14301;firefox-1430;windows-10;firefox;customization;,firefox,customization,en-US,"",steveh_661
