If you have one or several pinned tabs, clicking one of them does show the corresponding page, but you can't interact with it until you click into it. To reproduce, have at least one pinned tab and a normal one. If you click on a normal tab and then press ""Tab"", the focus will start jumping between elements that are focusable. But if you click on a pinned tab, pressing ""Tab"" will first jump through the tab bar a few times before finally getting to the page: First, the tab itself will get the focus, then the ""New tab"" button, then the ""Customize sidebar"" gear icon, and only then does the focus move to the page itself. </p><p>What's annoying about it in practice is that one of my pinned tabs is a site that uses keyboard shortcuts for interaction, and whenever I click on it and start pressing keys, nothing happens. Then I have to click into the page once to move the focus to it, and only then does it become usable again. </p><p>So, it would be great if pinned tabs would behave the same way as normal ones, immediately focusing the page when clicked. </p>",firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",hckmnn
