I've noticed that Firefox often shows a cached version of certain pages (especially /menu/) even after we update them with fresh pricing or item changes. </p><p>We use proper cache-control headers and Cloudflare as our CDN, but Firefox still seems to hold onto old versions longer than expected — unless users do a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5). </p><p>Has anyone dealt with this issue on dynamic sites? </p><p>Does Firefox handle cache differently from Chrome for max-age, no-store, or ETag? </p><p>Is there a known bug or setting related to aggressive caching in recent versions? </p><p>Would love to hear your thoughts or recommendations from anyone who has faced this with frequently-updated content. </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",jasonmillerfoodie
