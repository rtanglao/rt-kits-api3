I don't want to close my tabs, because I switch between them fairly frequently (I'm writing a story, and I need to keep track of other parts so you can see why that's a no-go). Is there a way to turn this specific pop-up off? I get annoyed always closing out of it whenever it shows up. I use FireFox on a Windows OS system and currently have version 133.0.3 (64-bit). I've had this show up in older versions as well, so it's not just limited to this version. Any help fixing this would be appreciated. -Mars </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",mars_adept_enten

When I open my AOL on Microsoft Edge it works fine, but I prefer not to switch browsers if not necessary.  I am using Windows 10 and have Norton Safe Search on both Firefox and Microsoft Edge.  I did erase history and cookies for the past 12 hrs but don't want to loose all passwords and connections by erasing all history if that would happen.  Please help me!
