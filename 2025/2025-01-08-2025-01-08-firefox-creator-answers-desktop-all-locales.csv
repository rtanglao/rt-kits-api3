I’m using Firefox on my PC, and I’ve been having trouble with accessing and using the ChatGPT platform. Specifically, when I try to send messages, they don’t transmit or load correctly. The page appears, but it seems as though the messages don’t go through. </p><p>Here are some details about the issue: </p><p>The problem occurs only when I use Firefox. Other websites and services are working perfectly fine on my browser, so I don't believe it’s an internet connectivity issue, and I have full wifi bars. I can access the site and interact with it on my phone, and on the desktop app (which goes down occasionally), but the desktop version doesn’t work properly.  It worked fine for a full day, maybe two.  I have a paid subscription. I’ve also noticed the error message in the Console: ""Source map error: Error: request failed with status 404"" in the Console when I try to interact with the platform. I’ve already tried basic troubleshooting steps, including clearing cache and cookies, disabling extensions, and ensuring my Firefox browser is up-to-date, but the issue persists. Could you please help me figure out what’s causing this problem? Any guidance or suggestions would be much appreciated. </p><p>Thank you.  </p><p>Linda </p>",firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",lindamoss56

I don't want to close my tabs, because I switch between them fairly frequently (I'm writing a story, and I need to keep track of other parts so you can see why that's a no-go). Is there a way to turn this specific pop-up off? I get annoyed always closing out of it whenever it shows up. I use FireFox on a Windows OS system and currently have version 133.0.3 (64-bit). I've had this show up in older versions as well, so it's not just limited to this version.
