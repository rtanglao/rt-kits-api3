Currently, pressing Enter immediately sends the message instead of creating a new line. This makes it difficult to format or write longer messages. It would be very helpful to have an option to change this behavior—so that pressing Enter adds a new line, while something like Shift+Enter (or a setting toggle) could be used to send. Many chat apps and AI tools provide this flexibility, and adding it to the Firefox sidebar would make the experience much more user-friendly. </p>",firefox-1430;windows-10;firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",drphyphy
