Over the past 1 to 1.5 years, across updates to both Firefox and Mint and multiple 'clean' installs of Firefox, I have experienced many crashes from Firefox per week. Sometimes there will be as many as 5 per day, but never less than one per day. During the same period I have  also been running Vivaldi; it has not crashed once in that time.  Now I have to do something. If there is a simple way to perform  'problem source identification', that is within my capability,  I would be grateful for advice. If there is not, then clearly I will have to un-install Firefox. </p><p>As far as I can tell both of these browsers run with just 1 add-on/extension: uBlock Origin.
