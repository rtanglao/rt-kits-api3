The page URL is: ðŸ‘‰ <a href=""https://zaxbys-menu-prices.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://zaxbys-menu-prices.com/</a> </p><p>It either loads very slowly or sometimes gets stuck on a blank screen. Iâ€™ve tested the same page on Chrome and Edge, and it loads normally there, so the issue seems to be specific to Firefox. </p><p>Could this be related to JavaScript rendering, caching, or some browser-specific incompatibility? Iâ€™ve cleared the cache, tried private mode, and disabled add-ons, but the issue persists. </p><p>Any insights or troubleshooting tips would be appreciated! </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",windows-10;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",zeeshanwrites1

This issue can be frustrating, especially when it affects only one or a few websites while the rest load normally. There are several possible reasons for this behavior, ranging from browser settings to site-specific compatibility problems. </p><p>One common cause is corrupted cache or cookies, which can interfere with how a site loads. Clearing them often resolves layout and loading issues. Another possibility is browser extensions, such as ad blockers or privacy tools, which may unintentionally block parts of the siteâ€™s content or scripts. Testing the site in a private window or disabling extensions can help identify if one of them is responsible. </p><p>In some cases, hardware acceleration can cause rendering problems with certain graphical elements on web pages. Disabling this feature in Firefox settings can improve stability. Similarly, Firefoxâ€™s Enhanced Tracking Protection might block scripts that the website depends on, especially on dynamic or media-rich sites. Users can temporarily turn this off for the affected site using the shield icon in the address bar. </p><p>It's also important to ensure that Firefox is updated to the latest version, as newer websites may rely on modern web technologies not supported in outdated versions. Finally, some websites are designed with Chrome-based engines in mind, which can result in display differences or bugs in Firefox. In such cases, contacting the websiteâ€™s support or using a compatibility reporting tool may help. </p>",windows-10;firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",zeeshanwrites1
