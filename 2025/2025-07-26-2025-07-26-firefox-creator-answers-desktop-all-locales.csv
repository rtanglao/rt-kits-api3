The message ""You have been signed out of this account. This may have happened automatically because another user signed in from the same browser"" strongly suggests a conflict, but it's typically a browser-related error, not a direct Thunderbird logout. </p><p>The most likely culprit for Thunderbird losing access to your Gmail is an authentication issue. Modern Gmail access in Thunderbird relies on OAuth2, a secure protocol. If the OAuth2 token becomes invalid or expires, or if Thunderbird's internal web component (used for the OAuth2 login pop-up) has issues like cookies being disabled, it can repeatedly prompt you for login. </p><p>Less common, but possible, are: Google's security systems detecting unusual activity and temporarily blocking access, or, if you're not using OAuth2 and have 2-Step Verification enabled, an expired or revoked App Password. While less direct, a concurrent, conflicting sign-in in a web browser using the same Google account could also contribute to Google invalidating sessions. </p><p>To resolve this, ensure your Thunderbird Gmail account is configured to use OAuth2 for both incoming (IMAP) and outgoing (SMTP) server settings. Also, verify that Thunderbird is allowed to accept cookies under its Privacy &amp; Security settings, as this is crucial for the OAuth2 process. Removing saved passwords for the Gmail account in Thunderbird and then restarting it can force a fresh OAuth2 re-authentication. </p>",windows-11;firefox;undefined;,firefox,undefined,en-US,"",hishi0729

This issue can be frustrating, especially when it affects only one or a few websites while the rest load normally. There are several possible reasons for this behavior, ranging from browser settings to site-specific compatibility problems. </p><p>One common cause is corrupted cache or cookies, which can interfere with how a site loads. Clearing them often resolves layout and loading issues. Another possibility is browser extensions, such as ad blockers or privacy tools, which may unintentionally block parts of the site‚Äôs content or scripts. Testing the site in a private window or disabling extensions can help identify if one of them is responsible. </p><p>In some cases, hardware acceleration can cause rendering problems with certain graphical elements on web pages. Disabling this feature in Firefox settings can improve stability. Similarly, Firefox‚Äôs Enhanced Tracking Protection might block scripts that the website depends on, especially on dynamic or media-rich sites. Users can temporarily turn this off for the affected site using the shield icon in the address bar. </p><p>It's also important to ensure that Firefox is updated to the latest version, as newer websites may rely on modern web technologies not supported in outdated versions. Finally, some websites are designed with Chrome-based engines in mind, which can result in display differences or bugs in Firefox. In such cases, contacting the website‚Äôs support or using a compatibility reporting tool may help. </p>",windows-10;firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",zeeshanwrites1
