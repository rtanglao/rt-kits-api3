For a start, not all my passwords are available to me and then the look and feel of the browser is different. Where I had grouped tabs of bookmarked URLs the Bookmark bar has reverted to an older version with some bookmarks I had deleted and some newer ones missing. I'm not even able to reconstruct what I had working before and it's become very frustrating. Is there an older history/moment in time I can revert to? I've already been told that the VPN I have been subscribed to is not compatible with my new ARM-based device so my loyalty to Mozilla is being tested at this time.

I'm always listening to YouTube I'm listening music while I'm working or I'm doing task on Firefox I used to have no problem I just Open YouTube and let it play on auto play and it goes no matter what. About 6 months ago I started to experiment some problems the video stop all the time even if I have a playlist going on like 50 song one after another it will stop once in a while for no reason. It pissed me off so much that I have to change my browser by default and I don't like other browser I use always Firefox with DuckDuckGo so when I'm trap to use other browser I get mad the only one that functions very good it's on edge Microsoft and seriously I cannot stand this…  I'm forced to use YouTube only on edge it's the only place that it works no matter what it never stop. It used to be a little arrow in the bottom of the screen, a button that you can click on and off to Auto play or not, this button disappear it's not even there no more. This button Auto Play it's not there in Edge or Google Chrome but YouTube works for them not for Firefox so what is the problem it's not the setting is it YouTube that's got problem with Firefox?  I don't know, it must be a way, a back door because I need to go back with Firefox I need to go back with DuckDuckGo. I'm pissed because I have to leave just because of that and that it's no compromise for me my music will pass before everything else. I don't feel like asking question to the community because it takes months before they answer you if they do. It's no customer service for Firefox or Mozilla whatsoever they don't answer you they don't talk to you they don't fucking care and this is another thing that pisses me off because they have a good thing going on but they don't care about the people.

The message ""You have been signed out of this account. This may have happened automatically because another user signed in from the same browser"" strongly suggests a conflict, but it's typically a browser-related error, not a direct Thunderbird logout. </p><p>The most likely culprit for Thunderbird losing access to your Gmail is an authentication issue. Modern Gmail access in Thunderbird relies on OAuth2, a secure protocol. If the OAuth2 token becomes invalid or expires, or if Thunderbird's internal web component (used for the OAuth2 login pop-up) has issues like cookies being disabled, it can repeatedly prompt you for login. </p><p>Less common, but possible, are: Google's security systems detecting unusual activity and temporarily blocking access, or, if you're not using OAuth2 and have 2-Step Verification enabled, an expired or revoked App Password. While less direct, a concurrent, conflicting sign-in in a web browser using the same Google account could also contribute to Google invalidating sessions. </p><p>To resolve this, ensure your Thunderbird Gmail account is configured to use OAuth2 for both incoming (IMAP) and outgoing (SMTP) server settings. Also, verify that Thunderbird is allowed to accept cookies under its Privacy &amp; Security settings, as this is crucial for the OAuth2 process. Removing saved passwords for the Gmail account in Thunderbird and then restarting it can force a fresh OAuth2 re-authentication. </p>",windows-11;firefox;undefined;,firefox,undefined,en-US,"",hishi0729

This issue can be frustrating, especially when it affects only one or a few websites while the rest load normally. There are several possible reasons for this behavior, ranging from browser settings to site-specific compatibility problems. </p><p>One common cause is corrupted cache or cookies, which can interfere with how a site loads. Clearing them often resolves layout and loading issues. Another possibility is browser extensions, such as ad blockers or privacy tools, which may unintentionally block parts of the site’s content or scripts. Testing the site in a private window or disabling extensions can help identify if one of them is responsible. </p><p>In some cases, hardware acceleration can cause rendering problems with certain graphical elements on web pages. Disabling this feature in Firefox settings can improve stability. Similarly, Firefox’s Enhanced Tracking Protection might block scripts that the website depends on, especially on dynamic or media-rich sites. Users can temporarily turn this off for the affected site using the shield icon in the address bar. </p><p>It's also important to ensure that Firefox is updated to the latest version, as newer websites may rely on modern web technologies not supported in outdated versions. Finally, some websites are designed with Chrome-based engines in mind, which can result in display differences or bugs in Firefox. In such cases, contacting the website’s support or using a compatibility reporting tool may help. </p>",windows-10;firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",zeeshanwrites1
