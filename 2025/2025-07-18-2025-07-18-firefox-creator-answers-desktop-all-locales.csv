But I am getting REALLY tired of websites not working with Firefox but working with Chrome (which I hate) and now DuckDuckGo.  Specifically, federal government websites like Social Security, <a href=""http://Id.Me"" rel=""nofollow"">Id.Me</a>, and I.R.S DONT WORK WITH FIREFOX!!!  Also California DMV.  Now I'm even having problems with commercial sites like <a href=""http://Outdoorsy.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Outdoorsy.com</a>!  I shouldn't have to switch but I'm getting real close to just abandoning Firefox.  I will also add that the number of times I have to download a new version, then delete my session, let it load, and then use history to restore previous session is also VERY ANNOYING!!! </p>",firefox-1400;windows-10;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,1749941;,samrosedc
