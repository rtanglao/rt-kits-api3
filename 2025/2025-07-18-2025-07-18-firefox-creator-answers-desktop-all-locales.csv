While I did manage to make it better through setting my proxy settings to 'No Proxy', Firefox still seems to be running at a slower pace than even the dreaded Chrome. Youtube is the worst offender, with videos that used to run smoothly in Chrome now lagging, buffering, and moving so slow that Youtube is forced to automatically reduce the video quality (however, I should note that even on 360p do I encounter a large amount of slowness). Please note that I am a total dummy when it comes to technical stuff, so I will most likely need extensive and comprehensive instructions on ways to solve/diagnose this issue.
