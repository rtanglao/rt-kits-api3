Despite enabling all necessary permissions—system-level microphone access, and relevant Firefox settings like `media.peerconnection.enabled`—my microphone does not work. It works fine with other WebRTC sites, and the same KOOK page works perfectly in Chrome and Edge. </p><p>This suggests a potential compatibility issue of KOOK’s web voice feature with Firefox. </p><p>Could you please: 1. Provide any guidance or settings to enable Firefox compatibility? 2. Let me know if there are plans to improve Firefox support in future updates? </p><p>Looking forward to your response. Thank you! </p>",firefox-14004;firefox-1400;windows-11;firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",3301639258

I shouldn't have to switch but I'm getting real close to just abandoning Firefox.  I will also add that the number of times I have to download a new version, then delete my session, let it load, and then use history to restore previous session is also VERY ANNOYING!!! </p>",firefox-1400;windows-10;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,1749941;,samrosedc
