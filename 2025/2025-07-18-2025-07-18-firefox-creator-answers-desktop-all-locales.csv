A few days ago I started having the problem that when I click on a link, a new tab opens but it does not load any content. The little dots on the tab go back and forth but nothing loads. My home page always opens and I can open articles on that page, but new links do not open.  I restarted the computer and it seemed that the problem had corrected, and I was able to open a couple of links but then nothing more would open. </p>",firefox;loading-speed;,firefox,loading-speed,en-US,"",DandZS
