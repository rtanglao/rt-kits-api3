I have subscribed to Windows 11, but as usual, there is a learning process and having continued, additional WIN 10 support while I learn WIN 11 is worth the WIN 10 money (to me). </p><p>Problem is the instructions for Item 3 are confusing about how to configure your on going updates, much less how to send the $30 to Windows.  Windows seems to imply something about "" starting/ changing  the way you receive updates""; but no clear instructions.

From my recollection and in all my years of computing, I have always understood that the original purpose of a browser's back button was to return to the page, not to reverse any scroll actions. However, someone has changed this.  </p><p>The problem is that the back button isn't navigating to the previous page, but rather undoes any scroll actions that were performed on the current page being viewed. Once all scrolling is undone, it's back at the the top of page again (default scroll position). Only by clicking the back button one more time will it actually go to the previous page. However, this is not the desired behavior. The desired behavior is that clicking the back button just once should be all that is required to get to the previous page, skipping any scroll actions that were performed on the current page. </p><p>I see other articles talking about what happens when you use the scroll wheel and/or mouse buttons. That is not what I am talking about here. I'm only talking about what happens when you click the graphical back button (which looks like a left arrow) on the toolbar.

With the two new features, I have a pair of niggles. One, is that the new sidebar, being fixed width, cannot be reduced. Taking up more screen 'Real Estate', that I consider would be better utilised for the main panel. The other niggle, is that ticking 'Show bookmarks' is not permanent and has to be re-ticked, for any new Firefox' display. I have another machine running the same version of Mageia. I opened this today, and it, while still showing the same version of Firefox, displays the old version. Perhaps, since the Mageia support section have not yet.sent a prompt for update. My query, is. Is it possible for me to return to the old style display, or is there a setting that will do so. The new display, having several options, is possibly an advance.
