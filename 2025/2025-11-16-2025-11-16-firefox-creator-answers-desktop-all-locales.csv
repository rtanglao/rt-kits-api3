Without a doubt, one of the WORST moments I've ever had using Firefox because it makes no sense that this happened just from a power outage, especially since it's happened several times before without affecting anything, but this time it was the final straw.

With the two new features, I have a pair of niggles. One, is that the new sidebar, being fixed width, cannot be reduced. Taking up more screen 'Real Estate', that I consider would be better utilised for the main panel. The other niggle, is that ticking 'Show bookmarks' is not permanent and has to be re-ticked, for any new Firefox' display. I have another machine running the same version of Mageia. I opened this today, and it, while still showing the same version of Firefox, displays the old version. Perhaps, since the Mageia support section have not yet.sent a prompt for update. My query, is. Is it possible for me to return to the old style display, or is there a setting that will do so. The new display, having several options, is possibly an advance.
