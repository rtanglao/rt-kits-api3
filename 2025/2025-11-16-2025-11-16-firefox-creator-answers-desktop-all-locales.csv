I already had my account set up, my syncing done, everything. Then there was a power outage for a few seconds, and my PC shut down and restarted, to SHOW ME how my YEARS-OLD browser had reverted to its factory or default settings. Even after re-entering my account, I haven't recovered my bookmarks, and now I have to log in to EVERY website again. Without a doubt, one of the WORST moments I've ever had using Firefox because it makes no sense that this happened just from a power outage, especially since it's happened several times before without affecting anything, but this time it was the final straw. I valued those bookmarks more than people I know in real life. </p>",firefox-1450;windows-11;firefox;sync-and-backup-confusion;,firefox,sync-and-backup-confusion,es,"",ReadG012
1548224,2025-11-15 17:51:58 -0800,2025-11-15 20:15:45 -0800,The new prentation of the bookmarks side bar,"<p>This concerns the display of bookmarksto  the the left of the main display. Fot the record, this is installed om Magea Linux, vers 9, from the OS repository, and is Firefox vers 140.4.0esr ( 64-bit). Up until recently the display was variable in width, and once the box for 'show bookarks' was ticked, the bookmarks display opened in any new&nbsp;;Firefox' brought up. With the two new features, I have a pair of niggles. One, is that the new sidebar, being fixed width, cannot be reduced. Taking up more screen 'Real Estate', that I consider would be better utilised for the main panel. The other niggle, is that ticking 'Show bookmarks' is not permanent and has to be re-ticked, for any new Firefox' display. I have another machine running the same version of Mageia. I opened this today, and it, while still showing the same version of Firefox, displays the old version. Perhaps, since the Mageia support section have not yet.sent a prompt for update. My query, is. Is it possible for me to return to the old style display, or is there a setting that will do so. The new display, having several options, is possibly an advance. But, for me, bookmarks display is paramount. </p><p>Thanks, Rod Goslin </p>",firefox-14040;firefox-1404;browser-appearance;,firefox,browser-appearance,en-US,1779547;,rod55
