After installing my Bitdefender AV and firewall software I installed Firefox latest version. I cannot login to sync my account. My email address keeps getting rejected with the message: “Mistyped email? *name@domain*.com does not offer email”. It is the same email that I have used to sync Firefox across all my devices and Win 10 PC’s. It is a domain we bought or registered for a private email service. It is the same email I used to create this account using Firefox on my iPad to make this bug report. Firefox is allowed thru the firewall, but many Windows sub programs are not. I did reboot several times after install with the same result. Currently not running any extensions as I haven’t tried to install them without sync. Is there some windows service or sub program I need to unblock? Never had this issue on any other device or PC when trying to sync. Any suggestions appreciated thanks! </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,1709065;,digimage
