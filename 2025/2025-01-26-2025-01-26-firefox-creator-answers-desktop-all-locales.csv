Because of eyesight issues I run Windows 10 scaled tp 150%.   As I've begun using FF I find many windows, as well as the banner, tab bar and url are very large.  Therefore they take up too much screen real estate and I can't always use websites without having the last 4 or 5 lines hidden and inaccessible. </p><p>Years ago I used FF with a compact theme but these no longer seem to be available.  How can I adjust the FF settings, or the Windows 10 settings for FF, so that I can both see it easily and have access to the entire length of the window?

Considering I delete cookies with fair regularity daily, this is unusual. The amount that I am seeing now, is around 190 advertising/Tracking cookies even when I only visit one or two sites. If I remove them and recycle the page and return to MCSD they are all back in storage in only those few seconds. This process can go on forever. This occurs even when I disconnect from the internet. How is this possible, where are these companies storing this stuff on my computer and how do I remove them and/or stop them from self populating?

It has always worked seamlessly in the past, but in the past couple of weeks (January 2025), several sites that I regularly visit and have saved passwords for (nothing financial; I never save that stuff) have not auto-populated the password field and I have had to change passwords.  I did this on one site a couple of days ago, using my mobile and tablet (both Firefox web browsers), but when I went to log in to that site on my desktop Firefox browser today, it had not updated the password, and even when I typed in the new password, Firefox did not offer - as it normally would - to update the saved password.  I was logged in to Firefox at the time, so my account was live.  Anyone else having this problem?  Or know why it's happening? </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",Peaches_57_x
