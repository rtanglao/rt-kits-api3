A small blue dot appears near the query input area, and it interrupts the typing process. When the dot is active, I cannot type properly because the first keypress is consumed to deactivate the dot instead of being entered into the input field. </p><p>For example, if I try to type ""Hello,"" the ""h"" key is used to deactivate the dot, and only ""ello"" appears in the input box. This issue forces me to either click on the blue dot or press a key before I can start typing. </p><p>The problem is specific to Firefox and does not occur on other browsers like Chrome or Edge. I’ve already tried clearing the cache, disabling extensions, and updating Firefox, but the issue persists. </p><p>This behavior is quite frustrating and disrupts the user experience. Could you please look into it? </p><p>Thank you, </p>",firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",mahdi.shalchian

Anyone have any suggestions? We've cleared cache/history, restarted laptop, etc. This occurs both on recorded programs and live tv. We still seem to be able to get the commercials, although we tried watching on two different devices and the commercials were very different. Is it possible for Firefox to have been hacked but not Edge on the same device? Doesn't  sound plausible to me, but I'm not sure. This has happened since the last update to Firefox. We have Windows 10 64 bit. Firefox 134.0.2 or whatever the latest version is. We're stumped why it works on one browser but not the other.

Considering I delete cookies with fair regularity daily, this is unusual. The amount that I am seeing now, is around 190 advertising/Tracking cookies even when I only visit one or two sites. If I remove them and recycle the page and return to MCSD they are all back in storage in only those few seconds. This process can go on forever. This occurs even when I disconnect from the internet. How is this possible, where are these companies storing this stuff on my computer and how do I remove them and/or stop them from self populating?

It has always worked seamlessly in the past, but in the past couple of weeks (January 2025), several sites that I regularly visit and have saved passwords for (nothing financial; I never save that stuff) have not auto-populated the password field and I have had to change passwords.  I did this on one site a couple of days ago, using my mobile and tablet (both Firefox web browsers), but when I went to log in to that site on my desktop Firefox browser today, it had not updated the password, and even when I typed in the new password, Firefox did not offer - as it normally would - to update the saved password.
