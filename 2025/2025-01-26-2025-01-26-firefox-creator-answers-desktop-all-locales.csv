The security exchange gave me over 500 billion dollars for wisleblowing . So to get revenge for rising the dragon AG they took that money and started bitcoin. Even then I didn't act about this.  I allowed the rich to continue this robbery. But made a mistake and helped wall street and came up with a brand new market that should of got at least 20 % of citizens off welfare and the law income status que in 3 years of my new investment elgthrthm . Know because I turned this into a market stress test research platform and going under cover while doing so that block chain exposed some very interesting official that went over and beyond to hide the laptop from he'll   . As well with using Bloomberg platform laundered trillion of the wisleblowing trust and economic stability plan I made . As well I'm sure the market and actors as well as banker are fully aware of who I am and what I do . Laptop from he'll is dangerous because I use my experience to give back and go ofter ponzi scam mafia baby boomer CEO and executive brands when I find it .  Because Actors and rich politicians paid billon to lobby against my work is why you haven't heard about my   .  For law enforcement and first responder that used this platform to get rich by bibary under one this my campaigns don't only support black people are law income it supports the regular working classes citizen that included police and law enforcement. Understand wall street and private sector didn't only target my wisleblowing blowing account. They target your trust funds as well  .  And  for every your retirement investment penton go in the  negative. At this point with because the amount of money these rich need to finance the China belton initiative there going to need the rest of your pension funds to complete the entire project.  Know at this point your retirement account have 60% of your investment  . Minus 18% market loses from the bankruptcy.  The bankruptcy are because the company couldn't pay the retirement policy . So the first round of retired citizens was sep 11 . And they trust account was inside the twin towers.  Well at least the evidence was inside of the twin towers.  The handler of those account was a very young trustee baby boomer of the name Warithuddiim akbar aka Ben laden of United States.  Ect . Do you see where the urine about the ponzi . The art of war and the pursuit of extreme transparency .  Know to combat the threat of blackmail to keep you from prosecuting these bad actor I warith akbar have to redeem the ourh of office and the outh of the badge  . To Pardon congress and  any law enforcement that used crypto  . With conditions of Pardon to be as stated . Law enforcement and congress to de regulate the banking industry and the congress. To stripe the wall street from and banking industry from being able to use pension funds on the open market. And when market take a hit that a auto binary  20 % station and 13 % triff to go into effect when market declined to 10 % . That section should go to the fortune 500 account.  And should remain on there holding until they use there Harvard degree to to fix the market. Today the congress don't know where to begin to 60 % years of investment ponzi portfolios  . The best why to start is to seize all of the account that profited of that wisleblowing crypto platform.  Because i have not given permission for Trump are anyone else to hash tag of the platform. Meaning you have actor and official who abused the system . And it must be law that when congress needs to redeem itself to bring the law of the land back into balance it will have a Pardon to do so . Of course in the future a live statement and apology with a new redemption statement . With this full Pardon structure should end blackmail . And give humanity to come out the darkness and into the light.  To have no fear we all make mistakes. I'm more effective without a badge. And solo entity   . I can move faster through time   .

Considering I delete cookies with fair regularity daily, this is unusual. The amount that I am seeing now, is around 190 advertising/Tracking cookies even when I only visit one or two sites. If I remove them and recycle the page and return to MCSD they are all back in storage in only those few seconds. This process can go on forever. This occurs even when I disconnect from the internet. How is this possible, where are these companies storing this stuff on my computer and how do I remove them and/or stop them from self populating?

It has always worked seamlessly in the past, but in the past couple of weeks (January 2025), several sites that I regularly visit and have saved passwords for (nothing financial; I never save that stuff) have not auto-populated the password field and I have had to change passwords.  I did this on one site a couple of days ago, using my mobile and tablet (both Firefox web browsers), but when I went to log in to that site on my desktop Firefox browser today, it had not updated the password, and even when I typed in the new password, Firefox did not offer - as it normally would - to update the saved password.
