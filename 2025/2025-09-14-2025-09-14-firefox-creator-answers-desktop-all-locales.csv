I recently started using the new(ish) feature of tab groups and I absolutely love it. I was using STG (simple tab groups) before and that fine, but this is way nicer.  The only small annoyance I have, which could be a mistake on my side. Is that some of my tab groups are shortend seemingly randomly?  If I for example make a group named ""phone"" it is visible like that, but after a couple of hours it goes to ""ph..."".  I thought it may be sidebar width not being wide enough, but you can see in my screenshot that is not the case.

Nearly everything is better. That being said, there's one feature I used all the time on Chrome that I can't get working right here, and that's auto scroll. On Chrome, it worked no problem. When I clicked in the scroll wheel, it turned on auto scroll and would stay enabled until I clicked it again. One Firefox though, this isn't working right. When I click in the wheel here, it enables for a quick second before disabling itself. It's super annoying and makes it unusable. I found out it's because scrolling on the scroll wheel cancels auto scroll on Firefox, but not on chrome. So how do I make it so scrolling on the scroll wheel doesn't break auto scroll?

I was using it like this perfectly fine for years previous to now. </p><p>I dont have this issue when I'm actively using it, only when I tab away from it and specifically its not on screen. Once I tab back to firefox the ram usage immediately dips back down to normal. I have tried many things to try and solve this like doing a clean install of firefox, getting rid of extensions, clearing my browser cache, closing all other apps to verify it was just firefox, clearing my history, turning on hardware acceleration. Nothing seems to help, im really at a loss and I don't understand what changed besides it being updated in the past couple of months. </p><p>My computer is fairly heavy duty and I have 16gb of ddr4 ram that again was working perfectly fine to run firefox before these past couple of months. As a result of this issue however if left in the background for too long on accident firefox uses up all my idle ram and starts causing other programs to not be able to run and has even crashed my computer previously when trying to run a program like clip studio paint. </p><p>I have noticed that while running the firefox task manager there is definitely some difference in memory usage when i tab back in after letting it be in the background so I have attached screenshots of the regular usage while tabbed in and the captured usage when i tab back in. </p><p>Any possible solution is welcome because I really enjoy using firefox and i dont want to have to switch browsers unless absolutely necessary. </p>",firefox-14201;firefox-1420;windows-11;firefox;crashing-and-slow-performance;,firefox,crashing-and-slow-performance,en-US,"",jkjk2347
