This extension is required for accessing national digital certification services in Oman. </p><p>I am attempting to add the extension from the official portal: <a href=""http://idp.pki.ita.gov.om"" rel=""nofollow"">idp.pki.ita.gov.om</a>. When I try to initiate the installation from this page, it fails to add to the browser. I have already ensured that my browser is up to date. </p><p>This extension is essential for me to access important government and educational services, including those from the Ministry of Education (<a href=""http://moe.gov.om"" rel=""nofollow"">moe.gov.om</a>). </p><p>Could you please provide assistance or guide me on how to resolve this issue and successfully install the ""sconnect"" extension? </p><p>Thank you for your time and support. </p>",firefox-14201;firefox-1420;windows-11;firefox;extensions;,firefox,extensions,en-US,"",jamal.issa.zadjali

I was using it like this perfectly fine for years previous to now. </p><p>I dont have this issue when I'm actively using it, only when I tab away from it and specifically its not on screen. Once I tab back to firefox the ram usage immediately dips back down to normal. I have tried many things to try and solve this like doing a clean install of firefox, getting rid of extensions, clearing my browser cache, closing all other apps to verify it was just firefox, clearing my history, turning on hardware acceleration. Nothing seems to help, im really at a loss and I don't understand what changed besides it being updated in the past couple of months. </p><p>My computer is fairly heavy duty and I have 16gb of ddr4 ram that again was working perfectly fine to run firefox before these past couple of months. As a result of this issue however if left in the background for too long on accident firefox uses up all my idle ram and starts causing other programs to not be able to run and has even crashed my computer previously when trying to run a program like clip studio paint. </p><p>I have noticed that while running the firefox task manager there is definitely some difference in memory usage when i tab back in after letting it be in the background so I have attached screenshots of the regular usage while tabbed in and the captured usage when i tab back in. </p><p>Any possible solution is welcome because I really enjoy using firefox and i dont want to have to switch browsers unless absolutely necessary. </p>",firefox-14201;firefox-1420;windows-11;firefox;crashing-and-slow-performance;,firefox,crashing-and-slow-performance,en-US,"",jkjk2347
