I typically use the NG tool for this. The problem is that the output is partially jibberish (random symbols) which takes a lot of space and is difficult to navigate. I suspect the problem is with the emails that have attachments or embedded images. I could be wrong, but I suspect that these attachments are sort of corrrupting the output file. (Not a true corruption; but inserting thousands of needless characters that renders the file very difficult to use.) I need a way to export the email without attachments or images; all I need is date, recipient, and body. I have Googled this used AI and have tried many methods, but nothing is working. The last attempt was to export as EML (messages and index), which did seem to save the emails without attachments/embeds. But then for some reason I could not import those messages back into Thunderbird. So I'm running in circles.  Is there a simple way to create a CSV file that simply has date, recipient, message body (and possibly subject line), and excludes attachments and embedded images? </p>",firefox-1460;windows-10;firefox;undefined;,firefox,undefined,en-US,"",johnmkirby

I have two monitors and a couple weeks ago I installed Windows 11, after that Firefox still worked properly.

Two windows are supposed to on the primary monitor, and one on the secondary, but now Firefox will send all three windows to the secondary monitor. So I move the two windows to the primary monitor, exit Firefox gracefully, give it a moment to shut down properly, restart Firefox, and all the windows are where I left them. </p><p>Then when I restart the computer, Firefox shoves all the windows onto the seconday monitor again. </p><p>The primary monitor always come on first, and I alway wait to login to windows till both monitors are awake, so it's not like the one monitor is missing. I also have MonitorKeeper (<a href=""https://github.com/hunkydoryrepair/MonitorKeeper/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/hunkydoryrepair/MonitorKeeper/</a>) which normally works for keeping the windows on the right monitor, but it doesn't work when Firefox launches the windows on the wrong monitor. </p><p>All other programs have no problems like this and open where I left them.
