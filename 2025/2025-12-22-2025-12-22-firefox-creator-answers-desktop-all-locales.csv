I had the chat site open at the time, it didn't log me out of anything, and all of those logs were still there as far as I could tell. </p><p>Come today, I log on to the chat site, and all of my conversations are <strong>gone.</strong> And I would very much appreciate getting them back if possible. No I have not recently updated my F-list backups or anything of the sort, so my only option is to find where the (deleted) browser data is stored and recover it from there. Which I really, really hope is possible. </p><p>Please help. </p>",firefox-14601;firefox-1460;windows-11;firefox;recover-data;,firefox,recover-data,en-US,"",jpw94
