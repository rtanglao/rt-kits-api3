So, for the time being my problem seems to have fixed itself, in the best tradition of Sam Lowry. Thanks to all possibly trying to help, now or later. When I read the article about the up-coming ""AI-wars""  and their consequences... it makes me not want to even own a computer anymore.  Not to bother or insult all those dedicated to these things here, but we lived even without all that stuff. And could again, and will, after it all breaks down in the foreseeable future.

I have two monitors and a couple weeks ago I installed Windows 11, after that Firefox still worked properly. But since I've had issues with the DisplayPort connection for the primary monitor being unstable, this weekend I swapped it to HDMI, reset the primary/secondary monitor settings in WIndows accordingly, and now Firefox won't open its windows on the primary monitor on first launch after windows loads. </p><p>I've got three window at the moment, with multiple open tabs in each. Two windows are supposed to on the primary monitor, and one on the secondary, but now Firefox will send all three windows to the secondary monitor. So I move the two windows to the primary monitor, exit Firefox gracefully, give it a moment to shut down properly, restart Firefox, and all the windows are where I left them. </p><p>Then when I restart the computer, Firefox shoves all the windows onto the seconday monitor again. </p><p>The primary monitor always come on first, and I alway wait to login to windows till both monitors are awake, so it's not like the one monitor is missing. I also have MonitorKeeper (<a href=""https://github.com/hunkydoryrepair/MonitorKeeper/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/hunkydoryrepair/MonitorKeeper/</a>) which normally works for keeping the windows on the right monitor, but it doesn't work when Firefox launches the windows on the wrong monitor. </p><p>All other programs have no problems like this and open where I left them. It only seems to be the Firefox restore session that somehow fails to put the windows in place on first launch of the day. </p>",firefox-14601;firefox-1460;windows-11;firefox;customization;,firefox,customization,en-US,"",rene50
