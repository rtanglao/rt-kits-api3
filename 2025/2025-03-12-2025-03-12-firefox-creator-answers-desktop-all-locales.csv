Manifest V3 basically killing Ad Blockers was the last straw. </p><p>Anyway, I'm having an issue with Firefox and I can't figure out why - when I type in the start of a URL, it's sometimes suggesting sites that I've never visited / don't have book marked etc. </p><p>For example, if I type in d it automatically puts in <a href=""http://dotesports.com"" rel=""nofollow"">dotesports.com</a> - I've never visited this site, it's not bookmarked etc so I don't understand why it's being populated instead of sites I do visit that begin with the letter d. Please see attached screenshot Firefox D. </p><p>I've tried fiddling with my search settings, but it's not made a difference. Please see the attached screenshot. </p><p>I've checked my extensions, but they're all pretty standard / well known ones and none of them would be altering the search bar like this. I've attached a screenshot of my extensions. </p><p>Additionally, when I start typing in gm (expecting it to autofill <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a>) it never seems to do so, even though it's one of my most visited websites. It doesn't have this problem with other websites I frequently visit, only gmail - any idea why this is / how I can fix it? </p>",firefox;search-tag-and-share;,firefox,search-tag-and-share,en-US,"",Fish-E

A computer includes hardware and software. Hardware Is the device itself and its components, such as wires, cases switches, and electronic circuits. Software Consists of the programs and apps that instruct software the computer to perform tasks. Software processes data into meaningful information. 	The first generation of computers used vacuum tubes, cylindrical glass tubes that controlled the flow of electrons. the ENIAC and UNIAC are examples of these expensive machines. 	The next generation of computers replaced vacuum tubes with transistors, which were smaller cheaper, and more reliable. 	In the 1960s, computer engineers developed integrated circuits. in 1971, Ted Hoff and a team of engineers at intel and IBM introduced the microprocessor. a microprocessor is the brains of a computer, a chip that contains a central processing unit. Today microprocessors are often called processors for short. EXPLAIN THE IMPACT OF THE INTERNET OF THINGS AND EMBEDDED COMPUTERS. 	The internet of things (IoT) is an environment where processors are embedded in every product imaginable (things), and these things communicate with one another via the internet or wireless networks. alarm clocks, coffeemakers, thermostats, streetlights, navigation systems, and much more are enhanced by the growth of IoT. IoT – enable devices often are referred to as smart devices because of their ability to communicate, locate, and predict. smart devices often have associated apps to control and interact with them. 	An embedded computer is a computer that functions as one component in a larger product, and which has a specific purpose. embedded computers usually are small and have limited hardware on their own but enhance the capabilities of everyday devices. Embedded computers perform a specific function based on the requirements of the product in which they reside. for example, an embedded computer in a printer monitors the link levels, detects paper jams, and determines if the printer is out of paper. 	A kiosk is a freestanding booth usually placed in a public area that can contain a display device used to show information to the public or event attendees. IOT AT HOME. 	IOT enables you to manage devices remotely in your home, such as to start the washing machine at a certain time, view potential intruders via a webcam, or adjust the room temperature. personal ioT uses include wearable fitness trackers that record and send data to your smartphone or computer about your exercise activity, the number of steps you take in a day and your heart rate. 	All businesses and the areas of business can take advantage of IoT. manufacturing can use sensors to monitor processes and increase quality of finished goods. retail can use sensors to track inventory or send coupons to customer’s phones while they shop. 	A healthcare provider can use IoT to: •	Connect to a patient’s wearable blood pressures or glucose monitor. •	Send prescription updates and changes to pharmacy, and alert the patient of the prescription  •	Track and store data provided by wearable monitors to determine necessary follow-up care. •	Send the patient reminders about the upcoming appointments or tests the uses of IoT are expanding rapidly, and connected devices continue to impact and enhance business practices at all levels. DISCOVER USES FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. 	Artificial intelligence (Al) is the technological use of logic and prior experience to stimulate human intelligence. Al has a variety of capabilities, such as speech recognition, virtual reality, logical reasoning and creative responses. Computers with Al can collect information to make decisions, reach conclusions and combine information in new ways, which is a form of learning. The goal in creating Al devises is to minimize the gap between what a machine can do. EXPLORE THE IMPACT OF VIRTUAL REALITY. 	Virtual reality(VR) is the use of computers to simulate a real or imagined environment that appears as a three dimensional(3-D) space.  	Augmented reality(AR) is a type of VR that uses an image of an actual place or thing and adds digital information to it. </p><p>THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. 	The digital divide is the gap between those who have access to technology and its resources and information, especially on the internet and those who do not. 	You can use technology to help with productivity, learning, and future career growth. In your daily life you interact with embedded computers in stores, public transportation, your car or truck, and more. assistive technologies help people with disabilities to use technology. green computing practices reduce the impact of electronic waste on the planet. 	Some of the practical uses of Al include strategic gaming, military simulations, statistical predictions, and self – driving cars. For example, meteorologists use Al to analyses weather data patterns to create a list of possible outcomes form an upcoming weather event. </p><p>	Some of the ways you might interact with Ai on a daily basis include: 1.	Virtual assistants, which use voice recognition and search engines to answer, react, or reply to user requests. 2.	Social media and online adds, which track your data such as websites visited, and provide ads targeted to your personal interests. 3.	Video games that provide information to your virtual opponents based on your skill level and the past actions. 4.	Music and media streaming services, which recommended options base on your past listening and viewing choices. 5.	Smart cars, which automate many driving tusks such as managing speed and avoiding collisions. 6.	Navigation apps, which provide you with information about traffic and the best routes, along with preferred stops along your way. 7.	Security, such as using your fingerprint to access your phone, or facial recognition and motion – detection cameras that alert you to unusual or unauthorized visitors  	Another use of Ai is natural language processing. Natural language processing is a form of data input in which computers interpret and digitize spoken words or commands. Digital assistants like amazon’s Alexa or apples Siri use natural language processing to respond answers or perform a task, such as adding an item to a grocery list. 	Robotics is the science that combines engineering and technology to create and program robots. robots are useful in situations where it is impractical, dangerous, or inconvenient to use a human, such as cleanup of hazardous waste and materials, domestic uses such as vacuuming and agricultural and manufacturing uses. 	Imagine your life without technology and the internet. you probably use the internet daily to find information, connect with social media, make purchases, and more. Your devices can help you connect to the internet to perform these tasks.  The following are examples of how you might interact with technology, including embedded computers and the internet, in your daily life. 	An intelligent workplace uses technology to enable workers to connect to the company s network, communicate with each other, use productivity software and apps, meet via web conferencing and more. 	A college or university might use a learning management system (LMS) to set up web –based training sites where students can check their progress in a course, take practice tests, and exchange messages with the instructor or other students. 	Physicians use computers to monitor patient’s vital signs and research symptoms and diagnose. the mobile health (mHealth) trend refers to healthcare professionals using smartphones or tablets to access health records stored in the cloud, and patients using digitals devices to monitor their conditions and treatments, reducing the need for visits to the doctor’s office. for example, mhealth apps can track prescription information, text reminders to take medication, or refill the prescription.  	Manufacturers use computer aided manufacturing (CAM) to streamline production and ship products more quickly. with CAM, robots perform work that is too dangerous, detailed, or monotonous for people. in particular, they play a major role in automotive manufacturing  	A company’s computers monitor assembly lines and equipment using machine to machine (M2M) communications. 	Most medium and large businesses and organizations have an information technology(IT) department. IT staff are responsible for ensuring that all the computer operations, mobile  write quiz questions base on the information above </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",banetitus74

Long story short, the best I could do was have my Microsoft account suspended. Now I am making new accounts for everything, including here. But my new account is attempting to sync with the old one. I don't want that to happen. I can't sign in to the old one to remove it since I can no longer access it. I am deathly afraid that this account will also be hacked due to it attempting to sync with the old one. Is that possible? And is there a way to remove the old one. I don't think my mind will be at ease till I can have a fresh start. I have requested Microsoft to completely delete the hacked account instead of simply suspending it, but I am unsure if that will do anything here. </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1717555;,theoliverhenderson
