I am deathly afraid that this account will also be hacked due to it attempting to sync with the old one. Is that possible? And is there a way to remove the old one. I don't think my mind will be at ease till I can have a fresh start.

I have been to S. Anthony's on emergency basis and have pulmonary fibrosis which is improving. I made a decision not to use Ofev but am instead using herbs and doing rehab, planning a long term rehab program which is with one provide on line. I try to walk daily but don't always manage. I am easily fatigued mentally as a result of a brain injury in 1998 which still affects me. </p><p>I am hoping for a doctor who is intelligent, understands medications and various issues. I have had heart problems, both jaws replaced, also knee and other issues related to arthritis, so I have chronic pain, swelling in ankles, and other issues. </p><p>My records are at U of C hospital where I have gone for many years but now need to not go to numerous clinics across town. Nor do I want multiple providers. I'd love to do all the work everywhere. </p><p>I am late by almost two months for Prolia injection and saw a rheumatologist but her referral didn't count because she wasn't with U of C. She realized that a pt can't miss the injections for a year. </p><p>But in spite of all that, I want a compassionate primary care doctor that will listen and be there longer than just a brief time. </p><p>Will be doing serious pf rehab and exercise program as requested by pulmonologist. </p><p>I am a retired professor and still working as a professional writer. But I feel pretty helpless and uncomfortable in terms of getting medical health and hoping I will have more confidence with dr. at S. A. or Common Spirit.  Thank you for your time and I appreciate you for reading all this and being a caring physician. Also, you are highly referred by a friend of mine. </p><p>Thanks, Linda </p>",firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,1717558;1717561;,horsemustang
