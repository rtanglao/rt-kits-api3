I can sign in on Microsoft Edge, or on the Safari browser on my phone, so this is clearly a Firefox specific problem.  When I try to sign in, the page skips the option that verifies my identity and goes straight to a message saying ""Failed to verify your identity, Try again"" without allowing the verification to occur.  The verification would occur if the page would allow it to, as it does in the other browsers I mentioned.  This was working fine last time I logged in a few days ago, so this is a new problem.  I could switch over to Edge, but would prefer to use Firefox, if I can.  Please help me.

This can happen multiple times sometimes as a short as typing only one character before the cursor jumps and I cannot further type.  It has now become soooo annoying that I am thinking of changing browers after having using FireFox for as long as I can remember.  This does NOT occur when using any other browser, including Edge and Chrome, so it is not to AOL webmail app but rather something in FireFox.   </p><p>Has anyone else reported the same?

I tried recovering an old profile, but the reboot erased everything, so there are no old profiles or local data left on the device. Since my Firefox account has always been connected to the same email, I was hoping all of my data would still be recoverable, but I haven’t had any success.
