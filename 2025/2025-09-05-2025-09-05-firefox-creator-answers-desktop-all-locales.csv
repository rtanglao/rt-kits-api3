It closes MOST of the tab group, leaving the last used one active along with a number to the right such as ""+3"" to show there are three more tabs hidden. This completely defeats the purpose of being able to close the tab group in the first place. In order to get around this, you have to click another tab to make it active and only then will the tab group you tried to close, actually close.

This is what they told me: </p><p>""<em>Unfortunately this is being caused by Firefox itself. </em> </p><p>It is preventing a critical WindowBlinds dll from loading into the process that owns the file open dialog and in doing so is breaking Windows theming support for that which is why the menu shows incorrectly. </p><p>They would need to stop blocking wbload.dll in child processes.  If they had issues with that then they should have contacted us so we could investigate a solution.<em>"" </em> </p><p>It would be great if there could be some fix for this.

I’ve been a Firefox user for over five years, always tied to the same Firefox account email. My laptop recently had to be repaired, and the technicians performed a full reboot. After getting it back and reinstalling Firefox, all my data was gone. I tried recovering an old profile, but the reboot erased everything, so there are no old profiles or local data left on the device. Since my Firefox account has always been connected to the same email, I was hoping all of my data would still be recoverable, but I haven’t had any success. This represents over five years of saved information, and I really need help to restore it. Can Firefox support assist me in recovering my data through my account? Thanks in advance. </p>",firefox-14201;firefox-1420;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;sync-and-backup-confusion;,firefox,sync-and-backup-confusion,en-US,1762055;,zaradarini
