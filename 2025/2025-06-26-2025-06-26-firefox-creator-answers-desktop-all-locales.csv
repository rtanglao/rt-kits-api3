That's not the case here. Nothing in the UI indicates there's a problem. Many of the add-ons have the recommended trophy icon. I removed and reinstalled uBlock Origin and Dark Reader.

Today, when I reopened my laptop, the Firefox window that was open instantly closed. I tried opening Firefox again, but it kept opening and closing immediately. It would show that there was an open window of it, but the window itself wouldn't open. It would run in the background but never actually open. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling, but it still did the same thing. Does anyone know a solution to this? </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1744862;,connorjm5045
