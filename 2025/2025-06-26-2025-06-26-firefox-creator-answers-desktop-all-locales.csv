I still have Windows 7 but always the latest version of Firefox, and everything else works fine in Firefox (including other weather forecast websites thankfully).  A page of Met Office headings appears instead of the forecast. </p><p>I emailed them yesterday and this is the reply: 'To see the public website in the previously recognised format, you would need to upgrade the browser version you are using or the Operating System of your device. This issue is affecting users on unsupported mobile devices (phones/tablets) as well as those on PCs and Laptops with unsupported software on them.  As per our Met Office Website Policy page - which details the level of support we offer and to which browsers – we currently only support the latest two versions of Chrome and Safari; the latest version of Edge and Samsung Internet; finally the latest version of Firefox only being partially supported. This policy has been developed to comply with the World Wise Web Consortium (W3C) AA Accessibility Standards. It also details the Decision Tree of which versions would continue to be supported or no longer supported  We appreciate this may be frustrating, but without updating or replacing this unsupported software/hardware you will be unable to view the public weather website in the correct format.'  </p><p>Since it says 'the latest version of Firefox only being partially supported' I guess there is nothing else I can do to access their forecast (apart from getting new PC and using Windows 11, which I will be doing later this year).
