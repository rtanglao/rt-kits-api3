Even tried deleting all cookies on Firefox, which was a bit of a pain, and it was no help. </p><p>I did read up on some people encountering a similar issue that could be fixed by deleting the Slack entry in ""about:serviceworkers,"" but this did not help here. </p><p>The only extension I'm running is uBlock Origin, which I've been running for probably as long as I've been using Firefox, and that has never presented an issue before either. </p><p>Would appreciate any help or advice on the matter. </p>",firefox-1430;windows-10;firefox;app-crash;needsinfo;,firefox,app-crash,en-US,1764934;,jaredwynne88
