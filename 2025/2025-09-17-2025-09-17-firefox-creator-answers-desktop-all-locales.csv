After refreshing and restarting the browser or sometimes even after restarting my device, everything is working properly again for a while.

I've seen some other people having the same issue from like July, this problem however started with me around the end of August.  Every time I try to log into my hotmail I get the screen attached.  The only way to get around it is to delete the cookies/cache related to <a href=""http://Live.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Live.com</a> and try again. Also, right now, I have to ""sign out"" from my email to avoid saving cookies or cache related to my login information - otherwise, I will have to do the process again (of deleting the cache/cookies).  The thing is, I've always used Firefox to check my hotmail, and I wouldn't log out of my hotmail and check back in quickly any time I want to - the process now is getting sluggish.  I've contacted Microsoft (or let's just say, tried to) but I kept going in loops and never got an answer. So I'm here in hope I get any ideas (and I have a feeling that it is something from Microsoft's side and not from Firefox side because the problem occurred suddenly and not after a specific update to Firefox). </p><p>Thanks </p>",firefox-1150;windows-7;cookies-history;,firefox,cookies-history,en-US,1764973;1765074;1765130;1765139;1765140;,lonelytj
