I’ve checked the versions and &gt; 115.11esr should be patched.

Since this is probably important – FontMatrix is *not* working (no JS), original PoC (<a href=""https://codeanlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/poc_generalized_CVE-2024-4367.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://codeanlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/poc_generalized_CVE-2024-4367.pdf</a>) is also *not* working.  I also wasn’t able to call an external script and so far haven’t found any path to exploit it beyond an alertbox. However, it still bothers me a lot and I’d like to know whether it’s the correct, expected behavior with FF+pdf.js, is it a vulnerability, or maybe my browser was somehow corrupted or is using some other mechanism that’s not within your control (my settings? about:config?). </p><p>Steps to re-create:  1.
