From what I understand, I cannot access them both from the same browser, so I have Google Chrome for one and Firefox for the other. However, I have had a lot of trouble printing invoices and shipping labels from Etsy. When I hit print in Etsy, the invoices and labels are sent to Word and then there is some corruption. Yesterday, the shipping label was too small and the top portion was filled with Chinese language and not English. The rest of the label was in English. Is there a reason why the forms will not print directly from Etsy in Firebox? Transferring the files to Word (this is done by Firefox) makes a process that should be quick and easy a pain in the neck. Can this be resolved or I am going to need to use another browser. Thanks.
