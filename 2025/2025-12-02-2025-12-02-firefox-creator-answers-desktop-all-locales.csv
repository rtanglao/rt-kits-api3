Recently, Firefox has been becoming unresponsive quite often, and the Activity Monitor shows significantly high memory usage. For context, I typically have two Firefox windows running simultaneously, with approximately 5 tabs open in each window (10 tabs total). This is when I notice the performance degradation and high memory usage. </p><p>To help you investigate, I’ve attached: </p> <ul><li> A screenshot of the memory usage in Activity Monitor when Firefox is running. </li><li> A screenshot of the extensions currently enabled in Firefox. </li></ul> <p>I am open to suggestions, such as disabling or removing certain extensions if they might be causing conflicts. However, I wanted to report this issue first to understand if this is a known problem or if there are optimizations planned for Firefox on Apple Silicon Macs. </p><p>Let me know if you need additional details, such as Firefox version, macOS version, or specific steps to reproduce the issue. I’d be happy to provide any information that can help resolve this. </p><p>Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to your response. </p><p>Best regards, Hemant </p>",firefox-1450;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;app-responsiveness;,firefox,app-responsiveness,en-US,1783435;,cshemant.tripathi
