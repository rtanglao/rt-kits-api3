Occasionally this function breaks, when it does it breaks for every tab in the browser window including the setting, I haven't found a singular or specific cause yet. I have troubleshooted it in the community, the prevailing logic being that themes or extensions are causing some incompatibility, so I have reset everything to defaults and made sure I have no extensions loaded, and the problem persists. I can temporarily fix the issue by going into my settings and turning hardware acceleration on and off again. I am writing this to hopefully point out this bug as clearly as possible in hopes that your programmers can fix it in a future update, as repeatedly turning a setting on and off to ""fix"" it might not be the best solution in the long term. </p>",firefox-1430;windows-11;firefox;app-responsiveness;,firefox,app-responsiveness,en-US,"",rekumaelements86

Sometime fairly recently it has changed to 4. I don't know why nor can I remember which line in about;config I used to change it. I think the line was ""browser.newtabpage.activity-stream.topSitesRows"" but when I try to change it, it does nothing. At the time I first changed it, the max it would change to was 5. The max now appears to be 4 if I did it correctly. Your help would be appreciated. </p>",firefox-14304;firefox-1430;linux;firefox;dashboard;,firefox,dashboard,en-US,"",wyoungman88
