I have a website with a background video that autoplays made with Squarespace. The video plays fine in every browser, except maybe 10-20% of the time will only pull up the spinning white wheel with black background but just in Firefox. I have been through all troubleshooting, DRM settings reset, Cache cleared, hardware acceleration turned off, browser up to date - but none of it gives me a permanent solution. The video itself is up to correct spec in Squarespace, does anyone know what I'm missing? Thank you in advance. </p>",firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",brianjamesrsi7

Occasionally this function breaks, when it does it breaks for every tab in the browser window including the setting, I haven't found a singular or specific cause yet. I have troubleshooted it in the community, the prevailing logic being that themes or extensions are causing some incompatibility, so I have reset everything to defaults and made sure I have no extensions loaded, and the problem persists. I can temporarily fix the issue by going into my settings and turning hardware acceleration on and off again. I am writing this to hopefully point out this bug as clearly as possible in hopes that your programmers can fix it in a future update, as repeatedly turning a setting on and off to ""fix"" it might not be the best solution in the long term. </p>",firefox-1430;windows-11;firefox;app-responsiveness;,firefox,app-responsiveness,en-US,"",rekumaelements86
