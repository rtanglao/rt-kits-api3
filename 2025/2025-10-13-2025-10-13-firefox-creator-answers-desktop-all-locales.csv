Siccome ho avuto bisogno di avere delle password che avevo salvato nell'account, ho fatto log in dal pc di casa. Una volta usate le password ho fatto log out ma a quel punto Firefox è diventato neutro, senza nessuna personalizzazione. Come faccio a ripristinare le impostazioni, i preferiti ecc. che avevo in Firefox sul pc di casa prima che accedessi con l'account? Grazie. </p>",firefox-1430;windows-10;firefox;recover-data;,firefox,recover-data,it,"",bianchetti.luca

Occasionally this function breaks, when it does it breaks for every tab in the browser window including the setting, I haven't found a singular or specific cause yet. I have troubleshooted it in the community, the prevailing logic being that themes or extensions are causing some incompatibility, so I have reset everything to defaults and made sure I have no extensions loaded, and the problem persists. I can temporarily fix the issue by going into my settings and turning hardware acceleration on and off again. I am writing this to hopefully point out this bug as clearly as possible in hopes that your programmers can fix it in a future update, as repeatedly turning a setting on and off to ""fix"" it might not be the best solution in the long term. </p>",firefox-1430;windows-11;firefox;app-responsiveness;,firefox,app-responsiveness,en-US,"",rekumaelements86
