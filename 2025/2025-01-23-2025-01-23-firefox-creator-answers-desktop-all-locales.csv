This has worked perfectly fine until a week ago. Now when I start up my computer and open firefox, the window opens briefly and then closes on its own. I've checked and theres no crash reports. Each time this happens I open firefox again and get a completely new window and I have to go into history recently closed windows to get the original window open and then take great care to make sure the other window is closed first. The first time this happened I was really unfortunate and lost tabs I had opened for years.
