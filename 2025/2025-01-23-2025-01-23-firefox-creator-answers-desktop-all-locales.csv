Most (if not all) of these videos did play with audio in firefox prior to this reinstall. </p><p>Firstly, I'm pretty sure this is not a windows sound mixer issue since many videos on the same page and tab play back with audio just fine in firefox. The same goes for it not relating to the firefox setting 'Speaker selection', under (burger) &gt; settings &gt; privacy &amp; security &gt; Permissions because videos of different formats (or using different players) on the same page play back audio fine. The tab is not muted.  Again, some videos on the same browser tab play audio fine; some of a particular format or player only play the video, while missing the audio (and where Edge plays the same video with audio). </p><p>Another common and potentially relevant issue I've seen is that, this being a 'Windows 11 N"" install, it was initially missing the settings &gt; system &gt; optional features &gt; Media feature pack, but that is now something I've successfully added.  I should add that windows did report problems when I initially tried to add the media feature pack but, after a very long delay, it eventually appeared to succeed when I ran a couple of DISM incantations that I think ended with - ""dism /online /add-capability /capabilityname:Media.MediaFeaturePack~~~~0.0.1.0"" </p><p>I have the 'Play DRM-controlled content' setting enabled. </p><p>Comparing the firefox vs edge video playback on this video test page - 	<a href=""https://tools.woolyss.com/html5-audio-video-tester/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://tools.woolyss.com/html5-audio-video-tester/</a> I get the following results (don't know how to get it formatted/aligned correctly, sorry) - </p><pre>                           FF vid    FF audio    Edge vid    Edge audio av1-opus-sita.webm          Works     Works       Works       Works vp9-vorbis-spring.webm      Works     Works       Works       Works vp8-vorbis-sintel.webm      Works     Works       Works       Works avc-aac-nerdist-friends.mp4 Works     <strong>MISSING</strong>     Works       Works avc-aac-big-buck-bunny.m4v  Works     <strong>MISSING</strong>     Works       Works avc-mp3-sita.mov            Works     Works       Works       Works </pre> <p>And perhaps also relevant is that there's also a difference in the audio-only samples further down the table on the same page - </p><pre>                   FF audio   Edge audio audio-sample.mp3    Works      Works audio-sample.weba   Works      Works audio-sample.ogg    Works      Works audio-sample.opus   Works      Works audio-sample.flac   Works      Works audio-sample.wav    Works      Works audio-sample.m4a    <strong>FAILS</strong>      Works ac192.mp3           Works      Works spoonradio-hd.aac   <strong>FAILS</strong>      Works audio.opus          Works      Works </pre> <p>Also, every '<a href=""http://v.redd.it"" rel=""nofollow"">v.redd.it</a>' / reddit-video-player video plays the video fine but has no sound when using firefox but plays both sound and video fine with Edge.
