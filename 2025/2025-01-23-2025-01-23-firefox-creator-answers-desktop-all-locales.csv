This has worked perfectly fine until a week ago. Now when I start up my computer and open firefox, the window opens briefly and then closes on its own. I've checked and theres no crash reports. Each time this happens I open firefox again and get a completely new window and I have to go into history recently closed windows to get the original window open and then take great care to make sure the other window is closed first. The first time this happened I was really unfortunate and lost tabs I had opened for years. I would really like a functioning browser again. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",43kaylagomez

Unless I click the home button (or click another bookmark), the browser just times out without loading anything. I tried opening in troubleshoot mode but the same thing happens there too -- nothing loads. I tried refreshing, but all that did was change the toolbar a bit (removed the home button, so I needed to restore it). I haven't been able to find anything in the settings that would account for this behavior. Help! </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",parredward
