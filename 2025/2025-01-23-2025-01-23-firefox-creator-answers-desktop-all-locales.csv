Unless I click the home button (or click another bookmark), the browser just times out without loading anything. I tried opening in troubleshoot mode but the same thing happens there too -- nothing loads. I tried refreshing, but all that did was change the toolbar a bit (removed the home button, so I needed to restore it). I haven't been able to find anything in the settings that would account for this behavior. Help! </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",parredward
