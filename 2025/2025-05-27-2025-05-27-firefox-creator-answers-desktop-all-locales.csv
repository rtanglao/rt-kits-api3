At the same time Chrome works fine. Mac Mail has become intermittent as well. I have uninstalled Norton products and changed Network proxy settings many times. Nothing helps.

Firefox on my android phone continues to work properly when using my Wifi router -the same router my Mac Studio connects to the internet with. I can access my third party mail service via Firefox on my android phone. Both FireTV devices work. I am at my wit's end.
