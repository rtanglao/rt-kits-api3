While on my both laptops it looks as expected, on my desktop the group icon looks disproportional (there is more free space at the bottom of the box than on the top). This appearance I consider ""wrong"" - screenshot 1. When I make sidebar wide it looks alright though - screenshot 2. Screenshot 3 shows how it looks on my laptops which I consider ""correct"". The only difference I can think of right now between my desktop and laptops is Windows scale settings. But when I set the same on my desktop the visual issue is still there.
