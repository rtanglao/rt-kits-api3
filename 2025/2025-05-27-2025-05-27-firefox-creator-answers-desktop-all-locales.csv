After this, I noticed that all my Multi-Account Containers were still listed, but all cookies associated with those containers were completely lost. I understand this might be caused by incompatibility between Firefox versions and profile structures. </p><p>I have located files such as: - `cookies.sqlite` - `containers.json` - `sessionstore-backups/upgrade.jsonlz4-*` </p><p>However, none of the cookies appear to have `originAttributes` associated with containers anymore (only empty strings). Is there any way to recover or reassign the lost cookies to their original containers? </p><p>This incident has affected multiple work logins and multi-account configurations I heavily depend on. </p><p>Thank you for any support or tools you can provide to assist in restoring the lost data. </p><p>Best regards, Thang </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",lush3ng
