In previous versions of Firefox for iPadOS, there was a setting labeled ""Block images<em>.  When turned on, it would block images from loading on web pages.  In the current version, I am unable to locate this option anymore. </em> </p><p>My questions are:  1. Is this option now located elsewhere, or has it been removed entirely?    2. If it is still available, how do you access it?   3. If it is gone, how do we ask Mozilla to bring it back? </p><p>I will appreciate any help you can offer on this question. </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",skykimball
