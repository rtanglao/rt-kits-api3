Sometimes the icons show up, but sometimes only the globe appears. I've tried everything, including installing the ""Bookmark Icon Loader"" and ""Bookmark Tab Icon Changer"" add-ons, but it didn't help. Is there a way I can change them manually in the browser itself without any add-ons? </p>",linux;firefox;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",olegdizzvolkov

I've attached screenshots. </p><p>These issues do not appear when using Chrome. Really annoying because Firefox is my default browser and now I will have to do my WordPress development using Chrome.
