When I tried importing my password (and all my other data) inside of Edge via Edge, it only brought in 235 passwords from Firefox where I have 422.  So I would assume if I used and imported my passwords to Edge via a CSV file instead that all my passwords would populate in Edge not roughly half of them. </p><p>Could you please tell me how to create a password CSV file in Firefox to use in Edge? </p><p>Many thanks in adabce </p>",firefox-14201;firefox-1420;windows-11;firefox;backup-data;,firefox,backup-data,en-US,"",StevenLAX16

But, I want to keep it so that links that I open in Firefox in new tabs do not instantly get switched to. I see there's a option in the settings, ""When you open a link, image or media in a new tab, switch to it immediately"" - basically, I want the ""switch to it immediately"" functionality for images and media that I drag from my desktop into Firefox, but not for links that I open while using the browser, similar to how Chrome handles it.
