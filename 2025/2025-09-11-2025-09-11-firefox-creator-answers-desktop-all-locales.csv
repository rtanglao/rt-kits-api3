The title might not have been clear - I want to make it so that when I open a photo or video in Firefox, the tab instantly switches to that new media. But, I want to keep it so that links that I open in Firefox in new tabs do not instantly get switched to. I see there's a option in the settings, ""When you open a link, image or media in a new tab, switch to it immediately"" - basically, I want the ""switch to it immediately"" functionality for images and media that I drag from my desktop into Firefox, but not for links that I open while using the browser, similar to how Chrome handles it. Is there any way that I can replicate this behavior in Firefox? Thank you. </p>",firefox-14201;firefox-1420;windows-10;firefox;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",roneld3444
