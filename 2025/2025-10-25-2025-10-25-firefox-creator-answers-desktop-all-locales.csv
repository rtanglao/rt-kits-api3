On Macbook Pro, I messed up all sessionstore folders and files. </p><pre>After a recent Firefox crash (maybe due to repeated bad connections and using a VPV in China), I lost all my previous tabs (more than 100) and I also didn't see the ""Restore previous session"" in History.  </pre> <p>I was able to find 'previous.jsonlz4' (and other *.jsonlz4) files on my October 11 Time Machine backup. However, after replacing, renaming, deleting various *.jsonlz4 files, Firefox, after reopening it, disregards any changes (deletions or new tabs) i made on the my last session, and return to the October 11 situation. I know i messed things up (see attached screenshot), but how can i clean that mess? </p><p>Thanks, Amos </p>",firefox;recover-data;,firefox,recover-data,en-US,"",amos654
