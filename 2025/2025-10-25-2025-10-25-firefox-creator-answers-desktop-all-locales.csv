What I find most annoying is that not only does Firefox issue a warning (that's fine) but there is then no way to proceed by accepting the danger (none in this case) and proceeding to login to my own Router that I have just purchased. So, the only way to set up and subsequently administer my Router is to use either MS Edge or Brave who provide a warning but then allow me to accept the risk and proceed to the Router's configuration settings. ASUS do provide a Certificate which I have added to my Trusted Root Directory and also to the Firefox Certificate repository but apparently, for reasons I don't understand, the Certificate, although issued by ASUS, is not signed by a certified authority that is acceptable to Firefox. Does anyone know how to get around this problem using the Firefox browser? Just why Firefox think it is OK to block me from accessing my own Router is beyond me!! This is equal to the arrogance often displayed by Microsoft i.e. we'll give you what WE think you need not what you need. By the way - I have also written to ASUS to ask them why on earth that don't issue a suitable Certificate for a $250 Router. </p>",firefox-1440;windows-11;firefox;web-certificates;,firefox,web-certificates,en-US,"",Sandgroper48
