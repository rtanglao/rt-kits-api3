A few days ago I was greeted by a fresh, blank install of Firefox and had to set everything up and sign in as I usually would on a fresh system install. Today, however, I somehow managed to launch both of them at once (I don't know how, as I just use the UI shortcut). After closing both fully, I can now only start the ""old"" one via the shortcut. </p><p>OS: Bluefin / Fedora 42.20, Gnome 48.6 </p><p>According to the list of flatpaks, only one is installed. Unfortunately that's roughly where my knowledge of Linux ends, so I can't troubleshoot this further. Help will be apprecciated, as I don't want to roll a die on which of these will start up every time I reboot. </p>",firefox-1440;linux;firefox;install;,firefox,install,en-US,"",erazem.jurkovic

I’m currently learning Vietnamese and often read articles with translations to improve my comprehension. I also use Reader Mode with voice playback to practice my listening and speaking skills. </p><p>Today, I accidentally pressed Play after translating a news article — and to my surprise, a Vietnamese voice started reading the English text aloud! I tried changing the voice settings, but it seems the model is stuck (Standard = Vietnamese). And it can be fun, listening to that Viet voice trying to pronounce English words, but in the end, it's of no use. I would rather prefer a matching englisch voice modell, in case I should decide to listen to the translated text, one day. </p><p>It’s not a big issue, but I thought this might be something worth passing along to the development team. </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",firefox-1440;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;listen;,firefox,listen,en-US,"",doneka355
