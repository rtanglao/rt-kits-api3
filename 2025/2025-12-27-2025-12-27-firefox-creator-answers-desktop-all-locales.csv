I have windows 11.  It freezes so badly that I have to hold down the on/off button until it goes off.   I looked it up outside of Firefox help and, per suggestions, turned off the hardware accelerator.  That seemed to work for a little while but now it's happening again with greater frequency.  There doesn't seem to be any exact situation that causes it which makes it very hard to diagnose.  But it's enough that I'm thinking of looking for another browser so any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you! </p>",firefox-14601;firefox-1460;windows-11;firefox;app-crash;,firefox,app-crash,en-US,"",JPK50

Apparently Firefox updated or something (as my mac has not been updated recently) and this new verision has added things I do not want, but more importantly, it took away all my hundreds of bookmarks! I am using a 2017 iMac which can no longer update to Mojave or whatever is current, so I am using the most recent update for Ventura (13.7.8) aparently they are still coming up with updates for Ventura for people like me, as I did have an update maybe a couple months ago, give or take. This happened (losing all my hundreds of bookmarks) maybe 1 or 2 weeks ago. I asked for help, and someone sent me instructions, which looked similar to the articles I just read which were suggested, but I followed, and there were no files to restore from. I do not do anything on the cloud and I dont want to use cloud. I aslo do not want my mac to sync with my iPhone I do not want them communicatng at all. However, one of the ways to get my bookmarks said I needed to sync with my phone, so despite not wanting to, I did. (This is not today, this was when I lost my bookmarks a couple weeks ago.) Of course there was no point syncing to my phone as I had never synced with it before and my bookmarks were not there. I believed they were in my computer somewhere. They guy tried helping me but nothing he said worked. I kept going back and forth along the lines of what he said, and tried different things. after like 3 or 4 hours, somehow, something I did worked, and I got all my bookmarks back! (Bear in mind, this incident was a couple weeks ago, this is not today.) But I don't know what I did. Now, today, I did something which again messed everything up! I have like 3 or 4 different firefox logos/ icons in my doc, which in my case runs along the left side of my screen. I aways click the top most firefox and it comes up and I start using it. For some reason, I clicked the other icons today, and different firefox windws came up. These were different colors, and they had like 30 different pictures of articles you might want to read, grouped into General,  politics, health, financial, MLB, NFL, NBA, entertainment etc. I have seen this before on a new mac mini, but it never showed up on my old iMac. But when I clicked this other firefox icon in my doc, this is what came up, apparently a newer version of firefox? Well I just wanted to stick with my old reliable firefox that had all my bookmarks, but apparetnly this new version of firefox took over, because now when i click the top most firefox icon as I always have before, my old version without all the articles you may want to read (just blank page with the usual firefox places to type in your search) would no longer come up, just this new version with all the pictures of 30 articles you might want to read, and once again, all my bookmarks are now gone! This is maddening! Why does firefox just delete evertything without my permission, and how can I get them back? I click on the 3 lines then bookmarks then manage bookmarks then restore, but once again, there is nothing there to restore. It is not on my phone. I did not do cloud.I did back up using time machine but I suspect once again that they are here somewhere in my computer. How can I get my bookmarks back and my old version of firefox back?
