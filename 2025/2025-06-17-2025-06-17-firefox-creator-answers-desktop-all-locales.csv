This was after clearing the cache of all files. I've only had this (new) machine a couple months.  </p><p>Short version: Sites have ""cookies"" from 200kb to as much as 34MB! For many of the sites over 3MB I have no account and have visited them only briefly.  </p><p>To be clear, I don't care about the space being used. It's trivial. But what the heck is FFox storing and calling it ""cookies""? Last I checked, a site was still limited to 4K size cookies and perhaps 50 per domain. So how are we getting to MB+ sized ""cookies"" per site?  Again, the cache was cleared, so what's left aside from trivial cookie files of &lt;4KB?  </p><p>Desktop; Windows 11; Firefox 139.0.4 64 bit </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",MozzieBob
