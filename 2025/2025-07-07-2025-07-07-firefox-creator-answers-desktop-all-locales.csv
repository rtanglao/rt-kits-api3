Estou a utilizar<em> o </em>Firefox 140.0.2 (64-bits)<em> numa instalação recente do Arch Linux, instalado a partir do repositório oficial e, por algum motivo, as abas não são restauradas ao iniciar uma nova sessão. As configurações encontram-se ajustadas (Geral -&gt; Iniciar -&gt; Abrir abas e janelas anteriores), mas sem efeito. Para fins de referência, outros navegadores instalados comportam-se normalmente em relação a este aspecto. Viria a ser um erro, ou há alguma medida adicional necessária para correto funcionamento desta configuração? </em> </p><p>Desde já, agradeço pelas considerações. </p>",firefox-14002;firefox-1400;firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,pt-BR,"",rogerjgamito
