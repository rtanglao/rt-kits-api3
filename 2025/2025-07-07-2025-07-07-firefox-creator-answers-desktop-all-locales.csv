I'm always listening to YouTube I'm listening music while I'm working or I'm doing task on Firefox I used to have no problem I just Open YouTube and let it play on auto play and it goes no matter what. About 6 months ago I started to experiment some problems the video stop all the time even if I have a playlist going on like 50 song one after another it will stop once in a while for no reason. It pissed me off so much that I have to change my browser by default and I don't like other browser I use always Firefox with DuckDuckGo so when I'm trap to use other browser I get mad the only one that functions very good it's on edge Microsoft and seriously I cannot stand this…  I'm forced to use YouTube only on edge it's the only place that it works no matter what it never stop. It used to be a little arrow in the bottom of the screen, a button that you can click on and off to Auto play or not, this button disappear it's not even there no more. This button Auto Play it's not there in Edge or Google Chrome but YouTube works for them not for Firefox so what is the problem it's not the setting is it YouTube that's got problem with Firefox?  I don't know, it must be a way, a back door because I need to go back with Firefox I need to go back with DuckDuckGo. I'm pissed because I have to leave just because of that and that it's no compromise for me my music will pass before everything else. I don't feel like asking question to the community because it takes months before they answer you if they do. It's no customer service for Firefox or Mozilla whatsoever they don't answer you they don't talk to you they don't fucking care and this is another thing that pisses me off because they have a good thing going on but they don't care about the people. This was, this is what I did so far: Disable Hardware Acceleration ""Performance"" section. </p><pre>I unchecked ""Use recommended performance settings."" </pre> <p>I unchecked ""Use hardware acceleration when available.""

Many of the tools and extensions I rely on for my daily work are either not available on Firefox or do not function as they do on Google Chrome. </p><p>I understand that Firefox has its own extension ecosystem and architecture, but I sincerely hope that your team could explore a way to bring full compatibility or at least broader support for Chrome extensions.
