From what I can glean from searching online, the fixes either involve messing with the Registry or uninstalling/reinstalling Firefox, but even these measures do NOT prevent the multiple instances from recurring with further updates.  The Control Panel only shows one instance of Firefox. </p><p>What is the best approach to this problem?  A ""fix-it"" tool would be most welcome. </p>",firefox-1400;windows-11;firefox;install;,firefox,install,en-US,"",zzsborusz

But I tried looking up my history and bookmarks today, and they're both gone. History won't update, and I can't add new bookmarks. In-page autocomplete still works. </p><p>My Firefox version is 140.0.2 for MacOS on an M1 Mac Mini. I'd recently update my computer's operating system before I noticed the issue, and I had to do a hard power-down a day or two afterward. I do not know if the issue began before or after the hard shutdown. </p>",firefox-1400;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",ioun315

For most shortcuts, if you click the three dots you get a menu of: Pin Edit Open in a New Window Open in a New Private Window Dismiss Delete From History </p><p>This is the menu you get for almost all shortcuts EXCEPT for Amazon. For the Amazon shortcut you get: Pin Dismiss </p><p>That's it. No opportunity to edit it. And if you click on the shortcut, it doesn't take you to <a href=""http://Amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon.com</a>, instead it opens ""<a href=""http://Amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Amazon.com</a> Search"" in the address bar. I don't want Search, I want to go to the Amazon home page but the shortcut doesn't take me to the Amazon homepage like it used to.

Some stupid thing about other web sites and sealing my information. I needed that page and could not see so I had to use another browser (not Chrome or Edge) to get the bill to display.   </p><p>I then had a coupon to print from an e-mail from my Pharmacy. Again you gave an error message but did download the coupon to where I save things.  </p><p>I do not want to use Chrome or Edge as they track the S**t out of you. I have another that is laid out like Chrome but supposedly isn’t and I use that. I have to pay for that one. The main thing these browsers don’t have is the Menu Bar at the top and you cannot put it on. I use that to free up screen space that is lost the way they do things.  </p><p>Can you PLEASE get things right in Firefox so I don’t have to waste my time or worse have to use this other browser I hate. </p>",firefox-1400;windows-10;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",anewdawn42
