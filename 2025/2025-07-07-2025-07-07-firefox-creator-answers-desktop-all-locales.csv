I have the latest version of Firefox on both the old one and this one.  also Windows 11 </p><p>On the old computer (which I set up 18 months ago and still works) the desktop icons show the website logo. The correct logo appears for any newly opened websites for which I set a desktop icon. </p><p>On this computer all website desktop icons show the Firefox logo and not the website logo. This happens whether I drag the address or the lock symbol. I can change the icon using the inbuilt menu, but this is tedious and I would prefer them be the correct ones. </p><p>The correct logo appears if I right click on an app in the start list and drag it to the desktop.   </p><p>Consequently I think the above is a Firefox problem. </p><p>I have been using Firefox for some years very successfully. </p><p>Regards Peter Adam Brisbane Australia </p>",firefox-14002;firefox-1400;windows-11;firefox;download-and-save;,firefox,download-and-save,en-US,"",pa.pedro.adam

Initially, it doesn’t do this, but if you do it repeatedly, Chrome eventually learns and sends you directly to that URL when you type ""maps"". The same happens with ""gmail"" or even just ""gm"", which redirect to ""<a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a>"" or ""<a href=""http://mail.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">mail.google.com</a>"". Does Firefox have this kind of feature? </p><p>I think I browsed a reddit thread from a few years ago asking this same problem having something to do with autofill frequency which doesn't work, because the actual url is not, in the example of maps, <a href=""http://maps.google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">maps.google.com</a> and the url I want to enter redirects to it. </p>",firefox-1390;windows-11;firefox;search-suggestions;,firefox,search-suggestions,en-US,"",professionalwyml

Estou a utilizar<em> o </em>Firefox 140.0.2 (64-bits)<em> numa instalação recente do Arch Linux, instalado a partir do repositório oficial e, por algum motivo, as abas não são restauradas ao iniciar uma nova sessão. As configurações encontram-se ajustadas (Geral -&gt; Iniciar -&gt; Abrir abas e janelas anteriores), mas sem efeito. Para fins de referência, outros navegadores instalados comportam-se normalmente em relação a este aspecto. Viria a ser um erro, ou há alguma medida adicional necessária para correto funcionamento desta configuração? </em> </p><p>Desde já, agradeço pelas considerações. </p>",firefox-14002;firefox-1400;firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,pt-BR,"",rogerjgamito
