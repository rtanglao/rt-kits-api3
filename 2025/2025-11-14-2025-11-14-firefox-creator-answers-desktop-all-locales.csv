When I change windows both too and from firefox, the menu pops up. As I continue to use it, my controls slowly begin to change. My scroll wheel changed from moving up and down the page to the same command that happens when you go backwards or forwards using the buttons in the top left. I lose the ability to use the windows key on my keyboard. Eventually, I lose the ability to type entirely sometimes, so all the keys from the keyboard just stop working, even though it's plugged in and recognized. Also, if I have firefox open for too long in the background, I'm unable to tab out of whatever window I'm presently in, even if firefox is just running in the background.  </p><p>I've isolated the problem to just firefox by using other browsers like edge and chrome.

I also thought maybe some of the extensions were causing problems so I stopped using all the ones not from firefox directly, but this also didn't help.

The problem is that sometimes the audio from Firefox just stops working, everything else in Windows works but not firefox, I tried having the same youtube video on Firefox and Chrome annd it worked on Chrome. There are times that a Windows restart fixes it and there are times that I just have to wait a couple of days till it fixes itself. The only thing I could find to trigger this behavior is to have mi Bluetooth earphones connected, then disconnect them and sometimes when reconnecting them the audio is just gone. This usually happens when I am working, when I start the day I put them on and start some music on Youtube, after 3-4 hours I do a 15 minutes break and during that time I charge the earphones, when I come back and turn them on again, most of the times the audio is gone. Is this a known issue or something? I can send anything if you want. Thank you </p>",firefox-1460;beta;windows-10;firefox;audio-and-video;,firefox,audio-and-video,en-US,"",alejandro.delacruz.garijo

My problem is whenever I seem to close Firefox down without using Task Manager to do so I will lose all of my tabs from the previous section. I know what you're thinking. There's a checkbox in the general settings right at the top to opt in to keeping tabs open. It's ticked! and has been since forever, and yet I still lose my tabs. So my question is, why might this happen? and how to prevent it? </p><p>Additionally, the 'restore last session' keyboard shortcut doesn't work for me either. </p><p>I'm really enjoying the new profile switching update; however, my other question is, how do I close a profile session down while I have another open? Yes, I'm aware you can open them side by side and close the window of choosing. A bit counterintuitive if you are trying to separate work from play. Still, I would like to not lose my tabs when I do choose to close one and not have multiple windows running in the background. Also yes, I did remember to check the box in the settings on each profile. Ticking the box does nothing for me. </p>",firefox-1450;windows-10;firefox;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",spectra-devil
