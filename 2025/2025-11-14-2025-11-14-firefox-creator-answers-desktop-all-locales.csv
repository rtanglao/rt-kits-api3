Facebook has an issue with scrolling through the feed in my group. I don't know whether there's also a problem on the home feed and also one's timeline. The further one goes back, the more sluggish it becomes and it takes longer to display posts. I'm not sure whether this is a browser issue as I haven't tested on other browsers, or a problem with Facebook pulling stuff out of the drawers in its archives.  Maybe it's a memory issue due to all posts needing to be loaded in memory so it's possible to go back up through the feed to the newest one. Anyway, it gets to the stage after going back through hundreds of posts over 6 months, FB stalls. So I tried clearing my history (I have this set to not clear cookies). I then closed FB and Firefox. When I started Firefox again, I had to agree to cookies and sign into all my social media accounts, Google accounts and also agree to cookies on sites I visit regularly. So obviously a glitch in the browser, causing many, if not all cookies to be deleted. </p>",firefox-1450;windows-10;firefox;cookies-history;,firefox,cookies-history,en-US,1779318;,eugbug1

Since the e-banking site hasn't changed in ages, I suspect instead something in one of the recent Firefox updates. The site works fine in Safari under Sequoia 15.5 on a MacBook Air, and I can login in Firefox, so I doubt that there is a problem with the site's security certificate. Since both the MacBook Air and the Ubuntu PC are on the same LAN, I also doubt any network obstruction. I haven't found a wax to get any more detailed error information and would be grateful for tips on how to do so. Meanwhile, I would like to at least change from the standart Firefox release to the ESR veersion, but find no information on how to do so.

It loaded the shortcuts but the page full of news things to click on never loaded.

I clicked on some of the shortcuts and some came up and others did not, at least during the time I was willing to wait.  I went to Google Chrome and it was slower than usual but eventually I was able to get to my email, ebay, etc.  I spent hours on the phone with Xfinity/Comcast and they ran tests and said everything was ok.

The problem is that sometimes the audio from Firefox just stops working, everything else in Windows works but not firefox, I tried having the same youtube video on Firefox and Chrome annd it worked on Chrome. There are times that a Windows restart fixes it and there are times that I just have to wait a couple of days till it fixes itself. The only thing I could find to trigger this behavior is to have mi Bluetooth earphones connected, then disconnect them and sometimes when reconnecting them the audio is just gone. This usually happens when I am working, when I start the day I put them on and start some music on Youtube, after 3-4 hours I do a 15 minutes break and during that time I charge the earphones, when I come back and turn them on again, most of the times the audio is gone.

My problem is whenever I seem to close Firefox down without using Task Manager to do so I will lose all of my tabs from the previous section. I know what you're thinking. There's a checkbox in the general settings right at the top to opt in to keeping tabs open. It's ticked! and has been since forever, and yet I still lose my tabs. So my question is, why might this happen? and how to prevent it? </p><p>Additionally, the 'restore last session' keyboard shortcut doesn't work for me either. </p><p>I'm really enjoying the new profile switching update; however, my other question is, how do I close a profile session down while I have another open? Yes, I'm aware you can open them side by side and close the window of choosing. A bit counterintuitive if you are trying to separate work from play. Still, I would like to not lose my tabs when I do choose to close one and not have multiple windows running in the background. Also yes, I did remember to check the box in the settings on each profile. Ticking the box does nothing for me. </p>",firefox-1450;windows-10;firefox;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",spectra-devil
