Even though I am using an external Password Manager (DualSafe Password Manager), Firefox keeps asking to save passwords. When I look at the privacy &amp; Security section in Settings, Ask to save passowrds is ticked and also greyed out. To access the setting, I have to disable DualSafe. The setting becomes accessible and unticked. I then re-enable DualSafe. If I then close Firefox, the setting is re-ticked and greyed out when I start Firefox again. Can anyone suggest how I can fix this? </p>",firefox-1450;windows-10;firefox;save-passwords;,firefox,save-passwords,en-US,"",chrisfleming102021

My problem is whenever I seem to close Firefox down without using Task Manager to do so I will lose all of my tabs from the previous section. I know what you're thinking. There's a checkbox in the general settings right at the top to opt in to keeping tabs open. It's ticked! and has been since forever, and yet I still lose my tabs. So my question is, why might this happen? and how to prevent it? </p><p>Additionally, the 'restore last session' keyboard shortcut doesn't work for me either. </p><p>I'm really enjoying the new profile switching update; however, my other question is, how do I close a profile session down while I have another open? Yes, I'm aware you can open them side by side and close the window of choosing. A bit counterintuitive if you are trying to separate work from play. Still, I would like to not lose my tabs when I do choose to close one and not have multiple windows running in the background. Also yes, I did remember to check the box in the settings on each profile. Ticking the box does nothing for me. </p>",firefox-1450;windows-10;firefox;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",spectra-devil
