This, while not a deterministic factor in how the application operates; illustrates a sudden, outward and hostile stance towards its existing user-base who is most commonly comprised of users dissatisfied with the lack of secure and private browser options available. Personally, I refuse to use Chromium-based web engines wherever possible and Firefox has been my one and only way to break from this ""monopoly"" of web engines. </p><p>Beginning to harvest user data for use by Mozilla and claiming ownership of any user content is immediately a massive breach of trust and contradicts what Mozilla as an organization has stood for since its inception. Going a step further to utilize this data to either be sold to advertisers as an asset, or to be used to train LLM's is exactly what I <strong>DON'T</strong> want to have happen with my data. I <strong>hate</strong> that this change happened and it massively reduced my trust in Mozilla and Firefox as a platform.  </p><p>I never asked for this, Mozilla promised that it would never happen, and now I'm left betrayed by broken promises made with the express intent to turn a profit on my behalf as a user. </p><p>In Anthony's blog post, he mentions how AI has reshaped how people search, shop and make decisions in ways that were hard to see or understand. I outwardly disagree with this statement and feel as though AI has ""infected"" its way through society by brute force, being put in front of every user and shoved in every application. LLM's are not a catchall solution, do not help resolve issues in new and innovative ways, and are massively misused, causing excessive resource usage, gutting consumer markets, and decimating the tech industry by causing excessive amounts of data centers and global tech inventories to be purchased and built with no promise of delivery.  </p><p>While I may want a fast, modern browser that is honest about what it does- I want that with no obscurity.  I want a web engine that is open source, as lightweight and minimal in its design and coding as possible; and with no bureaucracy. I want to know how the engine works, to have the option to review its codebase front to back, to have my data stay as my data on my own local machine without providing it to a third party simply by using an application. Mozilla with its changes since February of this year have removed this as a possibility from their entire application suite. </p><p>I don't want AI in my browser- AT ALL. I have disabled it in every capacity that I can (frustratingly too, as these are all enabled by default and FORCE me to provide you my data without express consent.) and with every advancement Mozilla makes towards calling it ""the future"" and ""the focal point"", I lose trust. I don't want AI, I want the old privacy policy put back, and I really, well and truly and wholly, DO NOT WANT AI.  </p><p>I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS, IT'S RUINING OUR LIVES, OUR SOCIETY, OUR PLANET, AND I WANT IT GONE. </p><p>Unless Mozilla stops this direction today, I will be seeking out new options, disallowing Firefox usage in any corporate environments within my jurisdiction, and actively informing friends, family and acquaintances of Mozilla and Firefox's fall from grace, and to utilize other user-centric options. </p><p>Thank you for your attention, have a great day, and I hope Mozilla can create action that will allow its users to trust it once again. </p>",firefox-1460;windows-10;firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1786501;1786511;1786515;,jemorann11

This was possible in the previous version of the browsing history. However, bookmarks in the new sidebar still allow opening links in a new tab using the middle mouse button. Additionally, there doesn’t seem to be a shortcut key for opening links in a split tab (side-by-side view). Currently, I have to drag and drop, which feels cumbersome. I suggest adding this feature to the right-click context menu, introducing a keyboard shortcut (e.g., Ctrl + left-click, or another modifier key), or an option to set allowing the middle mouse button to open links in a split tab. Alternatively, a double-right-click could also work. If this feedback cannot be directly forwarded to the developers, where should I post or submit these suggestions? </p>",firefox-1460;windows-10;firefox;links;,firefox,links,en-US,1786399;,su35pvu3c0
