And now I'm wondering where the hell is the “skip all stupid warnings” button when I go to a site I trust but which nevertheless has a self-signed certificate, because I know for a fact that there used to be such a button. Moreover, your guide offers me to click the “additional” button, where I supposedly can find this very cherished button. But it's not there! So, it would be okay, specifying this site in the exceptions in the settings - that doesn't help either. Why should I waste my time on this? </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",aleks12341728

I have no idea why its there, in 1 year I probably got redirected to there without knowing twice. </p><p>So it cant be the most used sites iam on, especially if there is reddit too. I dont have an account and do not use the site. Since when does firefox has Ads in their adress bar? </p><p>What is this and how do I get rid of it? I doubt that it is one of the most used sites in germany, it cant be for alot of simple reasons. Age of the userbase does not fit with the Internet User group. 50% of the country does not like them (tagesschau page). Germany is in the IT Darkages except the tech savvy youth and generation 1980 to this day. This newsgroup is targeted towards an older generation and is still heavily invested in TV not the Internet. As it is statemedia its also highly out of touch with the current more internet focused generations, so I doubt that its because they generate traffic or anything else. </p><p>Is there a way do blank all search results on default? And I would really like to know how this page got there. </p>",firefox;search-suggestions;,firefox,search-suggestions,en-US,"",thecasaromeo

I didn't think this would be a issue , but when i attempt to set it up , it gives me a backup code , i put it in when it asks me to and then it says its incorrect . It makes me quite confused as it continues to give me a new code but its always deemed wrong when i copy and paste it . </p>",firefox;two-factor-authentication;,firefox,two-factor-authentication,en-US,"",gameboi909
