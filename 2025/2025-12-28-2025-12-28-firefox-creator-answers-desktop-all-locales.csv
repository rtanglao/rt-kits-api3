I tried to restore many of the backups but only was informed ""Unable to process the backup file."" each time.  Tried again today with same result. </p><p>When this first occurred I obtained an article with the steps to solve this problem and did them in order.  Reinstall didn't work nor the above.  Nothing seemed to work.  Note that no new bookmarks then and now can be created. </p><p>So I have been trying out a new browser which did import Firefox bookmarks - therefore are readable - which placed them on the favorite menu without prompting.  These are listed as Firefox Bookmarks.  But this is not where new bookmarks are saved.  Thus the same topics are in two places.  So I attempted to import the Firefox bookmarks manually.  It worked but now every folder is on the favorite menu instead of being merged with the new ones created.  Of course this is absurd so were deleted. </p><p>I don't particularly like the new browser and actually would prefer to get Firefox straightened out. </p><p>I don't recall much about the events when this happened but it did not seem just after an update - possibly a week after?

I was on macOS Monterey on my laptop and firefox stopped working a few weeks ago. Then it was on my desktop with macOS Tahoe. I recently made a clean install of my laptop. When I installed firefox, the software was working until I added all my former bookmarks, plugins etc. I installed things one by one and it seems that it's due to the Extended Color Management plugin. The software show a grey background. I can interact with the software: clic on links, make a research but I do not see anything. Also, I can't quit it. I am only able to force it to quit. In between Monterey and Tahoe, I have the same issue. In between a M1 MacBook and a M3 Mac Studio, I have the same issue. I do not have a Mac intel anymore to try...  If I uninstall firefox and install it again, it works. But if I add the <em>Extended Color Management</em> plugin <strong>and</strong> activate it, it fails. </p><p>The problem is that I use firefox because of this plugin and for work.
