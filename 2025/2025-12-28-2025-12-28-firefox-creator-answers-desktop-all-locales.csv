I was on macOS Monterey on my laptop and firefox stopped working a few weeks ago. Then it was on my desktop with macOS Tahoe. I recently made a clean install of my laptop. When I installed firefox, the software was working until I added all my former bookmarks, plugins etc. I installed things one by one and it seems that it's due to the Extended Color Management plugin. The software show a grey background. I can interact with the software: clic on links, make a research but I do not see anything. Also, I can't quit it. I am only able to force it to quit. In between Monterey and Tahoe, I have the same issue. In between a M1 MacBook and a M3 Mac Studio, I have the same issue. I do not have a Mac intel anymore to try...  If I uninstall firefox and install it again, it works. But if I add the <em>Extended Color Management</em> plugin <strong>and</strong> activate it, it fails. </p><p>The problem is that I use firefox because of this plugin and for work. Do you know if firefox needs to update the plugin? Do you know a tricky way to avoid this issue? </p><p>Thank you in advance for your answers, and I wish you great celebrations.
