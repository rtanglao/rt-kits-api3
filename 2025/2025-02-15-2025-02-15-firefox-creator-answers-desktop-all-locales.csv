I did a quick google search and found all I have to do is it copy the Appdata/roaming/mozilla/profile directory to the new computer. I had closed FF on the old system before I copied it to a USB drive. On the new computer I installed FF. opened it, closed it, copied the file/directory to the new system. There were already to profile subdirectories present. I just added mine. Now FF crashes.  I can't have both computers on at the same time so I do not think 'Sync' will work.  What did I do wrong?
