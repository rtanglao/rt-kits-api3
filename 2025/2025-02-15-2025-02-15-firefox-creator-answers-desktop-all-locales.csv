He did this because I'd simply mentioned to him how I really miss having a simple way to ""cut and paste"" and edit items like I used to be able to do on my former computer, a Mac Pro. I now have an HP and Microsoft appears to rule almost everything! After I got home I was deeply disappointed to find that my Firefox program had not finished loading and was not completely installed!&nbsp;:( So, following the instructions - which I found somewhat difficult to follow - I'm not sure whether I downloaded or installed the real Firefox program or a 'clone!' I say this because, once I downloaded and signed up for Mozilla's Firefox app. and finished the process, there was a note prominently posted on Mozilla's Support page asking (or telling) me to ""Download Firefox! Don't I already have Firefox!?? If so, why doesn't Mozilla or Firefox already know I do? Another thing is, the first problem I encountered after opening my computer, was noticing that Mozilla and Microsoft seemed to be 'fighting' over which one of them I would be signing my Firefox through. (??) That was most confusing to me, because I had been warned to not sign up through Microsoft if I wanted the easy editing options. However, at this point I'm not exactly sure with whom I signed Firefox up through or if it is truly the bonified Firefox or just a 'player.' The invitation in a bright blue box is still on the Firefox Support page saying, ""Download Firefox."" Perhaps after all that, I did not download it at all. How can I tell? Was it done with Microsoft or Mozilla? It appears to be Mozilla, but I'm not tech savvy enough to really know, and does it really matter, which one? I'm still not used to this computer and still have trouble finding my apps! Can someone help me with this? </p>",firefox;accounts;,firefox,accounts,en-US,1712347;,irisgordy
