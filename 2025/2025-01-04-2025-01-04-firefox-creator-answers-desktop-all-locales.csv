It happens roughly every 7 days and I double checked every privacy setting that has something to do with deleting data uppon closing, deleting cookies in general and so on... It only happens on my PC (Windows 24H2, Build: 26100.2605), not on my laptop (also windows 24H2, idk what exact build). </p><p>I also found that firefox doesn't delete the cookies (it still says 200+ mb in the settings).  I also tried deleting the cookies (it said 0 bytes in the settings after that) and I will see in ~7 days if that had some effect. That can be seen in the pictures (those are in german). </p><p>if anyone has a fix or if this is a straight up bug, let me know! (I won't reinstall firefox just now, because I wanna test a few things before) </p>",firefox-13303;firefox-1330;firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",gurkensindcoolol

Browsing through youtube shorts it would not let me scroll down by using the mousewheel or have a delay of 3 secons from time to time. changing to the downarrow to view the next short made me hit an invisible wall at about 200 shorts. browsing twitch also leads to signifficant delays of several seconds until any click action is performed. one time it even crashed so i decided to clear the browser cache and restart my pc. is there a new way the temporary data is stored in the new version? i have 32 GB of RAM and lots of free disk space so that shouldn't be the issue.
