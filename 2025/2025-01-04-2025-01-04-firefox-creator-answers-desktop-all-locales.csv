Browsing through youtube shorts it would not let me scroll down by using the mousewheel or have a delay of 3 secons from time to time. changing to the downarrow to view the next short made me hit an invisible wall at about 200 shorts. browsing twitch also leads to signifficant delays of several seconds until any click action is performed. one time it even crashed so i decided to clear the browser cache and restart my pc. is there a new way the temporary data is stored in the new version? i have 32 GB of RAM and lots of free disk space so that shouldn't be the issue. Firefox used to have no issues whatsoever in older versions regarding videos and streams. </p>,firefox-13303;firefox-1330;firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",jack.co

I downloaded the latest version of Firefox, and it won’t launch.  I read your article about users who had firewall enabled on MacOS BEFORE upgrading to Sequoia having issues with Firefox not launching, but in my case, it’s a new system that had Sequoia on it already.   </p><p>Is there any workaround to this???  I rely on Firefox so much that I can’t migrate to my brandnew MacBook after paying so much for it. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",aiamariga
