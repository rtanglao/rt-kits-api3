I put my mouse pointer on te image and right click, but I do not get a context menu with a Google Lens choice.

I've spent thousands of hours using it but due to my GREAT IGNORANCE of the best way to use and maximize my efficiency, my precious time is being wasted. I FEEL LOST MUCH OF THE TIME.  IS IT POSSIBLE ORGANIZED MY USE OF FIREFOX IN A WAY THAT WILL MAKE IT A PLEASURE TO USE?  For example my Windows fire Explorer if very organized and based on a logical system that I created.  With Firefox I've created hundreds Bookmarks and I've started organized them but it doesn't automatically sort a folders or bookmarks when I put them in and that is a huge inconvenience because I sometimes forget to do that and then I can't find what I need. </p><p>I've built computers and installed hardware and complicated software; I've done a little bit of Excel programing as well.  I am a well educated person with a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemistry, and I also have several post graduate certifications but I feel like Firefox is cumbersome to use.  Now that ""feeling"" has to do with my ignorance most likely SO is there anyone out there who can point this frustrated researcher in the direction that will make me a virtuoso with Firefox?  With all the very smart people who invented and maintain Firefox, someone must have created a Firefox course to turn a Firefox user who can get a hundred times more done in a fraction of the time it is currently taking me. </p><p>Here's a good example of the kind of things I need:  1.  First, let me convey just a brief context of my endeavors, and then I'll submit a some ways in which my Firefox browser could much more helpful.  I do a lot of teaching in several technical areas of science (physics, mathematics, chemistry, financial management an investments, predictive models for targeting future needs vs resources for individual and group advancements, and with unique considerations for cultures/philosophical diversities, the role of pattern recognition in cognitive architecture and in subjective/objective conscious states of alertness paradigms; medical science, philosophy, learning theory and methods, I also teach music theory  and composition related to the guitar, violin, and piano.  One of the reasons that I like Firefox is it's Privacy protection, but I'm confident that if I were more ""edumacated"" about the complex subject of privacy I would like ""accessorize"" my interaction with a world that has plenty of ""bad actors out there"".  Consider this fact:  I am a skilled surgeon whose quick hands and mind have been involved involved in multiple acute life threatening injuries.  This means that I use a kind of magical thinking that I learned long ago, and that thinking is the difference between life and death for the man whose left renal artery was ruptured in a plane crash.  He is losing blood internally and must be treated immediately, He will arrive at trauma center in 10-15 minutes vial helicopter.  I am already scrubbed in and ready for his arrival as is my very experienced surgical assistant who has prepared all the surgical instruments organized in the sterile surgical room.  Firefox must be like my surgical assistant. Every tool I need for research, for probative accumulation of essential information must be readily, available, so I can focus of the important task of stopping the blood loss quickly.  That surgery was done and that 26 year old male survived after I repaired the ruptured left renal artery using endovascular repair via a surgical Goretex stint graft similar to what I have used in repair of aortic aneurysms. Simple when one has the tools at ones fingertips due to well trained support staff. When I am about to write a highly important article or chapter that I will contribute to a book that has several other contributing authors, There are certain tools I need and that depends on whether I'm writing in English, Russian, French, Spanish, Portuguese, or Italian.
