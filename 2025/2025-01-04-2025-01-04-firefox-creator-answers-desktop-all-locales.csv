Arról sem, hogy újabban miért történik ez, mármint az, hogy csak a mobil eszközről tudok belépni a facebook fiókomba. A laptopról nem engedi, mert szerinte én nem én vagyok, nem az én fiókom, más az elnevezése, más szerinte a jelszó, egyszóval kényszeríteni akar, hogy legyen másik új fiókom. Hogy e mögött a magyar rendőri szervezet vagy a kémelhárítás vagy a túlbuzgó ellenőrizni kell az állampolgárokat, vagy egy közelgő fasiszta világ van, nem tudom. De nagyon, nagyon felháborítónak találom, hogy nem enged be a legalább12éves fiókomba. Kinek, milyen nyomorult elmének fáj ez? Boldog lennék, ha tudnának segíteni!I don't know, I have no idea. Nor why this is happening lately, that I can only log into my Facebook account from my mobile device. It won't let me on my laptop because it thinks I'm not me, it's not my account, it has a different name, it thinks the password is different, in short, it wants to force me to have another new account. Whether the Hungarian police organization or counterintelligence or the overzealous need to check citizens or an impending fascist world is behind this, I don't know. But I find it very, very outrageous that it won't let me into my account that is at least 12 years old. Who, what miserable mind is this hurting? I would be happy if you could help </p>",firefox;accounts;,firefox,accounts,hu,"",nellijanisch

However, one thing I cannot figure out ... how to make it remember log-in email or username, but NOT saving any passwords. I googled and many answers are outdated (2014) ... non made a change anyways. - Unchecked ""Delete Cookies when Firefox closes"" - Under Passwords: I unchecked ""Ask To Save Passwords"" - Under Autofill: ""Save and Fill Addresses"" - Checked  - I added my entire mailing address and email in ""Save Addresses"" - ""Save and Fill Payment Methods"" - Unchecked - Under History: ""Remember Browsing and Download History"" and ""Remember Search and Form History"" ...    </p><pre>  both checked. </pre> <p>These settings seam to be most logical for what I want but it still does not work. What I'm talking about is, e.g., when I sign in to Amazon I'm expecting to already see my email or at least after typing the first letter. That's how it was in the previous browser. (FYI: required password field/sign-in is replaced by Windows pin) </p><p>What am I doing wrong?
