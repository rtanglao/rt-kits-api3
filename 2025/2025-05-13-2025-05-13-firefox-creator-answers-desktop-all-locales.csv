I saved my group tabs, very happy about it. Then I close and save it, then I opened it again, it was great!  </p><p>I am a student, I use my group tab to add the tabs that have the resources that I need to, and would also like to study for more knowledge and for my next school year. </p><p>There was no problem at that whole time. In April 21, there was no problem until April 22, 23 no problem. But I forgot my charger at that time, because I was at my mothers house. Then I wait for weeks for my charger to come back, about 2 weeks for my laptop to revive there in my grandparent's house. </p><p>When I got my charger, and opened firefox. Wait, but at first when I opened firefox, it showed me that there is a new update, an update about tab groups that I already now. I looked at my group tabs, and they are not there anymore. </p><p>What should I do to get them back. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",allysonmarie091

It takes about 2 to 3 mins to do the first search, after which it continues to work normally. </p><p>Furthermore, facebook takes too long to load (~4mins). </p><p>The netskope support team has asked us to make a few changes in about:config: 1. network.http.http3.enabled  2. QUIC protocol 3. network.udp.enabled </p><p>None of this works and even if it works, the problem is we have about 1500 devices. </p><p>Are there any reported issues&nbsp;? And is there anything that we are missing&nbsp;? </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1732207;,sohanvaradai
