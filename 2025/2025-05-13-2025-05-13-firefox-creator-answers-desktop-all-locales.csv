An issue I have is that when I have enough tabs that I need to scroll through them, when my cursor leaves the sidebar, the list of tabs scrolls to the top. This is not ideal since all new tabs are at the bottom, and I have to scroll back down to switch from one newish tab to the next. The horizontal tab list didn't have this issue, always remembering the position the list of tabs was in. Is there a way to mimic that behaviour? If not, I'm hoping this will suffice as a feature request. </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",coreywoodworth

I saved my group tabs, very happy about it. Then I close and save it, then I opened it again, it was great!  </p><p>I am a student, I use my group tab to add the tabs that have the resources that I need to, and would also like to study for more knowledge and for my next school year. </p><p>There was no problem at that whole time. In April 21, there was no problem until April 22, 23 no problem. But I forgot my charger at that time, because I was at my mothers house. Then I wait for weeks for my charger to come back, about 2 weeks for my laptop to revive there in my grandparent's house. </p><p>When I got my charger, and opened firefox. Wait, but at first when I opened firefox, it showed me that there is a new update, an update about tab groups that I already now. I looked at my group tabs, and they are not there anymore. </p><p>What should I do to get them back. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,1732349;1732396;,allysonmarie091

It takes about 2 to 3 mins to do the first search, after which it continues to work normally. </p><p>Furthermore, facebook takes too long to load (~4mins). </p><p>The netskope support team has asked us to make a few changes in about:config: 1. network.http.http3.enabled  2. QUIC protocol 3. network.udp.enabled </p><p>None of this works and even if it works, the problem is we have about 1500 devices. </p><p>Are there any reported issues&nbsp;?
