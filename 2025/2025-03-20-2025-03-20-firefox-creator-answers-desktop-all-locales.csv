I have a question regarding the Mozilla PDF viewer, and it's capability to add sticky notes. </p><p>To add sticky notes, I was using Microsoft Edge, since I thought Mozilla didn't have this option. On Edge, you select a patch of text and then you can add text that shows when clicking on that text portion. When not clicking it, the text looks like it's highlighted. </p><p>Much to my surprise, when I opened a PDF with Sticky Notes added with Mozilla, they were still there. When putting my cursor on top of the highlighted zones, they were marked as if they were simply highlighted, but when clicking, I was able to open the hidden text inside the note. </p><p>This makes me think there's actually a way to add said notes within Mozilla, since it's recognizing the text with the sticky note as a highlighted text, but I can't seem to find a way to do it. </p><p>I really hate using Edge, and Mozilla is my way to go for everything.

Can someone please tell me very briefly the steps to switch from the FF 128.8 ESR version to the latest supported regular version, which I believe is FF 136. From my research, it appears that you can download the regular version and go to about:profiles to switch your profile back to your original one used w the ESR version. Please list the very simple steps (1,2,3 etc) to switch from ESR to regular version for a non techie. </p><p>My background, I have an older MacBook Pro mid 2015, which had 10.11 installed (El Capitan) and recently took the plunge &amp; updated to Mac OS Monterey (12.7.6), which was the highest allowed for this older MacBook. The new OS is awesome &amp; fixed so many websites that were no longer working.  </p><p>Firefox automatically moved me to the ESR version at some point with my older Mac 10.11 OS. I believe my latest supported version was 78.15 ESR. When I recently updated my MacBook OS to Monterey 12.7.6, Firefox updated automatically to 128.8 ESR.  </p><p>Now, many websites recently seem to be broken (gmail, yahoo calendar, duckduckgo, &amp; others), so moving from ESR to the most recent regular version seems like the best solution (I believe FF 136 is highest supported by Mac OS 12.7.6).
