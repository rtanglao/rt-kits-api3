Recently, Mozilla added the ability to manually restart the GPU process in <em>about:processes</em>, which is very useful when it leaks memory. Does anyone know if they also programmed Firefox to automatically restart the GPU process if its memory usage becomes suspiciously high, for example, if it exceeds a very high percentage of system RAM at a reasonable baseline (e.g. 7GB out of 8GB RAM)? That would help reduce complaints about GPU process memory leaks. Thanks. </p>",firefox;crashing-and-slow-performance;,firefox,crashing-and-slow-performance,en-US,"",drdaviddukephd

A few days ago I lost all the tabs of my session while using, for the first time, the CSV export of my Pocket saves. Using the Firefox menu in the upper right, I found that there were no previous tabs listed to be restored and all previous windows were empty save for the individual links from my Pocket saves. My search history was also empty although my settings are set to save it. There was nothing to salvage and I gave-up perplexed. Today I am researching. I am learning that earlier sessions can be restored via backups. I've found my ""sessionstore-backups"" folder and jsonlz4 and baklz4 files. It is here that I get overwhelmed following the written directions in Firefox Help (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-restore-browsing-session-backup"" rel=""nofollow"">link text</a>. I stalled at step 5. I looked for video help and couldn't find anything. I would appreciate any assistance with this for me, a non-savvy computer user. Oh, I use a mac if that is relevant. Thanks.

Since the Firefox update in the past couple days, the mouse cursor has started appearing huge and slightly blurry (as though the image is scaled up) in Firefox and nowhere else. The size is visually annoying, and occasionally difficult to know exactly where I'm clicking (trying to move the caret in a text box for example). It also appears to be a different style from the main desktop cursor, the shape and color are ever so slightly different, but this may already have been the case and I simply didn't notice because of the previously small size. Firefox doesn't have its own built in cursor settings that I can find, nor obey the system cursor settings. I have a high DPI display so perhaps it is being over-compensated for? e.g. both the system and Firefox are scaling the cursor up, assuming the other hasn't done it already, resulting in a cursor that's too big. </p>",firefox-14001;firefox-1400;firefox;browser-appearance;,firefox,browser-appearance,en-US,"",joxenhandler

Mas com firefox e qualquer fork, os domínios ainda são interceptados e bloqueados. Mesmo se eu desligar o DNS seguro em ambos os navegadores, e utilizar apenas o DNS DoH configurado no Windows 11, o comportamento é o mesmo. Qualquer navegador Chromium consegue se ocultar de interceptações. Estou a dias fazendo experimentos e análises, mas não consigo solucionar esse problema com o firefox.
