I can close and open the bookmark toolbar, so I know it is there and open, but there is nothing in it.  I have restarted and started my computer.  This used to be easy.  Right-click a site saved in your bookmark and drag it to the bookmark toolbar or there was a choice to move to or pin to bookmark toolbar.  It had to be easy because I do not do complicated.
