1549551,2025-11-20 16:53:20 -0800,2025-11-20 16:53:20 -0800,Something happened to my bookmark toolbar items.  They are still under the hamburger under bookmarks.,"<p>I uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox, made sure my show bookmarks all the time was on, have been Googling and Googling and reaching out for several hours and cannot find out what happened to all our often-visited sites located under our url bar.  I have done everything I know to do.  I have tried dragging and dropping and it will not allow me to do that.  I never had to sign into anything.  Firefox just opened up and there everything happened to be.  There is a square with an arrow through it that says Import bookmarks where my bookmarks were on the bookmark toolbar.  I can close and open the bookmark toolbar, so I know it is there and open, but there is nothing in it.  I have restarted and started my computer.  This used to be easy.  Right-click a site saved in your bookmark and drag it to the bookmark toolbar or there was a choice to move to or pin to bookmark toolbar.  It had to be easy because I do not do complicated.  Help, please.  I don't have that many more years to live and I don't want to spend them frustrated&nbsp;:O  Also, when I open Firefox, I see no paddlock or shield in the search bar.  I see both  now when I'm in the support page, but not upon the opening of Firefox, which I consider my home page for Firefox browser. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",firefox-14501;firefox-1450;windows-11;firefox;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",Extrastuff1973
