Instead, I installed direct Mozilla Firefox into /opt/firefox and run the Mozilla production release.

Mozilla has an apt repo and method to update Firefox, presumably via the Software Updater that can be run from a regular, not root, user window, perhaps asking for the sudo password.

The same video using Google Chrome behaves as expected.

When using Chrome, the video brightness matches system brightness settings on my Macbook Pro (running Sequoia 15.3) but when I use FF, the video itself is incredibly bright, as if the white levels have been maxed out. It seems to be a problem with handling the HDR content. Even stranger, it's as if the browser is able to increase my screen brightness itself, but only in the video pane. I doubt that's actually happening, but that's what appears to happen. If I switch to another tab and then back to the video, it takes a few seconds for the video pane to increase extreme levels. </p><p>Also, I tried to take a screenshot of it but the screenshot doesn't show the extreme bright levels that I see when I'm using the browser. </p>",firefox-1350;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1711384;,Neiby

To resolve this issue, please update your settings to allow 3rd party cookies."" and nothing I do seems to fix it.  My settings are set to standard, didn't work. I tried to allow an exception but since it's embedded within the school canvas, I don't know how to get the Kaltura URL and the normal canvas url doesn't bypass it.  I've went to the about:config and messed around with that based on other support posts, but that didn't work either. I went into the cookie setting and set it to custom and just unchecked the cookies, but that still didn't work.
