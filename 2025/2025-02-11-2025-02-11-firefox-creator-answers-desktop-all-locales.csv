I use canvas for school and within that is Kaltura, used for uploading and recording lectures etc. I'm now being hit with the ""It seems your browser is blocking 3rd party session cookies which are required for the Kaltura application. To resolve this issue, please update your settings to allow 3rd party cookies."" and nothing I do seems to fix it.  My settings are set to standard, didn't work. I tried to allow an exception but since it's embedded within the school canvas, I don't know how to get the Kaltura URL and the normal canvas url doesn't bypass it.  I've went to the about:config and messed around with that based on other support posts, but that didn't work either. I went into the cookie setting and set it to custom and just unchecked the cookies, but that still didn't work. I'm at a complete loss and I need some help. </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",angie.94
