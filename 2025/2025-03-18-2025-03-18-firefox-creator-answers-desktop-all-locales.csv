Unfortunately the mail program has ""Spell Check"".  It can best be described as intrusive.  Every letter I type in my mail the spell check keeps popping up and bothering/interfering me to the point where it is very annoying and frustrating.  I need to get rid of it permanently.  I saw some suggestions where I could go to 'settings' and uncheck the box that says 'check your spelling as you type', it was unchecked and the spell check keeps popping up non stop! PLEASE show me how I can stop this aggravating feature. Thanks, Larry </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",yepytzme
