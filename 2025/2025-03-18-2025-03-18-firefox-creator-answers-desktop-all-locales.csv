I mean to remember that it could be fixed (until next time) by restarting the file explorer somewhere in Task Manager - not a convincing solution but one I could live with.  </p><p>Today, there's a new situation. Again, trigger was the missing YT sound in FF - not in fx Edge, and that the Task Manager trick didn't work (or maybe I restarted the file manager in the wrong tab?). Looking for a solution, I happened to see that the YT mute function in the FF tabs seems to be gone. However, other sounds are affected likewise. Also, I can't see them in Edge either. After various restarts (or maybe something else I did, instigated by the various instructions I found?), the sound is back. </p><p>However, while continuing to pursue possible solutions, I also happened to find that my browser is being 'administered by my organisation' - what ever that means (see two annexes). Who did that? I would say, this is not something I did, I would prefer to see it gone. But how? Will the other browsers (which I keep as a spare, and that I'm hardly familiar with) be likewise affected? </p><p>This is an equation with too many unknowns for my limited knowledge, are such effects known?
