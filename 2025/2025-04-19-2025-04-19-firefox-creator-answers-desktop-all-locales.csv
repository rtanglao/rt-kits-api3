It appears I should log into an Administrative account to do so. Microsoft Edge appears to be the problem by remaining the default. I was told by the Tech Sprt for my Asus laptop to ""delete"" Edge. I entered the Administrative account using DOS. So many changes have taken place since I last used this account that I'm uncomfortable trying to take this approach. I was led to an administrative directory using ""search"" end while there was able to get a directory listing using DOS. But can't proceed. I really need the Windows pictorial version to proceed or technical support (preferred). Whoever helps must be fully capable. </p><p>Asus TS said I must delete MS Edge. The person seemed capable, but if I delete Edge, which I haven't found a way to do so safely, that may create problems but makes sense to do so because of the interference of MS  Edge. My memory on how to proceed is that this process was MUCH less complex. I've read a number accounts by others with the same problem. My reasons for using Firefox, as an private engineer are to help prevent the stealing of intellectual property from wherever. Otherwise I'll have to abandon everything. </p><p><br> </p><p><br> <strong></strong> </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1726714;,MozillaFirefoxNewbie
