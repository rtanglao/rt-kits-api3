The issue is that I accidentally submitted a different extension under this listing with version 1.7.7. I reverted it immediately, but now I'm unable to upload the correct version (1.4.5) because it's considered a downgrade. </p><p>I really don't want to change my extension‚Äôs versioning just to get around this, since 1.4.5 is the actual next version in my release cycle. At the same time, I don‚Äôt want to stop updating the extension on the Mozilla Add-ons store.
