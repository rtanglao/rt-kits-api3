I know it does this, and it's been going on for years, and I hate it. I never want to enter my system password to install something that is unknown. Since the add-on is never identified, well, it could be something beneficial, or it could be some new malicious package that snuck into the update process. How am I supposed to know? To me, it's unacceptable that Firefox keeps doing this. (Maybe it's MacOS's fault, but this doesn't happen with any other non-Apple software package. So it's Firefox's fault as far as I'm concerned.) I've been using Firefox for decades--since it was Netscape. I don't to use any other browser except for special cases. But I'm thinking of switching over to using Safari all of the time. Not that it would harms Firefox or anyone involved in developing it if I switched. But switching to Safari now would be a p.i.t.a., so it shows how much this install bug annoys me. (Years ago I submitted some kind of bug report in the bug system, but that's a pain. It's an opaque bug reporting system for anyone outside of the Firefox developer community.) Well,that's it.  Lovin' Firefox except for this feature. </p>",firefox;update;,firefox,update,en-US,1758551;,mabrams001

I kept hoping an update might fix things but it's getting to the point I need to use Chrome much of the time now. I read the help article for websites not opening with Firefox but opening with another browser and had already done most of the things: clearing data and cache. I don't know what proxy is but I looked at my Chrome settings and changed Firefox to match (automatically detect settings). Nothing has helped. Sometimes a site won't open and sometimes I get into a website and then a random page within the website won't open. I have only a few pages open at a time. It might have started at some point after adding Facebook container to the extensions. Other extensions are: Duck Duck Go, Malwarebytes, Google Analytics opt-out, Read Aloud and U-Block Origin.

That's when I realized that Firefox was completely offscreen and unusable. </p><p>For context, last night, I had 3 windows open, two were regular sessions, the last one was a private session I had open on a temporary second monitor that I unplugged afterward. My dad lended it to me, so I'd rather not ask him again unless I absolutely have to. I closed them in order making sure to close the default window last thinking that Firefox would open there next time I launch it, but comes tomorrow and when I launch Firefox it opens off-screen and I can't interact with the window at all. </p><p>There also seems to be no way to bring it back directly to my screen on this garbage OS everyone calls ""windows 11"" according to their help forum: <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/4139775/app-runs-off-screen-in-windows-11?page=2#answers"" rel=""nofollow"">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/4139775/app-runs-off-screen-in-windows-11?page=2#answers</a> </p><p>So, I'm commenting here via brave browser, first to report a bug because I don't think Firefox should remember the last position of a <strong>private window</strong> of all things, but also because I don't know where else to go to ask that question since windows 11 itself cannot seem to have an option to solve this problem either. I know the position is stored in the profile folder, so what should I edit in there to get Firefox back where it should be?  No, I will not delete/reset it it has a ton of search engines and settings that Firefox won't sync. </p>",windows-11;firefox;customization;,firefox,customization,en-US,1758469;1758522;1758526;,Lumios
