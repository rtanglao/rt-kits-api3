Facebook, Ebay and Youtube are the only ones that appear consistently, sometimes other will display, but then be gone again the next time the app is launched. All other links just have the generic letter icons. </p><p>I tried deleting the 3 favicon files in the Profiles folder, but it did nothing. I've tried manually re-adding the links, still nothing. I removed the ""S"" from ""https;//"" and still nothing. The favicons all show up on my other machines which use Firefox on the same user account, so it is not a problem with the websites themselves. </p><p>Not sure if its related, but upon installing Firefox on this machine, it made Firefox on my Mac desktop absolutely  freak out. I had to make a significant number of changes over the course of hours to fix everything, so many relating to favicons alone that I don't know what actually fixed it. </p><p>What else can I do to try and get these working? Why does Firefox apparently struggle with this particular feature across multiple OSes? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",firefox-1420;windows-10;firefox;dashboard;,firefox,dashboard,en-US,"",VincentBrick
