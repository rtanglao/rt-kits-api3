Seeing how I would have to right click the tab and select a submenu to trigger that, it seems essentially impossible that I did that by accident. </p><p>Q: 1. Is there a keyboard combo that could be accidentally hit that would trigger Send tab to device? As far as I could research, there is no such shortcut. 2. Can a website trigger this API and perhaps I approved it by accident? I would definitely also notice this. 3. Is there a sync audit log I could check on either device to see if a tab was synced?

Я много лет использую firefox для работы, я работаю в банке, и недавно нам дали расширение для мессенджера где ми общаемся с клиентами и можем добавлять документы легче и другие функции. У меня возникла проблема, так как я не могу его установить никак. Я питалась установить его по инструкциям с сайта, но безуспешно. Расширение фактически самостоятельно написано нашими разработчиками и инструкция по установке только на Chrome, и вігдядит она примерно так: скачиваете себе архив, извлекаете файлы пишете chrome://extensions включаете режим разработчика и загружаете туда файлы что были извлечены из архива.  </p><p>Прошу детальную инструкцию как я могу это сделать для firefox. </p>",firefox-1420;windows-11;firefox;extensions;,firefox,extensions,en-US,1758472;,TheBloodyQueenOfMoon

This happened suddenly, without any discernible reason, and I can't seem to fix it. Everything else works, only content played from Firefox remains in the laptop speakers. I've checked my audio mixer, nothing seems amiss, I've updated Firefox and refreshed the application, still nothing. Hell, I've even tried different cables and HDMI ports, but nothing works. What could be the issue? Why did my audio suddenly stop working, and what can I do about it? </p>",firefox-1420;windows-10;firefox;audio-and-video;,firefox,audio-and-video,en-US,1758367;,vv.irving
