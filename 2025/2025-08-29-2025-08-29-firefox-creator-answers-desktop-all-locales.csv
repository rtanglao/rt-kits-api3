I'm writing this here in the hope it gets considered/solved in future Firefox updates, and I couldn't find a better place to write (sorry, I also didn't look too hard, since I've already lost some time manually ""fixing"" the scramble). </p><p>The context: I use Firefox currently in three different computers, with a login to cross-communicate my settings, add-ons, and specially, my bookmarks. I use Firefox bookmarks so much that most of my job is saved within them. One of those computers I hadn't used Firefox in a while, and yesterday I had to, and had to log back into my account in that machine. First weirdness was when it took so long to sync my favorites that I gave up and went to do something else. Then this morning in my main computer I realize that old bookmarks from that computer had synced BACK to my main one. </p><p>The problem then, is that instead of syncing the bookmarks by the last changes made by me, it got old bookmarks from the old login. I wonder if I had been using a new computer if the system would consider ""no bookmarks"" as my new bookmark list... sorry, I jest. I know the system apparently only brought bookmarks back and (as far as I know for now) didn't took them away (but it should, since many were deleted or moved for being no longer useful), but I think this whole experience shows that the system should be looking at individual changes by timestamp to each one, not whenever the whole set was saved, and specially: do not save a set BEFORE syncing.  </p><p>Plus, this made me wish for an option to undo synchronizations or save a current set for later reboot, so we could have more control over it. </p><p>I really use these bookmarks a lot, and they're basically the biggest reason why I stick to Firefox. </p>",firefox-14201;firefox-1420;windows-11;firefox;sync-failure;,firefox,sync-failure,en-US,"",FelipeCarvalho
