The hardest part of life is the destruction of my life and I don't know what to do to inspire anyone else to help me out with the problems of my past due to the fear of being better than the other half of my life. The fact that I have to be honest with people that are counting on my heart to be the only person that knows that they are better off trusting their instincts and then another person who cares about them will show up just in time. </p>,firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1723864;,terrencecyphers

By default, Firefox Inspector only wraps HTML lines above a certain Inspector width, around approximately 1200px. If the Inspector pane is narrower than that fairly wide size, the HTML doesn't wrap — it overflows to the right, requiring horizontal scrolling which I detest. </p><p>I cannot figure out how to customize this. I would prefer the inspector always wraps, but I'd settle for changing the cutoff value to a narrower inspector width. </p><p>Does anyone know if this is possible?

This feature is completely useless. I cannot imagine anyone taking an ounce of joy when seeing this.

Here is the ""error"" according to Firefox: </p><p><strong>An error occurred during a connection to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.amazon.com</a>. PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR </strong> </p><p>Error code: PR_END_OF_FILE_ERROR </p><pre>   The page you are trying to view cannot be shown because the authenticity of the received data could not be verified.    Please contact the website owners to inform them of this problem.<em> </em> </pre> <p>I have read the potential solutions to this problem. I did disconnect my VPN (Proton) and was able to connect to Amazon on my next attempt. However, that was atypical rather than typical - when I attempted to move from one Amazon page to another Amazon page, the END OF FILE ERROR was the result. Further attempts to reconnect to Amazon have succeeded 3 out of 11 times. Yes, I did close Firefox and reopen it, I am signed in to my Firefox/Mozilla account and I did reboot my laptop. I have yet to try the other solutions because I want to be a good Mozilla client and follow the instructions attached to the error message: ""Please contact the website owners to inform them of this problem."" I have contacted Amazon and am now waiting to hear back from someone in the Technical Department. I am skeptical that Amazon will be able to resolve this because I doubt that Amazon is to blame (this lack of connectivity has also happened with Google, GMail and a couple other sites that I can't recall at the moment. </p><p>To clarify, the received data of supposed questionable authenticity has been my login information on the official Amazon login page and also simply the data from an Amazon product page (bike locks mostly) </p><p>For me, this is only a problem with Firefox. It is NOT  happening on Bing, and even Chrome is able to connect without the END OF FILE ERROR. I have occasionally encountered other instances where Firefox would not connect me but the other browsers would. Most notably, this happens often when trying to connect my laptop with my phone via Bluetooth and other times when I'm asked to sign in to Google or sign in to my Microsoft account. On those occasions, Firefox demands that I insert my original security key from an external flash drive. I would be glad to do so, but I've never had an original security key on an external flash drive. At those times, I attempt the identical login using Bing (success about 9 out of 10 times) or Chrome (success every time). </p><p>I am not a cyber guru and am not even technically gifted with computer technology and internet knowledge. I am self-taught and am mediocre (at best) in these areas, so I'm hoping that the blame for this issue is mine as opposed to Firefox being at fault. </p><p>I look forward to any advice, suggestions or resolution to this issue and I thank in advance any who reply. </p><p>I am on an HP Probook 650 G2, Windows 10 Pro Build 22H2 (HP states that this laptop cannot be upgraded to 11), Firefox version 137.0 (64-bit), Xfinity WiFi 5G, Arris SB8300 Router/Modem. All are functioning as intended except Firefox. </p><p>Be Well </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1723867;,JustJeff
