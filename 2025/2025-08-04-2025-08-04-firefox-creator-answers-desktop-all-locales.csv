(Self rescue for Beijing Firefox close),"<p>Hello, Beijing Firefox is closing. I have to sync my data by myself. I know some options. But only one is suitable for me. Other suggestions are welcome. </p><p>1. Use Firefox global account. My network to global account may be not reliable. 2. Self host Firefox sync server. Too complicated 3. Travel my profile manually. Easy for me, and may be automated by my home computer which is a WebDAV server. </p><p>I'm using 3. But I find  a big folder ""Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\fgrfgcgt.default-release\storage\default"" It is 2.65G which is a bit big. I can exclude/delete it from my auto backup? </p>",firefox-1410;windows-11;firefox;backup-data;,firefox,backup-data,en-US,"",stirwl
