There's a pop-up that i will check to confirm the bookmark's location.  But when I click on the bookmark file with the correct labeled location, the bookmarked page doesn't appear.   However, it will appear if I manually drag the bookmarked page and put it under the labeled location file.  Either way, when I click on the 3 stacked bars&gt; bookmarks &gt;search bookmarks &gt; type in the website name, the page will appear with a blue star.   Instead of relying on manually bookmarking pages, how can i ensure the bookmarked page appears in the correct location when I simply tap the star icon? </p><p>In the first image, you can see I bookmarked a reddit page under ""MCAT Stuff"".  In the second image, you can see the page is still bookmarked, but under the ""MCAT Stuff"" bookmark, the page doesn't appear. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",celebrisi2412
