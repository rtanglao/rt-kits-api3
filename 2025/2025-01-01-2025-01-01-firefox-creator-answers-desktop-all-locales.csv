Previously I was able to open these PDFs in Firefox and the contents of the comment (added via Adobe) was visible; however, recently when I used Adobe to add a comment to a PDF and then opened it in Firefox the contents of the comment were not displayed (NOTE: I opened the PDF in Edge and it displays the contents of the comment, but it doesn't display with the same wrapping as used when the comment was created in Adobe).  Interestingly, older PDFs that I added comments to still open correctly in Firefox i.e. they display the contents of the comment.  I am assuming there has been some sort of update to Adobe, and was wondering if there needs to be an update to Firefox to continue to allow the contents of comments in the PDF to be displayed. </p>",firefox-13303;firefox-1330;firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1699200;,wgiles.junk
