When done (most of?) my add-ons were gone, in particular all my add blockers, facebook container, etc.  Also, my search engine defaulted to Google (yikes!)from Duck Duck etc.  I am very specific about trying to block all ads, trackers, etc and avoiding all Google products.  Other things stayed the same like cookies preferences. </p><p>Is this done by design?  Is there a file somewhere that still has all my add-on info, that I can restore. </p><p>I really would give up on browsing if I am forced to see ads all the time. </p><p>Thank you!
