Mozilla has beginner-friendly areas like documentation, translations, testing, and helping answer questions in forums. A great place to start is the Contribute page , which lists options by skill level. </p><p>If you do want to explore code, look for “<a href=""https://watsondrafting.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">good first bug</a>” issues in Mozilla’s repositories — they’re tagged specifically for beginners. </p><p>I also run a website <a href=""https://watsondrafting.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://watsondrafting.com/</a>  , where I share technical resources, so I know how valuable community-driven knowledge can be.
