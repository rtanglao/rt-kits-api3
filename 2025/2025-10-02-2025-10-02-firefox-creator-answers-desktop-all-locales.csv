I agreed and the download appeared to have worked.   However, I soon found I could not access any of the MS365 apps. I restarted and found Firefox had also disappeared.  The icons are present in the list of apps but clicking on them gets no response. </p><p>I have deleted and reinstalled Firefox and downloaded a new MS365 with no change. </p><p>I have Norton online antivirus and the MS365 comes with continuous Defender using Malwarebytes.  (I am running down the remaining Norton subscription).  I have also used both to do a sweep on each but no problems were found. </p><p>I have Outlook which has not been affected. </p><p>I am coming to the conclusion that I may need to do a full deletion of both.  Can anyone suggest any other way to deal with this? </p>",firefox-14201;firefox-1420;windows-10;firefox;update-failure;,firefox,update-failure,en-US,"",nowsaga31

Seems I can only use a blank page or your default home page. And if I want my normal home page I need to click on the home icon. In the course of a day, that's a LOT of extra clicking or the alternative, typing my search query into a tiny URL bar.   </p><p>Are you planning to change this? Or is this Mozilla control by default the new norm? I'm so sad to admit to be exploring Mullvad and Brave now.

I'm on a relatively new to me (refurb) desktop computer running Win 10 Pro (64 bit)* and Firefox 143.0.3. </p><p>In the past week both Firefox and Win 10 have updated.

I have all my bookmarks back, etc.  It also keeps changing my ""default to Firefox"" while I'm using Firefox, so I have to keep telling settings that yes, I still want FF to be the default browser. </p><p>Why is it doing this?
