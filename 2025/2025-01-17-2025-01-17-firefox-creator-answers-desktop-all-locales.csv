However, Firefox for some reason switches to tablet mode (see image attached). When I connect the typecover keyboard, firefox switches to desktop mode.  </p><p>So it seems as if FF thinks the PC should be in tablet mode because the typecover is not connected. But it shouldn't because a dock is connected.  </p><p>It worked perfectly for years, but since two days not anymore. It is not a major issue, but rather inconvenient.  I already restarted PC and reinstalled FF. </p><p>kind regards </p><p>Jan </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",janverstr

Now the volume resets to what was set on YOUTUBE rather than sticking to what was set in the VOLUME MIXER every time a new video plays or any time the page refreshes. This means that the volume gets reset every. single. time. The issue with this is not only that YouTube's volume slider isn't as accurate as KDE Plasma's, but also that a media player in a browser shouldn't be controlling its own system volume within the mixer because it causes issues and frustrations like these.  </p><p>How do I separate player and stream volume?

With any other chromium based browser there are no problems. I waited for the FF update to 134.0.1 but the problem persists.

A few days ago, I got a message on Firefox stating that a new update wasn't able to download automatically, and it advised me to download the latest version of the app instead. I attempted to do this from the Mozilla site, but the file would never download no matter how long I waited; it would get all the way to the end and just spin endlessly without completing the download. I thought I might be having some issue with Firefox in general, so I attempted to uninstall and reinstall the app; I uninstalled it but then found myself still unable to download the app to reinstall it even while using other browsers like Chrome or Safari. I've tried repeatedly to download the app while connected to different wi-fi networks, networks which I've known to be stable. I've been able to download other files without an issue (although none I've tried are as large). I even tried to complete the download using a proxy site, but was still unsuccessful.
