I can choose ""New window"" in the drop down menu and that window will have the bookmarks, but still will not connect. The only way to get the bookmarks and also be able to connect to the internet is to choose ""New private window"" from the drop down menu. The problem with that is that there have been occasions when I have had a need to examine my browsing history, which I can't do since Firefox doesn't save the history when in private window mode. I have tried the procedure to sync bookmarks, history, etc., but the procedure is somewhat confusing and didn't work for me.  Can you simplify the procedure for me?
