Everything seems to have gone ok, except that the Firefox bookmarks were installed and only work in the private browsing window. When I start Firefox normally, the window that opens does not have the bookmarks, and even if I enter a web address manually in this window, it will not connect. I can choose ""New window"" in the drop down menu and that window will have the bookmarks, but still will not connect. The only way to get the bookmarks and also be able to connect to the internet is to choose ""New private window"" from the drop down menu. The problem with that is that there have been occasions when I have had a need to examine my browsing history, which I can't do since Firefox doesn't save the history when in private window mode. I have tried the procedure to sync bookmarks, history, etc., but the procedure is somewhat confusing and didn't work for me.  Can you simplify the procedure for me?

Examining the desktop shortcut for the PWA confirms that the URL it targets is ""<a href=""https://discord.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://discord.com</a>""; however, changing this url manually in the shortcut then relaunching it STILL only navigates to the <a href=""http://discord.com"" rel=""nofollow"">discord.com</a> domain, not the full <a href=""http://discord.com/channels/@me"" rel=""nofollow"">discord.com/channels/@me</a> url path that I specified.  </p><p>Can anyone else confirm whether PWAs can only currently target a domain, not a specific url path? </p>",firefox-1430;windows-10;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,1771442;,fiffox
