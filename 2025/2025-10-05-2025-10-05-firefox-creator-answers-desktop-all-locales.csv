The refresh page and back buttons do not work and neither does the ability to click on any links on the page. I have to close the tab and start again. The issues still occur on new tabs. Eventually I have to close FireFox altogether but when I try to open FireFox again it does not work or takes a few minutes and sometimes the message Firefox is still running. At times I have had the sound of the videos, when they do play, from YouTube still playing even when the browser is closed. </p>",firefox-14304;firefox-1430;windows-11;firefox;app-responsiveness;,firefox,app-responsiveness,en-US,"",pete_scott2
