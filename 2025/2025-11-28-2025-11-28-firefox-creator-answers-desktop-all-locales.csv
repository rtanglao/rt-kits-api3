It's incoherent!  Don't tell me what to do without telling me HOW to do it!  We customers are not all software engineers.  Unfortunately the software engineers who write everything I've been reading haven't learned that.  I constantly read stuff that use terminology that is not self-explanatory. Then I'm asked to make a decision that is so badly defined that I have no idea what I'm deciding! SPEAK PLAIN ENGLISH!!!!!  Don't ask me to choose among a list of options that YOU have defined, but none of which have any relationship to what I need to know.  The ""which topic"" box just above this one is a perfect example.  It took me a long time to even find this opportunity to speak to you!  Choosing between incoherent options does not advance clarity for me or knowledge for you.  Just stop using computer lingo and speak in a manner that would be understood by a 9 year old, or in my case, a 79 year old retired mechanical engineer. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to actually vent my frustration at what I run into on a daily basis, not just with Mozilla.  Tom Riddering, [email address] </p><p>P.S.  This whole incoherent mess this evening started when I tried to authorize McAfee to protect me from trackers, just exactly what that means I'm not sure, but it sounds bad.  It's not at all clear just what would be tracked, who would bother tracking me, and why I need protecting.  My life is so utterly boring. </p>",firefox;tracking-protection;,firefox,tracking-protection,en-US,1782478;,volkfolks
