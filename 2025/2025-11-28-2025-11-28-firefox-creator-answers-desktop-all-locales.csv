I verified this by checking about:addons, and I only have the following extensions installed: </p><p>DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials </p><p>Firefox Translations </p><p>Gibiru for Firefox </p><p>None of them inject any ChatGPT functionality. </p><p>I then opened about:config to disable the feature, but the usual preferences do not exist on my system.
