I close them and they come back, always","<p>When I open Firefox browser around ten several weeks old tabs are there. It is not set in the setting to open. I did many attempts to get rid of this nuisance and they are still here. I Created new profile, erased all profiles, removed Firefox, and reinstalled with option not to use old setting since new installation found that the fire fox has been installed. And frustration part that Mozilla do not offer (as I know) support to fix this problem. This glitch is hidden somewhere and the program always find it an put it back. I am not sure if what to do as I run out of options, other than turn to another browser after many years using only Firefox with no problems at all.
