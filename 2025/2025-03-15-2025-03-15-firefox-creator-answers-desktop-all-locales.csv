I'm sure this is true of many other people's documents in many other fields and businesses. Who can we contact at Mozilla to insist that Mozilla's tampering with PDFs has to stop immediately?

This means the full name in most official documents, including passports, take the format: </p><p>Name: &lt;name&gt;  Surname: &lt;first surname from father&gt; &lt;first surname from mother&gt; </p><p>Here is an example of the famous (deceased) Spanish poet: </p><p>Name: Federico  Surname: García Lorca </p><p>Note the two part surname. There is no hyphen nor should there be one. He has TWO surnames. </p><p><strong>PROBLEM</strong> A recent update in Firefox introduced a single field for name under Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Saved Addresses which is used by Autofill to fill forms.  </p><p>Our poet would enter ""Federico García Lorca"" under name. If he were then to purchase a plane ticket and rely on Firefox Autofill to fill in the details, Autofill -- in a very narrow anglophone view -- will interpret ""García"" as a middle name and suppress it.   </p><p>As a result, the plane ticket will be issued to ""Federico Lorca"" who is not even the same person, and who may not even exist. Moreover, he may be denied boarding the plane or refused entry into the USA because the name on the ticket does not match any of his official documentation. </p><p>I have had to disable Autofill for this reason.  </p><p><strong>SOLUTION</strong> A proposed solution is to do like Edge does: Have separate Name and Surname fields the user can specify. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",Music42531

And if I can get it to shut down (the browser), it will get into this loop where it just loads back up all the same windows, and that same particular tab will lockup again as soon as I click on it. And it takes foreevvvver  to load back up even when I don't interact with the browser aside from CMD-Tabbing tf out of there. Tbh I'd prefer FF to launch clean after being told to shut down.
