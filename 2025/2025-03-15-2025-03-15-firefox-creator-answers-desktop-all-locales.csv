I am using the unbranded build specifically so that I do not have to have signed or verified extensions. But tonight my browser broke anyway because of the expiring CA TLS certs for the add-ons repository. </p><p>""One or more installed add-ons cannot be verified and have been disabled [Learn More]"". If I click the [Learn More] button nothing happens. It just disappears.  </p><p>And when I check: ""uBlock Origin could not be verified for use in Nightly and has been disabled."" </p><p>This should not be happening in the unbranded builds. I imagine it is happening in the custom Debian esr too. They're supposed to allow unsigned/unverified extensions/add-ons but now this apparently bug is happening. </p><p>To be clear, this was expected for normal Firefox releases with all normal extension signing stuff. But that was explicitly not supposed to be required for the unbranded builds. And so this is a bug. </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1718300;,mozilla706
