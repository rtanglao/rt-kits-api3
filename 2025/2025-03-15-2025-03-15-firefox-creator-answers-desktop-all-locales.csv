And I would expect a prompt when my computer had been shut down, or OS/FF had updated - seems normal. As of a couple weeks maybe months ago, I'm being asked for it what feels like constantly. In fact, It just asked me twice back to back withing the same session/tab/interaction with Passwords. That feels like a lot, esp if you actually have longer and more complex pwd<em>s than 90% of us. (And me sometimes, not claiming to be a pw angel or anything lol). But personally, Mozz/FF passwords fall into the top tier of my brains security hierarchy, along with my Apple Account, private keys, device encryption, MFA recovery, etc...things you'd generally be sure to incorporate best practices with and really don't wanna forget or lose. I don't really love the idea of turning it off, buuuut getting a bit grumpy about being pestered all day from Firefox.  </em> </p><p>So bug? Updated policy?

Hopefully not the third one.  </p><p>On an M4 Max running Sequoia Version 15.2 (24C101) using FIrefox 136.0.1 at the moment, but have noticed the same on a Yoga/Windows 11, iPhone, M1 Macbook Pro. </p><p>Privacy/Security is set to Strict.

I've been having a rough time lately on this M4 Max - 16 cores, 64GB mem with tabs freezing up the whole browser, every window. Sometimes the whole OS. Not specific to any certain site, and has happened with 1 windows and 3 tabs open just as often as 4 windows with 40 tabs open. <strong>And usually I cant even get to Activity Monitor at that point to see if it looks like a memory leak, or whatever. And if I can get it to shut down (the browser), it will get into this loop where it just loads back up all the same windows, and that same particular tab will lockup again as soon as I click on it. And it takes foreevvvver  to load back up even when I don't interact with the browser aside from CMD-Tabbing tf out of there. Tbh I'd prefer FF to launch clean after being told to shut down. Always have the option to load recent windows anyway....</strong> </p><p>^ aaand then saw the blatantly obvious checkbox to turn off reload on start my bad. üòÖ  </p><p>Sorry last thing - what exactly does ""We've made some educated guesses about your current browser and operating system."" mean?
