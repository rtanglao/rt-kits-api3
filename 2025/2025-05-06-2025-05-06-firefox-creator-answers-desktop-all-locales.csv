I have to open Sidebar Bookmarks manually every time I open Firefox Mozilla.,"<p>Been using Firefox for many years.  Configured the Firefox Browser to automatically open the Sidebar Bookmarks every time I open Firefox browser.  About a week ago that configuration stopped working and I can not re-set it to automatically open the Sidebar Bookmarks when I open the Mozilla browser.  When I search online I see I am not the only user of Firefox who has developed this same problem.  I suspect it occurred when Firefox updated their browser.  Would appreciate getting that feature restored as it is annoying to have to open the Sidebar Bookmarks every time I open and use Firefox browser.  No, I am not going to leave it open when I stop using my computer to solve the problem.  I close all my apps and shut my computer down after using it.  If this cannot be fixed my only alternative is to stop using Firefox and find a new browser.   </p><p>If I am doing something wrong please advise!  </p><p>Larrey </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",Larrey

I do not remember the “esr” in the version previously. Was I sent the wrong update? I still run under Windows 7 to avoid a hardware replacement which works for my usual desktop software. Is Window 7 related to the problem? My e-mail is via Yahoo at “<a href=""https://mail.yahoo.com/d/folders/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.yahoo.com/d/folders/</a> …” which switches to an <a href=""http://ATT.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ATT.com</a> site. Tried going directly to email via <a href=""http://ATT.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ATT.com</a> and the auto-close was faster. A test sitting at the ATT login prompt for 15+ minutes without loging in did not auto-close. I also have a soft recall of looking for help on the Mozilla site for well over 5 minute without the auto-close. Is Yahoo/ATT email the issue. If so, do I need to talk to them? Directory “PC:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\UpdateLogs ” has 3 files with 4/30/25 dates which is about when problem started.
