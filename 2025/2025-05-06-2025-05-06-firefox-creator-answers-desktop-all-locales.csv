1510152,2025-05-05 17:13:58 -0700,2025-05-05 17:13:58 -0700,firefox auto-closes after 5 minutes in Yahoo email.,"<p>Since the last update, (4/30) Foxfire auto-closes after about 5 minutes.  “Help, About Firefox”, lists version “115.23.0esr (64-bit)” as current. I do not remember the “esr” in the version previously. Was I sent the wrong update? I still run under Windows 7 to avoid a hardware replacement which works for my usual desktop software. Is Window 7 related to the problem? My e-mail is via Yahoo at “<a href=""https://mail.yahoo.com/d/folders/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.yahoo.com/d/folders/</a> …” which switches to an <a href=""http://ATT.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ATT.com</a> site. Tried going directly to email via <a href=""http://ATT.com"" rel=""nofollow"">ATT.com</a> and the auto-close was faster. A test sitting at the ATT login prompt for 15+ minutes without loging in did not auto-close. I also have a soft recall of looking for help on the Mozilla site for well over 5 minute without the auto-close. Is Yahoo/ATT email the issue. If so, do I need to talk to them? Directory “PC:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\UpdateLogs ” has 3 files with 4/30/25 dates which is about when problem started.  I can email file fro any directory subtree starting with MOZILLA\ if it will help diagnose the issue.
