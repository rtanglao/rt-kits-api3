Unable to restore last bookmark file.,"<p>This morning, Tuesday, 21-Jan-2025, I submitted a Firefox bug report. </p><p>After the latest version of Firefox (Jan 21, 2005 at 8:45:59 AM, version 134.0.2 (20250120135430)) was installed my bookmarks disappeared.  I was unable to restore the latest bookmark file from the ""Other Bookmarks, restore"".  I was able to select the file but it wouldn't installed. </p><p>I tried several possible solutions base on past experience.  This issue happened once before.  Nothing I did worked until I access your Online website page detailing how to verify the integrity of Firefox.  The verify search displayed a ""place.sqlite"" file was corrupt. </p><p>I examined the Profile ""ft4ltmzl.defalult-release"" file scrolling down to sqlite .  Yep.  There was a corrupt sqlite file in the profile.  Following the instructions in you website page on how to remove a corrupt sqlite file I remove the corrupt file(s) then restarted Firefox.  Volia.  My bookmarks were back again.  Firefox re-established the database.  All is well. </p><p>You did a great job detailing how to verify Firefox and how to remove a corrupt sqlite file(s).  The instructions were easy to follow for this particular issue. </p><p>Thank you. </p><p>James. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",giebelhausj
