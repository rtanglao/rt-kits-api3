Eek I thought it would be smarter and see that the new MBP was a newer version and had no configuration. Now I have blown away the containers and have to remake them. I also notice now that my settings - home page, history are not the same yet so I will have to look into what is going on there. </p><p>I am disappointed with the way this is going. Your initial master sync should be clear, there is no way to see if it is done or running or completed the initial sync. Honestly, the master sync should be treated differently from intermittent syncs anyway.
