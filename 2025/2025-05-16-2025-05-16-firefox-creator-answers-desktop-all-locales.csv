Can someone tell me or help me with what number that was, and when that disaster happened to me?  I lost a lot of critical bookmarks and have been trying since then myself to restore what was lost.  I know I should have backed up, but who knew this was going to happen?   Almost none of my bookmarks migrated over.  I know it's been a while, but if anyone can help, please drop me a line.  </p><p>Randy </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",randydavid

Rather than going one by one with Manual entry of each site that you want to retain site data and cookies for, why not generate/provide a list, populated the way the Manage Data function works. And then, let the user just select the exceptions to auto cookie deletion when you close Firefox? </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",sunrider4077
