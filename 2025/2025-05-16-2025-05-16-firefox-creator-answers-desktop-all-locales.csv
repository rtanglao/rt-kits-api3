Rather than going one by one with Manual entry of each site that you want to retain site data and cookies for, why not generate/provide a list, populated the way the Manage Data function works. And then, let the user just select the exceptions to auto cookie deletion when you close Firefox? </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",sunrider4077
