However there is an issue with the PWA icons under Windows, in the Start menu. In the all programs tab the icons are correctly the icons of their respective websites, but if the icon is pinned as a tile it switches to the default firefox icon making it hard to tell them apart at the first glance.

I have a new mac mini 4 and have the latest update for firefox. it's absolute dogshit to be honest. I'm lucky if the browser lets me click on anything, eg., bookmarks, add-ons, history are nonfunctional. Also my tabs on the browser get squished together and superimposed such that 2-3 separate tabs appear as though they are one tab. I have never had an issue like this before when using firefox. I don't encounter the issue with safari or chrome, but I don't like those browsers.

If I try to copy a shared link in OneDrive or SharePoint on my desktop and then paste that link into Outlook Web App, the paste function does not work. The option is there, but the actual pasting does not materialise. CTRL+V also does not work. The only thing that does work is if I paste the link into another window first and then copy again, and the CTRL+V works. Right click and paste never works.  I have tried this in a private window and in safe mode. I have also checked the clipboard settings in about:config to make sure they are not working against me. It works fine on Chrome.  I made a quick Loom to demo the issue: <a href=""https://www.loom.com/share/911ae68d614947aa9ea6beaba0d2f5b0?sid=2257b601-939b-4d95-90d8-bb2c95b1ed81"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.loom.com/share/911ae68d614947aa9ea6beaba0d2f5b0?sid=2257b601-939b-4d95-90d8-bb2c95b1ed81</a> Firefox is up to date, as is Windows. It has been like this since I moved over from Chrome a few weeks ago. Is this a common issue or a 'me' problem?  I have seen all the workarounds, but I am trying to understand why right-click, paste just doesnt work.
