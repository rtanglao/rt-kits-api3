I was visiting a site and it forced me to change password. So I let Mozilla auto-generate one and clicked update. The password however didn't match their requirements.  So now I am stuck with Mozilla that has updated password in its and the site that requires the old one.  Luckily I can see that there is file called ""logins-backup.json"" in my AppData directory. I have no idea how to access it and restore it though. I tried copying or renaming the file, but windows keep saying I don't have permissions to do that(even though I am owner of the file).  Is there any way to restore the old password? Thank you. </p>",firefox-14601;firefox-1460;windows-11;firefox;password-manager;,firefox,password-manager,cs,"",vavra.pepa
