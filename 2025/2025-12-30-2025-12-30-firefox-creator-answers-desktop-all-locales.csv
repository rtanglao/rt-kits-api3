On Google Chrome, any streaming website I used with autoplay enabled would KEEP full screen mode ON after changing episodes. It would automatically go to a new page with the following episode and remain full screen. Why doesn't Firefox have this feature?? I'm seriously considering going back to Google Chrome for this one small feature. Every time I had any streaming service playing with autoplay enabled, I didn't have to manually select the full screen option every time. I am having to stand up and manually click full screen function. Every. Single. Time.

I was visiting a site and it forced me to change password. So I let Mozilla auto-generate one and clicked update. The password however didn't match their requirements.  So now I am stuck with Mozilla that has updated password in its and the site that requires the old one.  Luckily I can see that there is file called ""logins-backup.json"" in my AppData directory. I have no idea how to access it and restore it though. I tried copying or renaming the file, but windows keep saying I don't have permissions to do that(even though I am owner of the file).  Is there any way to restore the old password? Thank you. </p>",firefox-14601;firefox-1460;windows-11;firefox;password-manager;,firefox,password-manager,cs,"",vavra.pepa
