Firefox behaves as if the setting is disabled. This is the third time I've experienced this issue in the past year, and every time the only solution that worked was to create a new profile. It is exhausting to get a new profile back to exactly how the old profile was, and it's something I shouldn't have to do. </p><p>Scenario: I am on Windows 11 (though this has also happened to me on Windows 10), currently using version 146.0.1 (though this has happened on previous versions). CTRL-Tab cycles in the most recently used order just fine for several months, then it suddenly doesn't—this happens in the middle of an active session, i.e., not after a restart of the browser nor the computer itself. I have four add-ons, none of which control tab cycling, nor have I added/removed any add-ons nor changed any of their settings since their initial installation many months ago. </p><p>What I've tried: </p> <ul><li> Disabling/re-enabling the setting (even though it is already checked) </li><li> Disabling/re-enabling the config <em>browser.ctrlTab.sortByRecentlyUsed</em> </li><li> Restarting Firefox normally </li><li> Restarting with add-ons disabled—note that the issue persists even with add-ons disabled </li><li> Disabling the setting, then restarting Firefox, then re-enabling the setting </li><li> Restarting the computer </li></ul> <p>It's the same thing described in <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1i0rsvt/ctrltab_no_longer_cycles_in_most_recently_used/"" rel=""nofollow"">this Reddit thread</a>.
