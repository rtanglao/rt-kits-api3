Two fake Trust Wallet add-ins were disabled within the last couple of days after one stole my money and I reported it, and another similar one. They had been pinned to my toolbar and they were subsequently taken off from there with the message that they had violated Mozilla's policies. Now I see that again there are two of them. How can this be prevented? The most obvious sign that these are fake is when one goes to create a new wallet the add-in directs the user to import instead, i.e. it wants to steal private information like recovery phrase. </p>",firefox-1400;windows-10;firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",pdreyfuss
