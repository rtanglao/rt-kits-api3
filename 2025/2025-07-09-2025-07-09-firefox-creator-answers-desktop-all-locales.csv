I can no longer use the website.,"<p>I once used a website for support for my mental health. There is no other website like it, and I would not be here today without it. For several years now, I've attempted to re-access the website. I have even gotten to the final page (which is rare) but when I click on the ""I hereby consent"" button - nothing, just errors. I've added the main website and the page site that will not load to all exceptions of all privacy settings I have switched on, but nothing. To be honest, I can't tell if it is Firefox or not, as other browsers give me the exact same issues. I have ADHD and reading, and making sense of the various solutions seems impossible. I cannot even access the website with all other antivirus &amp; malware software, VPN or any other security software and extensions turned off. Remedying this feels hopeless. How can I get assistance? I only wish to sign back up but I can't. I do not believe it is the website creating the issue. I have screenshots showing the error pages, how do I send diagnostic data to you so you might be able to help? </p>",firefox-14004;firefox-1400;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,1747496;1747529;,noncompliant

How can this be prevented? The most obvious sign that these are fake is when one goes to create a new wallet the add-in directs the user to import instead, i.e. it wants to steal private information like recovery phrase. </p>",firefox-1400;windows-10;firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,1747500;1747525;1747528;1747532;1747533;,pdreyfuss
