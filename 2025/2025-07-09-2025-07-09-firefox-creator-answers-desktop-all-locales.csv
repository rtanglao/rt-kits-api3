I can no longer use the website.,"<p>I once used a website for support for my mental health. There is no other website like it, and I would not be here today without it. For several years now, I've attempted to re-access the website. I have even gotten to the final page (which is rare) but when I click on the ""I hereby consent"" button - nothing, just errors. I've added the main website and the page site that will not load to all exceptions of all privacy settings I have switched on, but nothing. To be honest, I can't tell if it is Firefox or not, as other browsers give me the exact same issues. I have ADHD and reading, and making sense of the various solutions seems impossible. I cannot even access the website with all other antivirus &amp; malware software, VPN or any other security software and extensions turned off. Remedying this feels hopeless. How can I get assistance? I only wish to sign back up but I can't. I do not believe it is the website creating the issue. I have screenshots showing the error pages, how do I send diagnostic data to you so you might be able to help? </p>",firefox-14004;firefox-1400;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,1747496;,noncompliant

Two fake Trust Wallet add-ins were disabled within the last couple of days after one stole my money and I reported it, and another similar one. They had been pinned to my toolbar and they were subsequently taken off from there with the message that they had violated Mozilla's policies. Now I see that again there are two of them. How can this be prevented? The most obvious sign that these are fake is when one goes to create a new wallet the add-in directs the user to import instead, i.e. it wants to steal private information like recovery phrase. </p>",firefox-1400;windows-10;firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,1747500;,pdreyfuss
