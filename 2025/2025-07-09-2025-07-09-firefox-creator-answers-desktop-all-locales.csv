For several years now, I've attempted to re-access the website. I have even gotten to the final page (which is rare) but when I click on the ""I hereby consent"" button - nothing, just errors. I've added the main website and the page site that will not load to all exceptions of all privacy settings I have switched on, but nothing. To be honest, I can't tell if it is Firefox or not, as other browsers give me the exact same issues. I have ADHD and reading, and making sense of the various solutions seems impossible. I cannot even access the website with all other antivirus &amp; malware software, VPN or any other security software and extensions turned off. Remedying this feels hopeless. How can I get assistance? I only wish to sign back up but I can't. I do not believe it is the website creating the issue.
