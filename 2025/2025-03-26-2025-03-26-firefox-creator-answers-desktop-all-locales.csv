Also in Outlook, when I type 1st it changes the '1' and the 's' to superscript, makes the 't' regular sized, and will not allow me to place a space after the 't'. I have to hit 'enter', then space, then continue typing and then go back and remove the 'enter'. </p><p>In OneDrive, I'll open it from the 9 dots at the top left of Outlook and OneDrive will load. However, a moment later it often asks me to 'sign in', even though I've clearly been signed in for some time. Sometimes I can bypass it, but often the page won't work right until I click the 'sign in' pop-up. Then, it disappears, refreshes the page and it works fine; without me actually signing in. </p><p>I bring these two issues up at the same time, because they began at the same time. I believe it started in January or early February, if that helps. I waited to seek help, expecting it could have been caused by a recent update that would be corrected later. I recently saw that Firefox released an update and my browser auto-updated, but the issues persist.  </p><p>I've reached out to Microsoft for support on this and we found the issues only occurred in Firefox, so I'm here to ask for some help, please. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",firefox-13603;firefox-1360;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",dezmey10
