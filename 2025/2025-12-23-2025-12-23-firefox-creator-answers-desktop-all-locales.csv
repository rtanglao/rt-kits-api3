My laptop freezed up and had to hard reset it. I think it update windows after that and now that I open firefox, I find that not only was I logged out from my profile, but once I logged in, Firefox thinks I'm in another device and won't load my bookmarks and settings.  </p><p>I know it thinks it's on another device since when I check my synced tabs, it shows the ones I had open before I had to reset my laptop. All I can think about is that something broke with the windows update and all I want is to load my previous settings, extensions and bookmarks as they were before. </p><p>Edit: I would like to add that I had it set up to stop with the ai stuff google and other companies and now they are back on, I'm quite angry since now I have to figure how to fix this and the ai content is making it harder. </p>",firefox-14601;firefox-1460;windows-11;firefox;sync-failure;,firefox,sync-failure,es,1788420;,yeyoeduardochp
