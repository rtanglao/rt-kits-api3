I try to uncheck the box because I don't want to pin the extension, but the check mark won't disappear. The pinned extension icon on toolbar disappears after I click the box and the check mark disappears after I move the cursor off the box. This happens after 146.0 was released and the same thing does on Beta and Nightly. I am confused by this and hope this will be fixed. </p>",firefox-14601;firefox-1460;windows-11;firefox;extensions;,firefox,extensions,en-US,"",Tak-shi

I checked my synced phone and the bookmarks were still there, great! So I re-synced the phone and the laptop.. all bookmarks are now gone. Okay, I'll restore them through the bookmarks manager, but no: every time I try to restore a backup version of the bookmarks, I get this error: Unable to process the backup file. I've tried to convert the backup files (jsonlz4) to HTML, but importing the HTML file into the bookmarks manager does nothing.  Now what? I had so many bookmarks and I need most of them, and at this point I'm really at a loss.

I'm having a really weird problem with fonts in Firefox on my Macbook Pro M1 14-inch 2021. Specifically, the fonts in the bookmark sidebar appear to be corrupted and replaced with nonsense characters that have a lot of accents. I've tried rebooting, clearing all Firefox cookies and site data, reinstalling Firefox from an earlier version on my Apple Time Machine (from a time when I didn't have this problem), checking to see if the problem persisted when all extensions were disabled (it did, even after restart with all extensions disabled), and a reboot in safe mode. The reboot in safe mode temporarily fixed the problem and I was pretty excited, but it came back. I tried updating my Mac from Sequoia to the most recent OS (Tahoe 26.2), and the problem was still there, so I tried rebooting in Safe Mode again and the problem went away, but only while I remained in Safe Mode. This time the problem came back when I reopened in regular mode. So whatever the problem is, it's something that Safe Mode counteracts. Can someone help me figure out what's wrong? </p>",firefox-1460;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;browser-appearance;,firefox,browser-appearance,en-US,1788483;,mizfrancesca
