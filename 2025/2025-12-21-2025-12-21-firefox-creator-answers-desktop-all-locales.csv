All of a sudden I am unable to add or delete from my bookmarks and I think I may not be able to delete anything anywhere else either. Why has this occurred, suddenly, and how can I fix it without hiring an IT pro? I have been using Firefox as a browser for over twenty years and this has never happened before. I am using Windows 10 and Firefox 146.0.1. Thanks, James. </p>",firefox-1460;windows-10;firefox;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",jamesnla2401
