I can display 120Hz and Edge and Chrome display without any problems. Only in Firefox there are some areas that should be displayed in white but are displayed in pink. By the way, when connected via HDMI 2.1, the display is 120Hz without any discoloration. If you turn on the dynamic refresh rate, the screen will go black every time you move the mouse. When it is OFF, Firefox browsing does not change color and can be used normally, I called Dell support and they told me, ""That's probably a problem with Firefox."" By the way, the hardware configuration is CPU:AMD Ryzen7 9700X Mother Board:Asrock B650M HDV-M.2 Video Card:Asrock Radeon7600XT Challenger 16GB OC Thunderbolt 4 Expansion Card: GIGABYTE GC-MAPLE RIDGE It would be helpful if Mozilla could address this issue. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",george58sika
