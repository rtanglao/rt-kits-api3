Really. Clear my cache &amp; delete browsing cookies on a regular basis. I use a private window for shopping and q&amp;a info gathering.  Recently I saw <a href=""http://Walmart.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Walmart.com</a> showing up in my cookies and couldn't figure out how/why as I *only* look at Walmart in a private window.  Today I realized Walmart has managed to bypass the private window options and place cookies anyway! To say I'm furious about this is an understatement. I have adjusted my settings to ""Strict"" but it's still able to bypass the private window and is staying on my computer. I am updated to the most recent FF version; running MacOs Sonoma 14.7.7 which was just recently updated; I'm not going past this one for now but that really shouldn't be the issue. This is most definitely a FF issue and one that needs to be rectified not just because it's Walmart but because if they can do it so can others soon enough.

When I can access them, there are problems. For example, on Quora, I can see the main page, but when I click on my notifications tab, it cannot load. When I go to YouTube, it shows multiple grey boxes instead of my feed. With some trouble, I can access some of my email accounts, but am unable to open any of the emails. I have managed to determine that it must be a Firefox problem, since I'm able to access these websites both on my phone (where I use the default browser) and on Microsoft Edge. In fact, I couldn't even load the Mozilla website on Firefox, hence why I am writing this using Edge. </p><p>I have tried closing Firefox and reopening it, I've tried restarting my computer, but none of these work. I know for certain that it worked prior to the most recent update, but I don't know if that's the actual problem. It seems so strange that overnight these problems have arisen, and it appears that others are having similar, if not exactly the same problems. I am attaching images from both Quora and YouTube, just so you can see what I mean. </p>",windows-10;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",jonathangcarlson
