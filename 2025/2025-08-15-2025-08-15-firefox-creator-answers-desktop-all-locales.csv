In previous Firefox versions I was able to full-screen the window, move my cursor off to the side and the controls would disappear after a few seconds and I could use shortcut keys (space for pause/play, arrows for forward and back, etc) without the controls appearing on the screen, so I could take screenshots and stuff.  But now they reappear whenever I press anything on my keyboard.  Is there a new way to do this? </p><p>If not, can I request the feature be added? Thanks. </p>",firefox-14103;firefox-1410;windows-11;firefox;picture-in-picture;,firefox,picture-in-picture,en-US,"",RavenBlueX
