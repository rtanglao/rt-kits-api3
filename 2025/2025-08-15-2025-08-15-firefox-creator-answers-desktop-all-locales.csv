Now, I am getting an error stating that their server is down.  I have cleaned my cache, cookies, turned off all of my Ad Blocking extensions, and I am still experiencing problems.  Now, I have absolutely no problems logging into eBay via Microsoft Edge.  As for security softer, all I am using is Windows Defender.  What is going on?  Please assist.  I look forward to hearing from you and time is of the essence.  Thank you. </p>",firefox-1410;windows-10;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",kirkbramlett75

In previous Firefox versions I was able to full-screen the window, move my cursor off to the side and the controls would disappear after a few seconds and I could use shortcut keys (space for pause/play, arrows for forward and back, etc) without the controls appearing on the screen, so I could take screenshots and stuff.  But now they reappear whenever I press anything on my keyboard.  Is there a new way to do this? </p><p>If not, can I request the feature be added? Thanks. </p>",firefox-14103;firefox-1410;windows-11;firefox;picture-in-picture;,firefox,picture-in-picture,en-US,"",RavenBlueX
