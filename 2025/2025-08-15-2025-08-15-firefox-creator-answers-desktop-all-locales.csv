When I can access them, there are problems. For example, on Quora, I can see the main page, but when I click on my notifications tab, it cannot load. When I go to YouTube, it shows multiple grey boxes instead of my feed. With some trouble, I can access some of my email accounts, but am unable to open any of the emails. I have managed to determine that it must be a Firefox problem, since I'm able to access these websites both on my phone (where I use the default browser) and on Microsoft Edge. In fact, I couldn't even load the Mozilla website on Firefox, hence why I am writing this using Edge. </p><p>I have tried closing Firefox and reopening it, I've tried restarting my computer, but none of these work. I know for certain that it worked prior to the most recent update, but I don't know if that's the actual problem. It seems so strange that overnight these problems have arisen, and it appears that others are having similar, if not exactly the same problems. I am attaching images from both Quora and YouTube, just so you can see what I mean. </p>",windows-10;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",jonathangcarlson

But now they reappear whenever I press anything on my keyboard.  Is there a new way to do this? </p><p>If not, can I request the feature be added?
