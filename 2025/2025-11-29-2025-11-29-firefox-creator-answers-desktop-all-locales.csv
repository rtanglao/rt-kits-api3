I asked an AI the following: </p><p>Firefox Developer Edition (v145.0.2) on Windows 11 host machine can play <a href=""http://udemy.com"" rel=""nofollow"">udemy.com</a> videos but Firefox Developer Edition (v146.0b9) on Windows hyper-v virtual machine cannot. </p><p>I suspect the cause is due to either settings or the virtualisation Hyper-V. Other browsers (Edge, Brave) on the virtual machine can play <a href=""http://udemy.com"" rel=""nofollow"">udemy.com</a> videos with no problems.  </p><p>Gemini said: This is likely caused by a specific change introduced in Firefox Nightly/Beta (v146) regarding how it handles video decoding on Windows. </p><p>The Short Answer: Firefox v146 enabled FFmpeg-based hardware video decoding by default on Windows (previously it relied almost exclusively on Windows Media Foundation). This experimental feature often conflicts with the virtualized graphics drivers (Hyper-V Video) used in your VM, causing the player to fail (black screen or error) while audio might still work or the player simply refuses to load. </p> <hr> <p>Is this true? </p>",windows-11;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",dajoyce.br
