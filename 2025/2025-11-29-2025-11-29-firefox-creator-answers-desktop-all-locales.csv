There's incomplete or erroneous selections in the drop down when using autofill on web forms and I want to clean it up. Searches for instructions keep showing this: ""Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Forms and Autofill"", but there is no Forms and Autofill section. I've gone through the other settings, Addresses, Password, Payment and other options under Privacy &amp; Security but can't find email management settings.
