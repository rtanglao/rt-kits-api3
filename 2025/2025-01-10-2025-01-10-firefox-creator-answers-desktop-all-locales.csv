I opened Firefox again and I had been logged out. After logging back in and syncing what I could, I wasn't able to get all of my data back. This includes things such as passwords, history, the theme I was using, and extensions. What bugs me the most is that I have lost my Bitwarden master password, because foolishly I did not write it down. Any help is greatly appreciated! I am not the most skilled with technology.

Basing on that I have read and experimented as well as on response to my bug report, <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1938497"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1938497</a> I suppose that the new versions of Firefox are not able to start GUI using libGL backend GLX and they require LibGL backend EGL only. This requires libEGL version and other associated libraries that are present only in newest versions of Linux distributions like Fedora-41. These new versions are for new hardware and it is pointless to install them on older hardware because they would work probably ineffectively and cause problems.  Linux is very customizable and users introduce adjustments and install software created by themselves, for years. That is why an update to radically new version  of the Linux distribution is justified after buying a new computer. This would be  required for making the Firefox-134 binary provided to run with GUI  as well as for possible compiling it from source. </p><p>That is why I would like to ask for consideretion of submitting Firefox-134  binary statically linked (at least the libraries that are required for GUI)  so that it will work with GUI on older Linux systems obeying the requirements noted on mozilla pages with Firefox releases, assuming 4-8 GB RAM is available. </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,1702104;1702106;1702108;,koz55pl
