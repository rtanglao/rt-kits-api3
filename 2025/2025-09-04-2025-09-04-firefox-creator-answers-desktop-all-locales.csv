It is causing my error logs to fill up with useless information that is taking way, way too much of my time.  Obviously, I can't delete non-existent files, so there seems to be no easy fix.  I tend to think these are soft links to these non-existent files, making them broken and therefore problematic.  That seems to be the only place where my process can find the names of files that don't exist. </p><p>Can this be verified?  Can I be let in on the secret place where they can be found and eliminated? </p>",firefox-1420;linux;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",winkey1

It's late at night so probably my brain isn't processing your help topics correctly, but I was asked to install a firefox update on my windows 10 desktop system, and I clicked on allow it to make changes to my computer and when I came back to firefox my bookmarks have completelhy disappeared and the system won't let me restore them or add new ones.  i can't understand the whole profiles thing and I don't want to close my current windows and lose all my tabs.  If there isn't an easy way of fixing this problem without closing everything and restarting, then I'll just have to live without bookmarks.  Any suggestions?  Thanks.
