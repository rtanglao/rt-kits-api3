Tried about:profiles, but nothing comes up.  Recently due screen going haywire, phone was reset &amp; the shop left me with Google, which I hate. Have been things getting back to Firefox I've used for years. Not sure if lost then. Bookmarks screen/setup I get, must be Google's, because it's not like FF's. I have Samsung &amp; Google backups, but didn't realize Bookmarks were not put in them.  Phone &amp; apps are kept updated. FYI if it matters: Due to storm damage, I'm without a computer that might help. Help, pls. I'd be very appreciative. </p>",firefox-13501;firefox-1350;firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",vlzmsu2
