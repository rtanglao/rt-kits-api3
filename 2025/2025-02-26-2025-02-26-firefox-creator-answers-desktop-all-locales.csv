I recently had a terminal problem on my Win 10 computer so have bought a new Win 11 machine. I ran Firefox on the old Win 10, had 5 email accounts, had about 12 local folders and had my Profile stored in a folder on the desktop. The folder was moved there some years ago but don 't remember how I did it. I moved it there because this folder gets backed up every night. </p><p>So, I have managed to remove the HDD from my old machine and have located the 'old' profile folder. I now need to re-install Firefox on the new machine and match it up to my old profile folder (I think...) </p><p>Any advice on how to do that? </p><p>Regards </p><p>Steve </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,1714633;,stevehargreaves007
