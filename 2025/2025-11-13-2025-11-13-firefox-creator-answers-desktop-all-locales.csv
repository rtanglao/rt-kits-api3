I am not an expert in today's IT though a very long time ago I was.  I am 81 and have incurable cancer and am confined to my home in a chair.  I use FF many hours a day and I have a very structured set of tens of thousands of bookmarks.  I use FF on a Windows 7 laptop. I am a contributor to Mozilla. A couple of days ago I noticed that I could not save new bookmarks.  I then checked and found that I could not backup my bookmarks as either json or html.  I reinstalled FF but these problems are still there. Today I have tried looking at your support information.  I looked at your troubleshooting information.  I copied raw data to the clipboard and out it into a MS Word file.  I put FF into troubleshoot mode.  I cleared the startup cache, after which I could add new bookmarks but not save any backups.  I then refreshed FF and of course I then lost the first draft of this message .  The refresh took quite a long time to complete, but it did. Afterwards I can still not use bookmarks.  If I add a subfolder into them, I complete the process, the subfolder is added, but if I then sort the fold so that the subfolder is in place, nothing happens.  If I go through the motions of backing them up, nothing happens. I see the following options open to me: 1	Buy a Windows 11 laptop, which I’m not keen on, and run FF on that.  I have a windows 10 desktop available in another room, but I have no wish to be on the slippery downslope to eternally paying Microsoft for my computing. 2	Try and revert to an earlier version of Firefox. 3	Move to another browser, though for this and option 1, how to migrate my current set of bookmarks is an outstanding issue. I would greatly appreciate advice on how to get a functioning Firefox version back on my laptop.  Yours, Jon </p>",windows-7;firefox;backup-data;,firefox,backup-data,en-US,"",jon69

I work on an app that is used by a large amount of users. Starting october 14th around 7am (UTC+1) we started observing weird behavior where a small ammount of traffic (less that 1%) would have abnormal header values: </p><p>'custom-header-1':'[custom value], [custom value of a different header]'; 'custom-header-2':'[custome value of header 2], u=4'; 'sec-fetch-site':'cors'; 'priority':'same-origin'; 'sec-fetch-mode':'empty'; </p><p>As you can see the values of these headers are mixed with one another in almost a deliberate manner (since it appended the u=4 with a comma separator and a space from the priority into the custom header 2 value). There is nothing in the client code that would do this kind of manipulation,  and from examining the logs this only happens on Mozilla browser traffic starting version 144 (which was released on October 14th coincidentally).  Not that this does not impact all Firefox traffic. In fact, just a tiny fraction of traffic from random users and it's not even all of their traffic of an active session. Just random requests that then fail, are retried and the abnormal headers are gone. </p><p>I doubt the fault lies in firefox. If I had to hazard a guess it's probably some extension acting up, but the timing coinciding with the release of 144 give me the only troubleshooting path I have right now since contacting the users is not possible. We've seen it happen 145 as well. </p><p>I'm not really looking for a solution here, just a shot in the dark if someone else has experienced this or has some insight as of what this could be. </p>",windows-11;firefox;site-breakages;,firefox,site-breakages,en-US,"",Luchen

I just created a new profile (from my ""old"" personal profile) using the new Profile Manager. I managed to import data from my ""old"" work profile to the new one. In this process, I ended up creating two new work profiles (with different names). Now, I simply cannot delete one of them. Clicking on the delete icon on the profile manager opens the new profile, and I understood I should see a confirmation dialog corresponding to the ""about:deleteprofile"" URL, but nothing is shown on this case. Also, this new browser instance doesn't show any profile management menu items. </p><p>I tried manually removing the profile directory on ~/.mozilla/firefox hoping Firefox would understand it is gone and would automatically get rid of it, but instead it automatically creates a new empty profile on the same directory, and also unmanageable and undeletable. </p><p>So, if someone could please tell me how I can get rid of this new bogus profile, I'd be very thankful. </p><p>BTW this whole ""new"" profiles is a cool idea, but IMHO it was launched in a premature state.

Both my wife and I are experiencing page load problems on Firefox in the last 24 hours or so. </p><p>Many pages, but not all, are loading very slowly, and sometimes taking minutes. The spot in the tab keeps moving (left, right, etc), and when it stops, the page is loaded or in some cases just totally blank. On one occasion the was a message about, i think,  a protocol error. </p><p>We are both on separate Windows 11 machines, rinning Firefoz browsers v145.0, and it seems that the problem is since the upgrade. We use different Anti-virus software. I have cleared all cached data and disabled the only extension added, namely Lastpass. </p><p>Attempting to load the problem pages in Chrome works normally. (e.g. <a href=""https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/</a>) </p><p>Is there a problem with this version, or is there another explanation? </p>",firefox-1450;windows-11;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",david876
