When I click on translate a page, it download some pack of the source/target languages and keeps it in app's data permanently. The language also does not show as been downloaded in the translate setting section. Unwantedly firefox consumes persistent storage only for just after we randomly to translate a page from a random language and firefox android download unwanted languge's pack and event does not show in downloaded languages. No way to clean the storage apark from ""clear data"" which we do not want to do&nbsp;!  Same happens when you have an incognito session with multiple tabs open, and the system closes Firefox when you open some other apps. Firefox loses track of the ""potentially to be deleted"" data. Firefox data increased forever after such a Hard closed session.(in low RAM device 3-4GB). No other option except to Clear Firefox's data! </p>",firefox;languages;,firefox,languages,en-US,"",coolbrijeshrana

I've also entered my google Chrome username and password to  set up my Thunderbird  email service. I never wanted to sync all my usernames and passwords in my Acer laptop computer because I felt that that made it too simple for a hacker to access all of my personal Information and access to accounts. Mozilla Firefox wants a password for csv files or tsv files or HTML files&nbsp;? I don' know what any of these  files are  or where to go to to find them or the passwords for these  files. I just want to successfully transfer all of my Favorates folders and files   then all my Documents and picture files to my new  computer.  I'm a Photography artist, Graphic Designer,abstract painter, and creative writer. I can't move  forward in my creative pursuits without completing these tasks. Thanks very much for your help and  information. I'm soon to be 80 years old and not a very good keypuncher on a computer. I'm happy to leave  Microsoft Windows and Google behind but Linux Mint is all new to me. </p>",firefox-14103;firefox-1410;linux;firefox;import-and-export-settings;,firefox,import-and-export-settings,en-US,"",Unchainyourmind83
