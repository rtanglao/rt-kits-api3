Life arises because energy flows through matter in ways that increase entropy, and biological organisms are highly effective at speeding up this process. From this perspective, people are not central to the universe—we are momentary arrangements of matter and energy whose activity helps push the cosmos toward thermodynamic equilibrium. Yet within this process, something remarkable appears: consciousness. The universe becomes aware of itself through us, reflecting on the very laws that govern its decay. Our existence is therefore a paradox. On one hand, we are insignificant—a transient byproduct of entropy. On the other hand, we are extraordinary—for a brief moment, matter has evolved the capacity to recognize its own impermanence.  বাংলা অনুবাদে রোমান্টিক বিষাদ এবং অস্তিত্বের গভীরতা তুলে ধরুন যা পাঠকের মন বদলে দেবে </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",naturesalltheres

I have to literally boot up with a Linux Live distro to be able to delete it. This is invasive and NOT OK!! </p><p>I work with multiple profiles that require backups and be copied. I also have a 'master profile' which is set up to co contain all my settings and addons - when I require a new profile I simply copy it over and voila. Not even this is possible anymore, as Mozilla has locked down the entire folder tree, I can no longer copy a new profile into C:\Users\*USER*\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles.  </p><p>I also cannot copy existing profiles (and therefore also not able to backup) out of C:\Users\*USER*\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles - access denied. This is uncalled for by Mozilla. I have complete removed Firefox from my computer, including registry entries, and even after that I'm still denied access and cannot even delete C:\Users\*USER*\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla. </p><p>The only solution to to any of the above issues is to either reboot into Windows Safe Mode or bootable media of another OS. But this is totally impractical - Mozilla cannot expect of me to stop all my work and restart my PC every time I need to perform any of the above mentioned issues.  </p><p>This is highly invasive by Mozzilla - to not even be able to delete a profile folder without any trace of Mozilla on my computer????
