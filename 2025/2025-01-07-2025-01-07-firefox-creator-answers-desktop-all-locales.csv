I would report this to Atlassian, but they'll just say ""it works with a blank browser, so it's not our bug"" and they're probably right. There's some kind of Atlassian-related state being preserved in the problematic browser profile, but I can't pinpoint it, so any help there is welcome. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1700715;,tonalf
