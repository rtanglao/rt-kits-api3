When the browser is in full screen and I display a video in full screen mode, strangely, the video is not in full screen... It's on the top left corner and the rest of the page is in violet. I tested on different site, loading a local video and the issue is the same. I can't reproduce the issue on my desktop computer on Windows. When the browser is not in full screen (F11) and I put the video in full screen mode, there is no issue... I attached a screenshot of the situation. </p><p>Have you ever encountered this kind of issue? How to resolve it? </p><p>Thanks </p>",firefox-13303;firefox-1330;firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1700579;,lyamine

This works in chromium browsers and other chromium based apps like discord, steam, etc, it also works in kde settings app, dolphin, okular, etc. But not firefox. It even works in terminal. </p><p>Both firefox and thunderbird are like this. </p><p>Is there a way to get this working or is it simply not supported in firefox?

My bookmarks on both PC and Android are arranged in some haphazard way that ""sorting by name"" under Bookmarks / Manage Bookmarks / Bookmarks Toolbar / Views / Sort / Sort by Name momentarily changes but does not persist to the next time I view.  The next time I view the sort of the bookmarks toolbar, it is always ""unsorted"".
