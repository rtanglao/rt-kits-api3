I even explored the new way to log in called ""<a href=""http://Currently.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Currently.com</a>"" for yahoo mail. Still won't work on Firefox. But it does work on Edge. I would prefer to continue using Firefox for browser but need to use Edge til I figure this out. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

This flickering is accompanied by significant lag, which only stops if I scroll away from the video or navigate off the page. </p><p>I’ve noticed that disabling hardware acceleration in Firefox fixes the flickering issue, but it introduces bad screen tearing, which is also annoying. I’d prefer to keep hardware acceleration enabled to avoid tearing, but the flickering and lag make it unusable in its current state. </p><p>Has anyone else encountered this issue? If so, are there any known fixes or settings I can adjust to resolve the flickering while keeping hardware acceleration enabled? </p><p>Here’s what I’ve tried so far: </p><p>Updated Firefox to the latest version. </p><p>Updated my graphics drivers. </p><p>Cleared cache and cookies. </p>",firefox-13402;firefox-1340;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",twinklover
