The one I'm on now, and one I use mainly for music, maybe email but not much else.   </p><p>BOTH have the SAME IOS.   High Sierra.  Both used the SAME version of firefox. (Just launched the old one to see, 91.8.0esr)    </p><p>So the computer I'm on now is up to date with version 115.19.0esr  And now so is the other one. </p><p>Problem is.... Firefox in it's infinite STUPIDITY, does NOT automatically move bookmarks OR MAKE IT SIMPLE TO DO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  OH they let me import from another browser.  I DO NOT USE ANOTHER BROWSER SO THOSE OTHER BROWSERS DO NOT HAVE MY BOOKMARKS.   What a STUPID idea on their part huh? </p><p>Now dang it all.... it took me half a day but I managed to do it on this computer.   I remember even saying out loud ""well that was too easy.""   Knowing I would need to do it again I should have written down what I did but nope, that would be logical and make sense.  I didn't do it.  Its been a few weeks and now I cannot for the life of me remember what was so easy.  (Again HOURS of one set of instructions after another, yea it was easy to forget.)  </p><p>I just KILLED several HOURS going around with some ai thing,  nothing is working.   Shortest version it had me save the old bookmarks by exporting as html.  Did that, put it on a flash stick, brought that to the new computer, updated firefox,  and here is where nothing works. IMPORT from html DOES NOTHING AT ALL. AI had me open the file to make sure it wasn't corrupt, it's fine.  It even suggested I manually drag from that open file to the new bookmarks library but nothing drags. I did try contacting mozilla but got back a reply that they do not offer support UNLESS I AM A PAYING USER.  OH HELL NO.   I don't pay for stuff so BADLY designed.   And I actually like firefox. </p><p>Ok, ranting now.  Just frustrated.   I DO remember this was an easy task.... but dang.  HOW??????????  Aside from manually opening each bookmark, copying the url and starting over......  I have HUNDREDS!   I'd LIKE to move them all and I know it can be done since I'm on my new browser right now WITH all my old bookmarks.  So yea it can be done.... and it was ""easy.""  But my aging brain lost it.     I will give this board a shot.    Surely others have had the same issue.  SOMEONE out there must have written down the ""easy"" method. </p><p>Thanks in advance. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",ArtmakersWorlds

To be noted that, when I use the deep clean feature, it also cleans Chrome, the same as Firefox, yet the problems facing Firefox cannot be seen in Chrome. </p>",firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;needsinfo;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1708081;1708130;1708140;1708229;,muntasirranamashfi2007
