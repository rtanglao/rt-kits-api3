I rebooted my modem and my computer several times. I deleted old history which I do several times a week anyway. I called AT&amp;T support team but they just suggested logging on to another browser. So I tried Edge and was able to access the emails successfully. I even ""refreshed"" Firefox and nothing changed except I had to replace several quick links. I checked for updates and discovered my Firefox browser is up to date. My Android cell phone has no issues with the emails. I have one on Firefox browser and one with Chrome on my cell phone and no issues with either one. I have been using the same log in link for many years. I even explored the new way to log in called ""<a href=""http://Currently.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Currently.com</a>"" for yahoo mail. Still won't work on Firefox. But it does work on Edge. I would prefer to continue using Firefox for browser but need to use Edge til I figure this out. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

When I visit websites with videos (such as YouTube, news sites, etc), the videos often start flickering, as shown in the screenshot. This flickering is accompanied by significant lag, which only stops if I scroll away from the video or navigate off the page. </p><p>Iâve noticed that disabling hardware acceleration in Firefox fixes the flickering issue, but it introduces bad screen tearing, which is also annoying. Iâd prefer to keep hardware acceleration enabled to avoid tearing, but the flickering and lag make it unusable in its current state. </p><p>Has anyone else encountered this issue? If so, are there any known fixes or settings I can adjust to resolve the flickering while keeping hardware acceleration enabled? </p><p>Hereâs what Iâve tried so far: </p><p>Updated Firefox to the latest version. </p><p>Updated my graphics drivers. </p><p>Cleared cache and cookies. </p>",firefox-13402;firefox-1340;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",twinklover
