Death Spells are a form of black magic/voodoo that is performed to take revenge. The spell caster is cast a very powerful death spell however you need to prove the thing that the person who you are going to punish deserves it. </pre> <p>- [ ]  - [x] Death spells may become necessary when you’ve got your back against the wall, and black magic can be a potent tool. Casting a powerful death spell could be vital too if a pre-emptive strike of the enemy has to be decisive. Death spells are steps taken to eliminate a target with a defined spell path. Many death enchantments could range from using common material to a black magic death curse. A potent curse of death spell usually involves an enchanter and an initiator. Any quick death spell designed to take out an individual in moments sets in within a few minutes or hours at most. Quick death spells are common among people in need of urgent action against enemies. Not all instant death spells should be carried out, though, as some of these enchantments may have damning consequences - [ ] DR MAMAJANICE  </p><pre> - [ ] CONTACT&nbsp;;  +27736918822  - [ ] EMAIL; drmamajanicee@gmail.com- </pre>",firefox;accounts;,firefox,accounts,en-US,"",janicemama38
