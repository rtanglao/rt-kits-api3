I've only noticed it happening on my OLED monitor and not on my secondary IPS monitor. I tried Google Chrome and it doesn't happen on that browser. Also it seems to not have any color issues when my tab isn't in fullscreen but when I full screen it the color distortion happens. It doesn't seem like I can capture a screenshot of it as it looks normal on my IPS monitor but I can still see the color distortion in my screenshot on my OLED monitor. I am currently using a ViewSonic XG272-2K-OLED 27.0 monitor. I checked my monitor settings as well and nothing seems to work. Just wanted to check and see if you guys had any suggestions to help with this </p>",firefox-1420;windows-11;firefox;audio-and-video;,firefox,audio-and-video,en-US,"",goslanabeel
