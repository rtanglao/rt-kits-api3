As soon as I opened my browser afterward, all the fonts on the toolbars, tabs, menus, search bar,etc.  were changed from the font point they were at, to some miniscule, barely seeable size.  This is happening to everything above the work screen in Firefox, and my File Explorer.  Everything below the search bar line is as it should be.  How do I resize all the toolbars etc. to their previous size?  Thank you for any relevant assistance. </p>",firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",mnosera
