I usually keep only one tab open and run uBlock Origin. I mainly visit sites like Best Buy and Amazon, but honestly, all webpages take forever to load. </p><p>Could this be due to the 8GB of RAM on the Pixel A series? On my Samsung S24 Ultra, I rarely run into these issues. </p><p>I love Firefox and will continue to support it, but this is really heartbreaking. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated! </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",ValiexCruz

I originally created the account by using “Sign in with Google.” Recently, Firefox started prompting me for a password to log in for sync but I don't remember what it was. When I try to reset the password it doesn’t work because my account is tied to Google sign-in. I’m now stuck and can’t access my account through the browser or sync my data I can simply log into forum or change settings that's it.

As soon as I opened my browser afterward, all the fonts on the toolbars, tabs, menus, search bar,etc.  were changed from the font point they were at, to some miniscule, barely seeable size.  This is happening to everything above the work screen in Firefox, and my File Explorer.  Everything below the search bar line is as it should be.  How do I resize all the toolbars etc. to their previous size?  Thank you for any relevant assistance. </p>",firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",mnosera
