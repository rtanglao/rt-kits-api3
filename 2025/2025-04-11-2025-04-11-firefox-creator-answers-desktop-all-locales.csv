It will not load a locale or a remote page.  I can kill all running firefox processes and then manually restart the browser -- with the same behavior.   I have discovered that if I wait for around 10 minutes or so, then the browser starts working and continues to work just fine until the next update.  Once past this initial update wait, I can kill/restart the browser, reboot, etc.  and Firefox is responsive.  It is only immediately after the updates that this problem occurs.

I seem to remember being able to access the internet on an old laptop as a 'test' a year or two after I'd stopped using it after Microsoft stopped supporting whatever version of Windows was on it, but I can't remember whether it was via Firefox or Internet Explorer or some other Microsoft browser. If Firefox will still 'work' will Microsoft withdrawing support for Windows 10 have any effect on how well it 'works', and/or how secure etc it will be? I am going to try to install some sort of Linux on the tablet (well) before Microsoft abandons Windows, but if it turns out I can't install Linux, I'm hoping I should at least be able to access the internet via Firefox.
