I just got tired with how shitty the browser was, how bloated it made my computer, and how much Google treats everyone like a data product. However, I use hella google systems from Voice to Chrome to Drive to more and it all worked great together. Choosing to change to Firefox wasn't an easy decision but I knew it was a good one </p><p>Which makes it super irritating that some of the functionality is already facing problems. I have shortcuts I built to make it easier to study or do random things so I don't get distracted or tired. One shortcut is clicking a key that should launch UWorld in my default browser &amp; use Lastpass to autologin (I couldn't get it to launch the service but that was a separate issue). </p><p>I check if autologin was on for the password on LastPass I've allowed all permissions to the LastPass extension I clear my cookies on UWorld &amp; turned off enhanced tracking protection for the UWorld login portal site </p><p>What should I do to fix my one button shortcut again? </p><p>I really don't want to go randomly turning off every protection that Firefox gives me to figure it out so I'd appreciate someone who understands the browser better helping me out. Also, bonus points if you can help me build a single shortcut button on my Mac that can launch UWorld &amp; navigate me straight to the question bank.  (I do think the issue with autologin on LastPass is going to become more of an issue as I start opening up more websites I used to use on Chrome so I'd rather nip it in the bud before I see the problem occur more often) </p>",macos;firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",aj20rao

Now the list is a small fraction of what was there.  And how many people know what sizes are the likes of A4, B3, JIS-B4.  It takes extra time to figure out what works best. </p><p>The old list with Letter Plus, Letter Extra, Legal Plus, etc. was MUCH MORE useful.  If I were to eliminate anything, it would be the meaningless A5, B5, etc. </p><p>At least give us an option of the old or too short new list of paper sizes. </p><p>If my comments aren't appropriate in this forum, please provide a link to where I can submit it. </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",KJS-LES
