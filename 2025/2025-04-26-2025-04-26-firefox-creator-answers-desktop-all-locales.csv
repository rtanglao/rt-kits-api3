When I clicked on the Firefox icon on the task bar Facebook would open to my home page. Then, out of the blue, this afternoon, when I open Facebook, a small page would show up then Facebook would load. When I would close FB (x in upper right corner), that mysterious page of FB was there. Had to close it by clicking on the X in the upper right corner. Tried several things but could not get it to go away. So, I uninstalled/reinstalled Firefox. Got everything reinstalled. Now,when I click on the Firfox icon on the task bar, what comes up is the Facebook log-in page where I have to enter ID/password. Before, Facebook would open automatically. Any idea why this is happening and how do I get FB to open automatically like before? Thanks </p>",firefox-13702;firefox-1370;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",boongsong

Thus, websites are not recognizing me that always did prior to these issues (Facebook, Amazon, local grocery store chains, etc.) and I am having to go thru full security log in procedures over and over again, day after day. In the past I NEVER had these issues unless I ran a CC Cleaner scan or other PC clean-up software and, even then, I would simply go thru the security procedures and sign in to their site or account one time, then would be fine for week/months until I ran a cleaner scan again. What do I need to do to keep myself signed in ongoing with Firefox so that it does not disconnect me every day and I can avoid so much wasted time with all these security measures for my commonly visited sites (incl YouTube)? If this continues I am strongly considering using a different default browser that hopefully can eliminate these very irritating daily issues. Thanks for your help, Jim S. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",jimbo54
