It seems that either the video(s) is slower to load and/or is slower to play. While it's not terribly slower in human time it's slower than normal in computer time. I'm not having this problem in Chrome. Cookies and cache are cleaned multiple times a day. So, I'm a little stumped as to why I'm having this issue. Any comments would be appreciated.

When I clicked on the Firefox icon on the task bar Facebook would open to my home page. Then, out of the blue, this afternoon, when I open Facebook, a small page would show up then Facebook would load. When I would close FB (x in upper right corner), that mysterious page of FB was there. Had to close it by clicking on the X in the upper right corner. Tried several things but could not get it to go away. So, I uninstalled/reinstalled Firefox. Got everything reinstalled. Now,when I click on the Firfox icon on the task bar, what comes up is the Facebook log-in page where I have to enter ID/password. Before, Facebook would open automatically. Any idea why this is happening and how do I get FB to open automatically like before?

Thus, websites are not recognizing me that always did prior to these issues (Facebook, Amazon, local grocery store chains, etc.) and I am having to go thru full security log in procedures over and over again, day after day. In the past I NEVER had these issues unless I ran a CC Cleaner scan or other PC clean-up software and, even then, I would simply go thru the security procedures and sign in to their site or account one time, then would be fine for week/months until I ran a cleaner scan again. What do I need to do to keep myself signed in ongoing with Firefox so that it does not disconnect me every day and I can avoid so much wasted time with all these security measures for my commonly visited sites (incl YouTube)? If this continues I am strongly considering using a different default browser that hopefully can eliminate these very irritating daily issues. Thanks for your help, Jim S. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1728248;,jimbo54
