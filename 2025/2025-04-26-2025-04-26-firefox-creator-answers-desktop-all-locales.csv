Thus, websites are not recognizing me that always did prior to these issues (Facebook, Amazon, local grocery store chains, etc.) and I am having to go thru full security log in procedures over and over again, day after day. In the past I NEVER had these issues unless I ran a CC Cleaner scan or other PC clean-up software and, even then, I would simply go thru the security procedures and sign in to their site or account one time, then would be fine for week/months until I ran a cleaner scan again. What do I need to do to keep myself signed in ongoing with Firefox so that it does not disconnect me every day and I can avoid so much wasted time with all these security measures for my commonly visited sites (incl YouTube)? If this continues I am strongly considering using a different default browser that hopefully can eliminate these very irritating daily issues.
