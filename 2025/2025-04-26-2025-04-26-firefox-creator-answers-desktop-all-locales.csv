I was having issues with my windows laptop &amp; the microsoft guy said to do a factory reset but select the option to keep my files &amp; everything will be fine. Which I did. I did the reset &amp; logged into my Firefox, only to find that NONE of my passwards had saved. It had asked for a 32 Key code but I've had this account for years &amp; years &amp; years and have never once been given a 32 key code. I thought maybe it was an option for future password reset so just clicked on 'next'. Well my bad, that was the dumbest thing I've ever done because all my passwords have been wiped &amp; I've only managed to recover a tiny handful but most of them seem to be gone for good. Is there any hope of recovering? I thought because I had a Firefox account then that would be that, everything would be saved in the that account. Really wish I knew about the code thing, I wouldn't set one up if I knew. I think my biggest lesson from this is don't full trust the Microsoft guy if he makes it sound super easy &amp; fuss free! </p>",firefox;accounts;,firefox,accounts,en-US,"",Kelsie90

Now the Bookmark displays only: Manage Bookmarks, Bookmark Current Tab, Search Bookmarks, Bookmark All Tabs, Bookmarks Toolbar, Other Bookmarks, Mobile Bookmarks.  Not only could I not add the new Bookmark but I no longer could view ANY of my Bookmarks created over the years.  This error started out easily corrected by going to different website and then back to the one that I wanted to save.  Today, that did not work and no matter what I tried including completely shutting down and turning back on my computer to the Firefox browser, I could not add ANY website to bookmark.   What I tried next was to sign out of Firefox which required me to create a new password because the previous one created was not accepted.  After creating a new log in credentials I then tried to use Sync to retrieve my data which was unsuccessful because no entries under Bookmarks were present.  What if anything can I do to retrieve these important Bookmarks?     Thanks </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",egarz20

When I would close FB (x in upper right corner), that mysterious page of FB was there. Had to close it by clicking on the X in the upper right corner. Tried several things but could not get it to go away. So, I uninstalled/reinstalled Firefox. Got everything reinstalled. Now,when I click on the Firfox icon on the task bar, what comes up is the Facebook log-in page where I have to enter ID/password. Before, Facebook would open automatically. Any idea why this is happening and how do I get FB to open automatically like before?

Thus, websites are not recognizing me that always did prior to these issues (Facebook, Amazon, local grocery store chains, etc.) and I am having to go thru full security log in procedures over and over again, day after day. In the past I NEVER had these issues unless I ran a CC Cleaner scan or other PC clean-up software and, even then, I would simply go thru the security procedures and sign in to their site or account one time, then would be fine for week/months until I ran a cleaner scan again. What do I need to do to keep myself signed in ongoing with Firefox so that it does not disconnect me every day and I can avoid so much wasted time with all these security measures for my commonly visited sites (incl YouTube)? If this continues I am strongly considering using a different default browser that hopefully can eliminate these very irritating daily issues.
