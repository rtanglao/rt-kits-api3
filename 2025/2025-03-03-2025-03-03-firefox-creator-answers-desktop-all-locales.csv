It took a while, but I got logged into sync, set up my extensions and copied over my cookie exceptions and custom CSS. </p><p>Some of the data that came over from Firefox sync seemed very wrong or out of date, most notably the settings for container tabs. No big deal I thought. I'll just manually edit the discrepancies. Once I had everything set up the way I like it, I looked up a guide on how to sync my current configuration with the cloud and followed the steps. </p><p>Phew. Time to watch some YouTube to relax. Problem is that when I finished a video and tried to watch another video, I was logged out and my site settings had reverted to default. I figured the cookie settings were wrong, so I went to the settings page and saw the behaviour outlined in the video I posted. </p><p>I've been trying to get this working for over a day now. I've tried resetting Firefox, creating new profiles and doing a clean re-install using ""Geek Uninstaller"" to make sure everything is removed first. I've tried 3 different forks of Firefox and all 3 of them do the same thing. After I re-install everything, I open the browser and the first thing I do is go to the settings but it's still doing the thing I showed in the video. </p><p>The fact that the data on my Firefox Sync is so old has me wondering. Why won't the cloud data update itself anymore? Based on the state of my containers, the Sync data is more than a year out of date. Could there be something wrong with that data that broke my browser when it downloaded? </p><p>I'm going to try and get hold of another computer later and try syncing to that to see if it breaks that browser too. I'll update this post when I know more. </p><p>Thanks for reading all this. </p><p>P.S.
