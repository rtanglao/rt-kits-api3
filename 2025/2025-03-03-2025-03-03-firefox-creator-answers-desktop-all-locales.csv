Also, it's necessary due to OS upgrades. While the Restore Previous Session is a wonderful feature, it arbitrarily (and properly, by default) forgets all of the Private Tabs. But, there are times when I'd like to save some or all of the Private Tabs I've got open. A 'settable' feature to 'Remember Private Tabs during Restart' would be a tremendous asset at times. </p>",firefox-13501;firefox-1350;firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",antiquetuck
