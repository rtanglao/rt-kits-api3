My only preferred language is English, there is NOTHING else. This has been happening for months now, and the only way I've found to deal with this is to turn on a VPN, and I don't want to have to turn on a VPN every time I'm using this search engine. Just to add extra information, I live in Japan, this wouldn't happen if I were in the US, but I'm not in the US, and the search engine knows that, and keeps putting me on Japanese websites. This is getting really frustrating and it seems like the settings cannot do anything. Also I am aware there is a translation feature, but it takes long to load depending on the page, isn't accurate, and doesn't translate everything. </p>",firefox-1440;windows-11;firefox;languages;,firefox,languages,en-US,"",jayfaychaych
