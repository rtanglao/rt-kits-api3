I have to call every time I want to pay a bill ,so they can turn something on, or off, showing I am using a computer I have used in the past. It is their security.

I can no longer clear my history or cache if I want to use my bank. There has to be somewhere, to place them in the privacy and security setting so this does not delete what has to be kept in order to have my PC recognized by the worst IT department at any bank, so I don't have make transactions, only during bank hours, and wait 30 minutes on the phone to get this turned off.
