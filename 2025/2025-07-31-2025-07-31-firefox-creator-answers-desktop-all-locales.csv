The first problem once it relaunched was that it did not show any of my tabs that had been open; it just showed a single ""new tab"" page. Upon typing any URL, though, the browser does nothing. More specifically, it does not initiate ANY network traffic (according to Little Snitch Mini). I tried various things (redownloading and reinstalling, rebooting, and refreshing firefox), but nothing helped. With the ""refresh firefox"", the only result is that, after a minute or so, the crash reporter comes up. </p><p>Curiously, on the prior update to 140.0.4, I had exactly the same issues. I did manage to resolve it by retrying things the next day and the ""refresh firefox"" seemed to be the thing that fixed it. </p><p>Hardware: Macbook Pro (Apple M3 Max) OS: Sequoia </p>",firefox;update-failure;,firefox,update-failure,en-US,"",birdwatcher42
