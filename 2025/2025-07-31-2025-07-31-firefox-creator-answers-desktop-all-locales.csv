Often the file contains nothing or just a couple scraps of 5 or 10 short lines of text.  Are any of these applications responsible for not saving the information from Perplexity completely and correctly.  Much of the time it is completely worthless.  Is there a better app for any of these steps?  Thank you.  Dennis </p>,firefox-1410;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",singstock.dennis
