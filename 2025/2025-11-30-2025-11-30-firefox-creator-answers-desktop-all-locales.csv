When I try to add a bookmark to an existing folder on the Bookmarks Toolbar, it will not show up. It does show up if I go to the hamburger menu, and then Bookmarks/Recent Bookmarks, but not from the Toolbar. This is true for any folder on the Toolbar. I do not have this problem with Firefox 145 on Linux Mint Cinnamon. Is this a bug or a feature? Please advise, and thanks. </p>",firefox-14502;firefox-1450;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",wmichaelb
