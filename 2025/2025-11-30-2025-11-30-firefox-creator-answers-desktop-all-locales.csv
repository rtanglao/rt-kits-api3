I did eventually  discovered that if I click on the “ reload current page” icon up on the toolbar it then scrolls with no issue whatsoever.   </p><p>I do understand that this is not an end of the world situation, but is happening with greater frequency and it is an irritation which at times really starts to grind that every time I open a new tab I then have to reload that tab in order to get it to operate.  </p><p>Suggestions welcome. </p>",firefox-14502;firefox-1450;windows-11;firefox;app-responsiveness;,firefox,app-responsiveness,en-US,"",cupiddstunt

My newer laptop has had no issues for the record. Both systems are running windows 11, both have the same account that I am using, etc. If it makes any difference, my older laptop is using an ethernet cable whilst the newer one is connected via Wi-Fi. When I ran into this issue yesterday on my old laptop, the issue somehow resolved itself after I created a bugzilla account, although I am unsure if this was coicidence, so now I am confused why the issue has showed up again.

I'm on an android phone on Firefox and using duckduckgo. I have avast antivirus, but the free version. And in the last 24 hours, sometimes when I type inquiries, usually if its a string of letters and numbers, it will redirect me to a website unrelated to my search. For instance, typing in mig23(looking up fighter jet), it won't do searches and instead will take me to some UK boat website. ""OICE"", a typo, takes me to a NASA OIIR website. It appears to be close to whatever I typed in, but also doesn't happen every single time. This doesn't happen on my other devices, but it also doesn't happen when I use google in Firefox. However, it is possible that this happened on my laptop but I do not have access to it right now.  </p><p>I am always in fear of viruses and I desperately want this to be a computer glitch.
