When I check the updates section of 128.7, it says it's up to date, but I know you can run 135 on Sequoia, so that's why I downloaded 135. When I looked at the profile folder in 135, which is existing separately on the Mac from 128.7, I noticed that it was pointed at the folder with release in its name that was inside the profile folder. In 128.7 it's pointed at the other folder with default in the name (the profile folder only seems to contain two folders). How do I get all of my old info to migrate to 135? Or how do I get 135 to point at the proper folder inside of the Profile folder?  </p><p>Thanks </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;macos;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",DudeLess
