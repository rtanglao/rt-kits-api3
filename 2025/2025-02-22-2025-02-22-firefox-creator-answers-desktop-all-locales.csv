All of a sudden I can no longer get in from Firefox. I get the message ""Sorry! Something went wrong&nbsp;:("" when I try to access <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/</a> as soon as I hit enter. </p><p>I can log in fine from Chrome (really don't want to use it) without any problems so I don't think the issue lies with Facebook. </p><p>Can anyone help with this issue? </p><p>Thank you - Jan </p>",firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",janmogensen

However, I am unable to use the browser at all. I have to run it with administrator permissions for it to even open, and when it does open, I am met with a completely blank grey screen with nothing but my bookmarks. I cannot click any bookmarks, nor can I click anything on the sidebar [passwords, account, etc.] I can't search anything, and I can't use direct links.  </p><p>I have uninstalled four times using Revo Uninstaller, removed all lingering data all four times, refreshed the browser, refreshed my account, changed my account password, run troubleshooting mode, updated my computer, updated my drivers, and updated the app. Absolutely nothing has worked, and I am still unable to use it. </p><p>I'm not sure what else I can do. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",lotrlover654

When I check the updates section of 128.7, it says it's up to date, but I know you can run 135 on Sequoia, so that's why I downloaded 135. When I looked at the profile folder in 135, which is existing separately on the Mac from 128.7, I noticed that it was pointed at the folder with release in its name that was inside the profile folder. In 128.7 it's pointed at the other folder with default in the name (the profile folder only seems to contain two folders). How do I get all of my old info to migrate to 135? Or how do I get 135 to point at the proper folder inside of the Profile folder?  </p><p>Thanks </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;macos;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",DudeLess
