During this time other browsers on my Win 10 PC load immediately so it is not a network issue. It is Firefox. When I see that an update is pending I hesitate to do the update because I know I will lose the use of Firefox until it is ready to respond.  It just hangs with ""loading <a href=""http://X.com"" rel=""nofollow"">X.com</a>"" showing at the bottom left of the blank screen. I have been  using Firefox for a long time and in the past year or longer it has become very unreliable. There are also instances where without an update it will do this and the only way I can get it to work is to clear the cache and the history through settings. What is going on with Firefox!
