However, it is just a tool and I don't want or shouldn't need to be a Mozilla geek to get things done.  </p><p>Following a recent update Firefox now opens in what I will call ""split-screen"" mode as opposed to full screen. This is a nuisance. Yes, I know I can us a a function key BUT I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO AND I WON'T. </p><p>I am not technically illiterate, in fact I am a retired IT professional. I did try ""preferences"", help, etc. But if I have to look more than 5 minutes for an answer it's just not worth it. I have several alternatives for browsing.  </p><p>So, please, tell me in very few steps how to change this default.  </p><p>Thank you </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",jlpalmer150
