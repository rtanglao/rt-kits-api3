When it doesn't download the page right away I've learned to turn it off, sometimes from the Task Manager, and try again. Then sometimes, somehow, it works OK, I still haven't found out exactly how to do this. Then, once it starts working, to avoid the problem I do not turn it off, and Firefox remains OK as long as I do not reboot the laptop, which I seldom have to do. Does anybody else has this problem? Any ideas? </p>",windows-11;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",emfril

During this time other browsers on my Win 10 PC load immediately so it is not a network issue. It is Firefox.

It just hangs with ""loading <a href=""http://X.com"" rel=""nofollow"">X.com</a>"" showing at the bottom left of the blank screen. I have been  using Firefox for a long time and in the past year or longer it has become very unreliable.
