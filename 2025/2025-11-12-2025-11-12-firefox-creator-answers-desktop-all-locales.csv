You will see an example in the screenshot I uploaded. When I increase the screen using comm + the type is too large &amp; the video shrinks. ((although, somehow, the screen becomes smaller even though I'm enlarging it). Even with my reading glasses, I can't see 95% of the type. </em> </p><p>I've poured through everything (i think) on the website, and I made some changes, but they didn't make a difference (other than getting rid of those miserable recommended videos on the side).  </p><p>I have another question: Do I have to use a secondary email address: my Dept. of Ed. Outlook address, but I've just retired, and won't have access to it in about six months. I also don't want the DOE all up in my business: emails are legal documents forever &amp; ever. </p><p>Lastly, the ""Share Data"" link  says ""the internal workings of your browser.""
