From a while now that I need to change to Google Chrome everytime I want to put my credit card details to buy something online. Simply because the text boxes in Firefox don't show. They're simply not there. There are very few websites where they show up for half a second and disappear right after. I've tried disabling ""enhanced tracking protection"", disabling all my plug-ins, changing the ""hardware performance"" option, cleaning cache and cookies. Nothing seems to work. I'm going crazy because I like firefox and I want to work always in this one browser, not changing each time I want to do a different task. Similar thing happens with some websites when they freeze before you explore them and the pop-up window comes asking you about the cookies. But some of these, the window disappears right away, so I can see the page but it's stuck, because I didn't manage to accept the cookies option </p><p>Please, can you advise me what can I do?

A small number of videos will work, but I have not been able to predict which will work or why. A different Win 10 machine on the same network is fine.  I have tried all of the solutions I could find searching on-line (clearing cache, cookies, reboot, restart, update browser software, etc, multiple times). Checked settings in windows, firefox and youtube looking for something. Any help would be appreciated. Have used Firefox for decades and I don't want to be forced to change browsers. </p>",firefox-14402;firefox-1440;windows-10;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,1778578;,sayaaah
