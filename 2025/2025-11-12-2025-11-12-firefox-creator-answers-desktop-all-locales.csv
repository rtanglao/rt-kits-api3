App or connection issues Symptoms: App won’t open, crashes, or shows “Network error.” Fixes: Update the app: Go to the App Store or Google Play and update Coinbase Wallet + 1,,8,8,8,4,0,0,9,0,2,6 to the latest version. Clear cache or reinstall: Uninstall and reinstall the app (make sure you’ve backed up your 12-word recovery phrase before deleting it). </p> <ul><li><ul><li><ul><li> 𝐂𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞 help line𝗻𝘂𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿 +1-888⇋ 400⇋⇋ (9026) </li><li> 𝐂𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞 toll-free customer service +1-888⇋ 400⇋⇋ (9026) </li><li> 𝐂𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐛𝐚𝐬𝐞 technical help𝗻𝘂𝗺𝗯𝗲𝗿 +1-888⇋ 400⇋⇋ (9026) </li></ul> </li></ul> </li></ul> <p>Check your connection: Switch between Wi-Fi and mobile data. Coinbase Wallet needs a stable internet connection to sync blockchain data. Check for downtime: Visit <a href=""http://status.coinbase.com"" rel=""nofollow"">status.coinbase.com</a> </p><pre>to see if there’s a current outage affecting wallets, transfers, or blockchain networks. </pre> <p>🔐 2. Wallet access problems Symptoms: You can’t log in, restore, or see your assets. Fixes: Use the right app: “Coinbase Wallet 1 8 8 8 4 0 0 9 0 2 6” is a separate app from the main “Coinbase” exchange app. Many users mix them up — the Wallet app is self-custodial, meaning Coinbase itself cannot recover it. Check your recovery phrase: If restoring, ensure all 12 words are in the exact order, lowercase, with spaces only (no punctuation). Wrong network or chain: Assets may not appear if you’re connected to a different blockchain (e.g., Polygon vs Ethereum). Switch networks in the app. Browser extension: If using the browser extension, clear cache, reload, or re-import the wallet using your recovery phrase. 💸 3. Transaction or withdrawal issues Help line 1 888 400 9026. Symptoms: Can’t send or withdraw funds; “transaction failed” or “pending.” Fixes: Insufficient gas fees: On Ethereum, Polygon, etc., make sure you have enough of the native token (ETH, MATIC, etc.) to pay for gas. Network congestion: If the blockchain is busy, your transaction might be delayed. You can check status on <a href=""http://etherscan.io"" rel=""nofollow"">etherscan.io</a> </p><pre>or the explorer for your chain. </pre> <p>Wrong network address: Ensure you’re not sending to a network that the token doesn’t support (for example, sending ERC-20 tokens to a BEP-20 address). Coinbase Wallet vs <a href=""http://Coinbase.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Coinbase.com</a>: If you’re trying to “withdraw” to your Wallet from your Coinbase exchange account, make sure you’re sending from your <a href=""http://Coinbase.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Coinbase.com</a> account to your Wallet’s address, not vice versa. 🔒 4. Security or restriction issues Symptoms: App says “Account restricted,” “Action not allowed,” or “Verification needed.” Fixes: Pending verification: If you’re using the Coinbase exchange, complete identity verification or wait for pending reviews. Device security check: Coinbase may block logins from new devices until you verify via email or 2FA. App permissions: Ensure the Wallet app has permission to access storage, camera, and network in your phone settings. 🌐 5. Known Coinbase service issues Number 888* Check the live system status: 🔗 <a href=""https://status.coinbase.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://status.coinbase.com</a> That page lists any ongoing issues (e.g., “degraded performance on Coinbase Wallet transfers” or “Ethereum network delays”). ⚠️ Important: If you’ve lost access to your Coinbase Wallet and you do not have your 12-word recovery phrase, Coinbase cannot restore your funds. The Wallet is self-custodial — meaning only you control the keys. Could you tell me what specifically isn’t working — for example: The app won’t open or load You can’t send/receive crypto Your funds aren’t showing You can’t connect to the DApp browser Once you describe the exact problem, I can give you a more targeted fix. <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/ieioidsfiousiocnklcnlkldjoiujoijoijd"" rel=""nofollow"">https://coolpot.com/story/business/complete-list-of-coinbaser-customerc-servicep-contact-numbers-247-live-person-assistance-guide-vsk</a> • Call Coinbase® Live Person • Talk to a Real Agent at Coinbase® • Speak with Someone at Coinbase® • Contact Coinbase® Live Customer Service • Coinbase® Customer Service Phone Number • Reach Coinbase® Support • Coinbase®  **+1-888-4009-026** OTA Support Line • Coinbase® Contact for Refunds • Live Chat with Coinbase® • Coinbase® Agent Help </p>",windows-11;firefox;search-tag-and-share;,firefox,search-tag-and-share,en-US,"",jackmariya1996

Many times, you can see a series of stills in the video as the time line is dragged from the beginning to the end of the video. A small number of videos will work, but I have not been able to predict which will work or why. A different Win 10 machine on the same network is fine.  I have tried all of the solutions I could find searching on-line (clearing cache, cookies, reboot, restart, update browser software, etc, multiple times).
