I'm currently studying marketing to expand my knowledge and grow professionally. I graduated in Market Management Technology in August. In recent years, my life has changed a lot. I've achieved professional success and visited places I never imagined possible. My children and my husband have been instrumental in these changes. They've always been my greatest source of motivation and emotional support. Thanks to them, I've learned to balance my personal goals more effectively. Today, I feel more mature and confident in both my personal and professional life. I continue working every day to improve myself, seek new challenges, and make a positive impact on those around me. </p>",firefox-1440;windows-11;firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,es,"",mbgranadap
