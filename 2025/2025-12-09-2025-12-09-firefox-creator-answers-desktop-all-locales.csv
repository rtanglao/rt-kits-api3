I have made no changes nor am aware of any other. Online I see many people have this problem and in different browsers. Suggestions I see are irrelevant or beyond my understanding even though I am an experienced user, but no pocket protectors. Also since I got Windows 11/new computer over a month ago, some pages take forever to load. I see all kinds of computer handshakes, looking up, google this-that and so on in the bottom left corner above the Windows icon. Have never seen that stuff before. Is this a clue re: my ""Email Link"" problem? </p><p>Help would be much appreciated. </p>",firefox-14502;firefox-1450;windows-11;firefox;loading-speed;,firefox,loading-speed,en-US,"",jcjc1

When I type my name, my 1st name comes out fine but when I type my last name it's now a misspelled last name. Seems like it all started with a new banking company that I'm with now. I 1st notice it there and I had to fill out forms to correct the info with them and it was kind of a hassle. I noticed that there was one extra letter added to my last name when I looking at my account info. Maybe when I was initially filling out my personal info with them, I might have spelled my last name incorrectly. I'm not sure. Sometimes I type words wrong. I'm not the greatest at typing. But since then I've noticed my auto fill info, my last name, has been bringing up that same incorrect last name. How can I fix that. I see solutions for editing addresses and passwords but nothing about names, personal info. Anybody know how I can fix this. It has become a nuisance. Thank you ahead of time. </p>",firefox-14502;firefox-1450;windows-10;firefox;autofill;,firefox,autofill,en-US,"",agoldenstatewarrior
