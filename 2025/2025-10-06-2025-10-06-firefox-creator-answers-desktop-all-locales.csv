I have a Dell laptop with Windows 10,PRO installed.  I have installed some new software and now need to ""reset"" my computer in order to use the new software.  My question concerns how, if there is a way, to save TABS and other items  BEFORE doing the ""reset"".  I have found several ""suggestions"" on how to do this, but  here is one I would like your response.  I found this on Chrome; </p><p>If you use Chrome browser, you can also go to Chrome's settings &gt; On startup, and choose the ""continue where you left off"" option. This way when you relaunch the browser, it will carry on.  </p><p>My question:  Does Firefox have similar solution?  I did a Firefox search and was unable to find any similar comments, although it is possible I was not searching in the right place.  That's why I am asking this question. Please respond if Firefox has an answer or someone has posted an answer. </p><p>Thanks, krazykat1 </p>",firefox-14304;firefox-1430;windows-10;firefox;recover-data;,firefox,recover-data,en-US,1769945;,krazykat1

This seems minor, but I do enough image searches that this ends up making it unusable to me in practice. I'm hoping this is just a setting i havent been able to figure out how to switch off. </p><p>Thanks for your help! </p>",firefox-14303;firefox-1430;windows-11;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",camille.e.b

And all too frequently, I accidentally press C-W (the delete-word key on my editor), and my work is instantly gone.  I spent several days attempting to solve this problem.  Apparently I'm not the only one who has lost data this way.  Entries on Reddit pointed me to <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1378404#answer-1510431"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/que.../1378404#answer-1510431</a>.  I followed the instructions carefully, and double-checked my work, but C-W still kills my current tab.  The issue had been archived, but not solved. </p><p>I am a programmer (but certainly not in JavaScript), so I try to take technically complex solutions in stride.  But after letting things percolate thru my mind for a few days, I realized that I'm not being fair.  FireFox is marketed for public consumption.  And it's not fair to my sisters, my mother, or other folks who have never programmed anything in their life, to pretend like a solution that might have worked for me (but didn't), would be even a little bit comprehensible to them.  I was particularly struck, by something that the moderator said -- not by his words, per se, but by the perspective that his words revealed: </p><p>--- Only closing a window (Ctrl+Shift+W) could possibly make Firefox display a warning, closing a tab is always done without a                --- warning as you can reopen a closed tab via Ctrl+Shift+T. </p><p>Who would know that?  I would venture to guess that 99% of FireFox's users don't even know that you can control FireFox from your keyboard -- let alone actually want to do it.  People control their browsers with their mouse. They use their keyboards only to type in forum entries and such, or to scroll up/down thru a webpage.  I can see where devs might prefer to control/test FireFox from their keyboards, but I'm surprised that they would leave tens of undocumented shortcuts lying about like landmines that  everyday users could stumble onto.    </p><p>So I'm requesting that FireFox disable Ctrl+W and Ctrl+Shift+W (which are the most dangerous shortcuts), by default.  Ideally, it would provide an about:config entry so that devs could re-enable those shortcuts if they wish to. By the way, the referenced support entry lists only 1 person with this problem, and only 6 replies.  But it lists 2124 views.    </p><p>Thank you </p>",firefox-14201;firefox-1420;windows-10;firefox;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1769941;,twathle
