I have tried uninstalling Firefox and reinstalling it, and the problem persists.  From what I can tell, there's some process which is ongoing after the browser is closed, which isn't terminating properly and that's why it's crashing.

I have two profiles, and despite following all standard methods (including manually navigating to the profile folders), nothing worked. The usual steps, including directly creating shortcuts from the profile folder or using suggested tools, failed. </p><p>I specifically wanted a way to create exact shortcuts for each profile without manually editing anything. Even after testing everything, the only option left seems to be permanently leaving the profile inside Firefox and opening it from there, which defeats the purpose of quick access. </p><p>Due to this unnecessarily complicated process and lack of practical solutions, I have decided to leave Firefox permanently and switch to another browser. </p><p>Has anyone successfully created direct shortcuts for multiple Firefox profiles in Windows 11 without manual editing? Any practical advice would be appreciated, although I’m already moving away from Firefox. </p><p>Thank you. <a href=""https://chatgpt.com/share/68e37504-cb3c-8002-8b05-f93a0edb5e02"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chatgpt.com/share/68e37504-cb3c-8002-8b05-f93a0edb5e02</a> </p>",firefox-1430;windows-10;firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",dga.roorkee

If website owners do not put google's codes in their website, Google will block their website or flag it as deceptive.  This may become a large legal issue later.  Only once the website user verifies with Google, will this be cleared.  I run over 400 websites (all of the same codes) and the websites that I verify with Google were all blocked with a notice that the sites were deceptive.   There are no difference in codes with the site that were verified and none were blocked. So I had to upload Google's codes to each website to clear the blockage.  There were no phishing, no spamming, and nothing deceptive about any of the websites. The only difference was they were not verified with Google. Thus this forces website owners to put Google's codes on their website which is giving Google way too much control over the internet.  I thought firefox was not controlled by any other company such as Google.  If I use other browsers such as Microsoft's Edge, none of my website had any issues.  Please do not use Google services as that gives too much control to Google. In addition, Google's Captcha is really another obstacle. </p>",firefox-14303;firefox-1430;windows-11;firefox;browser-security;,firefox,browser-security,en-US,1769972;,freelancewide

And all too frequently, I accidentally press C-W (the delete-word key on my editor), and my work is instantly gone.  I spent several days attempting to solve this problem.  Apparently I'm not the only one who has lost data this way.  Entries on Reddit pointed me to <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1378404#answer-1510431"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/que.../1378404#answer-1510431</a>.  I followed the instructions carefully, and double-checked my work, but C-W still kills my current tab.  The issue had been archived, but not solved. </p><p>I am a programmer (but certainly not in JavaScript), so I try to take technically complex solutions in stride.  But after letting things percolate thru my mind for a few days, I realized that I'm not being fair.  FireFox is marketed for public consumption.  And it's not fair to my sisters, my mother, or other folks who have never programmed anything in their life, to pretend like a solution that might have worked for me (but didn't), would be even a little bit comprehensible to them.  I was particularly struck, by something that the moderator said -- not by his words, per se, but by the perspective that his words revealed: </p><p>--- Only closing a window (Ctrl+Shift+W) could possibly make Firefox display a warning, closing a tab is always done without a                --- warning as you can reopen a closed tab via Ctrl+Shift+T. </p><p>Who would know that?  I would venture to guess that 99% of FireFox's users don't even know that you can control FireFox from your keyboard -- let alone actually want to do it.  People control their browsers with their mouse. They use their keyboards only to type in forum entries and such, or to scroll up/down thru a webpage.  I can see where devs might prefer to control/test FireFox from their keyboards, but I'm surprised that they would leave tens of undocumented shortcuts lying about like landmines that  everyday users could stumble onto.    </p><p>So I'm requesting that FireFox disable Ctrl+W and Ctrl+Shift+W (which are the most dangerous shortcuts), by default.  Ideally, it would provide an about:config entry so that devs could re-enable those shortcuts if they wish to. By the way, the referenced support entry lists only 1 person with this problem, and only 6 replies.  But it lists 2124 views.    </p><p>Thank you </p>",firefox-14201;firefox-1420;windows-10;firefox;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1769941;,twathle
