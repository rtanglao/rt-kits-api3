It’s not a ducking effect (as all ducking settings are disabled), and Windows volume mixer shows all apps still at 100%. The issue happens only while Firefox is focused — not minimized, not unfocused. </p><p>Reproduction Steps: </p><p>Play music using Spotify or another app. </p><p>Focus any Firefox window or tab. </p><p>Background audio becomes quieter or altered — then returns to normal once Firefox is unfocused. Specifically on focus it will change system volume to 58, then return to what it was previously when unfocused. </p><p>System Info: </p><p>OS: Windows 11 (fully updated) </p><p>Firefox Version: 128.0.2 (issue present since at least 127) </p><p>Audio Output: Realtek and NVIDIA High Definition Audio (same issue on both) </p><p>Spotify Version: Latest Windows Store version </p><p>Windows Sound Settings: </p><p>Communications tab: ""Do nothing"" </p><p>All app volumes: 100% </p><p>No enhancements or spatial effects enabled </p><p>Troubleshooting Already Tried (No Success): </p><p>Step	Result ✅ Disabled audio ducking in Windows	No effect ✅ Disabled audio enhancements	No effect ✅ Ran Firefox in Troubleshoot Mode (Safe Mode)	Issue persists ✅ Changed Firefox audio backend to winmm via about:config	No improvement ✅ Fully reset Firefox profile (about:support → Refresh)	Issue persists ✅ Verified with Process Explorer (audiodg.exe shows activity on tab focus)	Confirms session change ✅ Ensured all apps in volume mixer show 100%	No volume mismatch ✅ Rebooted and tested cleanly	Still occurs ✅ Tested Firefox Portable (fresh instance)	Issue does NOT occur (portable version behaves as expected) </p><p>Additional Notes: </p><p>The issue appears to be triggered by the main installed version of Firefox only. </p><p>A completely clean portable version does not cause the volume change, suggesting something related to the system-wide install, global config, or registry entries is affecting it. </p><p>Even without extensions, without playing any video/audio in Firefox, just focusing the window causes this volume behavior. </p><p>What I Plan to Try Next: </p><p>Fully uninstall Firefox (including deleting AppData and registry leftovers), then reinstall cleanly to see if that resolves it. </p><p>Possibly test Firefox ESR if needed. </p><p>Request for Help: </p><p>Has anyone experienced Firefox causing audio session or DSP changes on focus, especially with audiodg.exe activity? </p><p>Could there be a hidden system-level or registry config that ties Firefox to a shared exclusive audio session? </p><p>Any way to trace which audio sessions Firefox creates and how Windows handles them? </p><p>Let me know if you'd like logs, about:support data, Process Explorer thread captures, or a video of the issue.
