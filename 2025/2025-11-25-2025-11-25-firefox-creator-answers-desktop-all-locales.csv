Firefox is crashing nearly all my tabs, even those that had been previously loaded.  I cannot use it at all.  Clicking ""Restore this tab"" does nothing.  (Firefox has crashed tabs in the past but in those times, ""Restore Tab"" actually worked.)  I actually had to write down on paper the subject and website of each of my tabs (and I had a lot of them, so this took a long time) because when I clicked on each already-loaded tab, Firefox would crash it and I'd lose it--and then it would crash the next one in line before I even got to it.   </p><p>I have been using Firefox for years and it has never given me this much trouble.  I've had tabs stored on it for a long time.  ""Restore session"" always worked if I had to restart my computer for something.  It does not work now because every tab crashes with the notice: ""GAH! Your tab crashed. Click 'Restore tab' to restore your session.""  But ""restore tab"" simply crashes again. </p><p>Firefox has allowed a Masterpiece Theater tab and a link to my local newspaper, Pioneer Press (I have a subscription).  Others crash.  Even some Firefox pages have crashed! </p><p>After writing down the info for all my tabs, and then clicking on each one so it would crash and then deleting them so that Firefox had no tabs listed, I tried restarting my computer but this did not help.  I also checked Malwarebytes, my anti-virus program, and didn't see a problem there (and I've had it for two years, always using Firefox with not much problem).  I think I clicked on ""update Firefox"" recently and it seemed to work for a while after that, but now this. </p><p>I know a little about computers as a user but I'm not very savvy about repair or about all the different commands and controls.  Trying to browse through all your articles to find how to fix the problem is exhausting, time consuming and leaves me really confused because I don't really know how to do the things each article suggests.  I don't have the time to read article after article and still not be able to fix the problem. </p><p>Do I actually need to delete Firefox and then reinstall it? I'd lose all my tabs (website history is still showing under ""History), stored passwords and stored credit card information and all other stored information.  I'd have to start over completely. </p><p>I love Firefox and don't want to switch to Google or some other browser but I might have to if this continues.   </p><p>According to your instruction to the user below--please be sure to view her note--here are some of my recent crash reports.  Thank you for any help you can give me.  Please also tell me how to reply to you if what you suggest does not work.  </p><p>FYI, I have Windows 10. </p><p>--Martha Henderson (crash reports below). </p><p>bp-c0fada24-adcc-4f0e-8675-212760251125 bp-f907e9c7-8ec2-48b7-a1b8-6dae40251125 bp-629ea128-83f7-4ac7-ba8c-991530251125 bp-420f47fe-6a45-416d-b25a-c3ee50251125 bp-a39e7bbb-cb91-4038-ab19-43e9f0251125 bp-5bf134fb-3a41-4b09-8b15-cc2190251125 bp-427e7858-be55-4d41-80cd-75da20251125 bp-56e2d61b-3193-436f-a6c4-d715e0251125 bp-94074f0a-1aa5-40c9-a56d-6cb7b0251125 bp-3748b89f-591c-4326-ada6-a093a0251125 </p><p>""rose.treasure 11/13/25, 10:10 AM </p><p>No matter what I try to read or go to, Firefox crashes repeatedly.

It concerns a website called <a href=""http://blankslate.io"" rel=""nofollow"">blankslate.io</a>, which I use very frequently for taking various notes. On this site, it is possible to create a permanent account for storing one's notes, which I did not do because I thought it would not be necessary (though after this incident my mind on that has been changed). Without a permanent account, the notes taken there are saved locally only on the specific browser in the specific device. </em> Onto the issue itself. My PC had been running critically low on memory, and, because of some misleading information I had received, I thought it was not possible to free more than only a very small amount. On Thursday, while I was playing a game, the remaining amount ran out (which surprised me because there had still been enough for everything to function properly when I checked before starting to play). To free some memory space, Firefox then performed an action which I will not be able to identify (please describe to me what this action was if you can) that resulted in me getting logged out of websites in which I have created accounts. I had no trouble logging back in everywhere except for <a href=""http://blankslate.io"" rel=""nofollow"">blankslate.io</a>, where, because of the way the notes are saved on the specific browser only and my lack of a permanent account, I now have no way of accessing my work, the site displaying a message of ""This note is private"" if I try to open one of my saved notes from either my browser history or my frequently visited sites. Neither is there any way of contacting the website's developer, because of the site's nature, or finding advice online, as the site is not a widely known one. Is there any way for me to regain access to the notes I had saved on this PC's Firefox browser? I still have access to all of the notes I had saved on a different browser or on different devices, so all of my work has not been lost, but this PC's Firefox browser contained, among others, my single most important note, one I have been using daily for 5 years and am highly distressed about not being able to access anymore. Please get back to me at your earliest convenience and, if it is possible to provide me with a way to resolve this issue, I will be immensely grateful.<em> </em> </p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read my request, I truly hope there is some way someone can help.
