I want to thank those who tried to help me before, but nothing has changed. When I open Firefox I immediately receive three messages, approximately 4 inches wide and 3 inches long on the right side of my browser, covering the areas I need to get to. They claim to be from Mozilla Firefox, have the Firefox logo on the top left, warning that I have a virus, or my files are infected, or a large Alert! And that I need to click ""here"" to fix the problem. It shows a strange ""address"" a string of random letters and the odd number and the words ""merge network protocol."" I did not click on this, or the ""dismiss"" that is shown. I did, however, click the X in the top right corner of one of these. It disappeared for about three seconds and was immediately replaced by another warning of some type. These messages do not go away when I leave Firefox, they follow me wherever I go. Restarting the computer gets rid of them, but I can't access Firefox without them returning. I have tried to alert Mozilla about this, but have not heard back. Any suggestions? </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",catdubie
