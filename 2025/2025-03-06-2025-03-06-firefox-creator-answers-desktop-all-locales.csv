I am unable to obtain sound when connected to the internet. I am hoping to start an online course to learn Python but when playing the first tutorial there was no sound at all.  I looked for the problem via your website support page and discovered (for some obscure reason) that ""Autoplay"" is defaulted to ""Block"" in the Firefox settings. I decided to change this setting to ""Allow audio and video"" but to no avail. I've even tried listening to DIY store and Yuotube instructional videos but can't hear a thing. If I use MS Edge as my browser, the sound is fine. Am I missing something here? Is there more to changing the settings than I what I read? Anyway, I've enjoyed using Firefox over the years and really don't want to have to use a Microsoft browser. Is thete something you can suggest? </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",dannynpauline36

I don't care if it is unsecure it is my site/router and I want to connect. I have used this configuration many times with no problems but firefox has done something to prevent it from working anymore, this started being a problem with some of these setups a couple years ago.
