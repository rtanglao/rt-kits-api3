It also takes a long time to switch from window to window or to close any windows.  Opening and swapping between tabs is immediate. </p><p>Here is what I have tried: </p><p>- Switching off hardware acceleration. - Clearing the cache, deleting all other data and uninstalling the single add-on I use. - Creating a new profile. - Using Mozilla's own ""Refresh Firefox"" option. - Trying the beta version. - Probably some other stuff that I've forgotten about. </p><p>The ONLY way I can get things running at the proper speed again is to completely uninstall Firefox using an uninstaller (that also deletes all the registry entries), restart the computer, and then reinstall Firefox. </p><p>After setting things back up the way I want, Firefox will run nicely for a number of days, then will slow down again to the point where I have to uninstall and reinstall (whilst also deleting the registry entries). </p><p>It doesn't seem to make any difference whatsoever whether the computer has or hasn't been restarted during that time. </p><p>Does anyone have any idea why this is happening? </p>",firefox-13602;firefox-1360;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",firefox3084
