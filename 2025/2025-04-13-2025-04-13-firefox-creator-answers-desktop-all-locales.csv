Yesterday they disappeared, so I rebooted my computer and the bookmarks came back, but not the favicons. I had to click on each bookmark to get the favicon to load, but even that didn't work on each one (and no, I am not going to click on every single bookmark I have, that would be ridiculous!).

My NordVpn account was doing the same tying with their Protection pro* (removed it- Ok now) . I have had FF #2 on comp. for a long time and I think I'm now just waiting to sign in now as I don't have FF PW-not problem. Making sure if I sign in to FF2 I won't loose my saved FF info...
