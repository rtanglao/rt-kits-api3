They place me all over Eastern Iowa.  That's WRONG! I am NOT in Cedar Rapids.  NOT in Marion, IA.  NOT in Davenport, IA.  NOT in Tipton or Decorah.  NOT in Illinois! </p><p>THE ONLY PLACE I AM (with my computer) IS WHAT I SET IN MY DEFAULT LOCATION:  CORALVILLE, IA   52241     I'm not even in Iowa City, although it is near. </p><p>It would be great if one could choose which sources are used for one's location.   Is that possible? I don't want information sent to me about locations where I am NOT living and never have lived there. I hope you can understand what an annoyance it is, year after year, always to be located in the wrong place. I wouldn't care if some websites knew my location if it was the correct location. </p>",firefox-1350;firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",janecarlson48
