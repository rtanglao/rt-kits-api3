I just tried to implement a CSP and it worked except for one small section of my website that allows a user to upload an image and that image is supposed to be displayed back to the user. Anyways long story short the CSP blocked me so I tried to whitelist data: and it still didn't work. defeated I removed the CSP from Nginx to work on it later but when I went to try and test again I get this error.  ``` Content-Security-Policy: The page’s settings blocked the loading of a resource (img-src) at data:image/webp;base64,UklGRqbeAABXRUJQV… because it violates the following directive: “default-src 'self'” ``` I have confirmed with Curl and by inspecting the network tab that there is no CSP included in the headers anymore. I have restarted Firefox, created a new Firefox profile, and cleared my cache to the end of time and yet still the error persists. I don't know where or how Firefox is storing website headers but they persists and also apparently work between profiles an implication I'm not going to delve into here. If someone could point me to the file where the headers are stored so I can delete it that would be wonderful.  </p><p>specs Qubes OS 4.2 Mozilla Firefox 140.4.0esr </p>",firefox-1400;linux;firefox;blocked-application-service-website;,firefox,blocked-application-service-website,en-US,1782044;,jadentyler72
