I could open the selected puzzle and be prompted to open with Firefox or Adobe and then be able to print.  Now, when I click on the selected puzzle nothing loads. I've cleared recent history, looked at permissions, turned off privacy settings in Duckduckgo and   nothing seems to work. I have resorted to using Edge (which I hate) to print the crosswords.  Has anyone got a solution? </p>",firefox-14502;firefox-1450;windows-11;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",sjarmain
