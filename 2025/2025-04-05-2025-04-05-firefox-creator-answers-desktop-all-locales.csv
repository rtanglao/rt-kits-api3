I say ""unfortunately"", because FireFox takes FOREVER to load, especially compared to Safari. But, more importantly, there was something about Safari that I really liked; that I apparently cannot get with FireFox. But this is odd, since FireFox seems to have so many more user preferences than Safari! And yet there appears to be no way to open FireFox in fullscreen. </p><p>If Safari is in full screen, when browser is closed, Safari remembers this, the next time Safari is opened in full screen. With firefox, I always have to go through long start up, and then I have to manually click zoom button, to go full screen. </p><p>Is this something you never considered or something FireFox cannot do? Again, I guess I am surprised at how many preferences are available for FireFox, but nothing like this, even though this is a feature in a competing browser! </p><p>I am not sure, but, even if this is more of a Mac feature than a Safari feature, since I am using Mac version of FireFox, seems like FireFox could or should work the same way as Safari!
