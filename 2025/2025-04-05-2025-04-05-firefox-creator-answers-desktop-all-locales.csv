Then I tried to move a tab to the bookmarks toolbar - and nothing happened.

You just keep asking me to synchronize HEY SYNC YOUR DATA NOW!, and then when you need it most, you lose your favorites and extensions as if you were using the browser in incognito mode (where nothing is saved and you can't recover anything after formatting), any synchronization consumes some computer resources, but yours doesn't make any sense. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,pt-BR,"",xerocromes
