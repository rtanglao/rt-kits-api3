Perhaps the reason is they are a lot (1000+ bookmarks), but I still hope it could work, because I want to switch to Firefox, but won't be able to do this if I can't transfer all my bookmarks. </p><p>There are basically two methods. One is the automatic method that is provided during the installation of Firefox. It transferred all the other stuff from Chrome but not my bookmarks. The other is the manual installation in which you download or export the bookmarks from Chrome in a HTML file and then import them in the Firefox bookmark manager. Nothing happens. </p><p>Is there any other or better way I can import my Chrome bookmarks?
