Then this Google Search reCaptcha thing started. Changed it back to what it was, basically the default setting there, but it was still happening. It only happens in FF [doesn't happen with Edge] and only on one pc, all other pc's and phones in the house are fine [all using the same network, router etc].  So I uninstalled FF altogether, reinstalled it...this thing was still happening regardless of what settings I use re cookies etc. If I actually complete the super annoying reCaptcha it goes away for about 1 or 2 searches, then comes back. </p><p>If I'm signed in to a Google account it doesn't happen.  </p><p>I even did a fresh Windows install [which actually fixed this the other time this was happening about 6 months ago] but that didn't fix it this time. There is no malware, no VPN, no extensions that I haven't been using for years. Nothing that could ever possibly be considered 'bot-like' behaviour.  </p><p>Thanks </p>",firefox-128130;firefox-12813;windows-10;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",Haruna
