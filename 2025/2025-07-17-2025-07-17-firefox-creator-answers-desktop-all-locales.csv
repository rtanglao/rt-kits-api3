However I have noticed that some, probably four, of the files within the profile folder are not backing up and Winzip says it could not open them for reading. I believe that the profile is stored at  C:\Users\Phil\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\*.* and this path is included in the BACKUP.LST for Winzip. Omitting this line from the BACKUP.LST gives no errors so I am convinced it is a Firefox problem. I have also noticed that after a clean, hard boot one of my housekeeping programs, SuperAntispyware, thinks that a browser is open and wants to close it before running. I always backup immediately after a clean, hard boot so nothing should be open on the PC except the batch file and Winzip. I do not have Firefox in my list of Startup files. It seems to me that some of the Firefox profile files are somehow opened immediately after booting and I'm wondering if there is a setting that I've missed which will cause this.  In the general settings for Firefox, the option to ""Open Firefox automatically when your computer starts up"" is unchecked. Incidentally, I have also run the daily backup under WinRAR and get a similar error message. Any comments / suggestions will be gratefully received.
