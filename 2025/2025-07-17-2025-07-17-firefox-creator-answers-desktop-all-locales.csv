Both times, the application also has disappeared from my computer by uninstalling itself I suppose - as I cannot simply reopen the app to pick up where I left off. </p><p>So, I've reinstalled it both times but each time - it resets my search history and pre-saved PINS and TAB GROUPS up top. So I have to recreate that each time. It's fine to do it once or twice, but it seems like something is going on here where I will have this problem be a daily or regular occurrence.  </p><p>Any suggestions on how to troubleshoot this issue? </p>",firefox-14004;firefox-1400;windows-11;firefox;app-crash;,firefox,app-crash,en-US,"",cedric.fonville
