(this is beside the main point though). I'm so frustrated right now since all my bookmarks are gone (literally having a breakdown). I tried looking through the help articles and all of them just say to use the backup profiles or that there are bookmarkbackup files in my profile folders or that firefox would download a folder with files from the old version but none of that happened. I looked into my folders for older profiles trying to find places.sqlite files but NOTHING. there is literally NO backups or profiles dated to before July 16 2025; the day it updated (shown in screenshot) and there is NO bookmarkbackup files anywhere. i have signed in to firefox prior and had my devices synced for awhile and no issues so there should have been previous profiles and data saved onto my computer. Please help, I really need my bookmarks back! </p>",firefox-14004;firefox-1400;windows-10;firefox;recover-data;,firefox,recover-data,en-US,"",careyyhap
