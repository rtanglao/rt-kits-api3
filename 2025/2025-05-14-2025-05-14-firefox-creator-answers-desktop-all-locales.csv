This behavior suggests a persistent session issue not aligned with the user-side configuration. </p><p>I would appreciate guidance on how to resolve this. </p>",firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,"",profcamilotorres

All of my bookmarks have disappeared.  I tried to restore from a backup but when I hit restore in the manage bookmarks window it says ""choose file"" but it lists no files to choose from.  I found multiple backup files by accessing my Firefox profile via finder.  However when I try to open them with Firefox it displays a blank page and nothing in the bookmarks tab.  Is it possible that the bookmark files have also been deleted from the backups as well?  If not, how do I transfer these files to the active bookmark tab in the menu bar other than using the restore function which offers no files to choose from? </p>",firefox-13801;firefox-1380;firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",LACL
