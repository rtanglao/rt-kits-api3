I am wondering if this is not adding to my extremely slow recovery of frozen tabs and windows and MANY instances of ""Non-Responsive"" everyday. Firefox is set to allow multiple processes, naturally, but I'm looking for ways to ease the pain here. If I disable Multiple Processes in Firefox v138.0.1, will I have problems running, for example, 5 windows with a total of 30 tabs spread across those Windows? (God knows I don't wanna have to grow up and actually manage the things I open up for stuff.) In addition, I am running Canva, sometimes Paint 3D, and Office 2021 concurrently. An associated question........in this most recent Firefox, how do I run Multiple processes, but limit the number of them to 5, for example? There used to be a setting in Firefox to do that, but I can't find it. I'm working with Windows 11-v24H2 on a Dell Inspiron 17 with an Intel Core i7-8550U CPU (about 7 years old) and 16Gb of Ram.........and sometimes I fall asleep waiting for many tabs, windows, and instances of Office 2021 to come back to work (I'm thinking they signed a Union deal, and didn't tell me about it.). </p><p>This has been going on and getting progressively worse for about 3-4 months. </p><p>Advice? Suggestions? I'd be truly grateful for any ideas you got. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",scottcmandell

I found multiple backup files by accessing my Firefox profile via finder.  However when I try to open them with Firefox it displays a blank page and nothing in the bookmarks tab.  Is it possible that the bookmark files have also been deleted from the backups as well?  If not, how do I transfer these files to the active bookmark tab in the menu bar other than using the restore function which offers no files to choose from? </p>",firefox-13801;firefox-1380;firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",LACL
