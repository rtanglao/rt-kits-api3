And most of addons are gone, my opened tabs gone. 1password, react developer tool, Grammarly - stayed. The theme is from my personal profile. Addons Web developer, axe, JSONVue, PixelZoomer, PrinterLogic, VisBug, Tabliss (with lots of configuration in it!) - gone. In the history - items from my second profile. I'm not payed at my work to spend few hours each FF update to re-setup my addons (that I need for work - I'm a web developer) and their configs.
