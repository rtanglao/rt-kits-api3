1516762,2025-06-12 19:49:28 -0700,2025-06-12 19:49:28 -0700,Drag and drop Thunderbird to Firefox,"<p>Hello, using Windows Version 22H2 (Build 19045.5965), Firefox 139.0.4, Thunderbird 139.0.2, I can drag multiple emails from Thunderbird but not drop them into Firefox (the stop symbol appears and does not let me finish the action). However, dragging and dropping single emails does work. Firefox does not understand the imap address but the drop is registered which is all that is relevant to me. Is this a bug/missing feature in Firefox or a problem with Thunderbird and Firefox on Windows? Or is there a way to do it by simply adjusting (preferrably very few) settings? Dragging and dropping multiple emails using Thunderbird and Firefox on Linux Mint works fine. Dragging and dropping multiple emails from the Windows Explorer to Firefox also works fine. In testing, the issue only arose using Thunderbird + Firefox, Chromium-based browsers also worked fine with Thunderbird. If this is the wrong forum to ask such a question because this should rather be in a bug tracker or something similar, please let me know. If this should be on the Thunderbird thread instead of Firefox, also let me know. Thank you for your help. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",tizian.heckmann
