I have cleared my cache on firefox, which did not work. I have done an end task on Firefox on my laptop and restarted it, which did not work. I have restarted my laptop, which did not work. I power cycled my T-mobile router, which did not work. I even connected to the internet via hot-spot through my motorola phone, which also did not work. I can log into Mercari on any other way that I attempt, using the same account and password, EXCEPT for Firefox on my Lenovo. Firefox claims that it is up to date and will not find a newer update. Nothing was altered, to my knowledge, between putting my laptop to sleep last night and waking it up this morning. No updates, power interruptions, or anything that I am aware of. I am at my wit's end and am out of ideas for things to try to fix this. Please help. I do NOT want to have to run Chrome again, just to be able to log into a single page on my laptop. </p>",firefox-13401;firefox-1340;firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,en-US,1705293;,searchcoyote
