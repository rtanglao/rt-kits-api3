We are 100% sure that barcode scanner works properly - barcodes scanned into vi editor running in bash terminal windows works perfectly. Barcodes scanned into Google Chrome works perfectly too. It seems that the only application with this problem is Firefox. For example we can scan 1234567890 and get 124567890 or 123456890. Barcode scanner types characters extremely fast, probably this is a problem. The problem persists scanning into text fields in the Web pages and into the Firefox address bar too - so could not be a web-site problem. No addons installed. </p><p>How this problem could be fixed?

It acted as if I was not logged in to begin with and would not load the correct account information. When I logged out and then attempted to log back in, I was given an error that stated that the password or account was incorrect. I contacted Mercari Support for assistance, first, as I could not log into my account on an Edge browser, either. When I opened a Chrome browser, it auto-logged me in without issue.

Unfortunately, after that, I still could not get logged in, still getting the same wrong password or account message on my laptop. HOWEVER, when I opened firefox on my phone and attempted to log in there, it worked, using the same account and password information as I had attempted on my laptop. Additionally, I was able to log into my Mercari app on my phone, as well as BOTH Chrome and Edge on my laptop. It is only Firefox on my laptop which is not accepting the correct information. I have cleared my cache on firefox, which did not work. I have done an end task on Firefox on my laptop and restarted it, which did not work. I have restarted my laptop, which did not work. I power cycled my T-mobile router, which did not work. I even connected to the internet via hot-spot through my motorola phone, which also did not work. I can log into Mercari on any other way that I attempt, using the same account and password, EXCEPT for Firefox on my Lenovo. Firefox claims that it is up to date and will not find a newer update. Nothing was altered, to my knowledge, between putting my laptop to sleep last night and waking it up this morning. No updates, power interruptions, or anything that I am aware of.
