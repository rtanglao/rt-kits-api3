I've submitted over 10 crash reports. Here's the two latest crash report (which includes my device's hardware information):  <a href=""https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/81eb1750-1dd0-490d-9eb1-d3c2c0250224"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/81eb1750-1dd0-490d-9eb1-d3c2c0250224</a> <a href=""https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/6682a7f2-836a-4365-938e-c9ab20250224"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/6682a7f2-836a-4365-938e-c9ab20250224</a> </p><p>I'm on Fedora 41 + gnome, but this issue persisted even in Windows 11, which caused BSOD therefore I made the switch to linux (At least in linux it doesn't crash the whole system, only firefox). If you need any additional information let me know. I can run journalctl/dmesg if required. </p><p>I've already tried things like restarting in safe mode (troubleshoot mode), refreshing firefox etc. Didn't work. </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",firefox-13501;firefox-1350;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;linux;fedora;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1714323;1714336;1714343;,dennisheyuxi
