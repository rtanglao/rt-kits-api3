I made the mistake of using Ccleaner, which is probably the problem, I haven't had issues cleaning before, though I usually check the registry before deleting and don't recall seeing any entry for Mozilla (I may be wrong, though). </p><p>Firefox was working fine a couple of hours ago, but now it won't open at all, except in admin mode and then it won't open any links or tabs, not even settings. I've uninstalled FF, deleted the folder in the Programs folder, and reinstalled it from scratch, but there is no change (the one difference is that it wouldn't open in Admin after before I reinstalled it). Waterfox doesn't open either, but Thunderbird seems to work with no problems.  </p><p>Thanks, Matt </p>",windows-10;firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",matthewcardier

I had no idea it would be a multi hour nightmare to get it  back on, and it  still  isn't. Why? Well because the ""help link"" page no longer exits, ratherthe page that  the image that it shows no longer exists. You don't have the option to turn it back on, and why in the hell would I have  to go to firefox settings to turn it back on to begin with. </p><p>I literally just now figured it  out. Holy fuck.

If you need any additional information let me know. I can run journalctl/dmesg if required. </p><p>I've already tried things like restarting in safe mode (troubleshoot mode), refreshing firefox etc. Didn't work. </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",firefox-13501;firefox-1350;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;linux;fedora;needsinfo;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1714323;1714336;,dennisheyuxi
