I had no idea it would be a multi hour nightmare to get it  back on, and it  still  isn't. Why? Well because the ""help link"" page no longer exits, ratherthe page that  the image that it shows no longer exists. You don't have the option to turn it back on, and why in the hell would I have  to go to firefox settings to turn it back on to begin with. </p><p>I literally just now figured it  out. Holy fuck. For me anyway.  </p><p>Go into discord settings and click on the  voice &amp; video and hit ""let's check"". Click yes when it asks to allow permission. </p><p>I'm just so damn glad someone got  butthurt earlier and erased my post. You're fucking trash for  doing that. </p><p>Hopefully this is actually helpful to folks having problems. I'm not a butthurt little bitch like the folks that look over this site. I actually help. </p>",firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,1714330;,Charles3rddd

I've submitted over 10 crash reports. Here's the two latest crash report (which includes my device's hardware information):  <a href=""https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/81eb1750-1dd0-490d-9eb1-d3c2c0250224"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/81eb1750-1dd0-490d-9eb1-d3c2c0250224</a> <a href=""https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/6682a7f2-836a-4365-938e-c9ab20250224"" rel=""nofollow"">https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/6682a7f2-836a-4365-938e-c9ab20250224</a> </p><p>I'm on Fedora 41 + gnome, but this issue persisted even in Windows 11, which caused BSOD therefore I made the switch to linux (At least in linux it doesn't crash the whole system, only firefox). If you need any additional information let me know. I can run journalctl/dmesg if required. </p><p>I've already tried things like restarting in safe mode (troubleshoot mode), refreshing firefox etc. Didn't work. </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",firefox-13501;firefox-1350;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1714323;,dennisheyuxi
