I've uninstalled FF, deleted the folder in the Programs folder, and reinstalled it from scratch, but there is no change (the one difference is that it wouldn't open in Admin after before I reinstalled it). Waterfox doesn't open either, but Thunderbird seems to work with no problems.  </p><p>Thanks, Matt </p>",windows-10;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;seg-bug-performance-issue;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",matthewcardier
