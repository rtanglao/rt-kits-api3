I have preciously established and used the bookmark labeled as ""Woodworking"" which is no longer present, in fact the the last alphabetical listed bookmark is ""Ryobi"".  </p><p>I did have and was able to use the bookmark ""Woodworking"" in the past. Why is everything beyond ""Ryobi missing? </p><p>3 - Some times when I go to use bookmarks it does show provide me with the panel that would allow me to bookmark the current tab but it will not allow me to create a new folder where I want to place the current tab.. </p><p>4 -I have tried to go to an older version of Firefox but have been unable to locate where I can obtain it. Would going back to an older version resolve my issues and if so where can I get an older version? </p><p>I have been using Firefox for many years and never had issues and have been very happy with it.

Upgrades tend to lose functionality- add-ons, etc, that we're accustomed to and still work quite well with don't function anymore with browser upgrades, and there's no viable replacement available so we stick with what works and find other ways to compensate for any perceived vulnerabilities.  Now, like Microsoft, you're forcing consumers to do things they never wanted to and taking away the reasons for using this browser to begin with.  Given that we've been able to use older versions for years with no issues, there's no sugarcoating that this is all on you, Mozilla.

I need to create bookmark folders in Library (or some place that they are out of sight until I click), and then see folders in a drop down list where I can quickly find, for example, the Teaching, Media, etc. folders that I create.  I'd love to use the star icon to create a bookmark which shows up in the unsorted part of the same area, and that I can drag into a folder when I need to organize. </p><p>This used to work easily.  I recently installed windows 10 and Firefox after my drive died.  Bookmarks are stacking up and smeared across the toolbar.  That's distracting, and I'd  prefer them in a sidebar or drop down menu.   </p><p>This used to happen easily.   It used to be simplicity to create folders for bookmarks and sort them by name.  It was simple to find them (drop down from Library iirc.)   I could see unsorted bookmarks below that, and just drag them into folders to organize. </p><p>Now, I CAN'T find folders.  I can use More Tools -Customize to move ""Bookmark toolbar items"" to an overflow space or the library, and get at those spaces from the toolbar menu icon or from the library toolbar icon.  But I can't see any folders that I create, only the recent bookmarks.  I can manage bookmarks by clicking on Menu -Bookmarks -Manage.  I can see created folders and create new ones and even put bookmarks into those folders.  But what I can't do is find those folders anywhere else, like in Library or Menu drop down.  I've tried creating folders in Bookmarks Menu, Bookmarks Toolbar, and the Other Bookmarks Folder.  I see them in manage, but not anywhere else.  This is too much hassle to get to bookmarks, and they're a disorganized mess as I bookmark more things.  I've read several Firefox help articles and watched a few vids... and nothing is working. </p><p>Can you help?   Much appreciated, </p><p>-Greg </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1712545;1712566;,ghunterhanks

Most of the memory is in the windows paging file, on a mechanical hard drive. So freeing up used memory takes longer than it would on a machine with a metric tonne of quad-channel RAM. The past 6 months, Firefox has started having memory leak issues, where it just uses more &amp; more memory until the paging file hits its hard limit and windows kills firefox. </p><p>But since last update (135.0 x64), the memory leak issue has worsened significantly. </p><p>If I open firefox, and then tab between all current tabs, I get maybe 5 GB of memory usage. So even if all tabs are marked as ""active"" and loaded into memory, this still isn't enough to cause issues. </p><p>But after 30 minutes, that memory usage has ballooned up to &gt;20 GB, at which point windows decides that it needs to free up memory, and kills the process. Which is annoying, because then the browser reverts to the last saved state, meaning many tabs can be lost or reset to several clicks back. </p><p>I've tried shaving off extensions, with zero change. I've tried increasing paging file size, but that's just kicking the bucket down the road.  </p><p>Anyone have a solution to this? </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",ColaMagician
