Most of the memory is in the windows paging file, on a mechanical hard drive. So freeing up used memory takes longer than it would on a machine with a metric tonne of quad-channel RAM. The past 6 months, Firefox has started having memory leak issues, where it just uses more &amp; more memory until the paging file hits its hard limit and windows kills firefox. </p><p>But since last update (135.0 x64), the memory leak issue has worsened significantly. </p><p>If I open firefox, and then tab between all current tabs, I get maybe 5 GB of memory usage. So even if all tabs are marked as ""active"" and loaded into memory, this still isn't enough to cause issues. </p><p>But after 30 minutes, that memory usage has ballooned up to &gt;20 GB, at which point windows decides that it needs to free up memory, and kills the process. Which is annoying, because then the browser reverts to the last saved state, meaning many tabs can be lost or reset to several clicks back. </p><p>I've tried shaving off extensions, with zero change. I've tried increasing paging file size, but that's just kicking the bucket down the road.  </p><p>Anyone have a solution to this? </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",ColaMagician
