For the last week, I keep getting an error message that I may be having connectivity issues so I can't connect to my mail and keep getting a logout. In the past, over time, I have to clear my cookies or I can't log in but clearing my cookies(everything) hasn't been working for about a week. It's not a network issue or with my account.  I can access my ATT mail using a different browser- it's just not through Mozilla anymore.  I can log into my ATT account through Mozilla, it just won't connect me to my mail. </p><p>This is the error message I get:    </p><p>Something's gone wrong We may be having trouble with your connection.

I copied some text from a PDF document that is on my computer,  by highlighting the text and then hitting Ctrl+C.  The text copied onto my clipboard OK.  Then I opened a blank PDF document in the Firefox PDF Editor and tried to paste that text into the blank document,  but I wasn't able to do so because when I right-clicked on the blank document and then clicked on ""paste"",  nothing happened.  This apparently is because the word ""paste"" is faded-out in the drop-down menu (i.e.,  it does not appear in prominent bold print).  Google's Artificial Intelligence seems to indicate that the technique I used would work (see screenshot which I've uploaded).   But it didn't work, so can anyone please tell me how can I paste text into that blank document? </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",Larry951
