Some examples are on the website bluesky, and bold text on Twitter such as in usernames. </p><p>I originally thought it was an issue on my end or in Windows, but when checking other programs and websites such as dengekionline and the non-bold text on Twitter it is using the correct font which I have confirmed via the inspector under the font section. When starting Firefox in safe mode it seems to use the correct font on the previously mentioned websites, so I disabled all my extensions and themes and this did not resolve the issue. I did a Firefox Refresh and this also did not resolve the issue. </p><p>I am not familiar with the intricacies on the Firefox about:config to really delve into the exact cause, so I ended up just reverting back to Firefox 134. On Firefox 134 with my same extensions previously the font is now back to Meiryo as it should be which leads me to believe it is something that was changed in Firefox 135. One thing I am considering is that the Japanese text is being recognized as Simplified Chinese by Firefox 135 as Simplified Chinese uses the Microsoft YaHei font as a default. </p><p>I have attached some photos that shows my Japanese font settings, and the same post by a user one on Firefox 135 which is using Microsoft YaHei and another on Firefox 134 which is using the correct Meiryo. I have also tried disabling the ""Allow pages to choose their own fonts, instead of your selections above"" and then restarting on 135, but this did not resolve the issue.

I copied some text from a PDF document that is on my computer,  by highlighting the text and then hitting Ctrl+C.  The text copied onto my clipboard OK.  Then I opened a blank PDF document in the Firefox PDF Editor and tried to paste that text into the blank document,  but I wasn't able to do so because when I right-clicked on the blank document and then clicked on ""paste"",  nothing happened.  This apparently is because the word ""paste"" is faded-out in the drop-down menu (i.e.,  it does not appear in prominent bold print).  Google's Artificial Intelligence seems to indicate that the technique I used would work (see screenshot which I've uploaded).   But it didn't work, so can anyone please tell me how can I paste text into that blank document? </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,1709720;,Larry951
