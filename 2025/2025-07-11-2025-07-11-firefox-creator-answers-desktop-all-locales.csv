In Chrome, I was able to get surround sound playback through my major streaming services (e.g., YouTube, Netflix, Disney+, Spotify, etc.). As I recall, there wasn't anything specific I needed to do in Chrome to enable this. As long as I was listening through my 7.1 surround sound headset, it seemed to work. In Firefox, it seems that audio from all the listed streaming services plays in stereo mode. Is there a way I can get surround sound to work on this browser? I couldn't find any audio related settings or documentation about this issue. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",firefox-1400;windows-10;firefox;audio-and-video;,firefox,audio-and-video,en-US,"",simondaniel1099
