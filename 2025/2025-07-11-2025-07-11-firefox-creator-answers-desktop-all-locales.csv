Sometimes it freezes while editing images or during generation. I already tried updating Chrome, restarting my phone, and switching networks (Wi-Fi and mobile data), but the issue continues.

There are several tabs I want to keep open at all times, because I refer to them from time to time throughout the day, but Firefox closes them from time to time. I googled the issue and the AI directed me to two settings: browser.tabs.unloadOnLowMemory and browser.tabs.min_inactive_duration_before_unload. It suggested setting the first one to ""false"" and increasing the duration of the second, or setting it to ""false."" However, the setting will only accept numeric values. </p><p>Since I am not having low memory issues, I want Firefox to leave my tabs alone. Is there any way to actually do this? If not, it would be really nice if Firefox developers reversed this intrusive change. </p><p>Thank you, Terry </p>",firefox-14004;firefox-1400;windows-11;firefox;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",TLMorse
