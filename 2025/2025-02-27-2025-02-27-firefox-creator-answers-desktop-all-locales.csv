Now it just sits with a spinning wheel. I've found that if I change the setting within Firefox to open the pdf within Firefox the issue is fixed in Xero. But then all pdf's open in Firefox instead of the usual Adobe.   This breaks other workflows within my organisation as I need to email the pdf straight away when I download it, so my Windows was set with Adobe as the default for opening pdf's but now Firefox has taken that over. There does not appear to be any way to email the pdf from Firefox other than to save it and then find the file and email it from there which is very time consuming. I don't know what has changed in Firefox, but please can you fix it.  I see I'm not the only person with this issue. </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,1714778;,diane43
