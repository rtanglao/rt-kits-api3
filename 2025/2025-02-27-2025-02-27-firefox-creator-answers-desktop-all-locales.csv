I have Firefox installed on multiple devices. </p><p>On my iPad it no longer lets me stay logged in to websites. No matter what I do with privacy or cookie settings I constantly have to re login to every site I visit, even if I haven't closed the browser. I also cannot use paypal checkout for anything as clicking on the paypal button always opens a blank page instead of the page that would allow me to select my payment choice. </p><p>On my desktop sites I normally stay logged into rapidly have the data corrupted to I have to remove the cookies and re login, which defeats the purpose of staying logged in. By rapidly I mean immediately. I can only visit a site once before having to clear the cookies. On at least one site I visit I have not been able to log back in because I get a, ""The verification result of reCAPTCHA was incorrect. Please try again."" This is only on Firefox and only on my desktop. Nothing I have been able to do have fixed this. I just cannot use this site anymore with Firefox. </p><p>I have always been very happy with FIrefox and want it to continue to be my default browser, but the more I have to resort to other browsers for more and more sites the more I feel like I need to move on to something else. Is there a way to fix any of these problems? </p><p>Firefox is up to date on both devices. The desktop uses Windows 11 Home 64 bit. The iPad is up to date.
