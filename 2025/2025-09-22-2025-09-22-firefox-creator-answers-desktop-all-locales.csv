Whether you’ve misspelled your name, need to adjust it due to marriage, or are correcting a passenger detail for any other reason, American Airlines customer service is ready to assist you. To get started, dial +1-888-217-8731, and you will be connected to a live representative who can guide you through the name correction process. You’ll need to provide your booking reference number, your original name on the ticket, and the correct name. If the change is due to legal reasons (like marriage), you may need to provide supporting documents such as a marriage certificate. The agent will also verify your identification details to ensure accuracy. American Airlines typically allows small name corrections, such as fixing a misspelled name, without any additional cost. However, significant changes—such as adjusting your name after marriage or a legal name change—may involve extra charges, depending on your ticket type and the nature of the modification. When you contact +1-888-217-8731, the agent will inform you of any potential fees and help you decide the best way forward. Once the name correction is processed, you will receive an updated boarding pass with the correct name, ensuring a smooth check-in and boarding experience. It’s important to make these corrections well in advance of your travel date to allow American Airlines sufficient time to update your ticket and make the necessary changes to your reservation. By contacting +1-888-217-8731, you can rest assured that your name will be corrected promptly and accurately. Don’t wait—call now to ensure your American Airlines ticket is updated with the correct information. </p>",seg-spam;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",shifasharminakter
1537334,2025-09-22 10:56:41 -0700,2025-09-22 10:56:41 -0700,Proposta di implementazione della funzione “Sottotitoli in tempo reale” su Firefox / Proposal for implementing “Real-time Captions” feature in Firefox,"<p>Gentile Team Mozilla, vi scrivo per sottoporvi una proposta che ritengo molto importante per migliorare l’accessibilità e l’inclusione digitale: l’implementazione della funzione “sottotitoli in tempo reale” direttamente nel browser Firefox. Questa funzione, già presente in Google Chrome, permette di generare automaticamente sottotitoli per qualsiasi contenuto audio o video riprodotto nel browser, indipendentemente dalla piattaforma o dal servizio di origine. Sarebbe quindi estremamente utile per tutte le persone sorde o con difficoltà uditive, ma anche per chi vive in contesti dove l’audio non è sempre disponibile o utilizzabile. Introdurre i sottotitoli in tempo reale su Firefox rappresenterebbe un passo decisivo verso l’accessibilità universale, garantendo a milioni di utenti la possibilità di fruire dei contenuti online senza barriere. Una funzionalità simile non solo rafforzerebbe la missione di Mozilla per un web aperto e inclusivo, ma darebbe anche un segnale concreto di attenzione alle esigenze reali delle persone. Vi ringrazio per l’attenzione e spero che questa proposta possa essere presa in considerazione per i futuri sviluppi di Firefox. Cordiali saluti. </p><p><br> Dear Mozilla Team, I am writing to propose an important feature that would greatly improve accessibility and digital inclusion in Firefox: the implementation of real-time captions directly in the browser. This feature, already available in Google Chrome, automatically generates subtitles for any audio or video content played within the browser, regardless of the platform or service. It would therefore be extremely valuable not only for deaf or hard-of-hearing users, but also for anyone in situations where audio cannot be played or easily understood. Introducing real-time captions in Firefox would represent a major step toward universal accessibility, ensuring that millions of users can enjoy online content without barriers. Such a feature would not only strengthen Mozilla’s mission for an open and inclusive web, but also demonstrate a tangible commitment to meeting real user needs. Thank you for your attention, and I hope this proposal can be considered for future versions of Firefox. Sincerely. </p>",firefox-1430;windows-10;firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",gladiatorebuono1981

But after opening a menu (e.g. dropdown from the bookmarks bar, or downloads menu next to address bar) for the second or maybe more time, the menu will show up in the wrong location, maybe halfway across or down the screen. I am usually able to bring my mouse over to where it is shown and click the buttons, although sometimes the buttons show a hover animation when my mouse is where they are *supposed* to be and I must reopen the menu to be able to interact with the buttons where they are actually shown. Contracting the window fixes the problem, but it comes right back when I maximize the window. It will also happen with tooltips, such as the name of a tab when I hover over it. </p><p>I am using Fedora 42 GNOME Wayland with two monitors, one at 125% scaling and other at 100% scaling; the issue happens on both, but independently of each other. I have tried enabling the Firefox setting for fractional scaling, but nothing was fixed. Any way to make menus show up where they are supposed to? </p>",firefox-1430;linux;browser-appearance;needsinfo;,firefox,browser-appearance,en-US,1766249;,lego_iready
