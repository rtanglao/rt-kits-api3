It started using an excessive number of processes. Then I started getting very frequent hanging and ""Mozilla Firefox (not responding). It may freeze for several minutes, and often I have to shut down and restart my PC. It then takes much longer than usual to shut down, and after restarting, it takes several tries to get Firefox to open.  A couple days ago, I  updated Firefox to the new version for Windows 7 Vista, and it may have actually gotten worse. </p><p>It  took me about 25 minutes to type this short description of the problem because it froze several times. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",wkeithmilich
