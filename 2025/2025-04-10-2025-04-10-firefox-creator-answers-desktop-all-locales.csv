I have a new macbook as well as 2 vintage macbooks and my desktop runs OS 10.13.6. Performance after the last several updates is slow and occasionally websites not showing, which caused me to attempt to downgrade to FF 78.6, but tried clearing cache instead. I had way too many websites open. Clearing cache improved things slightly, but now this—Pocket: after resetting Firefox I'm confronted with the poor decision-making that has allowed your browser to be infiltrated by 'Pocket;' news for the somnambulist slumbering through the Trumpocolypse to grease our slide into full-blown fascism. Do I exaggerate? Yesterday Trump called on the justice dept to open an investigation into the Republican in his last administration who declared the 2020 election results valid-- So, by extension, we now live in a time when the king, er, I mean the Commander in Chief, uh, president, whatever, can use the government to target anyone he doesn't like for any reason. Newsworthy? Okay, amongst the twenty or so Pocket offerings is a ProPublica story and one from AP I'd find interesting, but I'd have bailed long before I saw them because of all the 'amazing' credit card offers and such BS in the way.

Now that is happening with the Firefox display, layout, and functionality which requires a search try to find a page where some kind soul has provided a fix for  FF via about:config  (if possible).   </p><p>My brower updated to 136.xx in mid-march after I had already disabled auto update. However, have not had problems until recently, so it seems to be something the microsoft system has started doing to compromise the configured functionality of Firefox.

Did Microsoft buy controlling interest in Firefox, or what.    </p><p>Today The layout has started being a problem too.  Very elementary without features, with huge words and images although I have changed nothing in Firefox.  It is as dumbed down and tedious as Windows 10 when it was brand new.

I found this description gives a reasonable definition of the issue -  ""Release management refers to the process of planning, designing, scheduling, testing, deploying, and controlling software releases. It ensures that release teams efficiently deliver the applications and upgrades required by the business while maintaining the integrity of the existing production environment."" [<a href=""http://opentext.com"" rel=""nofollow"">opentext.com</a>]  Some of the critical success factors of updates dealt with predictability (frequency and advance scheduling of updates), planning, minimizing disruption to users and maintaining stability of the system. Even emergency fixes, had to assess the impacts and proceed accordingly.  Good communication is always mandatory. It also has to be a cost-effective process that is acceptable to both IT and the users.  If you do the research, you'll see that updates should be scheduled with a set frequency (i.e. monthly, weekly and possibly daily for certain types of changes but NOT ALL) and they are done at a set time of day (when usage is at its lowest to minimize disruption). To illustrate this, there should be a place that I can go to and see the key facts of your release management plan. It might say something like “updates are done weekly on Sundays at 3am ET. Here are the items that are scheduled to be implemented for the next year. I would be able to see every Sunday for the next year listed and under each date, would be a list of the changes that are to be implemented on that release date. Each item would be described clearly in business terms.   It would also show me the history of what has been released in the past, and it should flag anything that was released on a day other than the expected date (ie Sundays at 3am).”  Deviating from the set time introduces instability into the system and causes untold grief on users and is not cost-effective.   If you are good at following best practises like these, you will find your costs decrease, your system is stabler, your users are happier, there is minimal, if any, disruption to users and more.  It will be a benefit to all.  I find that I am constantly being impacted by Firefox updates, very often at critical times when I cannot afford the time to deal with the disruption. It has been very disruptive and expensive for me.  I find I never know when you will strike or what it is you are planning to implement.  Just recently, I had to take time away from an important task to apply your update as my machine had become unstable because of your pending update. It was only a few hrs later, that I got notified there was another update ready to download and install. I elected not to download at that time yet you kept telling me there was a download. Once again, my machine became unstable and slowly ground to a halt and then crashed. I lost a ton of work.  It's a huge setback. I always have issues as soon as you first put out that notification that an update is available. It shouldn't be impacting me and nothing on my machine should change until I choose to download and install the update.  But that is not what happens. I've been burned far too many times. I cringe every time that notification appears as I know it means it won't end well. The timing and increased frequency of your updates is having a significant impact on my productivity. They seem to happen at any time of the day and on way too many days each week. They are corrupting my machine even when I elect to defer the download of the update.  You need to be batching changes and installing them no less than once a week and at a time of traditionally low activity.    I should know what your schedule is so I can plan accordingly.  Based on my experience, I can only conclude that you have extremely poor release management procedures and perhaps no procedures. The communication is nonexistent until after the fact. It's far too little and far too late. My preference is to use Firefox, but I'm now at a point that I cannot continue to sustain the hits from what appears to be a release system that is not controlled and has no respect for the impacts on its users.   Are you open to a discussion on how you can improve releases and would you be willing to work with users to define the requirements and implement changes that will provide a better user experience plus achieve many more benefits? I'm willing to share my knowledge and experience to help improve the situation if you are willing to dedicate some resources to improve this area of concern. I'm quite confident that we will all win if improvements and best practises are implemented. I expect it will have minimal IT costs and has potential for large gains in the user community.  Please advise. </p>",firefox;installation-and-updates;,firefox,installation-and-updates,en-US,"",acrae
