(It seems it's an old feature, but I've only ever noticed it not long ago.) The thing is, a few updates ago, the speaker stopped replacing the favicon and appears to the side of it. I preferred it when it replaced the favicon, so I've been looking for a way to bring it back. </p><p>With some help from ChatGPT, I was able to get close to what it was, by using the userChrome.css, but not quite. I asked it to create a code to hide the favicon, hoping that would do it, and this is what it came up with: </p><p>/* HIDE TAB FAVICON WHEN PLAYING SOUND AND SHIFT SPEAKER ICON LEFT */ .tabbrowser-tab:not([pinned], [sharing], [crashed]):is([activemedia-blocked], [soundplaying], [muted]) .tab-icon-image { 	display: none&nbsp;!important; } </p><p>It hides the favicon, but the speaker doesn't align with the favicon and the tab title is also slightly offset to the right. There's a space or margin somewhere.

Only a new profile will get me the enhancements. I'd rather not have to create a new profile and add all my changes and add-ons all over again. It's a real PITA. Is there any 'trick' I can try to get the new enhancements? </p>,firefox-13804;firefox-1380;firefox;search-tag-and-share;,firefox,search-tag-and-share,en-US,1736452;,streetwolf

A blank page loads that says ""Hmm we're having trouble finding  that site"". But the tab says ""Server not found"". Again it's only some pages that won't load.  </p><p>It does not matter if I click the bookmark, or type in the address,it's always the same pages every time. I tried 19 sites, (10 bookmarks, and 9 typed), plus typing in some of the bookmarks also.  </p><p>If I change over to Chrome, or any other browser those pages will load. If I use Firefox Mobile, those pages load. Something has gotten messed up in my PC settings, or something.  </p><p>I have tried clearing the cache, the history, and the cookies, no luck. I restarted into safe mode, and had the same problem.  </p><p>It's been forever since I had any problems with FIrefox, and must admit I have forgotten most of the troubleshooting tips, that I used to know. But I did remember those, unfortunately none  of those are the problem.  </p><p>What else can I try? Thanks in advance.  </p><p>BTW: I am submitting this on my phone because this is one site that won't load.
