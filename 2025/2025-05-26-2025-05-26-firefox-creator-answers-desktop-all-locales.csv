Only a new profile will get me the enhancements. I'd rather not have to create a new profile and add all my changes and add-ons all over again. It's a real PITA. Is there any 'trick' I can try to get the new enhancements? </p>,firefox-13804;firefox-1380;firefox;search-tag-and-share;,firefox,search-tag-and-share,en-US,"",streetwolf

A blank page loads that says ""Hmm we're having trouble finding  that site"". But the tab says ""Server not found"". Again it's only some pages that won't load.  </p><p>It does not matter if I click the bookmark, or type in the address,it's always the same pages every time. I tried 19 sites, (10 bookmarks, and 9 typed), plus typing in some of the bookmarks also.  </p><p>If I change over to Chrome, or any other browser those pages will load. If I use Firefox Mobile, those pages load. Something has gotten messed up in my PC settings, or something.  </p><p>I have tried clearing the cache, the history, and the cookies, no luck. I restarted into safe mode, and had the same problem.  </p><p>It's been forever since I had any problems with FIrefox, and must admit I have forgotten most of the troubleshooting tips, that I used to know. But I did remember those, unfortunately none  of those are the problem.  </p><p>What else can I try? Thanks in advance.  </p><p>BTW: I am submitting this on my phone because this is one site that won't load. If it did I would, I would click the ""Share Data"" button. </p>",firefox-13804;firefox-1380;firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1736373;,rkm731r
