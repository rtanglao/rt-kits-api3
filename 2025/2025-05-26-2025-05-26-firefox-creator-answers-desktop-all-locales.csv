(It seems it's an old feature, but I've only ever noticed it not long ago.) The thing is, a few updates ago, the speaker stopped replacing the favicon and appears to the side of it. I preferred it when it replaced the favicon, so I've been looking for a way to bring it back. </p><p>With some help from ChatGPT, I was able to get close to what it was, by using the userChrome.css, but not quite. I asked it to create a code to hide the favicon, hoping that would do it, and this is what it came up with: </p><p>/* HIDE TAB FAVICON WHEN PLAYING SOUND AND SHIFT SPEAKER ICON LEFT */ .tabbrowser-tab:not([pinned], [sharing], [crashed]):is([activemedia-blocked], [soundplaying], [muted]) .tab-icon-image { 	display: none&nbsp;!important; } </p><p>It hides the favicon, but the speaker doesn't align with the favicon and the tab title is also slightly offset to the right. There's a space or margin somewhere. I tried removing margins (with the help of my technician), to no avail. </p><p>Is there any way of getting that previous behavior back? </p><p>Thank you. </p>",firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",RuiMC

I finally figured out that there was this toggle that kept Firefox from saving passwords unless I was logged into Firefox. Since I'd already logged into Firefox three times that day (when my Dell gets bogged down, it developes an odd habit of delaying response to my scrolling, and then taking it as a click on the ""close"" button), I unchecked the box. Tonight, I was looking for something else in my settings, and noticed the ""Require device sign in to fill and manage passwords"" was checked. I unchecked it, went back to looking for why Firefox wanted me to sign in when I was just trying to sing into an unrelated site, came back to ""Privacy and Security"" and ""Require device sign in to fill and manage passwords"" was checked again. No matter how many times I uncheck the box, if I click away and come back a few minutes later, it's checked again. Why? I've got to jump through SO many hoops EVERY time I open the browser to use the ""save passwords"" feature, I may as well not even have the feature and just use my spreadsheet for everything I can't remember. </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",wendygoerl
