Can anyone help? I'm using a MacBook Pro from 2010 (when they knew how to make things that lasted) with firefox version 115.22.0esr on macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 (which is apparently the last version I can use as computing has vastly outraced my laptops capacity and we are expected to update everything to catch up with security glitches etc so tough sh*t if everything goes wrong.

I do not directly translate the website from English to Uzbek but I want to learn some words while I am browsing by just selecting it and the quick translation. Google Chrome has an extension (Google translate extension) which can do this even more efficiently. But this extension in Firefox doesn't do it. I want one thing: please add Uzbek language so that I will be able to just click the words and see the quick definition. Or at least, if you cannot add Uzbek, please add a feature that enables me to click the word and the short English definition (let's say like Cambridge Dictionary or AI).

It's the bookmarks on the homepage I have the rows of bookmarks where I just double click and go to my website that I want. Well, when I got my laptop, I downloaded Firefox and I synced everything to my laptop and it worked great including all my bookmarks in the rows. but now it just won't sync the bookmarks I have in the ROWS i have on the home page I would hate to delete the browser and then reinstall just have all my bookmarks in the rows that I want. I waited a whole day and a half to see if it would sync and it would not. Why is this the only part not syncing all my other bookmarks sync up including my passwords I also checked the settings in Firefox and everything I want has the box check marked. Also, I don't know how to reply back to anybody who helps me. The examples of the picture these are the types of bookmarks I'm talking about if I change it on my desktop, it will not change on my laptop. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",dolfan
