It's the bookmarks on the homepage I have the rows of bookmarks where I just double click and go to my website that I want. Well, when I got my laptop, I downloaded Firefox and I synced everything to my laptop and it worked great including all my bookmarks in the rows. but now it just won't sync the bookmarks I have in the ROWS i have on the home page I would hate to delete the browser and then reinstall just have all my bookmarks in the rows that I want. I waited a whole day and a half to see if it would sync and it would not. Why is this the only part not syncing all my other bookmarks sync up including my passwords I also checked the settings in Firefox and everything I want has the box check marked. Also, I don't know how to reply back to anybody who helps me. The examples of the picture these are the types of bookmarks I'm talking about if I change it on my desktop, it will not change on my laptop. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",dolfan
