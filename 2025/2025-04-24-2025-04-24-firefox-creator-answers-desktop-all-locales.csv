I am connected through a VPN/Web3 setup that correctly places my location in Canada by a direct-routing for special sites domen address. Other browsers, such as Yandex Browser, reflect this correctly. However, Firefox seems to ignore this and reports my location as being in Russia. </p><p>I tested this side-by-side using the same website (Gemini), and the result was consistently different across browsers — Firefox being the only one that misrepresents my location. </p><p>This is concerning, especially from a privacy standpoint. It seems Firefox is using a different method to determine geolocation. </p><p>Could you please clarify how Firefox determines geolocation, and whether it’s possible to change or disable this behavior? I believe users should have full control over what location data is shared and ensure that the browser respects the actual network setup in use. </p><p>Importantly, blocking geolocation access for the site in Firefox’s settings does not solve the issue — the site still receives the incorrect (Russian) location, likely based on IP or some internal Firefox service. This suggests Firefox is using an alternative method to determine and transmit location data, possibly ignoring the active VPN setup or relying on cached/default IP-based data </p><p>Thank you. </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",C-Clod

I'm writing to request a feature enhancement for Mozilla Firefox that would greatly improve the user experience, especially on lower-end or older hardware. </p><p>Currently, whenever I open Firefox after closing it, it takes about 2–3 seconds to launch. In comparison, Microsoft Edge opens almost instantly due to features like Startup Boost and background mode, which allow it to keep essential processes running even when the main window is closed. </p><p>I would love to see similar functionality in Firefox — such as: </p><p>An optional ""Startup Boost"" feature to keep Firefox running in the background for faster launching. </p><p>A tray icon mode that allows Firefox to stay running in the system tray instead of closing completely. </p><p>A setting to allow background updates or session prep on startup/login. </p><p>These additions would make Firefox even more competitive in terms of performance and convenience. </p><p>Thank you for your continuous efforts in maintaining a privacy-respecting and open-source browser. I truly appreciate your work. </p><p>Best regards, RIYYAN AMIR </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",riyyanamir125
