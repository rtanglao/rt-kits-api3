When on any tab within a tab group I cmd+tab to another application as normal, but when I cmd+tab back to Firefox, it takes me to a tab <em>not</em> in a tab group that was last open which, in my case, is an old tab that was last used a week ago. Moreover, it hides my tab groups altogether. This means that when I switch back from another application I cmd-tab to Firefox, click the top-right down arrow,  select a tab group under <em>Recent Tab Groups</em> to get me back to my true last opened tab. </p><p>Cmd-tab is probably my most-used shortcut so this convoluted process of getting back to my <em>true</em> last tab is getting really frustrating. I have tried ticking ""cmd+tab cycles through tab groups"" in Settings but that's not what I am after. I've searched the forum and while I have come across similar posts, I haven't found a solution. </p><p>Any pointers gratefully received, thanks. </p>",firefox;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",jamie25
