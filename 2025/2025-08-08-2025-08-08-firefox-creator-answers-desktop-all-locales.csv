When on any tab within a tab group I cmd+tab to another application as normal, but when I cmd+tab back to Firefox, it takes me to a tab <em>not</em> in a tab group that was last open which, in my case, is an old tab that was last used a week ago. Moreover, it hides my tab groups altogether. This means that when I switch back from another application I cmd-tab to Firefox, click the top-right down arrow,  select a tab group under <em>Recent Tab Groups</em> to get me back to my true last opened tab. </p><p>Cmd-tab is probably my most-used shortcut so this convoluted process of getting back to my <em>true</em> last tab is getting really frustrating. I have tried ticking ""cmd+tab cycles through tab groups"" in Settings but that's not what I am after.

For context, I have Website Appearance and Themes set to Automatic so it'll respect my system settings, and my desktop is in dark mode at all times. If I change these settings to light it will render the page properly as expected, testing in Troubleshooting Mode doesn't change the behavior so it's not an extension thing, and Chrome (and other multiple other browsers) renders everything just fine. I've also tried playing with layout.css.prefers-color-scheme.content-override just in case (currently set to 2), but to no avail. I've also tried playing around with the contrast settings without any luck, either.  </p><p>I've attached two screenshots of the LinkedIn login page from both Firefox and Chrome to show what I'm seeing. This just started happening maybe a month or so ago, and the only custom thing I've done to the Firefox theme is have it use Mica so it feels more native to Windows. I haven't ruled this out yet, but it doesn't feel like it should be related since this has nothing to do with light/dark system settings.  </p><p>Appreciate any help&nbsp;:) </p>",firefox-14103;firefox-1410;windows-11;firefox;browser-appearance;,firefox,browser-appearance,en-US,"",bropel
