For context, I have Website Appearance and Themes set to Automatic so it'll respect my system settings, and my desktop is in dark mode at all times. If I change these settings to light it will render the page properly as expected, testing in Troubleshooting Mode doesn't change the behavior so it's not an extension thing, and Chrome (and other multiple other browsers) renders everything just fine. I've also tried playing with layout.css.prefers-color-scheme.content-override just in case (currently set to 2), but to no avail. I've also tried playing around with the contrast settings without any luck, either.  </p><p>I've attached two screenshots of the LinkedIn login page from both Firefox and Chrome to show what I'm seeing. This just started happening maybe a month or so ago, and the only custom thing I've done to the Firefox theme is have it use Mica so it feels more native to Windows. I haven't ruled this out yet, but it doesn't feel like it should be related since this has nothing to do with light/dark system settings.  </p><p>Appreciate any help&nbsp;:) </p>",firefox-14103;firefox-1410;windows-11;firefox;browser-appearance;,firefox,browser-appearance,en-US,"",bropel
