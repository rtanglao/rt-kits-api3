I have enough rows I want more columns and less space between them. </p><p>Find attached the current state of my new tab page, with my particular shortcuts redacted, and the number of additional shortcuts I could fit on the page without adjusting the gabs between them or resorting to a scroll bar. I'm missing out on at least 44 short cuts due to the default constraints, which I've been unable to find working overrides for. Depending on how cut-throat I get with my thin-margins, I could potentially be missing out on up to 80. </p><p>I tried following the near identical instructions from both this <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/1288920/how-to-modify-the-new-tab-page-in-firefox-with-stylish"" rel=""nofollow"">stack exchange</a> and this <a href=""https://www.tutorialpedia.org/blog/how-to-change-new-tab-background-firefox-css/"" rel=""nofollow"">tutorialpedia article</a>, to try and get at the problem by modifying my about page's CSS; but I was unable to change part of the page's appearance. Not even the background or text color. </p><p>Is the information in these out-dated (the stack-exchange is 7 years old) or otherwise inaccurate; or is there perhaps a setting in firefox which is interferring with these tutorials' solution method. </p><p>I have already tried resetting firefox with extensions disabled to check if any of my extensions are causing the problem to no discernable affect. </p>",firefox-14501;firefox-1450;windows-11;firefox;browser-appearance;,firefox,browser-appearance,en-US,1781560;1781565;,repooc.a

They also work in Chrome. </p><p>So what could be causing this issue on Firefox, which started about August time? </p><p>This is quite bizarre as I assumed all the processing/translation was done by Google/Youtube so in what way can Firefox be part of this issue? </p><p>To be clear, subtitles in the (foreign) language the people are speaking, works.
