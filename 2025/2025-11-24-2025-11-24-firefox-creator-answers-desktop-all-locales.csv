Cannot get it to work.  Concerned about the next fix "" create a new data base"" will be too complicated and I will get it wrong; and really mess up my new laptop.

There's a thread on the Youtube support site with nearly 40,000 posts of people with the same issue and tonight I was trying to watch a video where the hosts talk in Italian, so I use auto translate to English subtitles but no subtitles appear.  It will show Italian language subtitles. </p><p>I've gone back through this Youtube channel's history trying videos I've previously watched from months/years ago when auto translate used to work but even they're not working now. </p><p>I decided to try the video in Edge browser and to my surprise the auto translate to English worked there.  They also work in Chrome. </p><p>So what could be causing this issue on Firefox, which started about August time? </p><p>This is quite bizarre as I assumed all the processing/translation was done by Google/Youtube so in what way can Firefox be part of this issue? </p><p>To be clear, subtitles in the (foreign) language the people are speaking, works. Subtitles translated from that language to English (or other languages) has stopped working. Subtitles translated from that language to English IS working on Edge and Chrome browser. </p>",firefox-14501;firefox-1450;windows-11;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,1781530;,Jota64

How do I turn this off, as I have never, not once, found this useful. Instead, I've always found it to be more of a nuisance, as Alt + Tab is how to switch between software on Windows 11, and I switch between software often. Please tell me how to turn this feature off. </p>",firefox-14501;firefox-1450;windows-11;firefox;customization;,firefox,customization,en-US,"",drluigi4
