I have enough rows I want more columns and less space between them. </p><p>Find attached the current state of my new tab page, with my particular shortcuts redacted, and the number of additional shortcuts I could fit on the page without adjusting the gabs between them or resorting to a scroll bar. I'm missing out on at least 44 short cuts due to the default constraints, which I've been unable to find working overrides for. Depending on how cut-throat I get with my thin-margins, I could potentially be missing out on up to 80. </p><p>I tried following the near identical instructions from both this <a href=""https://superuser.com/questions/1288920/how-to-modify-the-new-tab-page-in-firefox-with-stylish"" rel=""nofollow"">stack exchange</a> and this <a href=""https://www.tutorialpedia.org/blog/how-to-change-new-tab-background-firefox-css/"" rel=""nofollow"">tutorialpedia article</a>, to try and get at the problem by modifying my about page's CSS; but I was unable to change part of the page's appearance. Not even the background or text color. </p><p>Is the information in these out-dated (the stack-exchange is 7 years old) or otherwise inaccurate; or is there perhaps a setting in firefox which is interferring with these tutorials' solution method. </p><p>I have already tried resetting firefox with extensions disabled to check if any of my extensions are causing the problem to no discernable affect. </p>",firefox-14501;firefox-1450;windows-11;firefox;browser-appearance;,firefox,browser-appearance,en-US,"",repooc.a

There's a thread on the Youtube support site with nearly 40,000 posts of people with the same issue and tonight I was trying to watch a video where the hosts talk in Italian, so I use auto translate to English subtitles but no subtitles appear.  It will show Italian language subtitles. </p><p>I've gone back through this Youtube channel's history trying videos I've previously watched from months/years ago when auto translate used to work but even they're not working now. </p><p>I decided to try the video in Edge browser and to my surprise the auto translate to English worked there.  They also work in Chrome. </p><p>So what could be causing this issue on Firefox, which started about August time? </p><p>This is quite bizarre as I assumed all the processing/translation was done by Google/Youtube so in what way can Firefox be part of this issue? </p><p>To be clear, subtitles in the (foreign) language the people are speaking, works. Subtitles translated from that language to English (or other languages) has stopped working. Subtitles translated from that language to English IS working on Edge and Chrome browser. </p>",firefox-14501;firefox-1450;windows-11;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,1781530;,Jota64
