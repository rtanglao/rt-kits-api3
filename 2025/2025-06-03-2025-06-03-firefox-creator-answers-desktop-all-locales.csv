When I restart Firefox or my computer it will work for a very short time, but goes back to crashing.   I have removed extensions.  Restarted PC.

destroy and everything i have built in the last few ueaes they have taken large amounts of konwy and done numerous other acts using google, facebook, instagram, threads, email and icloud apps that have been altered to share data and allow them to edit call logs, conversations, transactions, bills, and other highly sensative documents. they have been planning to do harm to my truck, me and my family.  they have already began by taking things from my truck while in the shower, they also have placed items inside the cab. changed settings on my eld, gps and trucks computer system that will cause more damage ans cause me to spend more money. they were sucking dick and hand jobs at walmart while i was right behind them. and now she asked for my card info so she could do further damage. she has been fooling around with zach for over 2 years now and he has been stealing and draining me every since. he is going to prison if i lose one more account. i have 2 backups that they dont know about. today i am done being nice. i will notify the us marshals office with all of the evidence of my phone account, bank account, social media accounts, email accounts, and all of the lost funds, and lost photo, and lost email accounts i will press charges for each account and the attempted murder, the poisioning, and fake bills i have paid.  the numerous money transfers, and the lies ive been told by the 5 of them. the editing of my phone contacts and phones configuration settings as well as my dad, mom and other family members that have been attacked during this time. the amistad truck, the stolen things from storage and the fuckery from the yukon ram and usaa. i will not lose this time. i have given them too much of me while they were too busy stealing and plotting against me. the new jersey situation was all part of a sceme to disarm me. they were successful but im not a dummy so my turn now. i have given them too many chances to be as real to me as ive been to them but i dont mean shit to either of them. my mother is sick because of them, my dad has been poisioned. zach gave them keys to his house. and my dad knows about it and who it is. this is all about to blow up backwards on them. all they had to do was be real with me and tell me i wasnt loved or wanted. instead he has fucked around on me with the chick in the white van with the dude that has long hair, and the couple in jasper, the couple in birmingham, and the chick he gave 200 to at the hardrock casino in tulsa.  he has been using my facebook account and gmail so if i get locked out its because they are selfish and they want me to have nothing.  i know he is linked to my phone, my apps, and my data are being shared. he ordered an sim card which allows all of this to happen. he also has a login for my att app, google, portal, samsung, nest, icloud, roku, amazon and banking apps as well as family companion apps that allow him to hover all of my typed content, attachments and music files. he is soly responsible for all of the fraud, theft, sickness, death and all other incidents that are about to take place and the the accounts that have been edited. he thinks i dont know about the shower at pilot  and the neighbor next door he paid for the hotel for. using my bank account. he fails to realize i have told a lot of my family whats going on. everything he attempts to destroy will be the things i use first in court. the things done to my truck will also be things i press charges for including the removal of the fuses and the added internet box with the voice recorder and sensor behind the dash. the other tv's he thinks i dont know about as well as the stolen shit out my storage,  and the damage he done to my moms car and her house. every message they sent on amazon app has been recorded as well as reddit and telegram. the snookie app and snapchat are all platforms that have been downloaded and are now being watched as they continue to add sdk and apk alterations to my devices and accounts.  he took my income taxes and he has also taken a loan out in my name. my sister is aware of all of the details so as soon as he puts more ghb in my drink AGAIN i will get them for assault and attempted murder. as they have done it 2 or 3 times before. zach has 3 kids that he wont tell me about and he may have one on the way. he will definatly see adultry charges on top of all the conspiracy charges and associated charges with my phone email social mediab, bank, and auto, insurance fraud, and not to mention his grandmothers ssn money and my dads money he tampered with. all of this is about to do a reverse reverse on all parties involved. proof is locked away in texas in safe hands. last warning.... log off my shit now or ill call the marshalls right now. dont call my bluff cause i will do it. i have enough evidece to send a community to elsavador.  i have the proof , time stamps and the photos to go along with each day they done me wrong. if im missing one
