It's not hidden between other open browsers or appearing on the taskbar. It's just gone. When I go back to the main webpage site and open up this pop-out page again, it will reappear. But the moment I click on this pop-out page it disappears. An example is attached with a DoorDash progress order. It seems that it only happens with ""secondary"" pop-out pages.
