I can type whole sentences and nothing happens until 10s later the whole sentence starts appearing as if I had just typed it. The hamburger menu and about dialog where not impacted from this delay. </p><p>The CPU and memory load shows no signs of being a bottleneck and nothing performance hungry is happening in the rest of the system.  </p><p>This happened around 2min after startup, after 5h of work, or anywhere in-between. </p><p>Workaround is a browser restart, but it is quite annoying if this occurs while I'm filling in a form and I have to start over. </p><p>Ubuntu 24.04 - snap package Once the issue occurred, I disabled all extensions (without restart), but the issue continued. </p>",firefox-14201;firefox-1420;linux;firefox;app-responsiveness;,firefox,app-responsiveness,en-US,"",felix.scholl

For example, Firefox's Chinese Simplified Language Support page.On the Simplified Chinese page (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/zh-CN/questions/new/firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/zh-CN/questions/new/firefox</a>), clicking the ""Continue"" option in the ""Ask a Question"" section redirects to <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/zh-CN/kb/%E8%8E%B7%E5%BE%97%E7%A4%BE%E5%8C%BA%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81?exit_aaq=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/zh-CN/kb/%E8%8E%B7%E5%BE%97%E7%A4%BE%E5%8C%BA%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81?exit_aaq=1</a>. Then, clicking ""GET HELP"" redirects back to <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/zh-CN/questions/new/firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/zh-CN/questions/new/firefox</a>. Under normal circumstances, it should redirect to the Question submission page. This feature works correctly on the English-language Mozilla Support page (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/new/firefox/form"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/new/firefox/form</a>). I attempted to change the language identifier in the English page URL from ""en-US"" to ""zh-CN,"" which resulted in a prompt stating: ""The question forum cannot be used for Firefox in Chinese (Simplified). We have redirected you to the English question forum."" And I found that none of the ask a question in Support can be used in simplified Chinese language. I tried to ask Mozilla Support, but I didn't get valid information. </p>",firefox;site-breakages;,firefox,site-breakages,en-US,"",zhengyang3552
