Take some number of mixed tabs 2. Sort them into relevant tab groups 3. Read/use webpages after organizing </p><p>So at step 2 it's a small interruption when each tab added to a group changes the browser focus. </p><p>As far as I can tell there isn't a way to do this in the settings or the config page but I wanted to double check </p><p>Thanks! </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",joepeguero

Unbelievably poor performance loading pages, which was working super fast before. Never had such an issue, running on 4 different, high performance PCs  and having same symptoms, where I have to wait for Facebooks posts to load for minute or so. Youtube stops playing in the middle of the video. In meantime if I try same pages on other browsers everything works fast AF. I'm on 1000Mbps connection at office and 500Mbps home. Noticed massive increase in RAM usage, which used to be around 3GB, it is now using 6+. What has happened&nbsp;? </p>",firefox;app-responsiveness;,firefox,app-responsiveness,en-US,"",eb55
