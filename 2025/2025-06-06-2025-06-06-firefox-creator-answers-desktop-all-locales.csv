Take some number of mixed tabs 2. Sort them into relevant tab groups 3. Read/use webpages after organizing </p><p>So at step 2 it's a small interruption when each tab added to a group changes the browser focus. </p><p>As far as I can tell there isn't a way to do this in the settings or the config page but I wanted to double check </p><p>Thanks! </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",joepeguero

Unbelievably poor performance loading pages, which was working super fast before.

Youtube stops playing in the middle of the video. In meantime if I try same pages on other browsers everything works fast AF. I'm on 1000Mbps connection at office and 500Mbps home.
