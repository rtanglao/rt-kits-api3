However, recently I’ve encountered persistent issues where several websites—especially work-related ones—have stopped functioning properly. I’ve tried troubleshooting steps like clearing the cache, allowing cookies, and disabling tracking protections, but the problems persist. </p><p>Reluctantly, I switched to Google Chrome as it currently offers better stability, but it’s been hard to abandon Firefox after so many years. I truly value Mozilla’s mission and privacy-focused approach, and I’d love to return if these issues are addressed. </p><p>Could you please look into these compatibility problems? I’d appreciate any guidance or updates on fixes. Thank you for your hard work—I hope to support Firefox again soon. </p><p>Best regards, Gustavo </p>",firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",info2042

E o pior de tudo é que acontece com MUITA frequencia, a cada 5/10 minutos... O que me força a ficar recarregando a pagina (F5) a todo instante para eu poder ver as mensagens que nao recebi. Fui instruída pela twitch para ver a aba de Consoles (F12) mas nao me deram respostas. Entao vou enviar o que acontece para vocês.
