I would get error messages about not being able to connect to reCAPTCHA. Switch to Edge, no problem. This would change from day to day. Sometimes it all works, other times it doesn't, still. Then I started to notice that Google searches in Firefox would sometimes take a long time and eventually fail. Try it a few minutes later sometimes, no problem, instant results. Erratic. Never know when it's going to work and when it's not. Switch to Bing, good to go, always. Google Maps sometimes loads right away, other times it is very slow and may never completely load. Finally, I've noticed that some non-Google sites sometimes load slowly or stall out altogether, commonly with a ""Waiting for <a href=""http://www.googletagmanager.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.googletagmanager.com</a>"" message at the bottom left. I haven't encountered any of these issues in Edge, though granted I seldom use it unless I'm having trouble with Firefox. </p><p>This weekend, I did a full computer rebuild, which involved a clean install of Firefox. I was hoping that something in Firefox had got corrupted in my old computer and that the rebuild would take care of it. But, no. Same as before. If this were a problem on Google's end, I'd expect a big howl. As it stands, I think it probably must be Firefox that's at fault. </p><p>Anyhow, before I try to submit a bug report, has anyone else experienced this? Better yet, does anyone know a cure? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",michael739

Ive read many of the support articles but can't find anyway to revert back to the far more useful version (the one that worked before).  This is causing  many other problems on trying to load Windows 11 on the two and then try to load Firefox. </p><p>I saw a notice on this 3rd laptop )that hasn't been downgraded to the latest version) this is the beta version.  Frankly. when I found the problem originally I thought I had a virus or Trojan on my system.  I need the bookmarks easily accessed since I use them constantly to visit the sites most important to my work. </p><p>If this is Beta then you have one very irate user that it simply changed most of Firefox's settings without notice or recourse.  So my question is simply this: is there a way to reload FF on these two new units with the vastly superior previous versions?  PLEASE give users the original settings so that they can choose which they need. </p>,firefox-13401;firefox-1340;firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",haiweepp1
