Hi, I’d like to ask for help. The problem is that I couldn’t remember my password and I didn’t change it, but I didn’t know that by changing it, I would lose everything. I had important emails and passwords that I didn’t have saved anywhere else. Please, help me recover this information. </p>",firefox;passwords-and-sign-in;,firefox,passwords-and-sign-in,es,"",samlexander75

Ive read many of the support articles but can't find anyway to revert back to the far more useful version (the one that worked before).  This is causing  many other problems on trying to load Windows 11 on the two and then try to load Firefox. </p><p>I saw a notice on this 3rd laptop )that hasn't been downgraded to the latest version) this is the beta version.  Frankly. when I found the problem originally I thought I had a virus or Trojan on my system.  I need the bookmarks easily accessed since I use them constantly to visit the sites most important to my work. </p><p>If this is Beta then you have one very irate user that it simply changed most of Firefox's settings without notice or recourse.  So my question is simply this: is there a way to reload FF on these two new units with the vastly superior previous versions?  PLEASE give users the original settings so that they can choose which they need. </p>,firefox-13401;firefox-1340;firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",haiweepp1
