For about 1 year everything OK. Last summer it started taking 30 seconds (exactly: 32"") to start up each time. If I keep it open, every additional window will open at light speed (a usual). If I turn it off, each next opening takes 32"". If i click on a URL link, after some seconds a blank screen opens (and occupies all the screen, covering all other open applications) and remains blank till 32"", then it works. I use few plugins/extensions: Bitdefender, Google anti-Analytics and (recently) ""To Google Translate"" For some reason also the Firefox Beta translator appears. Translations are still ridiculous... but there is no way to deactivate it. I have read community articles but found no clue. I tried  - a Firefox tune-up  - clearing the startup cache - restarting in troubleshooting mode no success. I cancelled all my passwords and bookmarks and the few plugins I used. Uninstalled it, downloaded a new installer from Mozilla Webpage, re-installed it, NOT allowing it to retrieve and incorporate old settings, preferences etc. (but - god knows how- it managed to go around looking for preferences/bookmarks and incorporated them). The 32"" delay still stands firm. Lastly: I noted that Mozilla Firefox folder stays in ""C:\Program Files"" But Mozilla Maintenance Service folder stays, instead, in ""C:\Program Files (x86)"" Also I noted that in Task Manager the Firefox app appears with a progressive number on its right. A the moment ""Firefox (15)"" I will attach a small screenshot of the Task Manager and hope the info appearing in the ""Help/Other Troubleshooting information"" page is shared </p>",firefox-13401;firefox-1340;firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,it,1704061;1704113;,tibaldi56

Last night i closed my computer lid (ie, sleep, not shut down) and this morning, when I opened it all my tabs were gone and there is nothing available under my history menu to restore closed tabs or windows.  I do have tabs from my other synced computer - but not from this. I also tried logging out and logging in - with no result. </p><p>Is this is a dead duck or is there a chance to still restore my tens of tabs i had open? </p><p>Thanks </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",snooper

The same problem occurs in Rumble voideos so it has to do with Mozilla-Firefox browser &amp; not the video sites.  This behavior where the user has no control on ""WHEN A VIDEO SHOULD POP-UP"" on a separate window only has happened under the latest Firefox version. I don't have any Extension Add-on that may produce this behavior. It seems that the Settings only turn off completely pop-up videos  If this is not solved I will definitely switch browsers. The user no longer has full control when a video should pop-up in a separate window. This should be a feature fully controlled by the user and not automatically by the browser. It is EXTREMELY ANNOYING. I've tried different settings suggested by other firefox users using the About:Config settings but none have worked. This is a major bug or a depracation of functionality. Please advice. </p><p>Thank You EM </p>",firefox;performance-and-connectivity;,firefox,performance-and-connectivity,en-US,"",elohimministries

Specifically this happens with PDF files downloaded from the (not all that amusing) PDFs from the FINCEN, (US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network).  I do not see why and how Firefox thinks it is allowed to change files that are simply downloaded and saved on Firefox.   </p><p>In other words, it seems that Firefox strips away certain ""permissions"" and/or ""functions"" (like built-in lookup, menu or choice boxes).    This means that the file so downloaded via Firefox can no longer be used to properly fill in data, or to look up and choose data items within the file.    (I see many times that ANYTHING having to do with ""permissions"" tends to be an intractable and unsolvable problem for software makers &amp; experts, so, if you do not know right away how to solve the problem, it will probably take you several years to figure this out.)     </p><p>The PDF in question is created by a government agency.  If you have ever dealt with a government agency, then you know that they act sort of like Adobe or Microsoft: ""They don't respond, or they do respond &amp; say they do not understand, and if they understand, they are either unwilling or unable to fix the problem.""    </p><p>If there is a switch or option within Firefox, which lets me tell Firefox ""Save this file exactly like it is received, nothing added or removed!"", that would be nice.  I just have not found such an option yet, and it would be nice if it might get provided someday.   </p><p>I will share my browser data, but I am sort of convinced that a detailed question like mine will not be addressed within that shared data. </p>",firefox-1340;firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,1703931;,voodooquantum

I would get error messages about not being able to connect to reCAPTCHA. Switch to Edge, no problem. This would change from day to day. Sometimes it all works, other times it doesn't, still. Then I started to notice that Google searches in Firefox would sometimes take a long time and eventually fail. Try it a few minutes later sometimes, no problem, instant results. Erratic. Never know when it's going to work and when it's not. Switch to Bing, good to go, always. Google Maps sometimes loads right away, other times it is very slow and may never completely load. Finally, I've noticed that some non-Google sites sometimes load slowly or stall out altogether, commonly with a ""Waiting for <a href=""http://www.googletagmanager.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.googletagmanager.com</a>"" message at the bottom left. I haven't encountered any of these issues in Edge, though granted I seldom use it unless I'm having trouble with Firefox. </p><p>This weekend, I did a full computer rebuild, which involved a clean install of Firefox. I was hoping that something in Firefox had got corrupted in my old computer and that the rebuild would take care of it. But, no. Same as before. If this were a problem on Google's end, I'd expect a big howl. As it stands, I think it probably must be Firefox that's at fault. </p><p>Anyhow, before I try to submit a bug report, has anyone else experienced this? Better yet, does anyone know a cure? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",michael739
