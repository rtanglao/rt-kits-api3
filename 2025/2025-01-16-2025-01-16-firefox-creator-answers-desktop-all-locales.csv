Specifically this happens with PDF files downloaded from the (not all that amusing) PDFs from the FINCEN, (US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network).  I do not see why and how Firefox thinks it is allowed to change files that are simply downloaded and saved on Firefox.   </p><p>In other words, it seems that Firefox strips away certain ""permissions"" and/or ""functions"" (like built-in lookup, menu or choice boxes).    This means that the file so downloaded via Firefox can no longer be used to properly fill in data, or to look up and choose data items within the file.    (I see many times that ANYTHING having to do with ""permissions"" tends to be an intractable and unsolvable problem for software makers &amp; experts, so, if you do not know right away how to solve the problem, it will probably take you several years to figure this out.)     </p><p>The PDF in question is created by a government agency.  If you have ever dealt with a government agency, then you know that they act sort of like Adobe or Microsoft: ""They don't respond, or they do respond &amp; say they do not understand, and if they understand, they are either unwilling or unable to fix the problem.""    </p><p>If there is a switch or option within Firefox, which lets me tell Firefox ""Save this file exactly like it is received, nothing added or removed!"", that would be nice.  I just have not found such an option yet, and it would be nice if it might get provided someday.   </p><p>I will share my browser data, but I am sort of convinced that a detailed question like mine will not be addressed within that shared data. </p>",firefox-1340;firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",voodooquantum

I would get error messages about not being able to connect to reCAPTCHA. Switch to Edge, no problem. This would change from day to day. Sometimes it all works, other times it doesn't, still. Then I started to notice that Google searches in Firefox would sometimes take a long time and eventually fail. Try it a few minutes later sometimes, no problem, instant results. Erratic. Never know when it's going to work and when it's not. Switch to Bing, good to go, always. Google Maps sometimes loads right away, other times it is very slow and may never completely load. Finally, I've noticed that some non-Google sites sometimes load slowly or stall out altogether, commonly with a ""Waiting for <a href=""http://www.googletagmanager.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.googletagmanager.com</a>"" message at the bottom left. I haven't encountered any of these issues in Edge, though granted I seldom use it unless I'm having trouble with Firefox. </p><p>This weekend, I did a full computer rebuild, which involved a clean install of Firefox. I was hoping that something in Firefox had got corrupted in my old computer and that the rebuild would take care of it. But, no. Same as before. If this were a problem on Google's end, I'd expect a big howl. As it stands, I think it probably must be Firefox that's at fault. </p><p>Anyhow, before I try to submit a bug report, has anyone else experienced this? Better yet, does anyone know a cure? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",michael739

This is causing  many other problems on trying to load Windows 11 on the two and then try to load Firefox. </p><p>I saw a notice on this 3rd laptop )that hasn't been downgraded to the latest version) this is the beta version.  Frankly. when I found the problem originally I thought I had a virus or Trojan on my system.  I need the bookmarks easily accessed since I use them constantly to visit the sites most important to my work. </p><p>If this is Beta then you have one very irate user that it simply changed most of Firefox's settings without notice or recourse.  So my question is simply this: is there a way to reload FF on these two new units with the vastly superior previous versions?  PLEASE give users the original settings so that they can choose which they need. </p>,firefox-13401;firefox-1340;firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",haiweepp1
