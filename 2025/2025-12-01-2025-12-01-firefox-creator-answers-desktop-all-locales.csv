I've never  &gt; configure this behavior, or found a setting to fix it. </p><p>This is a privacy problem, because most of the time when I open a website like <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a>, I don't want to be logged in so the website can identify me. I only keep a container tab for such a website around, so I can open it if I explicitly want to be logged in. </p>",firefox-1400;linux;firefox;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1783094;,kolAflash
