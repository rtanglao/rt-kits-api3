When I downloaded the XPI file, it contained only a `manifest.json` and **did not include the background image files** referenced in the manifest. This caused Firefox to reject the theme as “corrupt” when trying to install or import it. </p><p>What I discovered during debugging: </p><p>1. Firefox Color provides both a **ZIP** and an **XPI** download. </p><pre>  The ZIP contains the correct folder structure and the background image files.   The XPI is missing these files entirely. </pre> <p>2. Because the XPI is missing required assets, Firefox treats the file as corrupt. </p><p>3. Importing the broken XPI through the Add-ons Manager or uploading it to AMO also triggers corruption or validation errors. </p><p>4. I had to manually inspect the ZIP, extract the proper `images/` directory, and rebuild the XPI myself. </p><p>5. I ended up using ChatGPT to troubleshoot the issue, confirm expected manifest structure, correct extension ID mismatches, and verify JSON formatting. </p><p>The issue appears to be that Firefox Color’s **XPI exporter is broken or incomplete**, producing theme packages that cannot be installed or validated without manual repair. </p><p>It would be helpful if Firefox Color’s XPI export included all necessary files consistently and matched the structure found in the ZIP download. </p>",firefox-14502;firefox-1450;firefox;themes;,firefox,themes,en-US,"",EchoesRealmArrow
