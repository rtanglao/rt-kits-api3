Io avevo firefox con numerose credenziali gia memorizzate. Successivamente ho deciso per sicurezza di creare una password principale, da quanto avevo capito se questa non viene digitata all'inizio della sessione di firefox tutte le altre credenziali sono protette e non si può accedere ai siti che le richiedono (a meno che uno non faccia una nuova login per ogni sito).  Invece ciò che ho notato è che anche se non digito la password principale (e faccio annulla invece di immetterla) posso comunque loggarmi ai vari siti che hanno le credenziali salvate in firefox. Non capisco, non dovrebbe essere impossibile loggarsi a quei siti senza aver immesso all'inizio la password principale? ho fatto qualcosa di sbagliato? </p><p>Grazie </p>",windows-10;firefox;primary-password;,firefox,primary-password,it,1757551;,giulio.guardati

Browsing history being one of them. I swear the browser history UI is stuck in 2003. The way it sorts your browsing history and displays them doesn't make any $!@#ing sense. Chrome's history view is 1000x better and it follows common sense. Chromes will show you the day and time you visited a site in chronological order and it will preserve that. Firefox shows it in a half assed way, it won't tell you the time you visited the site and in some views it will just move that site around in your history when you click on it which is so annoying. </p><p>Firefox by default needs to have a nofrills history tab that opens up instead of a sidebar, in that history tab it should display your chronological order of sites you've just visited with the time and date. That should be preserved. </p><p>Anyone else feel this pain? </p><p>Is there an open Mozilla feedback item about overhauling the history UI?
