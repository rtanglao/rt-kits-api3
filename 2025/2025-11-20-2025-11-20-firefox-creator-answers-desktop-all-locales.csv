Firefox seems to be interpreting me opening the program as pressing the alt key, because even when I have the menu bar set to always be open, the input immediately goes to the ""File"" dropdown option of the menu, just as it would if I pressed the alt key. However, I tried to troubleshoot this by 1. opening a program that tracks keyboard inputs and that didn't show such a thing happening, and 2. I checked if this issue was happening with other applications that have switch the input to the upper menu bar when the alt key is pressed, and that was not the case.  This is making it a lot harder to use Firefox, as using a keyboard shortcut to open a new window (ctrl+shift+p, or ctrl+i) while in a normal Firefox tab, it will not automatically open to the new window (as it is set to do automatically), it will also not let me open the new window -- either by alt-tabbing or by clicking the new window on the windows taskbar -- and instead reopens the alt menu and sets the input to that menu, locking me to the original Firefox page unless I tab into a completely different application and then into the new window.  This issue also makes me unable to input key commands or text into my active tab immediately when I reopen it, instead forcing me to close the alt menu first either or clicking somewhere on the page. And since I don't keep the alt menu visible at all times, this forces the screen to shift up and down jarringly when I'm simply trying to use the computer.  </p><p>I'm using Firefox on a Windows 11 computer. I've tried refreshing Firefox and have tried my absolute best to find articles related to this issue but to no luck.
