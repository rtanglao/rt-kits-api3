Since I am testing different distros from time to time, so I will reinstall FF often. Since I've an user a/c on FF, so that I can simply logon to restore my settings and that worked fine except few things. </p><p>1. I can not keep my theme settings and menu settings, such as using a dark theme and always show menu and bookmarks, I need to set the above every time I reinstall FF even with an a/c. </p><p>2. I got the error ""Failed to read the configuration file. Please contact your system administrator"" when I run FF on Raspberry Pi with Armbian desktop, despite of the error FF started normally. When I check the "".mozilla"" folder, I found multiple profiles beside the default one I used, when I delete the extra ones and edit the ""profile.ini"" to remove them, I still found those profiles on the folder. Since I've some extensions installed as well as some screen settings, so I don't want to restart as new to re-do everything, is that any way to clean up my profiles while keeping my settings&nbsp;? </p><p>3. I set couple websites to auto load when FF starts, I pin them to the tab to save some screen space, but I got double entries every time, the pinned ones and the one I set auto load on start, it seems no way to only auto start as pinned. </p><p>Thanks&nbsp;! </p>",firefox-128130;firefox-12813;linux;firefox;profiles;,firefox,profiles,en-US,"",bilmenot

I can barely surf the internet anymore because I don't understand what half of the permissions questions are asking me.  I also find that the word choices of those working in IT aren't the best at communicating clearly.  Past examples:  items will ""populate"". I thought populating was about people and populations. Don't lists and other things get compiled? Bad choice #2, I am frequently  asked to click on ""OK"" as I interact with desktop O/S or websites in the midst of situations giving me grief.  I would gladly click on ""Acknowledge""  but these are situations that are most definitely not OK.   </p><p>I currently have Firefox installed on my Windows 10 desktop PC and a screen appeared suggesting I download Firefox. But why has this appeared?  Do the processes going on in the background not understand I'm already using Firefox? From trying to follow directions where I am told what to expect I'll see on a screen and the steps for navigating that to accomplish something, but then not actually seeing what I was lead to believe I would, to my query here and now,  less and less of things make sense any more, and it's really wearing me down.  Thanks in advance to anyone paying attention. </p>",firefox-1410;windows-10;firefox;install;,firefox,install,en-US,"",thatguythere

I don't mind selecting my cookie preferences when I log on to a site....ONCE. But I am getting the cookie question with each page I go to on the site. I've called my bank and they tell me they are getting the same complaint from other customers and it's because I'm using Firefox. They are not seeing this problem with other supported browsers and of course their solution is to switch to Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome, which is NOT a solution and which I will never do,  </p><p>Is anyone else here having this problem? If so, is their a solution? </p><p>Thank you </p>",firefox-1410;windows-10;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",jdemarco1

Ever since I switched to Firefox I noticed that while the videos play just fine, if I scroll down to the comments or to search for another video on the sidebar Firefox suddenly becomes extremely laggy and takes a good few minutes to actually load anything. Is there any way to fix this? (My Firefox is up to date and the only extensions I'm running are uBlock and Tampermonkey, but there aren't any scripts running through it specifically for YouTube) </p>",firefox-1410;windows-10;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",Shadowblitz0001
