Clicking the link in the email opens a pricing page where the Starter plan shows €1.43/mo (Screenshot 2). If I open new tabs or windows in the same session, the lower prices stay. If I close the browser completely, reopen, and visit the pricing page directly, the prices go up to €1.99/mo for the same plan (Screenshot 3). I believed €1.43/mo was the original base price and that an extra $15 discount would be applied at checkout. However, when I completed the purchase, I was charged €1.43/mo + VAT — but no additional $15 discount was applied </p><p>What I discovered after some testing: The link from the email directly loads a “discounted view” of their pricing page, but there is no indication that the prices shown already include the $15 discount. After opening this link once, every new tab or window in the same browser shows the reduced price, even if I try searching for Surfshark normally. The only way to see the “real” original pricing is to completely close the browser (all windows) or clear cookies/local storage, then visit their site without using the email link. </p><p>Is this a known browser session/caching issue, or could this be a deliberate site design (e.g., tracking parameters &amp; persistent cookies)?

Since I am testing different distros from time to time, so I will reinstall FF often. Since I've an user a/c on FF, so that I can simply logon to restore my settings and that worked fine except few things. </p><p>1. I can not keep my theme settings and menu settings, such as using a dark theme and always show menu and bookmarks, I need to set the above every time I reinstall FF even with an a/c. </p><p>2. I got the error ""Failed to read the configuration file. Please contact your system administrator"" when I run FF on Raspberry Pi with Armbian desktop, despite of the error FF started normally. When I check the "".mozilla"" folder, I found multiple profiles beside the default one I used, when I delete the extra ones and edit the ""profile.ini"" to remove them, I still found those profiles on the folder. Since I've some extensions installed as well as some screen settings, so I don't want to restart as new to re-do everything, is that any way to clean up my profiles while keeping my settings&nbsp;? </p><p>3. I set couple websites to auto load when FF starts, I pin them to the tab to save some screen space, but I got double entries every time, the pinned ones and the one I set auto load on start, it seems no way to only auto start as pinned. </p><p>Thanks&nbsp;! </p>",firefox-128130;firefox-12813;linux;firefox;profiles;,firefox,profiles,en-US,"",bilmenot

I can barely surf the internet anymore because I don't understand what half of the permissions questions are asking me.  I also find that the word choices of those working in IT aren't the best at communicating clearly.  Past examples:  items will ""populate"". I thought populating was about people and populations. Don't lists and other things get compiled? Bad choice #2, I am frequently  asked to click on ""OK"" as I interact with desktop O/S or websites in the midst of situations giving me grief.  I would gladly click on ""Acknowledge""  but these are situations that are most definitely not OK.   </p><p>I currently have Firefox installed on my Windows 10 desktop PC and a screen appeared suggesting I download Firefox. But why has this appeared?  Do the processes going on in the background not understand I'm already using Firefox? From trying to follow directions where I am told what to expect I'll see on a screen and the steps for navigating that to accomplish something, but then not actually seeing what I was lead to believe I would, to my query here and now,  less and less of things make sense any more, and it's really wearing me down.
