I log in to Windows 11 and my Firefox is already open. About a week ago that stopped happening. Nothing has changed on my system except maybe some automatic Windows updates. I still have the box checked in Firefox settings to open automatically on startup. It still no longer does that. I've tried to uncheck the box, restart Windows, recheck the box, restart Windows, but that isn't the fix. I saved my profile in Moz Backup, uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox, and that didn't work. Is it possible that a Firefox update might be responsible for this? If not, is there anything else I can try? It's not a big deal to have to click on an icon to start Firefox. I just got used to the convenience of automatic startup. Thanks. </p>",firefox-1410;windows-11;firefox;customization;,firefox,customization,en-US,"",sosa1

Since I am testing different distros from time to time, so I will reinstall FF often. Since I've an user a/c on FF, so that I can simply logon to restore my settings and that worked fine except few things. </p><p>1. I can not keep my theme settings and menu settings, such as using a dark theme and always show menu and bookmarks, I need to set the above every time I reinstall FF even with an a/c. </p><p>2. I got the error ""Failed to read the configuration file. Please contact your system administrator"" when I run FF on Raspberry Pi with Armbian desktop, despite of the error FF started normally. When I check the "".mozilla"" folder, I found multiple profiles beside the default one I used, when I delete the extra ones and edit the ""profile.ini"" to remove them, I still found those profiles on the folder. Since I've some extensions installed as well as some screen settings, so I don't want to restart as new to re-do everything, is that any way to clean up my profiles while keeping my settings&nbsp;? </p><p>3. I set couple websites to auto load when FF starts, I pin them to the tab to save some screen space, but I got double entries every time, the pinned ones and the one I set auto load on start, it seems no way to only auto start as pinned. </p><p>Thanks&nbsp;! </p>",firefox-128130;firefox-12813;linux;firefox;profiles;,firefox,profiles,en-US,"",bilmenot

I can barely surf the internet anymore because I don't understand what half of the permissions questions are asking me.  I also find that the word choices of those working in IT aren't the best at communicating clearly.  Past examples:  items will ""populate"". I thought populating was about people and populations. Don't lists and other things get compiled? Bad choice #2, I am frequently  asked to click on ""OK"" as I interact with desktop O/S or websites in the midst of situations giving me grief.  I would gladly click on ""Acknowledge""  but these are situations that are most definitely not OK.   </p><p>I currently have Firefox installed on my Windows 10 desktop PC and a screen appeared suggesting I download Firefox. But why has this appeared?  Do the processes going on in the background not understand I'm already using Firefox? From trying to follow directions where I am told what to expect I'll see on a screen and the steps for navigating that to accomplish something, but then not actually seeing what I was lead to believe I would, to my query here and now,  less and less of things make sense any more, and it's really wearing me down.
