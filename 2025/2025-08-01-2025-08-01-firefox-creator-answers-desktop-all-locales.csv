Clicking the link in the email opens a pricing page where the Starter plan shows €1.43/mo (Screenshot 2). If I open new tabs or windows in the same session, the lower prices stay. If I close the browser completely, reopen, and visit the pricing page directly, the prices go up to €1.99/mo for the same plan (Screenshot 3). I believed €1.43/mo was the original base price and that an extra $15 discount would be applied at checkout. However, when I completed the purchase, I was charged €1.43/mo + VAT — but no additional $15 discount was applied </p><p>What I discovered after some testing: The link from the email directly loads a “discounted view” of their pricing page, but there is no indication that the prices shown already include the $15 discount. After opening this link once, every new tab or window in the same browser shows the reduced price, even if I try searching for Surfshark normally. The only way to see the “real” original pricing is to completely close the browser (all windows) or clear cookies/local storage, then visit their site without using the email link. </p><p>Is this a known browser session/caching issue, or could this be a deliberate site design (e.g., tracking parameters &amp; persistent cookies)?

When I check the "".mozilla"" folder, I found multiple profiles beside the default one I used, when I delete the extra ones and edit the ""profile.ini"" to remove them, I still found those profiles on the folder. Since I've some extensions installed as well as some screen settings, so I don't want to restart as new to re-do everything, is that any way to clean up my profiles while keeping my settings&nbsp;? </p><p>3.
