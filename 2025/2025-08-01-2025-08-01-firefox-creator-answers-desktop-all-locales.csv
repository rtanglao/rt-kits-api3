Is there something Firefox is doing differently with caching, image rendering, or JavaScript handling that gives this performance boost? </p><p>Also, are there any official resources or optimization guides from Mozilla that we can follow to keep sites like ours fully compatible and high-performing on Firefox? </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",windows-10;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",merijaneshoes
