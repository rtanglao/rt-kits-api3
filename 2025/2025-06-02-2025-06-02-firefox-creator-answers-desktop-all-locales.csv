Such as cruise dates, ships, departure, destinations, etc. The cruise company says its working on there end. I have used Firefox always to book a cruise and has always worked just fine. For some reason its not this time. I have cleared out my browsing data and cookies and sites. That did nothing at all. I refreshed Firefox. I then uninstalled Firefox and reinstalled. That did not work. I also opened in new private window and that did nothing either. So i tried and used Chrome it worked just fine. I also tried and used Edge and it also worked just fine. I would rather stay with Firefox. So any help would be appreciated. I did let cruise company know and there IT dept is looking into it. Thanks again. </p>",firefox;accessibility;,firefox,accessibility,en-US,"",raftman111

I was trying to search for something grocery related, so at first I tried to type my search directly into the address bar - it wouldn't finish loading a page. So I tried going to Google's search engine instead and same thing, it wouldn't actually finish loading. I tried the same thing in chrome and it was fine. Tried clearing Firefox's cache but didn't seem to make a difference. </p><p>Only now when I'm typing up the support question did it finally load the Google search engine, but still won't load the actual search after typing it in.
