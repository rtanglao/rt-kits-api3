So, on any pages like WebGL Aquarium, i have pretty low fps, in comparison to other browsers (like Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome).

I was like, what? Where it did come from? This explains why I have a fps two times lower but who will explain to me why this gpu is here? I tried to change all acceleration settings in browser, but when i just disabled any acceleration, still shows GTX 980 what is more weird than if it just shows like nothing or Intel GPU, cause is disabled but still uses hardware acceleration, but no matters if i let Firefox use recommended performance settings or set to use acceleration when is available, it shows GTX 980. I think it's about a bug, or something? I can't say that's Windows problems, drivers, or any other thing, cause, other browsers don't act like this, and i just don't have GTX 980 in my laptop on side with RTX 3060 and Intel GPU, anyone even know that laptop like this exists?
