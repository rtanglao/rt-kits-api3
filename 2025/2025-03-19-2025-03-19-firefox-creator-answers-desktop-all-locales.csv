When I disable MetaMask, the search results load properly, but when it's enabled, they do not appear. This problem does not occur in other browsers like Brave. </p><p>I have tried: </p><pre>   Disabling and re-enabling MetaMask.    Adjusting Firefox's privacy settings.    Running Firefox in Safe Mode (which fixes the issue but disables all extensions). </pre> <p>Is there a known compatibility issue between MetaMask and DuckDuckGo on Firefox? Any suggestions on how to fix this without having to disable MetaMask? </p><p>Thanks in advance for any help! </p>",firefox;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1719409;,clementeacosta

The browser uses built-in tools like **Enhanced Tracking Protection** and **Safe Browsing** to block malicious sites. Sometimes, websites may be blocked due to incorrect settings or conflicts with extensions or security software. Users can check if a <a href=""https://p999game.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">website</a> is being blocked by Firefox in the address bar or through the **Privacy &amp; Security** settings. If a trusted site is blocked, users can add exceptions or disable certain security features, though this can expose them to risks. </p>",seg-spam;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",saddamha9450
