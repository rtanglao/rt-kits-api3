As a result, the text appears as a single long line when pasted into native Windows applications — which breaks the expected formatting. This behavior mainly affects: </p> <ul><li>     Text editable fields (e.g., contenteditable or textarea) in modern web applications. </li><li>     Code blocks or snippets (such as in Markdown or monospace) copied using ""Copy"" buttons (e.g., in ChatGPT or GitHub). </li></ul> <p>At first, I noticed this only when copying code from ChatGPT using the code-snippet copy button. But now it happens in almost all editable text areas — if I enter text with line breaks manually, and then copy it, those breaks do not appear properly in native Windows apps. For example: </p> <ul><li>     In Google Sheets, I often edit text with line breaks in a cell, but when I copy it back, it's all flattened into one line. </li></ul> <p>Right now, I have to fix this using scripts that replace \n with \r\n, but that's a very inconvenient workaround. </p><p>❗My main question is: <strong>What changed in Firefox that caused this behavior?</strong> This used to be reliable and feels like a regression. It’s a very basic feature and critically important for my daily workflow! </p><p>🔧 Follow-up questions: </p> <ol><li>     Can this be fixed in a future Firefox update? Will it be addressed? </li><li>     Is there a way to fix or configure this behavior right now via browser(settings, configs)? </li><li>     Is there an extension or workaround that can restore the \r\n format without manual scripting? </li></ol> <p>Affected apps: </p> <ul><li>     ChatGPT </li><li>     Google Spreadsheets </li><li>     Trello </li><li>     ProtonMail (regular text copying) </li><li>     (more) </li></ul> <p>Thanks in advance for any clarification or suggestions! </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,1727007;,b0gd4n_tal1b.kubyn3ts

If the Firefox windows is on the laptop display I never get crashes but on the secondary display I get around 1-2/hour. Also, this only happens with hardware acceleration enabled in Firefox settings, if I deactivate it then the issue is gone. I think it runs on the AMD integrated graphics, based on what I see in task manager. I also have uBlock origin, haven't tried deactivating it yet.

This is great but the tabs and sidebar stay visible when engaging the f11 full screen mode. This makes an awkward appearance when trying to view in full screen - such as movies or any other. The address bar at the top is hidden with f11, but the side tabs and their vertical side bar remain visible.  I believe Firefox would be more desirable if the f11 key also hid the side bar. This is how Microsoft's Edge browser functions.  Can't have a true full screen if the sidebar and tabs remain visible. The full screen functions works well if the sidebar function is turned off in settings but this makes it awkward for a user who wishes to use the sidebar tabs with a full screen mode.  Thank you for considering this issue and thank you for your great products. Tom </p>",firefox;browse;,firefox,browse,en-US,"",daddyogo21
