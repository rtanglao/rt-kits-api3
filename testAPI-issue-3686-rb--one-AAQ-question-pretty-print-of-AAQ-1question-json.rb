  "content" => "<p>Morning,\n</p><p>I've recently switched back to Firefox (for Mac) after being away from Ff for a long time, and have been tinkering with my settings and whatnot to try and get things the way I would like them. I suspect, like most things, that I'm just missing something.&nbsp;;-)\n</p><p>Basically, I don't want Ff to remember any autofill//form information, and I've got that working, but I would like it to be able to respect when a website allows you to click a radio button for \"Remember &lt;Me//This//Etc&gt;\". It does not seem to be doing that at the moment.\n</p><p>Does Ff have a setting that will let websites that you specifically click \"Remember Me\" be remembered, or is it an all or nothing?\n</p><p>Thanks!\n</p>",
