Today finally I decided to upgrade to the latest version of Firefox for my iMac, 147.0.1. Before the upgrade I successfully used with zero issues <a href=""http://gemini.google.com/app"" rel=""nofollow"">gemini.google.com/app</a>  .  Now the website comes up, but regardless what I enter as a question I only get an error message stating ""something went wrong"".  The same website works with no issues (TG) with Safari. </p><p>Does anyone else experience the same? Is this a known bug with this version of Firefox? Is there a work around for it? Is the solution just using Safari? </p>",firefox-14701;firefox-1470;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",Zsuzsu

Although my account shows recent activity (last connection around mid-February), none of my synced data has been restored on the new installation. </p><p>The missing data includes: </p><p>Saved passwords (logins) </p><p>Bookmarks </p><p>Firefox preferences/settings </p><p>I have carefully checked the Sync logs (about), and they indicate that collections for passwords, bookmarks, history, and preferences do exist on the Sync server. However, the new profile does not download or apply these records, and Sync appears to treat the new local profile as authoritative. </p><p>I suspect that repeated sign-ins and sync attempts from a fresh profile may have caused my previous data to be overwritten or made inaccessible, even though the server still reports existing collections. </p><p>Given the importance of this data, I would like to ask: </p><p>Is it possible to restore my Firefox Sync data (passwords, bookmarks, and preferences) from a snapshot or server-side state from approximately 20 days ago? </p><p>Is there any way to force a full restore from the server instead of uploading the empty local profile? </p><p>Are server-side backups or recovery options available in cases like this? </p><p>I fully understand that Firefox Sync uses end-to-end encryption, but since the data was previously accessible under the same account, I am hoping there may still be a recovery option. </p><p>Please let me know if you need any additional information, logs, or identifiers from my account or device to investigate further. </p><p>Thank you very much for your time and support. </p><p>Kind regards, [edited email from public community support forum] </p>",firefox-1470;windows-10;firefox;sync-failure;,firefox,sync-failure,en-US,"",aminebrahimpoor
