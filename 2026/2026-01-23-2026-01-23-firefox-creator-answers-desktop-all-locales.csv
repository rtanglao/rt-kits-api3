But then I had to reset Windows and lost my backup keys and other stuff. Soon after, I experimented with other browsers and forgot about Firefox (I also deleted the Firefox profile in the Authenticator app). Now I've decided to log into my account, but since I can't log in without the app, I figured there's an option to log in using the email linked to the account (I have access to it), but for some reason, they're asking me for an account recovery key. So, I know my email address and have the password for it, but I can't log into my account without the Authenticator app. To try this alternative, I need to know the account recovery key, but I've lost it too. So, I'd be very grateful if anyone knows a solution to this problem. For reference, I also logged out of my Mozilla account on other devices and I haven't received any emails related to this situation (like checking email, etc.). </p>",firefox-14701;firefox-1470;windows-11;firefox;two-factor-authentication;,firefox,two-factor-authentication,en-US,"",cotkote831

Since June, I have lost multiple Gmail accounts. Every time my account gets blocked and I cannot recover it, I am forced to create a new Gmail account. However, the problem is that a new Gmail account does not last more than one week. It gets blocked again, even though: recovery email is correct recovery phone number is correct password is correct security verification is completed I have tested this on multiple devices: Google Pixel 9a (Android) iPhone iPod The issue happens on all devices, so it is not device‑specific. I am concerned that Google may be blocking: my phone my password manager or my fingerprint/security credentials Every solution I try fails, and every new Gmail account has the same problem. I use Gmail and YouTube for work purposes, not just for watching videos, so this issue is very serious for me. I would appreciate help understanding why my accounts keep getting blocked and how to resolve this permanently. </p>",firefox;backup-recovery-and-sync;,firefox,backup-recovery-and-sync,en-US,"",ahmedalibzy

I would like to clarify my issue in more detail. My problem is not related to videos or playback issues. I am experiencing a Google/Gmail account restriction. My Gmail account is blocked, and I am unable to sign in on any device. I have tried: Recovery phone number Recovery email Security verification (including fingerprint/security checks) Password recovery None of these recovery options work. I tested this on multiple devices: Google Pixel 9a (Android) iPhone iPod The issue is the same on all devices, which indicates that this is an account-level restriction, not a browser or device problem.

Although my account shows recent activity (last connection around mid-February), none of my synced data has been restored on the new installation. </p><p>The missing data includes: </p><p>Saved passwords (logins) </p><p>Bookmarks </p><p>Firefox preferences/settings </p><p>I have carefully checked the Sync logs (about), and they indicate that collections for passwords, bookmarks, history, and preferences do exist on the Sync server. However, the new profile does not download or apply these records, and Sync appears to treat the new local profile as authoritative. </p><p>I suspect that repeated sign-ins and sync attempts from a fresh profile may have caused my previous data to be overwritten or made inaccessible, even though the server still reports existing collections. </p><p>Given the importance of this data, I would like to ask: </p><p>Is it possible to restore my Firefox Sync data (passwords, bookmarks, and preferences) from a snapshot or server-side state from approximately 20 days ago? </p><p>Is there any way to force a full restore from the server instead of uploading the empty local profile? </p><p>Are server-side backups or recovery options available in cases like this? </p><p>I fully understand that Firefox Sync uses end-to-end encryption, but since the data was previously accessible under the same account, I am hoping there may still be a recovery option. </p><p>Please let me know if you need any additional information, logs, or identifiers from my account or device to investigate further. </p><p>Thank you very much for your time and support. </p><p>Kind regards, [edited email from public community support forum] </p>",firefox-1470;windows-10;firefox;sync-failure;,firefox,sync-failure,en-US,"",aminebrahimpoor
