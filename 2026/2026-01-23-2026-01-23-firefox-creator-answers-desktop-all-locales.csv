However, the new profile does not download or apply these records, and Sync appears to treat the new local profile as authoritative. </p><p>I suspect that repeated sign-ins and sync attempts from a fresh profile may have caused my previous data to be overwritten or made inaccessible, even though the server still reports existing collections. </p><p>Given the importance of this data, I would like to ask: </p><p>Is it possible to restore my Firefox Sync data (passwords, bookmarks, and preferences) from a snapshot or server-side state from approximately 20 days ago? </p><p>Is there any way to force a full restore from the server instead of uploading the empty local profile? </p><p>Are server-side backups or recovery options available in cases like this? </p><p>I fully understand that Firefox Sync uses end-to-end encryption, but since the data was previously accessible under the same account, I am hoping there may still be a recovery option. </p><p>Please let me know if you need any additional information, logs, or identifiers from my account or device to investigate further. </p><p>Thank you very much for your time and support. </p><p>Kind regards, [edited email from public community support forum] </p>",firefox-1470;windows-10;firefox;sync-failure;,firefox,sync-failure,en-US,"",aminebrahimpoor
