If I switch my browser and search engine to Google, which I hate, it shows and prints each puzzle properly. I don't know if it's the browser or the search engine, but it is a problem that I didn't have until recently. The print box is completely different from Firefox/Duck Duck Go to Google, so if it is Duck Duck Go that sets the printing box, I need to contact them.

I am able to sign in to all other apps with no problem. I tried clearing my cache, restarted Firefox, restarted my computer and spent 30 minutes on remote desktop access assistance with AOL trying to fix the problem with no success. I can log in to my account using Chrome on the desktop computer and can log in with no problem using my Android phone but can't log in using my desktop computer with Firefox. I've verified that my Firefox version is updated. I am running Windows 11 Pro. </p><p>I would greatly appreciate any helpful advice. </p>",firefox-14701;firefox-1470;windows-11;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,1796135;1796139;1796143;1796146;1796153;1796174;1796179;1796181;,kasdds
