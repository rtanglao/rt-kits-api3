However, my <strong>Default Profile</strong> is visually stuck on the old UI design. It does not reflect the recent interface changes associated with the update. </p><p>The Troubleshooting Context: </p> <ul><li> I have verified that the browser itself is technically updated (via Help &gt; About Firefox). </li><li> <strong>The strange part:</strong> I have other Firefox profiles on this same machine. When I launch those profiles, they correctly display the new, updated UI. </li><li> This issue is isolated strictly to my main/default profile. </li></ul> <p>Has anyone experienced this mismatch where the version number is correct, but the UI fails to refresh on a specific profile? Is there a specific fix for this? </p><p>Thanks in advance for the help. </p>",firefox-14601;firefox-1460;windows-11;firefox;browser-appearance;,firefox,browser-appearance,en-US,1793200;,yashgandhi7200
