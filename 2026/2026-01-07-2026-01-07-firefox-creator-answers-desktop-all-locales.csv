This allows you to access all of your user tabs and links. I hadn't noticed this before. It defeats the purpose of setting a Primary Password. I noticed similar issues in the Tor browser, but you can't set a Primary Password there at all, even though the feature is there, and it's built on the Fire Fox engine. Please fix this issue. No buttons should allow you to log in without entering the correct Primary Password. </p>",firefox-14601;firefox-1460;windows-10;firefox;primary-password;,firefox,primary-password,en-US,"",astrovitamine

We are attempting to do this via GPO with the latest version of Firefox ESR. We have been running into an issue where the extension is not being installed when the browser starts. After reviewing the distribution documentation for Firefox add-ons it appears that we have to submit the extension to be signed by Mozilla, the problem here is that our extension is on the air-gapped network and cannot be moved to an internet connected device per our clients policies.  </p><p>I had read on this <a href=""https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/enterprise/enterprise-distribution/"" rel=""nofollow"">page</a> page that Firefox ESR does allow unsigned extensions if you set `xpinstall.signatures.required` to `false` but that conflicts with <a href=""/en-US/kb/add-on-signing-in-firefox"" rel=""nofollow"">the Add-on signing in Firefox</a> support page that states: ""Firefox Extended Support Release (ESR): Some versions allowed overrides, but most recent ESR releases also enforce signing."" </p><p>So we appear to be at an impasse, we cannot have the extension signed and we are required to use the ESR version of Firefox (the Nightly and Developer versions are not allowed.) Is there anyway that we could selfsign the extension? Or bypass the requirement via GPO? </p>",windows-11;firefox;extensions;,firefox,extensions,en-US,"",firefox2898
