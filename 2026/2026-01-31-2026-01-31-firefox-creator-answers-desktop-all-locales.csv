It has never happened before. I usually watch Facebook Reels while playing Solitaire at the same time — yes, I know, I don’t have a life. </p><p>This morning, after the update and restart, I opened Facebook and started watching a Reel as normal. As soon as I clicked the Windows Start button to open the list of programs, the video stopped. I then selected Solitaire, which opened to the taskbar. I restarted the video, clicked Solitaire to open the game fully, and the video stopped again. As soon as I minimize Solitaire, the video resumes playing. </p><p>I’ve tried all the suggestions I could find via Google, but nothing has worked so far. Note that this only affects videos playing directly on Facebook — videos playing in the Windows Media Player Legacy video player itself are not affected. </p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated… and yes, as mentioned, I clearly don’t have a life 😅 Link to video showing what happens when I select Solitaire in the Taskbar. <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oKLIl3I4f9lfTZvbU-9pJ1gMbOU7h0zm/view?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oKLIl3I4f9lfTZvbU-9pJ1gMbOU7h0zm/view?usp=sharing</a> </p><p>Regards everyone. </p><p>More info... I run two monitors and it seem if I click on whatever I have open in the second monitor the FB video stops. So something has changed after I turned my computer on this morning and updated Windows. I even did a System Restore to a setting two days before this new update and nothing changed still have the problem. </p>",firefox-14702;firefox-1470;windows-11;firefox;audio-and-video;,firefox,audio-and-video,en-US,1797337;,phillstroud
