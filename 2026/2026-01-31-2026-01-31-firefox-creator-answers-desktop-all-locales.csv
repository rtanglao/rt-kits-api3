When multiple tabs are opened and I switch between them frequently over time, Firefox sometimes becomes less responsive. Pages may take longer to load, scrolling feels delayed, and opening previously loaded tabs isn’t as smooth as it was at the start of the session. </p><p>What makes this a bit confusing is that system resources don’t appear to spike significantly, and the slowdown seems gradual rather than immediate. Restarting the browser usually restores normal performance, which makes me wonder if this is related to session handling, memory cleanup, or how background tabs are managed over time. </p><p>I’m not necessarily looking for a quick fix, but rather trying to understand whether this behavior is expected and if there are recommended settings or habits that help maintain performance during longer sessions. If others have noticed similar behavior or have insights into how Firefox manages extended tab usage, I’d really appreciate learning from your experience. </p><p>Example page used for observation and comparison: <a href=""https://dunkinmenu.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dunkinmenu.org/</a> </p>",windows-11;firefox;app-responsiveness;,firefox,app-responsiveness,en-US,1797370;,waseemashrafffa

It has never happened before. I usually watch Facebook Reels while playing Solitaire at the same time — yes, I know, I don’t have a life. </p><p>This morning, after the update and restart, I opened Facebook and started watching a Reel as normal. As soon as I clicked the Windows Start button to open the list of programs, the video stopped. I then selected Solitaire, which opened to the taskbar. I restarted the video, clicked Solitaire to open the game fully, and the video stopped again. As soon as I minimize Solitaire, the video resumes playing. </p><p>I’ve tried all the suggestions I could find via Google, but nothing has worked so far. Note that this only affects videos playing directly on Facebook — videos playing in the Windows Media Player Legacy video player itself are not affected. </p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated… and yes, as mentioned, I clearly don’t have a life 😅 Link to video showing what happens when I select Solitaire in the Taskbar. <a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oKLIl3I4f9lfTZvbU-9pJ1gMbOU7h0zm/view?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oKLIl3I4f9lfTZvbU-9pJ1gMbOU7h0zm/view?usp=sharing</a> </p><p>Regards everyone. </p><p>More info...
