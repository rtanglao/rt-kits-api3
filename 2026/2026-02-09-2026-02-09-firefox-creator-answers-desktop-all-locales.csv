It previously worked well, but is now unusable. I'm now running Firefox version 147.0.3 on Chrome version 144.0.7559.167. This is after I did a clean reinstall of Firefox using flatpak, which didn't help. It seems like it often happens when my mouse hovers over a browser tab or icon (eg account, extensions, hamburger). Other quirky display behaviour, which mayor may not related, is that videos are often not working (eg Youtube, BBC), and various browser windows (eg when selecting Manage Bookmarks, or restarting in safe mode), open a small size-reduced window. Latest crash reports below - </p><p>bp-79d9b303-4402-455b-b49b-bbc1e0260209 	 bp-58276587-1315-4431-beba-4d9230260209 	 bp-0f499a5f-34e7-4a1d-8789-e8dc80260209  	 bp-a2ccec4c-087d-4e39-8af6-cbb740260209 	 bp-59770723-c637-4689-ae2f-a203f0260209 </p><p>Thanks for any suggestions. </p>",linux;firefox;app-crash;,firefox,app-crash,en-US,"",johnnetizen

My current Windows version of Firefox is 147.0.2,  for Linux it is 147.0.3. installed from the official repository - also known as the Software Manager in Linux Mint.  I've configured Firefox exactly the same in both operating systems. Running under Windows when saving a Bookmark, Firefox displays the well known Globe Icon, but after reloading the page the Favicon appears immediately (provided it is available of course). Under Linux Mint this does not happen, even if one restarts Firefox. Only after a system reboot Favicons of  revisited pages become visible. Is this a fundamental difference between the Windows and Linux version of Firefox or am I missing something?   I've installed the Firefox extension for caching the favicon, but it made no difference, If I run it, still the Icon does not appear until system reboot.  I couldn´t find an answer in the help database nor on the Internet in general. </p><p>This difference might seem insignificant for most people but for me it is. When shopping on the internet I bookmark a lot of pages of products to be able to make quick comparisons. The Favicon is of great help because it makes it easy to identify the different shops.  Of course I could manually change the bookmark name to include the shop name, but Icons are a much better clue and leave more room in the bookmark name for other information. </p><p>Reinder </p>",firefox-14702;firefox-1470;linux;firefox;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",reinderrutgers
