This gradually got worse, the site taking for ever to open at all, and always with the little dot in the tab at the top left going from side to side showing it was still loading. I have tried everything I can think of. Opened in troubleshoot mode, changed DNS settings, uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox twice (one time to see if it would work normally if I didn't actually sign in to my account). All to no avail. In fact now things are worse, in that the <a href=""http://GOV.Uk"" rel=""nofollow"">GOV.Uk</a> website is now giving me similar problems - and a few other sites have become slightly slow and reluctant to open as well.
