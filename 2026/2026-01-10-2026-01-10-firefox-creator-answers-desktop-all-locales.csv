It did not used to be like this on my old computer however I created a firefox account on my old computer hoping that if I did that and signed in on my new computer it would bring over my saved tabs and info. It did bring over my info but kept my dad's tabs as well. Is there a way to get rid of my dad's tabs on my new computer without deleting them from his computer as well? I also then created a new firefox profile in hopes that when I signed in to that one it would only bring my information but it just replicated the original profile, now I am hoping to delete that second profile but I am worried that will delete all of my information because when I go to delete it it says it will delete a bunch of my saved information. Is that information saved in my original profile so that if I delete the second profile I created it won't delete the data from the original profile (which is just the same information on both) as well? I can't seem to find anything to sign out of other than the new firefox account I just created, I was hoping to sign out of whatever I originally signed in with and try a different sign in but I can't even seem to find anywhere to sign out. I am not sure how I managed to do this, but any suggestions on how to fix it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. </p>",firefox-1460;windows-10;firefox;sync-failure;,firefox,sync-failure,en-US,"",malinalusic02

See my following message here for a description of my solution. </p><p><em>Original message starts here ...</em> </p><p>I'm using Firefox 144.0 under Debian Linux. I've used Firefox on this machine for years with no problem.  Firefox can easily connect to literally thousands of web servers on the internet, both via HTTP and HTTPS. </p><p>But now, I'm having an issue: </p><p>I started running a web server on the same machine that Firefox is running on. This server only listens for non-HTTPS connections on port 80. I am not using any proxy server with Firefox. </p><p>I can easily and directly connect to my local web server's pages from my local machine from Chrome, w3m, curl, and direct telnet connections to port 80 ... all of which are addressing the publicly accessible domain name for my local web server. However, However, Firefox refuses to connect to any URL's on my local machine, and it gives me the following explanation: </p><p><em><strong>Unable to connect </strong></em> </p><p>Firefox can’t establish a connection to the server at [ my server's domain name ]. </p><pre>   The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few moments.    If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer’s network connection.    If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure that Firefox is permitted to access the web. </pre> <p><em><strong> </strong></em> </p><p>In Firefox, I have all auto-forcing of HTTPS disabled by means of <em><strong>Don’t enable HTTPS-Only Mode</strong></em> turned on. </p><p>I get the same error in Firefox whether I connect via a URL like ""http://MYFULLDOMAINNAME"" or a URL like ""http://AAA.BBB.CCC.DDD"", where ""AAA.BBB.CCC.DDD"" is my machine's publicly accessible static IP address and ""MYFULLDOMAINNAME"" is the long-standing, publicly accessible domain name for my machine ...  both with and without a suffix of "":80"" on the supplied URL. </p><p>And again, all other browsers on my machine have no problem whatsoever connecting to my own local web server on this same local machine of mine using those same URL's. </p><p>And all browsers (Firefox and otherwise) that are running on other machines all over the internet have no problem connecting to that same web server via the same URL's that I described above </p><p>Also, I have no firewall rules on my machine which would block access to my own machine's port 80. </p><p>What could be causing this error in Firefox, and what might I be able to do to fix it? </p><p>Thank you very much in advance. </p><p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Just a bit more information. Looking at the web logs, I see that Firefox's request never even reaches my local web server. In other words, Firefox itself is not even trying to make a TCPIP port 80 connection to my local web server in the first place </p>",firefox-1440;linux;firefox;connectivity;,firefox,connectivity,en-US,1792840;1792896;,hippoman1
