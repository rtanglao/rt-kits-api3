Lately in the ""Rules"" pane of the Inspector window, I've noticed something I've never seen before.  Normally it shows a list of rules for properties, attributes, etc...(CSS) which I can select or locate and change/modify with virtually no problems. Lately in that pane I've been seeing an item with an italicized title ""element attributes style"" and a lock icon on the upper left next to that text and it doesn't show show a link to the CSS page on the right side, nor does it allow me to select anything within. Does anybody know about this&nbsp;?...is it some new setting or something that's changed in the newer versions of the browser.  A couple of months ago I updated FF, which I hadn't done for awhile, and also just by chance, since that update I hadn't really used the Inspector for one reason or another, so I'm wondering if it's just a coincidence, since I had never seen it before. I'd appreciate any info or opinions about this. Thanks and wish everyone all the best. </p>",firefox-14402;firefox-1440;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;settings;,firefox,settings,en-US,"",buzzdixn

These incidents have created an ongoing threat to our safety, privacy, and well-being, and I am requesting your urgent attention and investigation. Specifically: Potential Data Breach: I am concerned that personal or sensitive information related to my family, including my children, may have been accessed, shared, or misused without consent. Fraud and Misrepresentation: There are ongoing issues that suggest fraudulent activity or misrepresentation that could be affecting accounts, communications, or digital platforms associated with my family. Rights Violations: My parental rights and the safety of my children are being compromised through these activities. This may involve unauthorized access to our information or interference in our digital lives. Child Safety Concerns: Given the seriousness of the potential breaches and unauthorized activity, I am deeply concerned about the direct impact on my children’s privacy and safety. I request the following actions from Mozilla: Immediate review of any accounts, data, or activity associated with my information or my children’s information. Confirmation if there has been any unauthorized access or suspicious activity. Guidance on steps I should take to secure our information and prevent further potential violations. Documentation or evidence of any actions taken to address this matter. Please treat this matter with the urgency it deserves. I am prepared to provide any information necessary to facilitate your review, including emails, account information, or other supporting evidence. I appreciate your prompt attention to this critical issue and look forward to your response.

La cosa mi era già successa in passato, avevo aperto un ticket e non eravamo riusciti a risolvere, anche perché io non posso lasciare il PC ""fermo"" in attesa di una soluzione che potrebbe richiedere giorni. Io vorrei avere un modo di poter salvare integralmente la configurazione di Firefox, come posso fare il backup dei preferiti e ripristinarlo. Una soluzione file based.
