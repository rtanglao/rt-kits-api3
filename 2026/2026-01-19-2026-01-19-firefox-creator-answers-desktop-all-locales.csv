From the settings page I thought it once every 24 hours. I noticed from higher than normal CPU usage impacting FF and the Windows search indexer. Which reverted to normal once I disabled the backup. </p><p>I checked the about config: </p> <ul><li> browser.backup.scheduled.minimum-time-between-backups-seconds </li></ul> <p>Is set to 24 hours (86400 seconds) </p><p>But I also noticed: </p> <ul><li> browser.backup.scheduled.idle-threshold-seconds </li></ul> <p>Is set to 15 seconds(!). Is that what I think it is? Back up whenever there's a 15 sec idle window, regardless of the minimum? Can I safely make that 86400 seconds too, or does it do something else entirely? </p><p>Many thanks in advance. </p>",firefox-1470;windows-10;firefox;backup-data;,firefox,backup-data,en-US,"",Joey

Not every time, just once in a while and that can be so infrequent that I don't see the browser being the issue until I contact support at the company whose site I'm having issues with.  This could be processing a checkout form on a site after purchasing an item.  This latest incident involves me trying to fill out an open enrollment form for benefits at the 3rd party benefits administrator because I got fired in Nov [along with many others].  I tried to fill out the re enrollment form and it simply went in circles and never completed.  The name of the benefits administrator is ""bswift"" if that makes any difference.  You know what they told me when I called and said I was using Firefox?  ""Well... you should be using Chrome or Edge.""  Doesn't happen often, but companies know there is a problem with Firefox.  In that case, why are there ZERO help articles on this site on the issues of forms?  I tried phrasing the question 5 different ways.  The last one gave ""Found 52 results for ‘forms don't work’ for ‘All Products’ "".  If the companies that I call know that Firefox is an issue, and this has been going on for a LONG time, years, then why has this not been addressed?  Either by Mozilla, or by someone in the Forums?  Not a single one of the 52 results were even close to  my issue.  I am simply at a lost to understand why I am the only one in the world forms don't work for.  I have to stop, move to Chrome, and start whatever it was I was doing all over again.  I have been using this product since Netscape 1.0, and was around long before windows or browsers existed.  Any insights are appreciated.  Thank you. </p>",firefox-1470;windows-10;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",bodybuilder230
