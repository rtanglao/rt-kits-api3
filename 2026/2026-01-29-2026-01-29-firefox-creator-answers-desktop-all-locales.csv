The site loads quickly on Google Chrome, but on Mozilla Firefox it feels noticeably slower, particularly on the first load and when navigating between pages related to heat pump water heaters and other service sections. </p><p>I’m trying to understand what might cause Firefox-specific slowdowns, such as differences in JavaScript execution, CSS rendering, font loading, third-party scripts, or browser compatibility. I’d also appreciate recommendations on using Firefox developer tools (like the Performance tab or Network analysis) to diagnose these issues, as well as best practices to improve load speed and overall performance in Firefox without negatively affecting Chrome. </p><p>Any insights, debugging tips, or real-world examples would be greatly appreciated. </p>",firefox;loading-speed;,firefox,loading-speed,en-US,"",johngasperemh
