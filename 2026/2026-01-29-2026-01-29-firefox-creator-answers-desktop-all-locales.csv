I talked to  Discover Card about it.  They say the most frequent reason it happens is because Discover Card is not on your safe list. I tried signing in on my other PCs with a Ubuntu OS and their browser Opera works fine on signing me in. Within the last two weeks I installed Mint on two of my PCs.  works great except for not being able to sign in to Discover Card. I am not having that problem on any other sites. I doubt if my cache is full as my usage being new OS has been minimal. I just tried signiing in with this PC after installing Mint yesterday. I get the same message </p><p>""We're sorry. Your request cannot be completed at this time. We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience and are working to resolve this issue soon."" </p><p>Discover wants to blame Firefox. Personally I think It has to do within the Mozilla VPN. I say that because I often had the same problem when I used McAfee's VPN. Discover maintains it has nothing to do with VPNs and it is a trust issue. </p><p>Eventually I want to replace Ubuntu with Mint. But I cannot until this problem is fixed. Opera is also running a VPN when I sign in so this would support Discover Cards theory about Firefox not having Discover on a safe list.  I think they have it wrong though. If your site is blocked you are not on Discover's safe list. I wish we could get a meeting of the two minds instead of me trapped in the middle.
