NOW, it is no longer in settings. </p><p>I first notices a problem when links on a banner did not work.  It did no occur to me it was due to Firefox control of the mouse.   </p><p>Next the mouse wheel function, configured in the OS, that scrolls three lines has become dysfunctional.  It jumps around and jerk up and down when I use it to scroll 3 lines which is a huge time waste. </p><p>Then I went to settings to turn off  the mouse feature and it was not there!   So I looked in about:config and there is a huge list of mouse settings that appear to be configured the way Firefox has universally done without any way to disable Firefox control of the mouse. </p><p>Lastly, I do not have the mouse configured for accessibility; I have it minimally configured the way I need it in the computer OS settings.  The Firefox configuration of how the mouse functions in Firefox also creates the same wheel problem when not using the browser.   </p><p>How can Firefox universal configuration of the mouse be disabled.  Nothing about it is useful or helpful, it creates a number of obstacle - primarily interference with the use of the mousewheel, and on some websites (primarily configured for the use of Chrome) the banner links are not responding to the mouse. </p><p>I do not have an accessibility configuration, nor do I use keyboard mouse shortcuts, Last time I updated I actually installed the entire program, hoping to avoid the Microsoft control of Firefox since the update feature apparently uses the microsoft app to update and takes control when Firefox is the default browser (perhaps also when it is not) - to no avail. </p><p>Please at least return the feature to disable Firefox mouse settings that allows turning off the configured mouse setting, or at least offer a solution for disabling them!! </p>",firefox-1400;windows-10;firefox;customization;,firefox,customization,en-US,"",gosfordsyke
