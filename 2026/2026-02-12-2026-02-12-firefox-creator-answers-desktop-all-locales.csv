تجربیات هم درس بگیرند و شبکه حمایتی قوی‌تری در بین خودشان شکل بگیرد. </p><p>۶. حفظ و ترویج گفتمان ایثار و مقاومت در سطح جامعه: استفاده از زبان بی‌زبان شهدا از طریق زبان مادران و همسران آن‌ها برای تبیین ارزش‌های انقلاب اسلامی و دفاع مقدس برای عموم مردم، به خصوص جوانان. ۷. افزایش رضایتمندی و ارتقای جایگاه اجتماعی خانواده‌های شهدا: نشان دادن عملی به این عزیزان که دولت و نظام اسلامی، آن‌ها را تنها
