Last time I tried to open Firefox in one of the user accounts, it asked for an admin password to install a helper, presumably to update.  Rather than responding, I switched to the admin account and updated Firefox manually, (from the ""about"" option).   If I now try to open Firefox back on the user account, I still get that request, but even after I enter the admin credentials, Firefox won't open.   It does however open on the admin account and the other two user accounts, not getting the ""helper"" window at all.    I have reinstalled Firefox (twice), and removed the profile form the troublesome user account, but the problem recurs.   Where is the problem and how do I fix it? </p><p>I tried starting Firefox in trouble-shoot mode, but nothing changed. </p><p>When I try starting Firefox from the Terminal with the -P option, I get the following message </p><p>miki@Mikeliss-iMac MacOS % ./firefox -P                                2026-02-11 18:14:06.242 Firefox GPU Helper[94978:60675173] Failure on line 688 in function id scheduleApplicationNotification(LSNotificationCode, NSWorkspaceNotificationCenter *): noErr == _LSModifyNotification(notificationID, 1, &amp;code, 0, NULL, NULL, NULL) 2026-02-11 18:14:06.281 Firefox GPU Helper[94978:60675275] Connection Invalid error for service com.apple.hiservices-xpcservice. 2026-02-11 18:14:06.281 Firefox GPU Helper[94978:60675173] Error received in message reply handler: Connection invalid UNSUPPORTED (log once): POSSIBLE ISSUE: unit 1 GLD_TEXTURE_INDEX_2D is unloadable and bound to sampler type (Float) - using zero texture because texture unloadable </p>",firefox-14703;firefox-1470;firefox;launch-failure;,firefox,launch-failure,en-US,"",m.bickis

I now think I could have been duped by the colour of the window bar. I have also found that firefox manage bookmarks does not show individual bookmarks that are not in folders - in the left pane. This also threw me. However, when I click on Bookmarks menu in left pane, the individual bookmarks are all shown in the RHS pane.  I have done a quick check and the list does not contain at least two bookmark folders that are in my Waterfox bookmarks - I did not try to check all. I now think there is no problem. Interested whether anyone else has raised this. MY SUGGESTION - in the past I am confident that manage bookmarks function did not use waterfox color. In the next update try to change the manage bookmarks function window to a color different to Waterfox colors. This may not be possible if waterfox simply inherits the manage bookmarks function code incl colors. </p><p>Prior question text pasted here for completeness Yesterday I was using both Firefox and Waterfox.  Since then when I try to use manage bookmarks in Firefox - I get the waterfox version of manage bookmarks showing the waterfox bookmarks list.
