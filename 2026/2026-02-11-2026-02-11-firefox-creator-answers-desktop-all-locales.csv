I do not understand much of this. I think it happened after an update. I tried a restore point. I deleted the Icons file as it seemed that might be an issue and they would automatically update on restart.  I called Dell support, they could not fix it, neither could my smart, younger friends. So after hours of frustration, I had to install chrome, which I hate. What I want is for someone to just fix it. Its 2:30am and I need to get some sleep, I will check this tomorrow afternoon and see if I can get anywhere.

I now think I could have been duped by the colour of the window bar. I have also found that firefox manage bookmarks does not show individual bookmarks that are not in folders - in the left pane. This also threw me. However, when I click on Bookmarks menu in left pane, the individual bookmarks are all shown in the RHS pane.  I have done a quick check and the list does not contain at least two bookmark folders that are in my Waterfox bookmarks - I did not try to check all. I now think there is no problem. Interested whether anyone else has raised this. MY SUGGESTION - in the past I am confident that manage bookmarks function did not use waterfox color. In the next update try to change the manage bookmarks function window to a color different to Waterfox colors. This may not be possible if waterfox simply inherits the manage bookmarks function code incl colors. </p><p>Prior question text pasted here for completeness Yesterday I was using both Firefox and Waterfox.  Since then when I try to use manage bookmarks in Firefox - I get the waterfox version of manage bookmarks showing the waterfox bookmarks list.
