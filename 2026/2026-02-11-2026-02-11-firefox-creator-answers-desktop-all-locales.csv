In Firefox the request is created, and times out. The server receives no file and logs “missing file.” The same webapp code is running on both Chromium and Firefox. </pre> <pre> Environment:  - Next.js app (pages/api route)  - Endpoint: POST /api/file-upload  - Client: fetch(url, { method: ""POST"", body: FormData, credentials:    ""include"" })  - Server: export const config = { api: { bodyParser: false } } + multipart    parsing (formidable)  - Edge/Chromium: Version 141.0.3537.85  - Firefox Version 147.0.3 (64-bit)  - OS: Ubuntu 22 / Linux </pre> <p>Steps to reproduce: </p><pre> 1. Create a FormData object and append a local file: </pre> <pre>    const fd = new FormData();     fd.append(""template"", file, <a href=""http://file.name"" rel=""nofollow"">file.name</a>);     fetch(`/api/file-upload`, {       method: ""POST"",       body: fd,  2. In Edge/Chrome, upload succeeds.  Server receives multipart body and parses the file. </pre> <pre> Actual behavior in Firefox:  - Transferred: 0 B  - No response status/body  - Client times out (Upload times out)  - File upload request received  - No bytes read server‑side. </pre> <p>Evidence: </p><pre> - Edge request logs:    content-type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----WebKitFormBoundary...    bytesRead ~1.69MB  - Firefox request logs:    Transferred 0 B    File upload missing file field </pre> <pre> Notes:  - Client FormData is valid; we log <a href=""http://file.name"" rel=""nofollow"">file.name</a> and file.size right before fetch.  - There is a CSP report‑only warning (frame‑ancestors) when using a fallback    iframe approach, but we are not using iframe in the failing case. </pre> <pre> Question:  Is there a known issue where Firefox blocks or fails to send and multipart/  body can be stripped before it leaves the browser? Is there a recommended  workaround that does not rely on browser sniffing? </pre>",windows-11;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",jramsey123
