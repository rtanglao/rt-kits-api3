But I believe my case is different. </p><p>I had to reset a password tonight, requiring me to re-login to the account in Firefox.  But, the tab/window would just freeze.   I don't see anything immediately being blocked (ie: any DNS filter etc).  </p><p>But, I CAN get it to work in Debugging mode, which suggests either there is an extension that is blocking it, or something else (some variable that is otherwise active in regular running Firefox).  I just don't know which. </p><p>Has anyone else reported this and what might be the issue?   I suspect uBlockOrigin (one), which I do use.  But the other extensions I use are just for Youtube, IG, etc. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",firefox-14702;firefox-1470;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;extensions;,firefox,extensions,en-US,"",forrie1
