Apparently, since I hadn't logged into the first email account for a certain amount of time, the account provider deleted the account, so when I decided to try to change my primary email account that I have listed on my mozilla account, but when I tried to add a secondary account like it says your required to do so you can change the primary, mozilla wants me to enter a code sent to my primary email address to prove I am me, and therein lies my problem. I can't get into the primary email account because it doesn't exist anymore, so I need a new primary email account on my mozilla account, and I can't add a new email account to my mozilla account because I can't access the primary email account.
