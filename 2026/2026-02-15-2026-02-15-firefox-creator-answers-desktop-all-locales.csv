I use google as my default search engine. When I open a new tab the google search page opens as usual. But now all of a sudden as soon as I start typing, search suggestions are appearing in the address box and not in the main google search page bar.  </p><p>I've tried ""settings-search-address bar"" and turned off all features but that had no effect on the problem. I've reset the laptop several times but the issue still remains.  </p><p>This problem is really annoying so any help would be great. Cheers Jeff </p>",firefox-14703;firefox-1470;windows-11;firefox;search-suggestions;,firefox,search-suggestions,en-US,"",jeffgrey064
