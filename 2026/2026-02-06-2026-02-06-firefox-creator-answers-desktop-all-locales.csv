It's been my favorite browser.  I'm using the current updated Firefox 147.0.3 (aarch64) and and Apple's O/S macOS Sequoia Version 15.7.3. </p><p>However, for at least 8 months or more now, Firefox has become completely unreliable for downloading files to save on my virtual drive in my MacBook Pro M3 Max because it often if not always freezes up in the process.  I have to curse again (!) then Force Quit, reboot, and everything instantly comes back up on the monitor as if nothing happened, only of course I did not accomplish the task of downloading and saving the file I needed to handle. </p><pre>I have discovered by talking to folks and by researching Firefox's support information library that I'm ""not alone"".  Not by far.  This problem IS a Firefox issue.  I've tried to follow Firefox's several different solutions to overcome whatever the root cause of the problem is, but without success.  The TIME required to really go through this problem-solving process is a killer.  And, yea, since I'm physically practically in OPEN AI's backyard, I have consulted CHAT GPT and it also confirmed this issue between Firefox and Apple's O'S macOS Sequoia Version 15.7.3 and practically gave me a Masters thesis about.  Who has time for this?  Why can't Firefox solve this problem to make this easy for us? </pre> <p>S0 now, before I update my O/S to macOS Tahoe 26.3, does anyone know if between Apple and Firefox this problem has been solved?  For 10 years it was never a problem.  What the heck happened?  Firefox is no longer my primary browser, for I never know for sure whether or not I'll need to download and save to my Mac's virtual drive a file. </p><p>Thanks for any constructive comments anyone may make! And Happy Friday. ~ GPB </p>",firefox;download-failure;,firefox,download-failure,en-US,"",gbardet

(It works ok when I use Private Browsing, but that's inconvenient.) </p><p>WHAT USED TO HAPPEN: when I was at the sign in page, my password manager (Dashlane) filled in the username and then a screen asking to use the passkey.  I said yes, and got in to Google with no problem. </p><p>NOW: the password manager fills in my username (my name at <a href=""http://gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">gmail.com</a>) and when I hit ""NEXT""  in the sign in field I get <strong>email or phone <a href=""http://l.com"" rel=""nofollow"">l.com</a></strong>   When I click in the field that disappears and my username appears.  When I hit NEXT it goes back to ""email or phone <a href=""http://l.com"" rel=""nofollow"">l.com</a>"".  Same when I hit return.  Same when I enter my phone number. SO maybe it's Dashlane (my password manager)?  But when I disable that and TYPE my username (or phone number) in the field, same stuff happens. </p><p>BUT when I use a private browser window, the gmail sign in works as before, and so that's what I've been using -- but it's not convenient having 2 windows open.  Before it was just a tab in one window. What changed?  Why? Can I change it back?

Introduction A courtesy meeting was held between the Administrator of Western Province with Secretary DPLLGA ensued with the following discussions and undertakings </p><p>2.	The Provincial Administrator visited Secretary with the following issues of concerns which he came to share with Secretary, to gauge his views and if possible gain support for his own initiatives he advanced in the administration of his Province with development plans triggered from the villages, communities, wards, and LLGs to cascade with and harmonize with his DSIP, PSIP, and in overall alignment with the MTDP4. 3.	He emphasized the urgent and dire need of such plans to put villages and communities in order with organized services that trigger ordinary village developments, organizing towards improving services, and advancing lives for ordinary population, and improving qualities and standards for the ordinary citizens. 4.	He pointed out the missing link or disconnect in planning between the DSIP,  PSIP, and the overall NDP and in particular the MTDP4. How could a local village and community in PNG improve its deteriorating services if the current scenario remains uncovered, especially by way of advancing planned interventions and National Government attention and leadership with structured and formatted delivery of basic services to the village and community levels? 5.	  <strong>bold text</strong> </p>",firefox-12401;firefox-1240;windows-11;firefox;download-and-save;,firefox,download-and-save,en-US,"",yoweeddy
