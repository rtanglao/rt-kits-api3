This makes it easy to pick the wrong card during checkout or testing. </p><p>Is there currently a way to add a custom description or label to a saved payment card (for example “Stripe test – successful payment” or “Stripe test – 3D Secure”) that would be shown in the card selection dialog? </p><p>If not, is this something that’s planned or already discussed as a potential improvement? From a developer’s perspective, this would be a big usability win. </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p>",firefox-14703;firefox-1470;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;autofill;,firefox,autofill,en-US,1798458;,Morten

Introduction A courtesy meeting was held between the Administrator of Western Province with Secretary DPLLGA ensued with the following discussions and undertakings </p><p>2.	The Provincial Administrator visited Secretary with the following issues of concerns which he came to share with Secretary, to gauge his views and if possible gain support for his own initiatives he advanced in the administration of his Province with development plans triggered from the villages, communities, wards, and LLGs to cascade with and harmonize with his DSIP, PSIP, and in overall alignment with the MTDP4. 3.	He emphasized the urgent and dire need of such plans to put villages and communities in order with organized services that trigger ordinary village developments, organizing towards improving services, and advancing lives for ordinary population, and improving qualities and standards for the ordinary citizens. 4.	He pointed out the missing link or disconnect in planning between the DSIP,  PSIP, and the overall NDP and in particular the MTDP4. How could a local village and community in PNG improve its deteriorating services if the current scenario remains uncovered, especially by way of advancing planned interventions and National Government attention and leadership with structured and formatted delivery of basic services to the village and community levels? 5.	  <strong>bold text</strong> </p>",firefox-12401;firefox-1240;windows-11;firefox;download-and-save;,firefox,download-and-save,en-US,"",yoweeddy
