Launch Firefox (and add Sites shortcuts) 2. Do not navigate to any website 3. Observe network activity using Process Monitor or clash verge </p><p>Expected Behavior: - Opening about:home should not establish TCP connections to remote sites unless the user interacts with them. </p><p>Actual Behavior: - TCP connections are observed immediately to sites listed in Top Sites shortcuts, even without user interaction. </p><p>Notes: - Disabling DNS prefetch, speculative preconnect, and predictor settings does not prevent these connections. - Extensions have been ruled out, I can distinguish <a href=""http://darkreader.org"" rel=""nofollow"">darkreader.org</a>(extention) <a href=""http://mozilla.org"" rel=""nofollow"">mozilla.org</a>(update) and <a href=""http://reddit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">reddit.com</a>(your sponsor url) from *.edu.*(my shortcuts), DON'T mention that. - Connections occur before any page navigation or clicks. - I suspect that Firefox may attempt to load site icons (favicon / tile thumbnails), but this is unconfirmed. </p>",firefox-1460;windows-10;firefox;new-tab;,firefox,new-tab,en-US,"",anemo3354
