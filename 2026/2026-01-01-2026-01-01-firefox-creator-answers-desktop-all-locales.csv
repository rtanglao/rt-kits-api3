However, we're affraid of a backward syncing situation. How can we make sure we prevent that? </p><p>For example, say we worked on the desktop for a week, and then need to use the laptop. What should we do when we turn the laptop on and open ff browser, if we wish to sync from the desktop to the laptop? Do we press the Sync button on the laptop? - or will that force a backward synching from the laptop to the desktop? If that's the case, than how do we sync reliabely? And let's say the day after, from the now-updated-laptop to the desktop? Is the safest way to do it by turning the sync option off, and copying the bookmarkbackup folder from one updated computer to the other? </p><p>Also, this may complicate things a bit - We use the browser bookmarks in a non traditional way. It's kind of an archive for us. The .jsonlz4 file size in bookmarkbackups folder is 37MB. We remember reading somewhere before, the server backups stores files up to 10MB. So, question is, does the large size or the bookmarks file will affect the synching process between computers? </p><p>Thank you very much!&nbsp;:) </p>",firefox-14601;firefox-1460;windows-11;firefox;sync-configuration;,firefox,sync-configuration,en-US,1790544;1790550;1790554;1790559;,tef
