How to correct?,"<p>I own three laptops and they are in my Firefox account and synced.  I have several bookmarks for site I frequently visit.  On two laptops, based on my settings, when I tap a bookmark it opens up in its own tab.  This is how I want these to function.  For some reason, my third laptop does not behave in this manner.  The new bookmark opens up on the tab I am currently in.  It gets bumped and the new bookmark opens.  This is exactly how I do not want it to perform.  What is going on?  Also, when I set up settings doesn't it work for all my laptops since I am signed in? </p>",firefox-14601;firefox-1460;windows-11;firefox;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",crarja

It's cool that it gives me a few things to look at the refresh occasionally, and that they're filtered by subject. However there's some sites I don't wish to go to. Either sites that feel like clickbait or sites that have a paywall attached to them. I'd rather they not show up at all. </p><p>The thumbs down button does not work for this... in fact I'm not sure exactly what it does. For example there's a website that comes up on the NBA section that is always low effort, bad content click bait. But it's popular because of the sensationalism. I've thumbs downed specifically that website at least 30 times now and it's still a regular pop up under that section. </p><p>If there's a way to stop these sites from showing (not just stopping me from going the website through a  website blocking app) that would be rad.

I had no idea that my own family (daughter and her family) synced their equipment to get online to me, but they must have done this right before they were evicted from my Mothers house as they had lived there almost eight years and never ever paid my Mom any rent and what's worse is that my Mothers house was really beautiful until they moved in and then the whole house was just wrecked and they even had fires from my Mothers stove and they screwed up my Mothers dryer somehow burning the insulation wiring that went around the outside on the door. They had a really bad habit of drinking alcohol and smoking pot.  </p><p>They used my Mother's yard as a trashing ground.  </p><p>My daughter worked for Uber and Enterprize Truck Rental) I am not sure about the spelling of the last one, but my Mothers driveway had receding fence that was as long as her driveway and when my daughter got home they would all ""clean"" the car out by throwing everything they had as trash over my Mothers fence because it was late at night when she would come 'home' and I had only been there around two years as my Moms caretaker. Mom would ask me to take pictures of her yard (Mom was around 93 then) and she also asked me to take pictures of the house in the rooms they used. The rooms would have been shut down if Social Services knew what they looked like! My daughter finally married her boyfriend and she asked me to see if he could move in and so I asked my Mother if it was OK if he moved in. Mom said yes and I did not know he was an alcoholic, granted he was a nice guy, but he loved to cook and on several times I knew hr had gone to lay down while the stove was blazing on top! They both caused fires in the oven and I can't smell very well because I have really bad allergies. When the top of the oven was lifted up there was at least 3/4 of an inch of grease in there and it was black! They were evicted from my Mothers house while Mom was in a Nursing Home. At any rate I am giving you a slight picture of how they were minus her sons abuse towards me and he knew better! They all knew netter, but they wanted to act like they were from the slums of Baltimore, MD, That's where they moved from into Moms house eight years prior. My Mother had written a note to my daughter telling her that they all had to get out and that's when my daughter didn't even say anything to Mom in the morning, or if she was home early my daughter would just ignore my Mother. So what is going on is they evidently knew I was going to get a Desktop because they synced their items and TV to my old computer. I guess they think that I was the one that had them evicted and her son who is very mean probably found out how to sync their things to the modem that is here under the name of Unknown. I am back with my boyfriend now and he has a free phone from the government, but I have one from AT&amp;T an iPhone 16e. And I do have a Roku onn TV that they mess with as they had one at my Mothers and I guess that's how they got into the Roku TV that I had bought while at Moms I even gave her an extra $100.00 because I wanted her to know I appreciated what she had done. I am on fixed income just as my boyfriend. And it's just us here and we specifically told Comcast that we don't want anyone else on the modem and they said that would not be possible if we didn't give out the password and it's all about them syncing to my old computer. The worst thing they did is put a ""(1)"" for their groups to use and my computer started out with the name ""Owner"" and when I got my Desktop I changed my name to ""Unknown"" and either Microsoft or them put the number (2) on my system My boyfriend doesn't even want to be bothered or learn computing because of this, but he is paying for it and they are all getting a free ride and while they are doing that they are also abusing me and my Desktop and my TV (Roku) and my boyfriends phone!

A few days ago, Firefox suddenly asked me if I wanted to create a profile. Since I had never used this feature in depth before, I selected the default “Original Profile” option. Since then, the profile name “Original Profile” has always been displayed in the tab title bar. I don't understand the point of this, but it causes me major problems because I manage my passwords using KeePass. To log in to the desired pages with Auto-Type, KeePass recognizes the tab title bar and automatically enters the data. Due to the above-mentioned change in Firefox, all my passwords are now useless because the profile name is displayed everywhere in the title bar and I would have to resave Auto-Type for all stored passwords (several hundred). This is very annoying. Why was this introduced and why is there no option to disable it?

This provides a persistent chat interface without needing to switch tabs constantly. Natively, Firefox supports providers like ChatGPT (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), Claude (Anthropic), Le Chat (Mistral), and others through a dropdown selector. However, Grok (from xAI) is not included in the official list and must be added manually as a custom provider. </p><p>The screenshot you provided shows the standard Firefox ""Proceed with Caution"" warning when accessing `about:config` (the advanced preferences page), alongside an open tab at `<a href=""https://grok.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://grok.com/</a>` displaying the SuperGrok interface. This strongly indicates the setup process for adding Grok via a custom configuration tweak, which loads the full Grok web app into the sidebar (essentially embedding `<a href=""http://grok.com"" rel=""nofollow"">grok.com</a>` in a framed view). </p> <ol><li><ol><li><ol><li><ol><li> Requirements and Context </li></ol> </li></ol> </li></ol> </li></ol> <p>- **Firefox Version**: Version 133 or later (as of early 2026, most users will have a newer version; check via Menu &gt; Help &gt; About Firefox). - **Account Needs**: You'll need an xAI/Grok account (free or SuperGrok/Premium+ subscription) for full access. Logging in within the sidebar will persist if cookies are allowed. - **Limitations**: </p><pre> - Only **one** chatbot can be active in the sidebar at a time.  - Custom providers like Grok load the full web version, so interactions send data directly to xAI (no Mozilla intermediation, preserving Grok's native features like image generation, voice mode if available, or real-time search).  - Performance may vary; the sidebar uses an embedded view, which could consume more resources than native integrations.  - Privacy Implications: All queries go straight to the provider's servers. Review xAI's terms for data handling.  - Persistence: The setting generally survives restarts, but closing/reopening the sidebar or browser resets might occasionally require re-login. </pre> <p>- **Nuances and Edge Cases**: </p><pre> - If you're on a free Grok plan, usage quotas apply (higher with SuperGrok).  - Features like page summarization (highlight text &gt; right-click &gt; AI shortcuts) work if Grok supports context from the main tab.  - Mobile Firefox does not support this sidebar feature.  - If the sidebar doesn't appear after setup, ensure it's enabled in settings. </pre> <ol><li><ol><li><ol><li><ol><li> Step-by-Step Setup Instructions </li></ol> </li></ol> </li></ol> </li></ol> <p>1. **Update Firefox (Recommended)**: </p><pre>  - Go to Menu (three lines) &gt; Help &gt; About Firefox.   - It will check for updates automatically; install any available. </pre> <p>2. **Access Advanced Preferences**: </p><pre>  - In the address bar, type `about:config` and press Enter.   - You'll see the ""Proceed with Caution"" warning (matching your screenshot).   - Check the box for ""Warn me when I attempt to access these preferences"" if desired, then click **Accept the Risk and Continue**. </pre> <p>3. **Configure the Custom Provider for Grok**: </p><pre>  - In the search bar at the top, type `browser.ml.chat.provider`.   - If the preference exists, double-click it.   - If it doesn't exist, click the ""+"" button to create a new string preference named `browser.ml.chat.provider`.   - Set the value to: `<a href=""https://grok.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://grok.com/</a>` (or `<a href=""https://grok.x.ai/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://grok.x.ai/</a>`—both typically work, but `<a href=""http://grok.com"" rel=""nofollow"">grok.com</a>` aligns with your screenshot and SuperGrok branding).   - Click the checkmark or press Enter to save. </pre> <p>4. **Enable and Open the Sidebar**: </p><pre>  - Go to Menu &gt; Settings (or Preferences) &gt; General tab.   - Scroll to ""Browser Layout"" section.   - Check **Show sidebar** if not already enabled.   - Close settings.   - Click the **Sidebar icon** in the toolbar (it looks like a panel; if missing, right-click toolbar &gt; Customize Toolbar &gt; drag it in).   - In the sidebar, look for the **sparkle/AI chatbot icon** (or it may auto-load the chat interface). </pre> <p>5. **Access and Use Grok**: </p><pre>  - The sidebar should now load Grok directly.   - Log in to your xAI account if prompted (for full features like Grok 4 access or higher quotas).   - Start chatting via the ""Ask Grok"" input at the bottom.   - Optional shortcuts: Highlight text on a page &gt; right-click &gt; options like ""Summarize,"" ""Explain,"" etc. (Grok will process based on context).   - To switch back to a native provider later: Return to `about:config`, clear or change the `browser.ml.chat.provider` value, then select from the dropdown in the sidebar. </pre> <ol><li><ol><li><ol><li><ol><li> Troubleshooting and Alternatives </li></ol> </li></ol> </li></ol> </li></ol> <p>- **If Grok Doesn't Load**: </p><pre> - Clear the preference value and restart Firefox.  - Ensure no extensions block iframes or cookies.  - Try alternative URLs like `<a href=""https://x.com/i/grok"" rel=""nofollow"">https://x.com/i/grok</a>` if issues persist. </pre> <p>- **Reverting Changes**: </p><pre> - Set `browser.ml.chat.provider` to blank, or delete the preference.  - Native options will reappear in the selector. </pre> <p>- **Alternatives if Native Setup Fails**: </p><pre> - **Extensions**: Search Firefox Add-ons for ""Grok Sidebar"" or similar (e.g., dedicated Grok integrations exist, often free).  - **PWA Installation**: Visit `<a href=""http://grok.com"" rel=""nofollow"">grok.com</a>`, click the install icon in the address bar to add as a standalone app window.  - **Other Browsers**: Edge/Chrome have similar sidebar AI features (e.g., Copilot or extensions) with easier Grok support. </pre> <p>- **Implications for Daily Use**: </p><pre> - Great for multitasking (e.g., ask Grok about a webpage without leaving it).  - Enhances productivity but increases browser resource use.  - As an experimental feature origin, it may evolve—Mozilla could add official Grok support in future updates. </pre> <p>This method provides the most integrated experience matching your screenshot.

Firefox should not be wasting it’s time on these features in the first place, as it has been nothing but an active detriment to the user experience on every platform on which it has been implemented. Nobody asked for this. Nobody wants this. I installed Firefox because I saw that it was different from other browsers, mainly in the way that it was not following the latest tech fads straight off a cliff. If the new leadership decides to change that, then I see no reason to stick around. </p>",firefox-1460;windows-10;firefox;undefined;ai-feedback;offtopic;,firefox,undefined,en-US,1790487;1790575;,alcarazjaco

However, we're affraid of a backward syncing situation. How can we make sure we prevent that? </p><p>For example, say we worked on the desktop for a week, and then need to use the laptop. What should we do when we turn the laptop on and open ff browser, if we wish to sync from the desktop to the laptop? Do we press the Sync button on the laptop? - or will that force a backward synching from the laptop to the desktop? If that's the case, than how do we sync reliabely? And let's say the day after, from the now-updated-laptop to the desktop? Is the safest way to do it by turning the sync option off, and copying the bookmarkbackup folder from one updated computer to the other? </p><p>Also, this may complicate things a bit - We use the browser bookmarks in a non traditional way. It's kind of an archive for us. The .jsonlz4 file size in bookmarkbackups folder is 37MB. We remember reading somewhere before, the server backups stores files up to 10MB. So, question is, does the large size or the bookmarks file will affect the synching process between computers? </p><p>Thank you very much!&nbsp;:) </p>",firefox-14601;firefox-1460;windows-11;firefox;sync-configuration;,firefox,sync-configuration,en-US,1790544;1790550;1790554;1790559;,tef
