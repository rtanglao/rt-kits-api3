A few days ago, Firefox suddenly asked me if I wanted to create a profile. Since I had never used this feature in depth before, I selected the default “Original Profile” option. Since then, the profile name “Original Profile” has always been displayed in the tab title bar. I don't understand the point of this, but it causes me major problems because I manage my passwords using KeePass. To log in to the desired pages with Auto-Type, KeePass recognizes the tab title bar and automatically enters the data. Due to the above-mentioned change in Firefox, all my passwords are now useless because the profile name is displayed everywhere in the title bar and I would have to resave Auto-Type for all stored passwords (several hundred). This is very annoying. Why was this introduced and why is there no option to disable it? Very annoying!!!!! </p><p>When will there be a solution for this? </p>",firefox-1460;windows-10;firefox;browser-appearance;,firefox,browser-appearance,en-US,"",mailgerd

This provides a persistent chat interface without needing to switch tabs constantly. Natively, Firefox supports providers like ChatGPT (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), Claude (Anthropic), Le Chat (Mistral), and others through a dropdown selector. However, Grok (from xAI) is not included in the official list and must be added manually as a custom provider. </p><p>The screenshot you provided shows the standard Firefox ""Proceed with Caution"" warning when accessing `about:config` (the advanced preferences page), alongside an open tab at `<a href=""https://grok.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://grok.com/</a>` displaying the SuperGrok interface. This strongly indicates the setup process for adding Grok via a custom configuration tweak, which loads the full Grok web app into the sidebar (essentially embedding `<a href=""http://grok.com"" rel=""nofollow"">grok.com</a>` in a framed view). </p> <ol><li><ol><li><ol><li><ol><li> Requirements and Context </li></ol> </li></ol> </li></ol> </li></ol> <p>- **Firefox Version**: Version 133 or later (as of early 2026, most users will have a newer version; check via Menu &gt; Help &gt; About Firefox). - **Account Needs**: You'll need an xAI/Grok account (free or SuperGrok/Premium+ subscription) for full access. Logging in within the sidebar will persist if cookies are allowed. - **Limitations**: </p><pre> - Only **one** chatbot can be active in the sidebar at a time.  - Custom providers like Grok load the full web version, so interactions send data directly to xAI (no Mozilla intermediation, preserving Grok's native features like image generation, voice mode if available, or real-time search).  - Performance may vary; the sidebar uses an embedded view, which could consume more resources than native integrations.  - Privacy Implications: All queries go straight to the provider's servers. Review xAI's terms for data handling.  - Persistence: The setting generally survives restarts, but closing/reopening the sidebar or browser resets might occasionally require re-login. </pre> <p>- **Nuances and Edge Cases**: </p><pre> - If you're on a free Grok plan, usage quotas apply (higher with SuperGrok).  - Features like page summarization (highlight text &gt; right-click &gt; AI shortcuts) work if Grok supports context from the main tab.  - Mobile Firefox does not support this sidebar feature.  - If the sidebar doesn't appear after setup, ensure it's enabled in settings. </pre> <ol><li><ol><li><ol><li><ol><li> Step-by-Step Setup Instructions </li></ol> </li></ol> </li></ol> </li></ol> <p>1. **Update Firefox (Recommended)**: </p><pre>  - Go to Menu (three lines) &gt; Help &gt; About Firefox.   - It will check for updates automatically; install any available. </pre> <p>2. **Access Advanced Preferences**: </p><pre>  - In the address bar, type `about:config` and press Enter.   - You'll see the ""Proceed with Caution"" warning (matching your screenshot).   - Check the box for ""Warn me when I attempt to access these preferences"" if desired, then click **Accept the Risk and Continue**. </pre> <p>3. **Configure the Custom Provider for Grok**: </p><pre>  - In the search bar at the top, type `browser.ml.chat.provider`.   - If the preference exists, double-click it.   - If it doesn't exist, click the ""+"" button to create a new string preference named `browser.ml.chat.provider`.   - Set the value to: `<a href=""https://grok.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://grok.com/</a>` (or `<a href=""https://grok.x.ai/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://grok.x.ai/</a>`—both typically work, but `<a href=""http://grok.com"" rel=""nofollow"">grok.com</a>` aligns with your screenshot and SuperGrok branding).   - Click the checkmark or press Enter to save. </pre> <p>4. **Enable and Open the Sidebar**: </p><pre>  - Go to Menu &gt; Settings (or Preferences) &gt; General tab.   - Scroll to ""Browser Layout"" section.   - Check **Show sidebar** if not already enabled.   - Close settings.   - Click the **Sidebar icon** in the toolbar (it looks like a panel; if missing, right-click toolbar &gt; Customize Toolbar &gt; drag it in).   - In the sidebar, look for the **sparkle/AI chatbot icon** (or it may auto-load the chat interface). </pre> <p>5. **Access and Use Grok**: </p><pre>  - The sidebar should now load Grok directly.   - Log in to your xAI account if prompted (for full features like Grok 4 access or higher quotas).   - Start chatting via the ""Ask Grok"" input at the bottom.   - Optional shortcuts: Highlight text on a page &gt; right-click &gt; options like ""Summarize,"" ""Explain,"" etc. (Grok will process based on context).   - To switch back to a native provider later: Return to `about:config`, clear or change the `browser.ml.chat.provider` value, then select from the dropdown in the sidebar. </pre> <ol><li><ol><li><ol><li><ol><li> Troubleshooting and Alternatives </li></ol> </li></ol> </li></ol> </li></ol> <p>- **If Grok Doesn't Load**: </p><pre> - Clear the preference value and restart Firefox.  - Ensure no extensions block iframes or cookies.  - Try alternative URLs like `<a href=""https://x.com/i/grok"" rel=""nofollow"">https://x.com/i/grok</a>` if issues persist. </pre> <p>- **Reverting Changes**: </p><pre> - Set `browser.ml.chat.provider` to blank, or delete the preference.  - Native options will reappear in the selector. </pre> <p>- **Alternatives if Native Setup Fails**: </p><pre> - **Extensions**: Search Firefox Add-ons for ""Grok Sidebar"" or similar (e.g., dedicated Grok integrations exist, often free).  - **PWA Installation**: Visit `<a href=""http://grok.com"" rel=""nofollow"">grok.com</a>`, click the install icon in the address bar to add as a standalone app window.  - **Other Browsers**: Edge/Chrome have similar sidebar AI features (e.g., Copilot or extensions) with easier Grok support. </pre> <p>- **Implications for Daily Use**: </p><pre> - Great for multitasking (e.g., ask Grok about a webpage without leaving it).  - Enhances productivity but increases browser resource use.  - As an experimental feature origin, it may evolve—Mozilla could add official Grok support in future updates. </pre> <p>This method provides the most integrated experience matching your screenshot. If you encounter issues or need clarification on a step, provide more details! </p>",firefox-1460;linux;firefox;customization;,firefox,customization,en-US,1790574;,luke31
