I make backups of folder ""bookmarkbackups"" in Firefox profile folder, so that when I have to make a restore  after a data loss (for whatever reason), I can also restore my bookmarks. I'd like to be able to restore my extensions too, and to do this it would be enough to have a backup of the list of extensions I had installed before the trouble happened. However, if I backup the subfolder ""extensions"" of the profile folder, I would have a list of files the name of which looks like: </p><p>FirefoxColor@mozilla.com.xpi idcac-pub@guus.ninja.xpi uBlock0@raymondhill.net.xpi vpn@proton.ch.xpi {3d92ddc3-5581-453f-ad9f-d9ea864d1f9a}.xpi {531906d3-e22f-4a6c-a102-8057b88a1a63}.xpi </p><p>..so that in most cases I cannot guess the extension name from the file name. My purpose is to install manually the extensions in the new browser installation, once I have the list of the extensions. Moreover, in that folder you find all the extensions, both the ones which were active, and the ones which were inactive... But I'd like to have a list of the active ones so that I can re-install only that ones. </p><p>Does anyone know how can I get such a list, starting from the profile folder? </p><p>Many thanks in advance. </p>",firefox-1470;windows-10;firefox;extensions;,firefox,extensions,en-US,"",gplus.clean

I closed what I thought was my only open Firefox window then downloaded and installed the most recent Windows update. When I rebooted, I did not realize I had left a Firefox window open with a single tab. That Firefox became my default and I lost all the tabs I had. Is there any way to get those tabs back? The tabs I had yesterday, 1/22/2026 are the ones I need. </p>",firefox-14701;firefox-1470;windows-11;recover-data;needsinfo;,firefox,recover-data,en-US,1795924;,pam-raby
