I closed what I thought was my only open Firefox window then downloaded and installed the most recent Windows update. When I rebooted, I did not realize I had left a Firefox window open with a single tab. That Firefox became my default and I lost all the tabs I had. Is there any way to get those tabs back? The tabs I had yesterday, 1/22/2026 are the ones I need. </p>",firefox-14701;firefox-1470;windows-11;recover-data;needsinfo;,firefox,recover-data,en-US,1795924;,pam-raby

I have ""fixed this"" three times and because I am old, I have trouble following even though I have read the instructions.  Thanks","<p>I need a more permanent fix to the disappearing bookmarks issue when the file is in use by another entity.
