The resolution of my pc is 1600x900 however my browser, after entering into a full screen mode, turns the resolution in 1600x917 and I do not understand why it automatically assigns this resolution. I have tried turning off the fingerprint option but it did not help. My os is x64 linuxm distro is the arch linux, and I use the awesome window manager. I tried using the Librewolf and I had the same problem when entering the full screen mode. I've set the linux recently so I guess I have no settings that could have potentially be the cause of the problem. </p>",firefox-14601;firefox-1460;linux;firefox;browser-appearance;,firefox,browser-appearance,en-US,"",cherepkovanatalya45
