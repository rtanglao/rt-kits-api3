I have tried all of the conventional fixes including installing a new version but it doesn't seem to work.  In the meantime, I will use Safari and occasionally, up to an hour later, it will open and operate normally...until I restart my Mac at which point the whole process starts all over again.  But usually, I just get the finder message ""Firefox not responding""  </p><p>Please advise. </p>",firefox;launch-failure;,firefox,launch-failure,en-US,"",furrywill

Actions such as opening the wallet, switching networks, approving transactions, or interacting with dApps take a long time or freeze temporarily. </p><p>This issue occurs only in Firefox. MetaMask works smoothly and as expected on other browsers (for example, Chromium-based browsers) and all other websites and browser extensions load and function normally in Firefox. This suggests the problem is specific to the MetaMask add-on behavior within Firefox rather than general browser performance. </p><p>Impact: </p><p>Delayed transaction approvals </p><p>Lag while opening the extension </p><p>Poor user experience when interacting with dApps </p><p>Productivity impact when using Web3 applications </p>",firefox-1470;windows-10;firefox;extensions;,firefox,extensions,en-US,"",keepintouchwithroman
