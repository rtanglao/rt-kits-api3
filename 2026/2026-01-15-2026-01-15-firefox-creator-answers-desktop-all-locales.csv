Happens daily &amp; several times daily on a variety of web sites. The Symbols &amp; Shapes never cover an entire page, just small sections here &amp; there. Sometimes this problem fixes itself after a few minutes (meaning the Symbols &amp; Shapes vanish and normal letters &amp; words [in English] appear in their place). Sometimes I have to log in &amp; log out a few times before it goes back to being a web site with normal words &amp; letters (in English)... Sometimes, those areas - or patches - of symbols &amp; shapes on a web site page Never get fixed...even going as far as to make the page (and one time the whole website) unusable. The extent to which I find this whole thing very annoying is compounding. Thank you in advance for your valuable time and your consideration of a remedy to my problem.
