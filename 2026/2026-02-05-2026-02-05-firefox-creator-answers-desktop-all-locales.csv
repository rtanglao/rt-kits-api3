I am a long-time user of Firefox, but recently I have encountered a series of bugs.   </p><p>1. Initially, I couldn't access GitHub. On the same computer, Edge works fine, but Firefox fails to load the page. Sometimes, the page content loads in Firefox, but the layout is completely messed up, leading me to suspect that CSS files are not loading.   </p><p>2. I uninstalled Firefox, deleted the profile, and performed a complete reinstallation. This time, I couldn’t even open the Firefox account login page, receiving the error `SSL_ERROR_BAD_MAC_READ`.   </p><p>3. Following online advice, I set `security.tls.version.max` to 3, but the issue persisted. The error changed to `SSL_ERROR_RX_MALFORMED_SERVER_HELLO`. When checking the certificate, the common name was `<a href=""http://n.sni-347-default.ssl.fastly.net"" rel=""nofollow"">n.sni-347-default.ssl.fastly.net</a>`.   </p><p>4. Suspecting an issue with the system or browser certificates, I deleted all self-signed certificates and self-signed CAs (such as Fiddler and Accesser) from the system, but I still cannot access the site. </p><p>Please tell me, how should I go about solving this problem? </p><p><br> 您好，感谢您在繁忙之中拨冗阅读我的求助。 </p><p>我是Firefox的老用户，但最近发生了一系列的bug。 1. 最初是github无法访问。在同一台电脑上，用Edge可正常访问，但Firefox无法访问。Firefox有时页面内容可正常加载，但布局全乱，怀疑是CSS文件未加载。 2. 我卸载Firefox，删除配置文件，完全重装。这次连火狐账号登陆页面都无法打开，提示SSL_ERROR_BAD_MAC_READ。 3. 我按照网上的提示，设置`security.tls.version.max`为3，仍然无法加载，报错变为`SSL_ERROR_RX_MALFORMED_SERVER_HELLO`。查看证书，通用名称为`<a href=""http://n.sni-347-default.ssl.fastly.net"" rel=""nofollow"">n.sni-347-default.ssl.fastly.net</a>`。 4. 怀疑系统或者浏览器证书有问题，删除了系统内所有自签名证书与自签名CA（fiddler, Accesser）但仍然无法访。 </p><p>请问我该如何解决这个问题呢？ </p>",windows-10;firefox;web-certificates;,firefox,web-certificates,en-US,1798279;,1173368667
