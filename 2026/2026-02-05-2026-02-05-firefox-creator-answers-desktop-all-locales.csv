Stick with me. I administrate clubs and play chess there so open pages regularly, in new tabs, still generally only three simultaneously. </p><p>Every 1 in 5 times the page just gets stuck loading. Only parts appear and the little refresh icon up there doesn't show because the X stays (the one to stop loading the page). This is quite annoying. Simply by refreshing it immediately loads properly. But it is ridiculous to keep having to press F5 every couple of minutes before one can get on. As I also used Beta channel on my win11 machine I figured maybe it's that but after several updates it persisted. Now I am using the Normal channel and a Linux Mint OS and exactly the same keeps happening. I have tried a dozen remedies. Like adding an exception to the enhanced tracking in Firefox and several others and nothing fixed this. Does anyone knows how this happens? </p><p>And will Mozilla fix this?
