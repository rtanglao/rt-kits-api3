At best, it’s still an extra click to get to the address bar/search box, but it usually doesn’t register correctly at first so about a quarter of the time it does nothing, about a quarter of the time I accidentally click a link on the webpage instead, about a quarter of the time my phone thinks I’m trying to swipe up, and only about a quarter of the time it actually works correctly. </p><p>So many “UX” trends are way more about design/style/aesthetics. UX designers need to get over themselves and remember that the key word is USABILITY - stop over thinking it or changing stuff for the sake of changing stuff and make the product better instead. </p>",firefox;browser-appearance;,firefox,browser-appearance,en-US,"",69ggd8f5fc
