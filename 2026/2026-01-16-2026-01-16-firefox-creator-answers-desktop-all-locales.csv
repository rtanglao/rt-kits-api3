It does nothing when I click on ""Log in"" (I have a ChatGPT account), and the up arrow that you hit (or enter button) after asking a question does nothing (and the up arrow stays greyed out even while you are typing the question). I can use ChatGPT just fine on my Safari browser and iPhone. I used my iPhone ChatGPT to take me through steps to help, and it had me do several things (all of which did not work). These included: 1) refreshing the page/restarting; 2) open <a href=""http://chat.openai.com"" rel=""nofollow"">chat.openai.com</a>, clicked lock icon and clicked ""clear cookies and site data"" and reloaded the page; 3) did same and clicked on the shield icon and toggled off ""enhanced tracking protection""; 4) Went to file and ""new private window"", then <a href=""http://chat.openai.com"" rel=""nofollow"">chat.openai.com</a>; 5) went to ""about:support"" in Firefox and clicked ""refresh Firefox""; 6) Went to Firefox Settings, then Privacy &amp; Security, then Permissions, then Block pop-up windows, then clicked exceptions and added ""<a href=""https://chat.openai.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chat.openai.com</a>""; 7) Then to Firefox Settings, then Privacy &amp; Security, then Cookies and Site data, then manage exceptions, then added also ""<a href=""https://openai.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://openai.com</a>""; 8) Then changed enhanced tracking protection to Custom and unchecked cookies (cross-site tracking cookies) and restarted Firefox (I have since rechecked the box); 9) When I log into Firefox, it was showing a banner that read ""Your privacy matters. Firefox now securely routes your DNS requests whenever possible to a partner service to protect you while you browse."" Chat said to click ""Disable"" for this.; 10) After refreshing Firefox I chose (the 2nd time) ""Restore only the ones you want"" and opened a new tab. 11) At one point, I hit ""Log in"" for ChatGPT and the screen went slightly blurry and a new small rounded rectangular box (about 3 inches long) popped up, and Chat told me to hit the ""X"" to close that box, it then said to right-click on ""Log In', and to choose ""open link in new tab"", but that option was not available. Chat says Firefox is still failing to load the embedded login frame, even after refresh. 12) I logged into ""<a href=""https://chat.openai.com/auth/login"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chat.openai.com/auth/login</a>, and that still didn't work in Firefox, either. 13) Finally, I changed to Safari and successfully logged in. But I prefer Firefox as my main browser and want ChatGPT to work!  I've even tried adding it to my sidebar (the new feature), and the same problems are occurring. It won't let me log in, and I can't ask it any questions.  Help! &nbsp;:) </p>",firefox-1470;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,1794233;,debzmd

It just started today when using FireFox. On nearly all websites, including Mozilla support, when I click on an embedded link on a site, firefox asks me to select an app to open the https.  Even if I tell it to let firefox open all https, it still asks me everytime.  to make it better, it still doesn't always let me open the link and I go through the same thing when I click the link again. </p><p>This also happens when clicking on the search box in *any* search engine, e.g. Google, Startpage </p><p>See the image below. </p><p>I've attempted to change all cookie &amp; tracking settings, no help.  I even uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox. </p><p>This is making FireFox useless. </p><p>I had to use my default browser, Brave, just to submit this question. I only use FireFox for social media accounts, sites I need to link to my sm accounts and the occasional web search. For example, linking my Etsy shop to facebook.  When I clicked the link ""link to facebook"" is when I noticed this problem. </p>",windows-11;firefox;links;needsinfo;,firefox,links,en-US,1794115;,firefox3232
