Never got any message prior to this week. Situation is: I moved to a new city and can no longer see ANY of my passwords saved on Firefox. It's basically saying I have to change them ALL! Even if I tried, it's required to know the previous password to change the password on many, if not ALL the account passwords. The message says I was breached, but I wasn't.

It just started today when using FireFox. On nearly all websites, including Mozilla support, when I click on an embedded link on a site, firefox asks me to select an app to open the https.  Even if I tell it to let firefox open all https, it still asks me everytime.  to make it better, it still doesn't always let me open the link and I go through the same thing when I click the link again. </p><p>This also happens when clicking on the search box in *any* search engine, e.g. Google, Startpage </p><p>See the image below. </p><p>I've attempted to change all cookie &amp; tracking settings, no help.  I even uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox. </p><p>This is making FireFox useless. </p><p>I had to use my default browser, Brave, just to submit this question. I only use FireFox for social media accounts, sites I need to link to my sm accounts and the occasional web search. For example, linking my Etsy shop to facebook.  When I clicked the link ""link to facebook"" is when I noticed this problem. </p>",windows-11;firefox;links;,firefox,links,en-US,"",firefox3232
