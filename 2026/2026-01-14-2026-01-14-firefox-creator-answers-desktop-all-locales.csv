This page checks to see if it's really you sending the requests, and not a robot. Why did this happen?"".  This happens on Firefox, but not Chrome or Edge.  If I 'Allow' Google in the 'Exceptions - Cookies and Site Data' then I do not get the message, but it takes several seconds for Google display the resulting page. However, if I delete the cookies/cache the message will return and I have to redo the reCAPTCHA.  I have scanned with Malwarebytes, Bitdefender, Hitman Pro, Trend Micro House Call and Microsoft Defender, nothing detected. Running Win 10 (64) with 'Extended Security Updates', Firefox 147.0 (64), no additional Extensions or Plugins. Also I uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox. </p>",firefox-1470;windows-10;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",runkyrodo

Something happened to my Firefox about two weeks ago.  I was able to bring up Firefox which had all my bookmarks, passwords, etc.  What is different is that I can not bring up Firefox by hitting the icon in the dock.  If Firefox is already up and I hit he icon, it will jump to the front.  But not if it is sitting in the dock. </p>",firefox;launch-failure;,firefox,launch-failure,en-US,"",conradcohen

From my main page I open the Group in a new window, peruse the 14 tabs, then save and close the Group. If I re-open the Group in a new window during he same main session, the Group opens in a new window perfectly. If I shut down the computer and re-open my main page a day later, AND then open the Group in a new window, one of the Group tabs opens in the main window and 13 open in the Group window. I then re-add the open tab from the main window to the open Group window. Again, I get the same behavior with all 14 tabs opening in the Group window during the same session, but only 13 in the Group window if I shut sown the computer and re-open a day later. Anyone have a solution?? </p><p>Thank you! </p><p>--Rick </p>",firefox-1460;windows-10;firefox;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",taxmanrick
