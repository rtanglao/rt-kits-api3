If I shut down the computer and re-open my main page a day later, AND then open the Group in a new window, one of the Group tabs opens in the main window and 13 open in the Group window. I then re-add the open tab from the main window to the open Group window. Again, I get the same behavior with all 14 tabs opening in the Group window during the same session, but only 13 in the Group window if I shut sown the computer and re-open a day later. Anyone have a solution?? </p><p>Thank you! </p><p>--Rick </p>",firefox-1460;windows-10;firefox;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",taxmanrick
