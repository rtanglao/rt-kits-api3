I have multiple desktops with some Firefox pages open in some of them.  If I click a link in an email from desktop that does not currently have an open Firefox window, Firefox does open a new window on that desktop but instead of giving it the focus, the focus jumps to whichever Firefox window on another desktop most recently had the focus.  If I use the keyboard shortcut Cmd-Tab to return to the Mail and then Cmd-Tab again to switch back to Firefox, Firefox then gives the focus to the newly opened window on that desktop.  This is annoying and seems like a bug. </p><p>Thanks, </p><pre> Mel S. </pre>",firefox-1460;mac-os-x-1015;firefox;links;,firefox,links,en-US,"",mel.stampe

From my main page I open the Group in a new window, peruse the 14 tabs, then save and close the Group. If I re-open the Group in a new window during he same main session, the Group opens in a new window perfectly. If I shut down the computer and re-open my main page a day later, AND then open the Group in a new window, one of the Group tabs opens in the main window and 13 open in the Group window. I then re-add the open tab from the main window to the open Group window. Again, I get the same behavior with all 14 tabs opening in the Group window during the same session, but only 13 in the Group window if I shut sown the computer and re-open a day later.
