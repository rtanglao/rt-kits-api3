I am typing this question on DuckDuckGo browser because I was unable to go in. It will not let me search, open new tabs, refuse to open new tabs and even to click on settings. I also tried to delete it in an attempt to log in again but it won't even let me delete it. The image I shared is all I see. No bookmarks, shortcuts, ways to do settings and other things.

Something happened to my Firefox about two weeks ago.  I was able to bring up Firefox which had all my bookmarks, passwords, etc.  What is different is that I can not bring up Firefox by hitting the icon in the dock.  If Firefox is already up and I hit he icon, it will jump to the front.  But not if it is sitting in the dock. </p>",firefox;launch-failure;,firefox,launch-failure,en-US,"",conradcohen

From my main page I open the Group in a new window, peruse the 14 tabs, then save and close the Group. If I re-open the Group in a new window during he same main session, the Group opens in a new window perfectly. If I shut down the computer and re-open my main page a day later, AND then open the Group in a new window, one of the Group tabs opens in the main window and 13 open in the Group window. I then re-add the open tab from the main window to the open Group window. Again, I get the same behavior with all 14 tabs opening in the Group window during the same session, but only 13 in the Group window if I shut sown the computer and re-open a day later. Anyone have a solution?? </p><p>Thank you! </p><p>--Rick </p>",firefox-1460;windows-10;firefox;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",taxmanrick
