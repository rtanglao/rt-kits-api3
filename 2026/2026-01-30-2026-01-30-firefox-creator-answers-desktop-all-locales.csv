Antelope is my ""main"" account, but I use Bear for a lot of things too, which includes Gemini. So, if I want to use the Gemini chatbot option on Firefox's sidebar, it would make the most sense to use it under my Bear account, since that way I can access my previous chats and all that. However, when I open the Gemini chatbot, it automatically logs me in as Antelope. And when I click on the account's profile picture to swap to Bear, it instead opens the Gemini site on a new tab, in which I am indeed logged in as Bear, but the sidebar remains stuck on the Antelope account. I've tried the ""reload Gemini"" option, restarting Firefox, and clearing the cache, but nothing works. I think I could fix it by logging out of both accounts, then logging in only as Bear, letting the sidebar ""grab"" that account, and then logging in as Antelope, but I wanted to know if there's an easier/cleaner way to go about it.

First, I still can't get the History and Bookmarks to show, although for a while they did. On top of that, a new issue has developed. Firefox exe now shows on my desktop as well as where I actually want it, in the taskbar. When I try to move it from the desktop, the app is deleted from both areas. When I go back to my apps folder, where I choose to keep exe files, and create another shortcut to go in my taskbar, it gets put back on my desktop and the cycle repeats.  With all that nonsense going on for a month or more (I've really lost track of the days and hours I've spent on it), my question is should I just uninstall Firefox, reinstall it and then try to get my History and Bookmarks back. Or what would be a better solution? Whoever helps me with this mess has my sincere gratitude. I've used Firefox as my browser for many years without ever having any trouble and am baffled by what's going on now. </p>",firefox-14702;firefox-1470;windows-11;firefox;install;,firefox,install,en-US,"",nmbourne

I had a private window open and a regular window open and closed the regular one. When I reopened the regular one all of my pinned tabs were gone. This should be fixed, Firefox should differentiate between the windows and stop closing tabs on the regular window if it's closed before the private one. Kind of an odd thing. </p><p>I was able to recover my tabs with a json file thankfully but haven't been able to do so before as I had opened and closed multiple windows trying to figure out where the pinned tabs had gone and the ""previous.json"" had  changed to those new open tabs.
