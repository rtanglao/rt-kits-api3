1562979,2026-01-29 23:16:47 -0800,2026-01-29 23:16:47 -0800,Firefox exe issues,"<p>I'm afraid the community may be tired of me, but it seems this is the only help Firefox is willing to provide for my problems. First, I still can't get the History and Bookmarks to show, although for a while they did. On top of that, a new issue has developed. Firefox exe now shows on my desktop as well as where I actually want it, in the taskbar. When I try to move it from the desktop, the app is deleted from both areas. When I go back to my apps folder, where I choose to keep exe files, and create another shortcut to go in my taskbar, it gets put back on my desktop and the cycle repeats.  With all that nonsense going on for a month or more (I've really lost track of the days and hours I've spent on it), my question is should I just uninstall Firefox, reinstall it and then try to get my History and Bookmarks back. Or what would be a better solution? Whoever helps me with this mess has my sincere gratitude. I've used Firefox as my browser for many years without ever having any trouble and am baffled by what's going on now. </p>",firefox-14702;firefox-1470;windows-11;firefox;install;,firefox,install,en-US,"",nmbourne

I had a private window open and a regular window open and closed the regular one. When I reopened the regular one all of my pinned tabs were gone. This should be fixed, Firefox should differentiate between the windows and stop closing tabs on the regular window if it's closed before the private one. Kind of an odd thing. </p><p>I was able to recover my tabs with a json file thankfully but haven't been able to do so before as I had opened and closed multiple windows trying to figure out where the pinned tabs had gone and the ""previous.json"" had  changed to those new open tabs. It might also be nice to have a few ""previous.json"" files be created instead of the single one for instances like this. </p>",firefox-14702;firefox-1470;windows-11;firefox;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",nicholas.brewer90
