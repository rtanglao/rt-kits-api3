I have had a Firefox account for 15 years at least and a lot of information was in my folders and bookmarks. Please let me know how the information can be recovered. I tried to follow several of the instructions provided and was not able to fix the issue. I have a recovery code/Mozilla key, but I am not sure where or how to use it.  </p><p>I do all my work and personal stuff on Firefox so I need timely assistance to fix the problem. </p><p>Thank you, Mike </p>",firefox-1470;windows-10;firefox;recover-data;,firefox,recover-data,en-US,1797143;,mwmelso

That is the background for this post. </p><p>I'm using Windows 11 version 25H2, and my Firefox is up to date (147.0.2) </p><p>I hope there are some Mozilla employees working with Firefox in this community (as they have the most 'inside knowledge', but I would of course very much also hear about experiences and ideas regarding this from other Firefox users&nbsp;:-) </p>",firefox-1470;windows-10;firefox;history;,firefox,history,en-US,"",impure-ivy-clammy
