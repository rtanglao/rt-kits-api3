Antelope is my ""main"" account, but I use Bear for a lot of things too, which includes Gemini. So, if I want to use the Gemini chatbot option on Firefox's sidebar, it would make the most sense to use it under my Bear account, since that way I can access my previous chats and all that. However, when I open the Gemini chatbot, it automatically logs me in as Antelope. And when I click on the account's profile picture to swap to Bear, it instead opens the Gemini site on a new tab, in which I am indeed logged in as Bear, but the sidebar remains stuck on the Antelope account. I've tried the ""reload Gemini"" option, restarting Firefox, and clearing the cache, but nothing works. I think I could fix it by logging out of both accounts, then logging in only as Bear, letting the sidebar ""grab"" that account, and then logging in as Antelope, but I wanted to know if there's an easier/cleaner way to go about it. Thank you in advance. </p>",firefox-14701;firefox-1470;linux;firefox;customization;,firefox,customization,en-US,"",ansblox.nospam
