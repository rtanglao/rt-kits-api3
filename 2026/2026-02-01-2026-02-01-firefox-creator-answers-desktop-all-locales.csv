That is, if power management is inhibited by media playing on another tab while I play a game, it will get stuck in the inhibited state.  If power management is uninhibited while I play (no media playing), it will get stuck in the uninhibited state.  This persists until the browser is restarted even if all tabs are closed. </p><p>I don't believe it to be a system issue, as the problem clears as soon as the browser is closed.  Chrome based browsers do not exhibit the behavior for me, but I tried a Firefox fork (LibreWolf) and it has the same issue.  I don't experience this issue at any other website I visit. </p><p>Only certain areas of <a href=""http://lichess.org"" rel=""nofollow"">lichess.org</a> cause this behavior, primarily playing a game against a human opponent.  I tried progressively blocking media and script requests to narrow down offenders, but I always break site functionality before I can pinpoint anything. </p><p>I'm not so much looking for a solution (although that would be great) as I am troubleshooting advice.  Is there any way to narrow down exactly what it is about this specific website that is causing the issue? </p>",firefox-1470;linux;firefox;web-compatibility;,firefox,web-compatibility,en-US,"",tebeyiv477

But, there is an option on the bottom of the reader that is available when using Edge and is not available when I use Firefox. A mouseOver on Edge displays  ""Print or clip"". Yes, it's a snipping tool and/or print option. But it really right-sizes the snipped area perfectly for printing crossword puzzles. The Windows snipping tool (Windows 11) makes it too small so I need to go to Edge for only this one task. My first preference would be to get the function on the Firefox screen, and my second choice would be to figure out how to use the Windows snipping tool to print without leaving Firefox.
