Par exemple, le site &lt;<a href=""http://www.F1LVT.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.F1LVT.com</a>&gt; est composé de quelques pages d'accueil qui donnent accès à des liens correspondant à des articles en pdf. Quand on clique sur le lien, avec la version précédente de Firefox ou avec un autre navigateur, l'article est affiché sur une nouvel onglet. Avec la dernière version de Firefox, ça ne fonctionne plus, le navigateur n'affiche pas un nouvel onglet et l'article en pdf est directement enregistré dans le PC sans avoir été ouvert dans Firefox. C'est assez désagréable. Au lieu de visualiser les liens, il faut aller rechercher dans les téléchargements et les ouvrir ...

To select the tabs without the menu bar interfering, I <strong>need to be extra careful while using the pointer</strong>! I find this annoying. I went back to Chrome to see how it is managed. Chrome actually resizes the window and takes the tab one position down, when the menu bar pops out, in the full screen mode.
