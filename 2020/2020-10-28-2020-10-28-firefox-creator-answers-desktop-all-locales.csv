This thread here <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1224888"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1224888</a> has a link to the rapid release version but I end up in the same warning message. </p><p>Since the beta will necessarily always be a newer version than a release version, <strong>how do I transition from beta to a release version but preserve all my settings, add-ons and everything if Firefox will tell me that it won't let me use my existing profile in an older version, the release version?</strong> </p><p>My motivation to leave the beta version is that Firefox started having a bug since 27-Oct-2020 in Google meetings where either a shared screen or the camera image of the person in a meeting appears very zoomed in in the top left corner so it doesn't show the rest of the image. </p>",desktop;beta;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",riluma

Firefox's own search bar appears at the bottom of my screen. However, I want not Firefox's native search bar, but the PDF.js search tool. Firefox's search bar cannot search the entire PDF document. Instead, it searches only the currently viewed page or two. </p><p>I think this is a bug, and I would welcome any ideas or workarounds. Please let me know if I should post a bug report somewhere else. A cursory internet search didn't reveal any others reporting the same problem. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-810;firefox-8102;,firefox,other,en-US,"",sondrak

Is there a workaround that I can use now to be able to watch HDR videos in Firefox, or will we have to wait for it to be officially added? </p><p>Thanks in advance for the help. </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;firefox-820;firefox-8201;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",Williamguerrera2002
