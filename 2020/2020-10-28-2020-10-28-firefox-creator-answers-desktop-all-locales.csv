I then went and changed it after many tries and It still wont let me in. I can enter it as many times as I want and press enter and the box just comes back up. I am worried that by changing my password I have most likely just lost all my saved passwords. Do I just reinstall firefox? Or will the problem remain if I do so? A part of me doesn't want to reinstall if the problem will still be there, but this time, I won't be logged into anything at all. </p><p>And yes, I have tried most things I have seen in these forums, I am desperate. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",emmaismelon
