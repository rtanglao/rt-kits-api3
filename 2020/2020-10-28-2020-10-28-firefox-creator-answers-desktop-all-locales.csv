That way I can see twice as much, and all that space isn't wasted after the attribute. Is this possible here? I can tweak anything I need to - just looking for where to go. </li></ol> <p>Attached is the way it looks now, and a little excerpt mockup I made showing what I am hoping to achieve. </p> <ol><li> Secondly, is it possible to have the Layout and Computed tab consolidated into one tab?
