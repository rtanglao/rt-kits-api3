I followed the directions, and I  ouldn't find anything. I searched my computer and all my drives for json files and 'bookmarks', and I found backups from 2001, 2013, and I know I have backups 'older' than those on discs, but the ones missing (so far) are the most important and complete ones from the past 7 years. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but update 76 'seems' to necessitate syncing devices. I only have reason to browse on my desktop, so I didn't plan on syncing it with anything. I 'do' have a smartphone, but other than downloading malwarebytes and one other app, that I need, that's the extent of my 'online' activities on the phone. However, since I couldn't find my bookmarks without doing so, I decided to download Firefox onto my phone and try to sync them up. When I signed up for the Firefox account earlier, I changed my password with a password generator. However, my phone doesn't have all the characters on its keyboard that are in my password. You can customize the keyboard, but it looked like a magnificent pain to do so. Instead, it seemed easier to 'dumb down' my password from 40 characters down to around the minimum, at least until I got them synced. However, I tried twice with typing visible on the phone and it said the password was wrong, so instead of trying a third time, and getting locked out of Firefox - I came here to see if anyone could help me. I know that rebooting often corrects a lot of things, but since I don't have these bookmarks backed up anywhere - I was afraid this might be a case where it may make the bookmarks more difficult or impossible to retrieve.  Thanks in advance. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-81;firefox-760;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",Dystopian_Refugee

Nothing. </p><p>Yahoo mail still loads just fine in safe mode, but simply will not load in regular mode.
