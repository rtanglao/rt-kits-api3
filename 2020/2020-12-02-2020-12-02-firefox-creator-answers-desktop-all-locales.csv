Yesterday you asked again and i did again. But, at the same time, my texts are treated as if i am a «complotist». Surprise ; i know better than anyone i’m not. This is done unilateraly, as thieves yes without asking me. These texts are muy serious and respect laws.  If it by an delation i put words  that way « - » they are not mine. Otherwise, i’m good for money but not for texts. I don’t agree this at all …i do nothing for you dare blurring texts and i hope a change will come after these words. Thanks a lot  - GG  <strong>bold text</strong> </p>",desktop;other;windows-81;firefox-830;,firefox,other,en-US,"",guingant.gilbert

Firefox (v.83.0) runs fine until a few specific system daemons make contact with my computer, after which no page will load. The daemons in question are remindd, mediasharingd, touristd, and amsaccountsd. Normally HandsOff! sets my preferences for each process, to refer to when those processes attempt another connection. However, these four daemons' prefs do not remain in the settings, yet FFox still refuses to load. Not sure if all daemons are to blame, or only 1 or 2, but they seem related. Other browsers do not work either, but Tor Browser works fine! (which i'm using to send this msg.) My only remedy is to un-install and re-install HandsOff!. Then FFox and others work great until those daemons show up again. </p><p>I realize this is partially a HandsOff! issue, but i wish i could start a group email between developers at Mozilla, Tor, and One Periodic, to compare why Tor is the only browser to get through, and to overcome this block. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",woodstew

I followed the directions, and I  ouldn't find anything. I searched my computer and all my drives for json files and 'bookmarks', and I found backups from 2001, 2013, and I know I have backups 'older' than those on discs, but the ones missing (so far) are the most important and complete ones from the past 7 years. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but update 76 'seems' to necessitate syncing devices. I only have reason to browse on my desktop, so I didn't plan on syncing it with anything. I 'do' have a smartphone, but other than downloading malwarebytes and one other app, that I need, that's the extent of my 'online' activities on the phone. However, since I couldn't find my bookmarks without doing so, I decided to download Firefox onto my phone and try to sync them up. When I signed up for the Firefox account earlier, I changed my password with a password generator. However, my phone doesn't have all the characters on its keyboard that are in my password. You can customize the keyboard, but it looked like a magnificent pain to do so. Instead, it seemed easier to 'dumb down' my password from 40 characters down to around the minimum, at least until I got them synced. However, I tried twice with typing visible on the phone and it said the password was wrong, so instead of trying a third time, and getting locked out of Firefox - I came here to see if anyone could help me. I know that rebooting often corrects a lot of things, but since I don't have these bookmarks backed up anywhere - I was afraid this might be a case where it may make the bookmarks more difficult or impossible to retrieve.  Thanks in advance. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-81;firefox-760;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1372412;,Dystopian_Refugee
