After upgrading Ubuntu to current version, Firefox will not load Yahoo e-mail in regular mode. Just thrashes and does nothing. All other websites working fine. </p><p>Tried safe mode, and Yahoo mail loads just fine in safe mode. As such, I turned off hardware acceleration. Did not help. Then disabled the only extension I had on Firefox. Then outright removed extension. Cleared cache. Nothing. </p><p>Yahoo mail still loads just fine in safe mode, but simply will not load in regular mode. I can access the yahoo main page, but if I click into yahoo mail from there it doesn't load that way either. </p><p>Thanks for any help!! </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",dopperwall
