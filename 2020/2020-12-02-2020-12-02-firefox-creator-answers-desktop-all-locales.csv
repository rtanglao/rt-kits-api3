Everything is working fine but I don’t understand how the S3 server can initiate an upload from a client browser after the form data (file name, signature, policy, etc.) has been posted to its URL. The image data is in a file on the client device and is not contained in the form, only the file name is there. Where in the process is the upload started and how does the S3 server tell the client browser to upload the image data?  </p><p>Perhaps there’s more communication between the web server and browser during a post/response that I’m not aware of.  Perhaps AWS and Firefox have a WebSocket open to perform the file upload?  </p><p>Any insight would be appreciated. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,other,en-US,"",glez

In this regard, my question is, will this be fixed in future releases? </p><p>The second question is about ""dark themes"" on web sites. Web developers have finally figured out how to present their site in a user-defined color theme. For example - Youtube. If I open a Youtube page not with FireFox, it will define a ""device theme"" and show the page not in ""white"" but in ""dark"" version. It is very comfortable. Unfortunately, it doesn't work in FF.

I've changed my computer. I have 2 firefox accounts, the first for private browsing, the second one for work browsing, and I use them via different Firefox profiles. The configuration of the private account (adamsterbinszky@gmail.com) was succesful. But the configuration of the work account (sterbi@orfk.police.hu) was not. I've used this accounts since 2013, and I'd reconfigured them so many times, and there wasn't any problem until now. The actually problem is the unreceived verigfication email. I've tried the actions below: - checking email working -&gt; Perfectly works. - checking spam folder -&gt; There is no any mail in the spam folder. - adding accounts@firefox.com to contact list -&gt; Done. I did not get the verification emails. The administrators probably changed the security settings. I cannot log in, I cannot sync. I tried to send you this letter from my work e-mail, but I did not find any support address, just this option. How can I resolve this problem? Thans for your help. </p><p>Kind regards,  </p><p>Adam Sterbinszky </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-770;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",adamsterbinszky

Firefox (v.83.0) runs fine until a few specific system daemons make contact with my computer, after which no page will load. The daemons in question are remindd, mediasharingd, touristd, and amsaccountsd. Normally HandsOff! sets my preferences for each process, to refer to when those processes attempt another connection. However, these four daemons' prefs do not remain in the settings, yet FFox still refuses to load. Not sure if all daemons are to blame, or only 1 or 2, but they seem related. Other browsers do not work either, but Tor Browser works fine! (which i'm using to send this msg.) My only remedy is to un-install and re-install HandsOff!. Then FFox and others work great until those daemons show up again. </p><p>I realize this is partially a HandsOff! issue, but i wish i could start a group email between developers at Mozilla, Tor, and One Periodic, to compare why Tor is the only browser to get through, and to overcome this block. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",woodstew

I followed the directions, and I  ouldn't find anything. I searched my computer and all my drives for json files and 'bookmarks', and I found backups from 2001, 2013, and I know I have backups 'older' than those on discs, but the ones missing (so far) are the most important and complete ones from the past 7 years. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but update 76 'seems' to necessitate syncing devices. I only have reason to browse on my desktop, so I didn't plan on syncing it with anything. I 'do' have a smartphone, but other than downloading malwarebytes and one other app, that I need, that's the extent of my 'online' activities on the phone. However, since I couldn't find my bookmarks without doing so, I decided to download Firefox onto my phone and try to sync them up. When I signed up for the Firefox account earlier, I changed my password with a password generator. However, my phone doesn't have all the characters on its keyboard that are in my password. You can customize the keyboard, but it looked like a magnificent pain to do so. Instead, it seemed easier to 'dumb down' my password from 40 characters down to around the minimum, at least until I got them synced. However, I tried twice with typing visible on the phone and it said the password was wrong, so instead of trying a third time, and getting locked out of Firefox - I came here to see if anyone could help me. I know that rebooting often corrects a lot of things, but since I don't have these bookmarks backed up anywhere - I was afraid this might be a case where it may make the bookmarks more difficult or impossible to retrieve.  Thanks in advance. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-81;firefox-760;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1372412;,Dystopian_Refugee
