I've tried solutions suggested in other forums, with no success. It can happen randomly, like resting at night. BUT, very often, it happens right after I've clicked on some action in Firefox. My wife, with a similar machine, has the same issue. About the the only program we share is Firefox. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",dtmitch

As per the customer requeriment after we login into our application if the wesbite is idle for more than 9 minutes then the website should display a popup message from 9th minute to till it completes the 10th minute.  </p><p>Message:  If there is no operation for 10 minutes, the session will be expired. (remains 0 seconds). Do you want to continue. After it corsses the 10th minute, if the user didn't take any action then the session will log off automatically. </p><p>Current Staus: we have implemented a custom logic to achieve this funtionality, as per the requiremnent it is working successfully in all browsers except one scneario in Mozilla browser. </p><p>Issue: When we open our website ""<a href=""https://xxxx.xx.xxxx.co.jp/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://xxxx.xx.xxxx.co.jp/</a>"" in mozilla browser first tab the popup message is not coming until unless we activate the web page. Also this is an inconsistent behavior. Example 3 or 4 times once we are facing this issue. </p><p>Example:  as per the business logic website should display a popup message on 9th minute after it crosses 10th minute it has to logoff automatically, in this case if i come back to the web page after 15th minute as per the logic it should have been logoff the session, however here the popup message is coming up now. </p><p>Note:  when we test the same within localhost server it is working successfully, however when we promoted the same bundle into dev server environment it is not working as expected resulting an issue. </p>",desktop;tabs;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",psk.niru

It got really slow and laggy. Like multiple seconds of latency after I type to see the letters and tabbing fields. I cleared the cache hoping it would fix but still the same.  </p><p>Then I couldn't comment on Youtube or open the drop down under my Youtube account icon. It would just show a blank section with a spinning wheel. So I gave up and decided to reset FF.  </p><p>After I reset FF, I went to look for my extensions and addons to reinstall them and when I click on the Addons puzzle piece icon in FF, it opens up a new tab with a blank page (see attached) with the addons menu items on the left (Addons, Extensions, Appearance, Plugins, Services) and a white main page with a grey box that says What are addons? After explaining what they are, at the bottom it says ""when you are connected to the internet, this pane will feature the best addons for you to try out.""  </p><p>When I click the Extensions menu item on the left, it takes me to another blank page (screenshot attached) that says ""You don't have any addons of this type installed"" with a button that says ""Learn more about addons"". When I click that, it takes me to the previous page.  </p><p>The search box in the upper right yields no results no matter what I type in there. </p><p>How can I get to that page that shows all the different addons and extensions where I can search for the ones that I need so I can install them? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-560;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",roy2k
