I have gone into system preferences multiple times and selected the option to have Firefox restore session history, and when I simply close the Firefox browser, it does indeed save session history and all other data upon re-opening.  However, when the computer is re-booted, Firefox then acts as though it has never been opened before, opening a totally virgin version of the browser.  Why would it be wiped every time the computer is rebooted?  This is a business computer and we need the log-ins to be saved for multiple different sites.

It got really slow and laggy. Like multiple seconds of latency after I type to see the letters and tabbing fields. I cleared the cache hoping it would fix but still the same.  </p><p>Then I couldn't comment on Youtube or open the drop down under my Youtube account icon. It would just show a blank section with a spinning wheel. So I gave up and decided to reset FF.  </p><p>After I reset FF, I went to look for my extensions and addons to reinstall them and when I click on the Addons puzzle piece icon in FF, it opens up a new tab with a blank page (see attached) with the addons menu items on the left (Addons, Extensions, Appearance, Plugins, Services) and a white main page with a grey box that says What are addons? After explaining what they are, at the bottom it says ""when you are connected to the internet, this pane will feature the best addons for you to try out.""  </p><p>When I click the Extensions menu item on the left, it takes me to another blank page (screenshot attached) that says ""You don't have any addons of this type installed"" with a button that says ""Learn more about addons"". When I click that, it takes me to the previous page.  </p><p>The search box in the upper right yields no results no matter what I type in there. </p><p>How can I get to that page that shows all the different addons and extensions where I can search for the ones that I need so I can install them? </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-560;,firefox,customize,en-US,1362498;1362508;,roy2k
