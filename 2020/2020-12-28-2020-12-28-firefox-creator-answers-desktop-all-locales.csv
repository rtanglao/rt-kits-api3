Also, at the recently added programs there are there are two firefox icons. If I will press the one it opens the Firefox browser showing me signing in. If i will press the other icon it does not show me signing in. Is it a normal state. Can you figure out the two Firefox icons created. How can I delete the one?

Some lame excuse that you couldn't sync with only on computer with the browser.  Funny thing why would you want to sync if you only had one machine with the browser. Have a simple backup system would take care of any of that. Oh well I was stuck because the browser would not function and I followed through with downloading the program onto my iPhone and scanning the code.  It seemed to work.  The only acknowledgments is a continuing barrage of emails telling me ""someone is trying to log into my account.""  Yea that's me because I got asked a second time to set-up this bloody link.

Let me explain, I use mouse logitec g502 hero, now this mouse has some nice features that offer me to configure some buttons on it to work like switching tabs on browser when I have multiple tabs open, Its very easy to navigate like this on firefox, now since I installed latest version of firefox 84.0.1 64bit, tab switching dosent work anymore for me sadly, for example, if I open 3 tabs and wanna move from first tab on the left side to the second tab near it, it works, but if I want to move from second tab to the third one, it switches again to the first tab, like there is no third tab open at all, if I wanna go backwards and switch from second tab to first one again, it dosent work at all. Now I thought maybe its bug with my mouse software where I configure this things but no, in google chrome for example tab switching works perfectly and without issues, so it leads me to believe, something inside firefox got broken on new version and it causes issues  now??? Can I get some help on this, if its on my side? Its really huge handicap for me, if I need to go back and manually click on tabs in order to navigate through multiple tabs. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",creativboy666

In the past this has been incredibly helpful, because it allows me to review my lessons and improve my planning. </p><p>Current Issue: For some reason Firefox now appears to be misinterpreting these ZIP files as PDFs. When I begin the download, Firefox gives me the option to either open (as PDF) in Firefox, or to download. At this point (before any download occurs) Firefox has already labeled the file as a PDF. If I open it in Firefox, obviously it doesn't work (being a .zip folder.) If I download it, Windows Explorer usually lets me explore it as a .zip folder, but recently, about 10% of the files I download (even if I never open them as a PDF) still download as a PDF and are therefore inaccessible. </p><p>Fixes: I've tried downloading instead of opening with Firefox. This works about 90-95% of the time; not sure what the issue is. I've tried re-assigning the file type in Windows Explorer, to no avail. I've adjusted Firefox preferences (from ""always ask"" to ""use Windows Explorer."") I'm not sure this will help, but will try. </p><p>Any advice? I hate to sound fussy, but I'm pretty meticulous about saving my lessons and hate losing that much data on my students. While I can save each file independently, it takes much longer.

For the most part it works great, no issues. But once every 10 days or so, everyone at the entire plant gets booted from their remote desktop session.

This will repeat as many times as we try. </p><p>After some real-time troubleshooting, we have narrowed it down to Firefox. If I terminate all Firefox sessions on the server, the disconnects stop immediately and people can resume their work. Our next goal is to narrow it down to which website by closing users tabs one by one, but we have to wait for it to happen again and the entire company can't operate while we do this, so it is not an ideal troubleshooting method. </p><p>I am writing here just to see if anyone has any idea what might be causing this?

Then I noticed that on some sites audio was disabled when the video started, so I decided to investigate. After spending HOURS reading all the information, trying out settings described Firefox Support, browsing fora where similar / related issues are discussed, refreshing and - eventually - re-installing Firefox, I just cannot get it to work.  Until attempting to get this to work the way it did before, I had NEVER configured autoplay in Firefox options.   Not had I EVER configured autoplay for an individual website.  So, evidently, I don't understand it. Currently, Firefox 84.0.1 autoplay is set (in options, permissions) to Block audio and video but videos start automatically with audio. No settings for individual websites. What I want is that videos DO NOT start automatically but that audio IS enabled when I start the video. Can anyone advise me how to configure that? </p>",desktop;tips;windows-81;firefox-840;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",xoao

Changing this parameter worked well already. </p><p>How long will Mozilla provide these configuration parameters ""security.tls.version.max"" and ""security.tls.version.min"" in ""about:config""?
