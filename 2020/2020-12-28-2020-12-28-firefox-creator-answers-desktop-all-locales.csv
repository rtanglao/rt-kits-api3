I was getting it with Windows 7.  I only had 6GB RAM, so thought it was because I kept running out of RAM.

Figured since my systems do not run a web server, nothing should be using it. Nothing else was changed. </p><p>Browsing was slow after this and a lot of TLS handshakes showing up in bottom left of Firefox window. Enabled port 80 on the router firewall and browsing back to normal. Also, some pages would not load completely unless I disabled Enhanced Tracking Protection.  </p><p>Presumably there is some traffic using port 80 when web pages load that makes loading faster. </p><p>Seems that port 80 needs to be left open to avoid slowdowns from TLS handshakes. Appears that certificates is part or all of this issue.  </p><p>Can someone please confirm? </p><p>Thank you </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",gdavis74
