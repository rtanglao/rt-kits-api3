Then I noticed that on some sites audio was disabled when the video started, so I decided to investigate. After spending HOURS reading all the information, trying out settings described Firefox Support, browsing fora where similar / related issues are discussed, refreshing and - eventually - re-installing Firefox, I just cannot get it to work.  Until attempting to get this to work the way it did before, I had NEVER configured autoplay in Firefox options.   Not had I EVER configured autoplay for an individual website.  So, evidently, I don't understand it. Currently, Firefox 84.0.1 autoplay is set (in options, permissions) to Block audio and video but videos start automatically with audio. No settings for individual websites. What I want is that videos DO NOT start automatically but that audio IS enabled when I start the video. Can anyone advise me how to configure that? </p>",desktop;tips;windows-81;firefox-840;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",xoao

My question concerns the support of TLS 1.0 and 1.1. I have a rather old Netgear NAS within my network but it runs quite well. Access to it's web site requires one of the above TLS versions. Netgear has discontinued support for this device. I have found some web content which describes changing the TLS version in ""about:config"" of FireFox. Changing this parameter worked well already. </p><p>How long will Mozilla provide these configuration parameters ""security.tls.version.max"" and ""security.tls.version.min"" in ""about:config""? If ending availability of older TLS versions in FireFox, I will not be able to run my NAS any more - a very expensive consequence I think (NAS migration). </p><p>Thanks a lot in advance, stay safe </p><p>Guenther Gredy </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",guenther.gredy

I have Xfinity WiFi labelled 300 Mbps, but am getting speed test results using <a href=""http://all-nettools.com"" rel=""nofollow"">all-nettools.com</a> of 3 to 5 Mbps.  In addition to pages loading slowly, when I'm already logged into online stockbroker, clicks on ""quote"" button often result in ""request timed out"".  There was some recent ""upgrading"" work on cables in the neighborhood, but that supposedly finished in early Dec., before the degraded performance began (although on Dec. 15th - 16th, load time was so bad it was crashing my system).  Has improved somewhat since then, but still really slow.  Those 3 - 5 Mbps results were obtained just before I sent this.  Same test over the past week had been running in the 12 - 25 range.  I'm running the latest version of Firefox Browser on a Dell Latitude E6510 laptop with Windows 7 Professional SP 1 (64-bit), 8 GB RAM, Intel Core i7 M620 chip @ 2.67 Ghz.
