This after not having you tube settings at 1080p. Are we going to fix this problem or are we just going to keep ignoring it and focusing on the new latest and greatest or are you busy making like as many versions of firefox as there are linux distros lmao. Moving on papering over things and not fixing problems but instead creating and not finishing and polishing. It's getting pretty old and i am getting quite sick of the crashes please fix your broken ass dam browser and quit updating the sob if your not going to fix anything. </p>,windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-840;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",stihlman1737

On the old website the browser spell check worked fine on all text boxes. On the new site it only works in a few text boxes, in most it doesn’t work (the right click menu doesn’t even show a spell check option in those text boxes). I also noticed the same issue on the Ning creators website (which I believe is a Ning3.0 based site). </p><p>Also spell check is not available in the new facebook share pop up window’s text box. </p><p>Is this something that needs updated I the browser? </p>",desktop;websites;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",sewing12431

I have Xfinity WiFi labelled 300 Mbps, but am getting speed test results using <a href=""http://all-nettools.com"" rel=""nofollow"">all-nettools.com</a> of 3 to 5 Mbps.  In addition to pages loading slowly, when I'm already logged into online stockbroker, clicks on ""quote"" button often result in ""request timed out"".  There was some recent ""upgrading"" work on cables in the neighborhood, but that supposedly finished in early Dec., before the degraded performance began (although on Dec. 15th - 16th, load time was so bad it was crashing my system).  Has improved somewhat since then, but still really slow.  Those 3 - 5 Mbps results were obtained just before I sent this.  Same test over the past week had been running in the 12 - 25 range.  I'm running the latest version of Firefox Browser on a Dell Latitude E6510 laptop with Windows 7 Professional SP 1 (64-bit), 8 GB RAM, Intel Core i7 M620 chip @ 2.67 Ghz.  Any suggestions for:  1)  How to distinguish between ISP issues with Comcast vs. Browser/ OS software or laptop HW issues?  2)  How to improve performance, even if the main problem turns out to be Comcast ?

Figured since my systems do not run a web server, nothing should be using it. Nothing else was changed. </p><p>Browsing was slow after this and a lot of TLS handshakes showing up in bottom left of Firefox window. Enabled port 80 on the router firewall and browsing back to normal. Also, some pages would not load completely unless I disabled Enhanced Tracking Protection.  </p><p>Presumably there is some traffic using port 80 when web pages load that makes loading faster. </p><p>Seems that port 80 needs to be left open to avoid slowdowns from TLS handshakes. Appears that certificates is part or all of this issue.  </p><p>Can someone please confirm? </p><p>Thank you </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",gdavis74
