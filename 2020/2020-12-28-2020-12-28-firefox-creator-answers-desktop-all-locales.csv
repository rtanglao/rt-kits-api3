I would like each complete window to be dedicated to one general topic as follows: - 1.  Investment 2. Health 3. Internet Marketing 4. News and general research 5. At choice! Each window would also have 3 gmail tabs fixed at 1, 2 and 3. Could these windows be identified by a written title  or  a number  or a relevant colour on the top bar? When WIN 10 is first opened all 5 windows fly up together open, but when I examine them from the taskbar button the task bar images don't show any details of the fixed tabs on each panel.   Somehow this needs to be enabled for faster usage. Finally sometimes a video waiting starts automatically and I cannot see where it is  (i.e. in which window) .   Then the audio commentary begins and I don't know how to silence it because I don't know where it is.   And I am already trying to watch another video.   So how can I identify the temporarily unwanted and invisible video without having to examine every window? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Chancery

For the most part it works great, no issues. But once every 10 days or so, everyone at the entire plant gets booted from their remote desktop session. They can reconnect ok, but it will only stay connected for about 5 seconds, then it disconnects again. This will repeat as many times as we try. </p><p>After some real-time troubleshooting, we have narrowed it down to Firefox. If I terminate all Firefox sessions on the server, the disconnects stop immediately and people can resume their work. Our next goal is to narrow it down to which website by closing users tabs one by one, but we have to wait for it to happen again and the entire company can't operate while we do this, so it is not an ideal troubleshooting method. </p><p>I am writing here just to see if anyone has any idea what might be causing this?

Then I noticed that on some sites audio was disabled when the video started, so I decided to investigate. After spending HOURS reading all the information, trying out settings described Firefox Support, browsing fora where similar / related issues are discussed, refreshing and - eventually - re-installing Firefox, I just cannot get it to work.  Until attempting to get this to work the way it did before, I had NEVER configured autoplay in Firefox options.   Not had I EVER configured autoplay for an individual website.  So, evidently, I don't understand it. Currently, Firefox 84.0.1 autoplay is set (in options, permissions) to Block audio and video but videos start automatically with audio. No settings for individual websites. What I want is that videos DO NOT start automatically but that audio IS enabled when I start the video.

Recently, many of the old bookmarks don't work anymore. When I click on a bookmark nothing happens. I always have to click on it a second time. Only then the website gets opened.
