I have to manually set every single subdomain to also load in the same container. </p><p>Theres no way I've found to do this automatically. </p><p>All help, comments and feature request welcome in this regards. </p><p>Thank you all!

This is a trick to have <strong>THE TWO BEHAVIOURS TOGETHER</strong> Catch: AutoHotkey is required. </p><p>In Firefox Options/Preferences -&gt; General -&gt; Tabs"" mark enable recent order (ticked) Then compile the next script in Autohotkey and keep it running. </p> <hr> <ol><li>if WinActive(""ahk_exe firefox.exe"") </li></ol> <p>	^Q::Send, ^{TAB} 	^Tab::Send, ^{PGDN} 	+^Tab::Send, ^{PGUP} </p> <ol><li>if </li></ol> <hr> <p>Now with <strong>Ctrl+Tab</strong> and <strong>Ctrl+Shift+Tab</strong> you move right and left between Tabs and with <strong>Ctrl+Q</strong> you move to last viewed Tab. I choose Q because is next to Tab but you can change it in the second line of the script. Cheers! </p>",desktop;tips;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,tips,en-US,1369579;1369581;,bk11t763

Opening a new tab takes multiple seconds. </p><p>Navigating to the site (I have my start page hosted on AWS) on an existing tab is instantaneous, as is refreshing this page once the tab is loaded. So what gives? As far as I can tell Firefox doesn't install service workers on a per-tab basis, so there should be no issue here. </p>",linux;desktop;beta;tabs;firefox-840;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1369582;,devildude4427

How to force/bypass this beeep feature ?","<p>Hello, </p><p>Firefox is blocking some website because it says it's not secure (see picture). I don't give a .... So I want to access the website anyways. However, there is NO way to do that, NONE. I've searched everywhere. So I can only rely on you guys. How can I force the connection or bypass the F security, or get rid of it, or something... anything. </p><p>Here is a historic of my tests : My issue is simple. 2 days ago I could surf on some website completely fine. Then all of a sudden half my website get SO CALLED ""The connection has timed out"". </p><p>- Test server : So I go on the usual website-server-is-down to test if the server is down. The website itself is perfectly fine according to 5 testing website. - Test server 2 : Then I go through a ""browser inside browser"" website to test it again (dunno how it's called). I can access the main page then navigate fine on all test-browser. <strong>The website is therefore fine</strong>. - ""Not secure"" : Despite the viciously misleading message saying ""connection timed out"" that makes you believe the website is down and gone, it is actually fine, as proven above. It's just for some god unknown reason Firefox decided to block it, without telling you it's actually blocking it (nice move!). - No button : I searched but could not find a way to either force the connection or create security exception. I tried disabling all security in ""privacy"" tab in the option, no deal. - Certificate : I also went to try and add the website as an exception in the certificate list, but Firefox pretends it cannot connect to the website, therefore you cannot add the certificate. - Security.enterprise : I have removed the access from Avast to Firefox allowing me to unlock security.enterprise_roots.enabled. Once I had it unlocked, I tried either True or False, but no deal (including reboots comp &amp; browser) - I spent 4 hours searching solutions on the web, but couldn't fin any. Is Firefox actively preventing me for surfing the web as I like... ? </p><p>In the end, I still cannot access this website. And I wanna say to Mozilla : It's my own liberty if I want to go and shoot myself in the foot by visiting a so-called ""unsecured website"". I should be able to do so if I want to... </p><p>Anyway, if any gosu out there has the skill, please help ? ^^; Thanks </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-830;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1369573;1369584;,cyborga41
