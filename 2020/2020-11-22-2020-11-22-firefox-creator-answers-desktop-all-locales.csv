Other browsers are smart enough to remember when I forced them or just entered it 10 times and then it knew that I wanted that URL. </p><p>Is FF able to do this?

However, I notice a trend that if I have several Firefox tabs open for quite a while, it starts typing in some wrong characters. </p><p>A list of character errors it makes is: é appears when typing slash beside shift on the right side. è appears when typing the apostrophe symbol beside enter. à appears when typing slash above enter ç appear when typing the right square bracket ^^ appears when typing the left square bracket (does not type anything 1st try, then enters that the 2nd try. Or if pressing it once, then backspace, it enters ^) / appears when typing key to the left of 1 at the top. É appears when typing a question mark. @ is working right now, although it usually does not work when this occurs. </p><p>Restarting the computer fixes it every time. This EXCLUSIVELY occurs times I have at least a few Firefox tabs open. I first came across this in Windows 7. In Windows 7, it made those character errors in Firefox but entered the correct characters when typed in apps like Word and Excel. It only occurred around once per month, I got by it by typing characters in Word then pasting them in Firefox until I got a chance to reboot. They pasted fine, just typing them gave the character errors. </p><p>With Windows 10 though, it is more than 10 times worse. I get these errors nearly every day. And in Windows 10, once the incorrect characters start getting typed in Firefox they also type that way in apps like Word too. </p><p>In msconfig.exe, I disabled all non-Microsoft services and disabled everything in the startup list, but it continues doing this. </p><p>Anyone have suggestions what to do? I honestly think the most likely explanation for this is Google bribing Microsoft to make it like this to drive people away from Firefox to use Chrome. That way Google can micromonitor us that much better. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1369625;1369626;1369631;1369632;1369633;,crossr74

So I want to access the website anyways. However, there is NO way to do that, NONE. I've searched everywhere. So I can only rely on you guys. How can I force the connection or bypass the F security, or get rid of it, or something... anything. </p><p>Here is a historic of my tests : My issue is simple. 2 days ago I could surf on some website completely fine. Then all of a sudden half my website get SO CALLED ""The connection has timed out"". </p><p>- Test server : So I go on the usual website-server-is-down to test if the server is down. The website itself is perfectly fine according to 5 testing website. - Test server 2 : Then I go through a ""browser inside browser"" website to test it again (dunno how it's called). I can access the main page then navigate fine on all test-browser. <strong>The website is therefore fine</strong>. - ""Not secure"" : Despite the viciously misleading message saying ""connection timed out"" that makes you believe the website is down and gone, it is actually fine, as proven above. It's just for some god unknown reason Firefox decided to block it, without telling you it's actually blocking it (nice move!). - No button : I searched but could not find a way to either force the connection or create security exception. I tried disabling all security in ""privacy"" tab in the option, no deal. - Certificate : I also went to try and add the website as an exception in the certificate list, but Firefox pretends it cannot connect to the website, therefore you cannot add the certificate. - Security.enterprise : I have removed the access from Avast to Firefox allowing me to unlock security.enterprise_roots.enabled. Once I had it unlocked, I tried either True or False, but no deal (including reboots comp &amp; browser) - I spent 4 hours searching solutions on the web, but couldn't fin any. Is Firefox actively preventing me for surfing the web as I like... ? </p><p>In the end, I still cannot access this website. And I wanna say to Mozilla : It's my own liberty if I want to go and shoot myself in the foot by visiting a so-called ""unsecured website"". I should be able to do so if I want to... </p><p>Anyway, if any gosu out there has the skill, please help ? ^^; Thanks </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-830;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1369573;1369584;,cyborga41
