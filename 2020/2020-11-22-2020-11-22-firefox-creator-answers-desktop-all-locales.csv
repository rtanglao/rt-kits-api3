In other words, probably the latest update is causing the problem. </p><p>The address bar omits the last (or two) keyboard input when the search shortcut is used. For instance, I set ""ddg"" as the keyword for Duckduckgo search shortcut. I type ""ddg 파이어폭스"" on the address bar and hit enter. The browser shows the search result for the word ""파이어폭"". Sometimes instead of omitting the inputs, the browser simply ignores the search shortcut function.

I’ve been trying to follow the topics on the matter, such as the one named ‘Session won't load’ (questions/1254740), to no avail. </p><p>Finally, this time I remembered not to close Firefox when I saw my tabs where suddenly missing. I’ve never seen the ‘Restore the previous session’ on the Firefox menu, and neither did I this time. Without closing the browser, I did a backup of the ‘sessionstore-backups’ folder. It contains: </p><p>‘previous.jsonlz4’, from 22/11/2020 17:42 ‘recovery.baklz4’, from  22/11/2020 18:57 ‘recovery.jsonlz4’ from  22/11/2020 18:58 ‘upgrade.jsonlz4-20201027185343’ from 31/10/2020 13:42 ‘upgrade.jsonlz4-20201108180448’ from 10/11/2020 15:05 ‘upgrade.jsonlz4-20201112153044’ from 22/11/2020 10:34 </p><p>The one I need is ‘previous.jsonlz4’, since by 18:57 I’ve already lost my tabs. From the update backups I think I could also use the one from 22/11. In any case, I don’t understand what I am doing wrong so as to recover the ‘previous.jsonlz4’. This is what I’ve tried from different threads on my profile folder: </p><p>The ‘-backup’ and ‘OLD’ changes belong to different attempts </p><p>- Rename (on ‘sessionstore-backups’ folder) ‘recovery.jsonlz4’ and ‘recovery.baklz4’ to ‘recovery-backup.jsonlz4’ and ‘recovery-backup.baklz4’, and also tried with ‘recoveryOLD.jsonlz4’ and ‘recoveryOLD.baklz4’ - Rename ‘sessionstore-backups’ folder to ‘sessionstore-backupsOLD’ - Rename (on the main profile folder) ‘sessionstore.jsonlz4’ file to‘sessionstore-backup.jsonlz4’, and also tried with ‘sessionstoreOLD.jsonlz4’ - Copy/paste the ‘previous.jsonlz4’ file into the main profile folder.  - Rename ‘previous.jsonlz4’ to ‘sessionstore.jsonlz4’ </p><p>Nothing has worked. Once followed the steps, Firefox keeps opening my startup page. Note that it does not restore my previous session (that is, some tabs regarding this same subject), but my startup page, which means my attempts are having some effect, although not the desired one. I do have the ‘Restore previous session’ checkmarked in ‘Setting/General/Startup. </p><p>I also tried to replace ‘recovery.baklz4’ (on ‘sessionstore-backups’ folder) with ‘previous.jsonlz4’, from 22/11/2020 17:42, hoping to be prompted with the ‘Well, this is embarrassing’ + ’Restore’ window. I had no success. </p><p>I’ve been trying to recover my tabs for hour by now and don’t find what I am doing wrong. Why does Firefox refuse to load my ‘previous.jsonlz4’ file?  Am I missing something? Maybe ‘previous.jsonlz4’ is corrupted or something? Should I try to use the ‘upgrade.jsonlz4-20201112153044’ from 22/11/2020 10:34 file? (Although I would lose some information) </p><p>Some people talk about a ‘History &gt; Restore Previous Session’. I cannot find anything similar. </p><p>Thank you very much </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1369834;1369836;,delfion.815

I then set up a .desktop script in my ~/.local/share/applications folder (I use Ubuntu as my OS of choice) to open that profile along with an image for recipe sage so I can save the ""application"" to my launcher separate from the regular Firefox icon. It worked fine that way for years until just recently. it no longer works. I deleted and recreated the profile, open it, set the default page, close firefox and restart it and it just spins, never loads the page. If I set the default to the default firefox page and then go to the site manually it works but not if I save it as the default.

However, I notice a trend that if I have several Firefox tabs open for quite a while, it starts typing in some wrong characters. </p><p>A list of character errors it makes is: é appears when typing slash beside shift on the right side. è appears when typing the apostrophe symbol beside enter. à appears when typing slash above enter ç appear when typing the right square bracket ^^ appears when typing the left square bracket (does not type anything 1st try, then enters that the 2nd try. Or if pressing it once, then backspace, it enters ^) / appears when typing key to the left of 1 at the top. É appears when typing a question mark. @ is working right now, although it usually does not work when this occurs. </p><p>Restarting the computer fixes it every time. This EXCLUSIVELY occurs times I have at least a few Firefox tabs open. I first came across this in Windows 7. In Windows 7, it made those character errors in Firefox but entered the correct characters when typed in apps like Word and Excel. It only occurred around once per month, I got by it by typing characters in Word then pasting them in Firefox until I got a chance to reboot. They pasted fine, just typing them gave the character errors. </p><p>With Windows 10 though, it is more than 10 times worse. I get these errors nearly every day. And in Windows 10, once the incorrect characters start getting typed in Firefox they also type that way in apps like Word too. </p><p>In msconfig.exe, I disabled all non-Microsoft services and disabled everything in the startup list, but it continues doing this. </p><p>Anyone have suggestions what to do? I honestly think the most likely explanation for this is Google bribing Microsoft to make it like this to drive people away from Firefox to use Chrome. That way Google can micromonitor us that much better. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;escalate;windows-10;keyboard;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1369625;1369626;1369631;1369632;1369633;1369634;1369635;1369636;1369648;1369674;1369677;1369690;1369725;1369750;1369806;,crossr74

I have to manually set every single subdomain to also load in the same container. </p><p>Theres no way I've found to do this automatically. </p><p>All help, comments and feature request welcome in this regards. </p><p>Thank you all!

Opening a new tab takes multiple seconds. </p><p>Navigating to the site (I have my start page hosted on AWS) on an existing tab is instantaneous, as is refreshing this page once the tab is loaded. So what gives? As far as I can tell Firefox doesn't install service workers on a per-tab basis, so there should be no issue here. </p>",linux;desktop;beta;tabs;firefox-840;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1369582;,devildude4427

How to force/bypass this beeep feature ?","<p>Hello, </p><p>Firefox is blocking some website because it says it's not secure (see picture). I don't give a .... So I want to access the website anyways. However, there is NO way to do that, NONE. I've searched everywhere. So I can only rely on you guys. How can I force the connection or bypass the F security, or get rid of it, or something... anything. </p><p>Here is a historic of my tests : My issue is simple. 2 days ago I could surf on some website completely fine. Then all of a sudden half my website get SO CALLED ""The connection has timed out"". </p><p>- Test server : So I go on the usual website-server-is-down to test if the server is down. The website itself is perfectly fine according to 5 testing website. - Test server 2 : Then I go through a ""browser inside browser"" website to test it again (dunno how it's called). I can access the main page then navigate fine on all test-browser. <strong>The website is therefore fine</strong>. - ""Not secure"" : Despite the viciously misleading message saying ""connection timed out"" that makes you believe the website is down and gone, it is actually fine, as proven above. It's just for some god unknown reason Firefox decided to block it, without telling you it's actually blocking it (nice move!). - No button : I searched but could not find a way to either force the connection or create security exception. I tried disabling all security in ""privacy"" tab in the option, no deal. - Certificate : I also went to try and add the website as an exception in the certificate list, but Firefox pretends it cannot connect to the website, therefore you cannot add the certificate. - Security.enterprise : I have removed the access from Avast to Firefox allowing me to unlock security.enterprise_roots.enabled. Once I had it unlocked, I tried either True or False, but no deal (including reboots comp &amp; browser) - I spent 4 hours searching solutions on the web, but couldn't fin any. Is Firefox actively preventing me for surfing the web as I like... ? </p><p>In the end, I still cannot access this website. And I wanna say to Mozilla : It's my own liberty if I want to go and shoot myself in the foot by visiting a so-called ""unsecured website"". I should be able to do so if I want to... </p><p>Anyway, if any gosu out there has the skill, please help ? ^^; Thanks </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-830;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1369573;1369584;1369646;1369647;1369755;1369760;,cyborga41
