At first i thought something happened with firefox. Use Edge to log in an no problems at all. Coming back to FF at <a href=""http://chase.com"" rel=""nofollow"">chase.com</a> loads fine. As soon as i log in im presented with missing layouts buttons and no text.  Under the Network monitor i see that a lot of scripts and json files are blocked or empty(0 bytes). </p><p>Is anyone else experiencing this issue ? Prior version of FF worked just fine. What happened ? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-820;firefox-8202;,firefox,websites,en-US,1363145;,danibaies

I actually get over 700 on Opera, and about 550 on Chrome. With Firefox, I usually get about 280. I feel certain it is the browser - that is the only difference. Even wireless is fast. I have already tried different router ports, cables, disabling add-on's, etc. My version is up to date. I wonder if there is some setting I need to adjust to get the higher speeds. My preference is to stay with this browser, but not at the cost of speed. Appreciate any help! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-820;firefox-8202;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",blumbergjs
