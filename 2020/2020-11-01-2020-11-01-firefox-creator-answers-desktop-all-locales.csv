BUT unfortunately it didn't copy over the users folder which is where appdata is and I think where all the files I need are... But I have the folder in program files where firefox is installed. Hopefully that's good enough?? Because I had over 200 tabs saved. </p>,desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1363155;,valkyrie1

When the website loaded, there was a drop down question whether to allow ""8x8"" to access video and audio. When I typed ""allow"", Windows crashed with a stop code: Page fault in nonpaged area.   When I tried to link to the website with Microsoft Edge, the website again loaded and again there was the drop down question whether to allow access to video  and audio.  This time, however, when I answered ""allow"", the system did not crash.  What could be happening in Firefox? Thanks </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",jec4

1311182,2020-10-31 20:24:32 -0700,2020-10-31 20:24:32 -0700,Firefox Internet Speed,"<p>Renewed with ISP and now am getting ""up to"" 600 Mbps download speed. I have a wired connection. I actually get over 700 on Opera, and about 550 on Chrome. With Firefox, I usually get about 280. I feel certain it is the browser - that is the only difference. Even wireless is fast. I have already tried different router ports, cables, disabling add-on's, etc. My version is up to date. I wonder if there is some setting I need to adjust to get the higher speeds. My preference is to stay with this browser, but not at the cost of speed. Appreciate any help! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-820;firefox-8202;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",blumbergjs
