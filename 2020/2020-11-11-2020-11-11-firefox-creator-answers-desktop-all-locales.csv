Infelizmente abre essa janela flutuante que fica exatamente em cima das abas quando o meet usa a minha câmera, o meu microfone e quando compartilho a tela como na imagem em anexo. Isso atrapalha muito a navegação quando abro mais de uma aba, inclusive mesmo após minimizar o navegador essa janela permanece na tela sobrepondo outros aplicativos e isso tem me incomodado bastante. Há alguma forma de retirar essa janela ou desabilitar? seria de grande ajuda pois essa janela está sendo o único ponto negativo no firefox para mim pois particularmente é o meu navegador favorito. </p> <ul><li> Bulleted list item<strong>Sistema operacional:</strong> Ubuntu 20.10 </li><li> Bulleted list item<strong>Versão do firefox:</strong> 82.0.3+build1-0ubuntu0.20.10.1 </li></ul> <p>Agradeço a atenção! </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-820;,firefox,other,pt-BR,"",ryan.severo1107

Sending pages directly to a device works, and so does syncing Firefox Extensions. Bookmarks and currently open tabs, however, do not sync between Windows and the other two instances. Everything did sync at one point about a week ago, but no bookmarks or tabs have been received from my Windows instance since. </p><p>So far I have attempted uninstalling/reinstalling Firefox on my phone, as well as logging out on all devices and logging back in starting with the desktop, but the issue is still there. Notifications are enabled on my phone and I haven't changed Sync settings on Desktop, so everything should be syncing. Thanks for any help. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,sync,en-US,1366180;,berg.gibson
