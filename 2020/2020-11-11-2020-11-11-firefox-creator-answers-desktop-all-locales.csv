No error message. It's as though I never clicked it. It's an intermittent problem that arises on many sites. The worst thing is it usually fails on an activation like making a payment, logging in, or joining a site. You know, right when you most need the button to work. Then I have to switch to Edge. </p><p>I suspect it has something to do with Java or Javascript not being functional with Firefox. However, the news of the workaround hasn't reached me. I've had Edge as my backup when this failure occurs. If Java is such a security threat, it doesn't make sense to have me switch to a browser that handles Java. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,other,en-US,"",free3ist

If i do this when playing Fishing Planet my game freezes if i am gone too long then i must use task manager to restart my pc.I know this is not your prob but it is the Devs of FP that are doing that because they dont like it if you leave your avatar hanging in game with no movement.Well i apologise to no one about having to do that because i am away busy dealing with peoples lives. </p><pre>  Now that all just describes FP tactics but where it concerns you is that FP is also refusing to allow me to pause the Sim and go to other web sites which i also need to do regularly. So basically if i pause FP and then browse to another site it keeps crashing my FF Browser as if they are trying not to allow me to do that while their sim is open. Well as i said i work strictly to an emergency alarm and FP has no right to crash my browser. Of course they will deny it but i assure you my assumptions are correct and they need to sync better with you. Thanks in advance,im sure there are other E staff all over the world getting punished by FP for leaving their Sim paused and it needs to be sorted out between them and you. </pre>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mervward111111

Infelizmente abre essa janela flutuante que fica exatamente em cima das abas quando o meet usa a minha câmera, o meu microfone e quando compartilho a tela como na imagem em anexo. Isso atrapalha muito a navegação quando abro mais de uma aba, inclusive mesmo após minimizar o navegador essa janela permanece na tela sobrepondo outros aplicativos e isso tem me incomodado bastante. Há alguma forma de retirar essa janela ou desabilitar? seria de grande ajuda pois essa janela está sendo o único ponto negativo no firefox para mim pois particularmente é o meu navegador favorito. </p> <ul><li> Bulleted list item<strong>Sistema operacional:</strong> Ubuntu 20.10 </li><li> Bulleted list item<strong>Versão do firefox:</strong> 82.0.3+build1-0ubuntu0.20.10.1 </li></ul> <p>Agradeço a atenção! </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-820;,firefox,other,pt-BR,"",ryan.severo1107

Notifications are enabled on my phone and I haven't changed Sync settings on Desktop, so everything should be syncing.
