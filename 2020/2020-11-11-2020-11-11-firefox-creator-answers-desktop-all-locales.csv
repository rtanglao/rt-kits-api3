No matter what address I connect to (via a link or typing it in), down at the bottom of the browser I can see that a <a href=""http://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">google.com</a> address is stalled, not connecting, and preventing access to the connection - to the point of the connection timing out.   My ISP is functioning properly.  </p><p>I am not talking about links I click from  a google search, but any and all pages I access.   </p><p>In the first place there is no need for a google connection to be involved with the sites I am going to.   And in the second place is there a way to prevent what I am guessing is google tracking, since it seems to the problem that is timing out all my browser activity. </p><p>Thirdly, I installed Chrome, also, to use a specific add-on for a project I work on.  But the add-on did not do anything useful, so I uninstalled Chrome for that reason but also because there are clearly a lot of instances of telemetry that it does not appear  possible to stop since Chrome does not seem to be configurable.   </p><p>Of course there was a lot of Chrome junk that was not uninstalled.  I was wondering if that could be causing the problem.  So yesterday I made sure to get rid of as much of it as I could in the directory and the registry.  But it has not made a difference.   </p><p>I assume it is not a Firefox problem, since I use Cyberfox when a need a 32bit browers and have the same problem, though it is not as pronounced.  </p><p>Any ideas about what is causing the problem and how I can put an end to it are welcome.   </p><p>(I detest Windows 10 and how it dumbs down everything and prevents configuring, so continue to happily  use Windows 7 (and XP too) with a stable 40MB ethernet connection.

No error message. It's as though I never clicked it. It's an intermittent problem that arises on many sites. The worst thing is it usually fails on an activation like making a payment, logging in, or joining a site. You know, right when you most need the button to work. Then I have to switch to Edge. </p><p>I suspect it has something to do with Java or Javascript not being functional with Firefox. However, the news of the workaround hasn't reached me. I've had Edge as my backup when this failure occurs. If Java is such a security threat, it doesn't make sense to have me switch to a browser that handles Java. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,other,en-US,1366217;,free3ist

If i do this when playing Fishing Planet my game freezes if i am gone too long then i must use task manager to restart my pc.I know this is not your prob but it is the Devs of FP that are doing that because they dont like it if you leave your avatar hanging in game with no movement.Well i apologise to no one about having to do that because i am away busy dealing with peoples lives. </p><pre>  Now that all just describes FP tactics but where it concerns you is that FP is also refusing to allow me to pause the Sim and go to other web sites which i also need to do regularly. So basically if i pause FP and then browse to another site it keeps crashing my FF Browser as if they are trying not to allow me to do that while their sim is open. Well as i said i work strictly to an emergency alarm and FP has no right to crash my browser. Of course they will deny it but i assure you my assumptions are correct and they need to sync better with you. Thanks in advance,im sure there are other E staff all over the world getting punished by FP for leaving their Sim paused and it needs to be sorted out between them and you. </pre>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mervward111111
