PS...I was able to bookmark this page, but at least 100 bookmarks vanished.  Tabs &amp; Bookmarks are fine with Safari and Chrome.

If i do this when playing Fishing Planet my game freezes if i am gone too long then i must use task manager to restart my pc.I know this is not your prob but it is the Devs of FP that are doing that because they dont like it if you leave your avatar hanging in game with no movement.Well i apologise to no one about having to do that because i am away busy dealing with peoples lives. </p><pre>  Now that all just describes FP tactics but where it concerns you is that FP is also refusing to allow me to pause the Sim and go to other web sites which i also need to do regularly. So basically if i pause FP and then browse to another site it keeps crashing my FF Browser as if they are trying not to allow me to do that while their sim is open. Well as i said i work strictly to an emergency alarm and FP has no right to crash my browser. Of course they will deny it but i assure you my assumptions are correct and they need to sync better with you. Thanks in advance,im sure there are other E staff all over the world getting punished by FP for leaving their Sim paused and it needs to be sorted out between them and you. </pre>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mervward111111
