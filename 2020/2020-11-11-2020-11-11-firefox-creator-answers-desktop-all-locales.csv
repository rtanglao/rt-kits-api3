Sending pages directly to a device works, and so does syncing Firefox Extensions. Bookmarks and currently open tabs, however, do not sync between Windows and the other two instances. Everything did sync at one point about a week ago, but no bookmarks or tabs have been received from my Windows instance since. </p><p>So far I have attempted uninstalling/reinstalling Firefox on my phone, as well as logging out on all devices and logging back in starting with the desktop, but the issue is still there. Notifications are enabled on my phone and I haven't changed Sync settings on Desktop, so everything should be syncing. Thanks for any help. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",berg.gibson
