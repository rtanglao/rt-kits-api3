Unfortunately a) There is zero information here on actually using it and achieving any sort of acceptable results re: bookmarks, and b) It's complicated and it doesn't even import the bookmarks file. </p><p>I installed Zotero v 5. Have to also install Zotero for Firefox extension. This is hidden in documentation (one or the other does basically nothing, have to install both).  I tried to import FF bookmarks.html, it proceeded to use 50% of CPU resources, memory used by the program went up to 800 MB, and after 15 minutes the import bar was at 0%.  I tried to import the bookmarks.json file, it doesn't support it. </p><p>Any suggestions? </p>",windows-7;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-680;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",elzach

Ever since upgrading to Catalina  Firefox has been giving me problem.  When trying to start Firefox sometimes it starts right up.  Most times the icon just bounces in my dock.  sometimes after maybe 1 to 5 minutes it will start.  Other times it never starts.  I can't force quit it. </p><p>Just a while ago I went to open my Firefox and nothing.  Didn't move.  No dot below the icon in the dock to let me know it's already open. </p><p>Okay I keep a new dmg file so tried to reinstall it.  Error message says can't install because Firefox is in use. </p><p>Had to manually turn off the iMac and re-start for Firefox to open. </p><p>Too may issues here.  It all started when upgrading to Catalina.  Finally had to come here to try to find a solution. </p><p>No crash report because it's not crashing. just won't start or quit most times.
