I need BBB for meetings and online lessons. When activating audio, a little notification should show up, asking for mic access permission (i tried it on firefox on another pc and it worked there). However, on my pc, this doesn't happen. I also tried other websites where mic access is needed, but it's the same story: the pop up does not show up. </p><p>Microphone access is not disabled in the privacy settings; when I lookup the permissions on a page that requires a microphone, it says that there are no special permissions for the page.  </p><p>I also tried a different browser and it worked there, therefore I assume it's not in the windows settings (Firefox has permission to access the microphone). </p><p>I updated Firefox as well as Flash. </p><p><br> Any idea how to get this running? </p><p>Thanks in advance, m </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-820;firefox-8202;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",mariwe99

I don't understand why website like eBay and DuckDuckGo think they can change how I view there website becasue of my setting in Firefox. I completely understand that this may be a convenience for some people, my point is though if there is an option for it, where is the option against it! Some websites look terrible in dark mode! Also why do websites need so much information about my computer and browser when I visit them? Why can't I bock this as well? Why does a website need to know what operating system I run. My point is.. if it's not necessary for the website to work then it should not be shared. privacy! </p><p>Believe it or not, I'm a human and make mistakes. I like my free will. I like to make stupid and illogical decisions sometimes, I like to make mistakes, and learn from them. Why are algorithms trying to control my life?

I don't have that problem with Opera or Chrome, so it must be a Firefox problem. I like Firefox and prefer to use it, but this problem is disappointing. I'm surprised that no one involved with Firefox has solved it yet  (no disrespect to the volunteers who spend many hours trying to fix things). It must be a tricky problem.

Have to also install Zotero for Firefox extension. This is hidden in documentation (one or the other does basically nothing, have to install both).  I tried to import FF bookmarks.html, it proceeded to use 50% of CPU resources, memory used by the program went up to 800 MB, and after 15 minutes the import bar was at 0%.
