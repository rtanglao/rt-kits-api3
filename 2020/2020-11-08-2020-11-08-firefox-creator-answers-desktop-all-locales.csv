After recovering the backed up file in Show All Bookmarks is there something I can do to make this part of the permanent bookmark profile and not revert to blank each time it closes?

I don't understand why website like eBay and DuckDuckGo think they can change how I view there website becasue of my setting in Firefox. I completely understand that this may be a convenience for some people, my point is though if there is an option for it, where is the option against it! Some websites look terrible in dark mode! Also why do websites need so much information about my computer and browser when I visit them? Why can't I bock this as well? Why does a website need to know what operating system I run. My point is.. if it's not necessary for the website to work then it should not be shared. privacy! </p><p>Believe it or not, I'm a human and make mistakes. I like my free will.
