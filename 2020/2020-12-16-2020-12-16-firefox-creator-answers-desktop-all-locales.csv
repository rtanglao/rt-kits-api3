I mean I can click on the show password icon if I want to see it. Wouldn't someone simply be able to observe the password when it is displayed in regular text on my screen? Why doesn't the change password feature on my Firefox user account give me the option to ""generate a secure password"" in the first box, but the option shows up in the second ""change password"" box for confirming the password? Then it shows the new password so I can approve of it or something which seems to defeat the whole purpose of hiding the password in the first place. Doesn't seem all that secure and I'm no software or security engineer by the way. Maybe you can improve the security of the WIn 10 firefox browser a little. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ltigro

Since I upgraded I have had nothing but misery. Pages don't function normally. Windows will not display properly, no matter what I set them. Worst of all with any single window, or multiple windows, the slightest mouse movement outside the window and every window comes forward, then it recedes. Back and forth - again and again. If the mouse moves away from the window boundaries, up comes on another window - not the one I want top work in. If that's not distracting enough, I will move the mouse out of the immediate area, what I type does not appear on the page - it goes to some small pseudo search bar which means That the mouse is on the empty desktop. Etc. Etc. I've had it. Too much distraction and poor functionality. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-660;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1376222;,jesshenryes
