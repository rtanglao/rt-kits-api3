As I had already turned off the bookmarks toolbar because it used up unnecessary screen real estate, I am more than a little annoyed that a bar advertising something that I don't want, explicitly turned off, and no apparent way to remove, has suddenly appeared. If I am on a screen only 900px high, as one of the screens I use is, this is exceptionally annoying. Can it be switched off, and how? Adding unnecessary rubbish used to be the province of Internet Explorer. It would be a shame if FF followed that path. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",stardakev

Refresh Firefox."" So I did that. Then I added back the add-ons I want to use. The add-ons are installed and working. But there are no icons in the toolbar. There is no overflow arrow. Just a blank space where the icons used to be. I've searched for solutions for two hours now. Can't figure it out. </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-840;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",fastriver
