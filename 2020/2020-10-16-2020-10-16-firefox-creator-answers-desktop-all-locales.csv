Bonjour, Je rencontre quelques soucis avec l'usage de Firefox 81.0.2. Je suis abonné au journal ""<a href=""http://www.ladepeche.fr"" rel=""nofollow"">www.ladepeche.fr</a>. Je n'arrive plus, depuis 3 mois, à écrire un commentaire ou à lire les commentaires. J'utilise le webmail d'orange, je n'arrive pas à envoyer un fichier joint. Ces défauts n'apparaissent pas avec Microsoft Edge, ou Google Chrome, ou Internet explorer. Thunderbird me permet d'envoyer des fichier joints. Peut-être est-ce dû à la configuration de Firefox? Quelqu'un peut-il me donner une idée en espérant rétablir les fonctions perdues. Je le remercie par avance. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jean-marie.bransoles

I'd like my New Tab page to display my Bookmarks in the Highlights section. I only check the setting to show Bookmarks since what I'm looking for is something a bit like Speed Dial. The Highlights section can populate Visited sites just fine, but no bookmarks show up. My bookmarks are saved in the default Other Bookmarks folder. Safe Mode makes no difference. </p><p>This worked when I first set it up, but now the section is blank (again). It seems to happen after PC has been shut down, but I haven't tested that properly.

Of course sometimes its the website's fault.  Crosschecking with Process Explorer I noticed something odd.  In Firefox the Task Manager didn't show any great memory use but in Process Explorer it showed huge memory use.  How can there be such a discrepancy and which one is accurate?  I'd trust Process Explorer because the computer slowed down a lot when it showed a lot of memory use and as soon as I had closed a few tabs (not making much of a difference in Firefox's Task Manager but a huge difference in Process Explorer) all was fine.  I'm using a i5 CPU with 16gb DDR3 ram.  In almost every aspect the system is just fine, rarely showing its age.  But I'm diligent in watching for programs running in the background, always checking Services.msc and MSCONFIG for newly installed programs that have elected to run all the time in the background for no sensible reason. </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-810;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",moz2u
