I cannot find the site referenced in bookmarks. 1.1. Looked/searched manually running FF; 1.2. Saved all BM's to a HTML file (secured directory); then ran string searches (full and partial). ... Could not find it. 2. Tried to find reference to it at Avast (= failed, response bot is not designed for technical stuff - above finger painting or 'mud-pies' or 'how to change nappy'). 3. I have been working through my Firefox add-on apps - mainly because I think (fits logically) one of those is doing the site call (internal function) to this 'r-click' site ... thus far without luck. 3.1 I'm not young (though dementure might help that) - thus also have Seamonkey and Waterfox, etc., installed to look at/watch (progress, developments, teams talking, etc). As a rule all those have the same groupings of Apps/ext's - because I look at and rate those also. (have done, since the early Mozilla days). </p><p>The https:rclick.site/3LtGKV (phlishing) message/reaction does not come-up in Seamonkey, Waterfox or Tor browsers (using many of the same plug-in apps/ext's). </p><p>3.2 I was going to enter it in my firewall black list (added preventative), but would prefer to enter the actual calling application or URL; then report the same elsewhere. </p><p>Concluding and question. </p><pre>In theory - I think it is an extention or application 'calling home' - possibly innocently - in which case I would like to remove it, then report it (as either problematic or malicious - in the extentions &amp; apps reporting system). </pre> <pre>Thing is I cannot find it/what is causing it. </pre> <pre>It cannot damage me/my systems; however it can - if malicious - damage innocent/unsuspecting others. </pre> <pre>Thank you and much sincere grovelling ... for clever tips and thoughts you may wish to bestow, </pre> <pre>Be safe, keep well and keep smiling, </pre> <pre>Rick. </pre>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,other,en-US,"",richardvfinney
