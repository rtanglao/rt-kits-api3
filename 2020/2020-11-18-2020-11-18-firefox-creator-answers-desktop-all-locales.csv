Neither individual sent messages nor conversations that include sent messages. The message lists display fine, but when I try to open a message / conversation it only shows a blank page. Currently the version of Firefox on this computer is 83.0 (64-bit), although the problem occurs since the most recent versions. It only happens with Gmail. Yahoo! and AIM work fine. Doesn't happen in Chrome or Edge </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",omar456c

Will renaming the old profile the same as the new one work or do I have to down the route of installing an older version of Firefox to migrate successfully? </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",casualbutsmart

Firefox version  82.0.2. </p><p>For the last couple of weeks I have found that I am often unable to open many links on websites while using Firefox.  I click on the link and nothing happens.  If I hover over the link, I will see a URL in the bottom left of the page. </p><p>I have not found any particular pattern for what links work/don't work, it seems to be pretty random.   </p><p>I suspect this is something simple that I just am not aware of.  I'd really appreciate any ideas to get Firefox working correctly again.  Currently I am being forced to use Chrome on many of my usual sites where Firefox will not work. </p><p>Thanks in advance for your help! </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-820;firefox-8202;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",tomellisphoto
