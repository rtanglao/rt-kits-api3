But I've made a lot of changes to the tabs in those other 3 windows since I 'lost' the 4th one; so I can't just use that backup of all 4 windows, going forward now.  I need to recover that 4th window, into my current session. </p><p>Is there some way to make a copy of one entire window (with all its contained tabs with their titles and URLs) from one session, close Firefox, then open a new Firefox session and 'paste' those contents into a new (empty) window? </p><p>I downloaded the ""Copy All Tab Urls"" Add-on (by Michele Pezza), which allows me to copy that one window's 248 'lost' tabs (titles and URLs) to my clipboard.

I'm using a wireless headset and can hear the audio in steam/non-steam games, can talk to friends using discord and can play audio/video files that are stored on my HDD with no audio issues. </p><p>Here's what I've checked so far: </p><p>- Volume mixer says that FF isn't making any sound, which is odd. - I've turned off hardware acceleration as recommended on another thread, but to no avail. - I've restarted FF and my PC because sometimes it's just that simple. - I've tried other playback devices (computer headphone output, focusrite scarlett solo) and FF won't play through those either. - Just in case someone asks, youtube isn't muted. </p><p>I've isolated the problem to FF and considering that I hadn't changed any settings until after the problem occurred (hardware acceleration) I can't for the life of me figure out what might be causing this audio issue. Any help would be appreciated, but until then I'll have to use edge. *shudders* </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-760;firefox-7601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1373892;1373956;1373957;,adamjohnathanlee

To put it another way: lets say I have a 16:9 aspect ratio monitor and I'm watching video that is 21:9 aspect ratio, I'm going to see those ""black bars"" on the top and bottom of the actual video area (the content between the top/bottom bars). Well when this PIP bug I'm experiencing happens the previously maximized PIP window comes UN-maximized all on its own and locks in on the actual video area. The result is a broken PIP window showing video area w/ black bars removed stuck on the upper ~2/3 of my screen and the desktop visible behind it in the lower ~1/3. </p><p>Furthermore a secondary effect seems to be the disabling of the double-click that would normally restore a maximized window to its lesser size, aka double-clicking wont minimize I have to use the top-right [x] button to close the PIP altogether.  </p><p>So far I've experienced this problem on HULU, HBOMAX, and Amazon Prime Video. This bug presents randomly at any point during playback however I do notice it happening more often during the switching of opening production credit scenes that come at the start of a movie.  </p><p>Is there some setting I can apply that would just lock the PIP into a maximized state? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",sontst.chr

Before doing this I was logged into my Firefox profile and should have had my bookmarks and extensions synced. I do not see any reason why this would not be the case. However, after my reinstall of Ubuntu and logging into Firefox profile all of my bookmarks and extensions are gone. I tried checking around Firefox and it only shows bookmarks and extensions from after my reinstall. I have not performed a backup since I reinstalled Ubuntu, but those bookmarks are there. So I don't understand why I can't find my old bookmarks and extensions from before my Ubuntu issue, because I was logged into my Firefox account. My Firefox account information should have been saved to my account not my computer anyway.
