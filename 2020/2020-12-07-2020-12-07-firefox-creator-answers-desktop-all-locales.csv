(<strong>attached</strong>)  I contacted the bank Support, and they told me to clear the cache and try again, but that did not help either. I was able to get into my account using<strong> Chrome</strong> browser, but this is a constant thing with<strong> Firefox</strong>, that websites will not work properly for one reason or another, and I have to open a different browser to be able to complete my objectives. <strong>Firefox </strong>consistently complains about permissions to open websites that were working fine just this morning. Almost like it is random, or something.  As well, trying to use online chat in <strong>Firefox</strong>, is a joke, and I almost religiously have to go to a different browser to chat with anybody online. I have noticed that, for around the last year or so,<strong> Firefox</strong> browser has become less and less useful,and more and more tedious to use, which is leading me to think about changing my default browser to one that is more reliable. <em>I have been using <strong>Firefox</strong>, as my browser for many years now, and hope that it can be corrected somehow, because I do not want to switch to a different browser truthfully.</em> I do have addons, mainly ad blockers, but if I remove all addons, the same problems remain. Am I going to have to switch to a different browser that is more consistent, if I want to be able to have reliable internet usage, until you guys get your collective acts together, or what?? </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;firefox-830;,firefox,websites,en-US,1373853;,zlloyd2

Rather than between devices, I’m trying to sync between 2 profiles on the same Mac.  Is this even possible?  I’m using the latest Firefox 83.0 on Catalina 10.15.7 and and I need to sync only the history from the old profile to the new one.  The new one has everything I need set up except for the history (several years worth from the old profile).  After opening both profiles using the about:profiles page, logging in w/ each having a different device name, and selecting History only, I ran the sync but nothing transferred.  I found a log subfolder in the weave folder within the new profile folder and it shows a lengthy error report autosaved as a plain text file, but I received no error when doing the sync.  It shows ""FirefoxAccounts ERROR   Pairing channel error: Error: WebSocket unexpectedly closed"". </p><p>If I can’t sync between profiles how can I import/export just the history?  I tried doing a copy/paste and drag &amp; drop between profiles like you can with bookmarks but it didn’t work.  I read that history and bookmarks, along w/ other data are both stored in the places.sqlite file, so I can’t just replace the new one w/ the old one or I will then lose things I need. </p>",desktop;sync;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",shape5

I'm using a wireless headset and can hear the audio in steam/non-steam games, can talk to friends using discord and can play audio/video files that are stored on my HDD with no audio issues. </p><p>Here's what I've checked so far: </p><p>- Volume mixer says that FF isn't making any sound, which is odd. - I've turned off hardware acceleration as recommended on another thread, but to no avail. - I've restarted FF and my PC because sometimes it's just that simple. - I've tried other playback devices (computer headphone output, focusrite scarlett solo) and FF won't play through those either. - Just in case someone asks, youtube isn't muted. </p><p>I've isolated the problem to FF and considering that I hadn't changed any settings until after the problem occurred (hardware acceleration) I can't for the life of me figure out what might be causing this audio issue. Any help would be appreciated, but until then I'll have to use edge. *shudders* </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-760;firefox-7601;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",adamjohnathanlee

First, it was logging into Quickbooks.  Now I can't log in to my antivirus account, which is Kaspersky.  The issue is identical with both websites.  I can log in to these websites if I use a different browser, like Microsoft Edge.   If I try using Mozilla, the log in page will load, but after I enter my user name and password and hit the log in button the page just sits there and does nothing. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,websites,en-US,1373854;,Dobermiller

To put it another way: lets say I have a 16:9 aspect ratio monitor and I'm watching video that is 21:9 aspect ratio, I'm going to see those ""black bars"" on the top and bottom of the actual video area (the content between the top/bottom bars). Well when this PIP bug I'm experiencing happens the previously maximized PIP window comes UN-maximized all on its own and locks in on the actual video area. The result is a broken PIP window showing video area w/ black bars removed stuck on the upper ~2/3 of my screen and the desktop visible behind it in the lower ~1/3. </p><p>Furthermore a secondary effect seems to be the disabling of the double-click that would normally restore a maximized window to its lesser size, aka double-clicking wont minimize I have to use the top-right [x] button to close the PIP altogether.  </p><p>So far I've experienced this problem on HULU, HBOMAX, and Amazon Prime Video. This bug presents randomly at any point during playback however I do notice it happening more often during the switching of opening production credit scenes that come at the start of a movie.  </p><p>Is there some setting I can apply that would just lock the PIP into a maximized state? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",sontst.chr

However opening them up in edge chromium both files play back perfectly. Besides Edge I've also confirmed it plays back nicely in MPV. </p><p>I've tried Hardware acceleration, but both having it on and off did not change the fact that these files wouldn't want to playback in Firefox.

Before doing this I was logged into my Firefox profile and should have had my bookmarks and extensions synced. I do not see any reason why this would not be the case. However, after my reinstall of Ubuntu and logging into Firefox profile all of my bookmarks and extensions are gone. I tried checking around Firefox and it only shows bookmarks and extensions from after my reinstall. I have not performed a backup since I reinstalled Ubuntu, but those bookmarks are there. So I don't understand why I can't find my old bookmarks and extensions from before my Ubuntu issue, because I was logged into my Firefox account. My Firefox account information should have been saved to my account not my computer anyway. Please help me I had a lot of important bookmarks on there, but can't remember all of them. </p>",linux;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-830;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",sjschmidl
