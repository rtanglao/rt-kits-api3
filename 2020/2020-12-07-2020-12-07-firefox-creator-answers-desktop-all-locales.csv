Some are not able to what so ever, for example I've created a text video using this FFPMEG command:  ffmpeg -f lavfi -i testsrc=duration=10:size=1280x720:rate=30 testsrc.mp4  </p><p>which created the following file: <a href=""https://astolfo.nl/i/z2ada.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://astolfo.nl/i/z2ada.mp4</a> Both the uploaded version and the local .mp4 are unable to be played back in Firefox. However opening them up in edge chromium both files play back perfectly. Besides Edge I've also confirmed it plays back nicely in MPV. </p><p>I've tried Hardware acceleration, but both having it on and off did not change the fact that these files wouldn't want to playback in Firefox. Safe mode also did not effect this issue. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",dapal003

Before doing this I was logged into my Firefox profile and should have had my bookmarks and extensions synced. I do not see any reason why this would not be the case. However, after my reinstall of Ubuntu and logging into Firefox profile all of my bookmarks and extensions are gone. I tried checking around Firefox and it only shows bookmarks and extensions from after my reinstall. I have not performed a backup since I reinstalled Ubuntu, but those bookmarks are there. So I don't understand why I can't find my old bookmarks and extensions from before my Ubuntu issue, because I was logged into my Firefox account. My Firefox account information should have been saved to my account not my computer anyway. Please help me I had a lot of important bookmarks on there, but can't remember all of them. </p>",linux;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-830;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",sjschmidl
