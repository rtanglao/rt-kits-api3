First, it was logging into Quickbooks.  Now I can't log in to my antivirus account, which is Kaspersky.  The issue is identical with both websites.  I can log in to these websites if I use a different browser, like Microsoft Edge.   If I try using Mozilla, the log in page will load, but after I enter my user name and password and hit the log in button the page just sits there and does nothing. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",Dobermiller

I prefer FF and want to add back into FF all the new passwords and bookmarks &amp; etc that I created/added while using Chrome. Hence my question. And if yes, then shouldn't I totally avoid synching with my FF account as wouldn't that defeat the purpose of creating a new profile to avoid duplication? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,other,en-US,1373830;1373835;1373837;1373838;,lolaiii

To put it another way: lets say I have a 16:9 aspect ratio monitor and I'm watching video that is 21:9 aspect ratio, I'm going to see those ""black bars"" on the top and bottom of the actual video area (the content between the top/bottom bars). Well when this PIP bug I'm experiencing happens the previously maximized PIP window comes UN-maximized all on its own and locks in on the actual video area. The result is a broken PIP window showing video area w/ black bars removed stuck on the upper ~2/3 of my screen and the desktop visible behind it in the lower ~1/3. </p><p>Furthermore a secondary effect seems to be the disabling of the double-click that would normally restore a maximized window to its lesser size, aka double-clicking wont minimize I have to use the top-right [x] button to close the PIP altogether.  </p><p>So far I've experienced this problem on HULU, HBOMAX, and Amazon Prime Video. This bug presents randomly at any point during playback however I do notice it happening more often during the switching of opening production credit scenes that come at the start of a movie.  </p><p>Is there some setting I can apply that would just lock the PIP into a maximized state? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",sontst.chr

Some are not able to what so ever, for example I've created a text video using this FFPMEG command:  ffmpeg -f lavfi -i testsrc=duration=10:size=1280x720:rate=30 testsrc.mp4  </p><p>which created the following file: <a href=""https://astolfo.nl/i/z2ada.mp4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://astolfo.nl/i/z2ada.mp4</a> Both the uploaded version and the local .mp4 are unable to be played back in Firefox. However opening them up in edge chromium both files play back perfectly. Besides Edge I've also confirmed it plays back nicely in MPV. </p><p>I've tried Hardware acceleration, but both having it on and off did not change the fact that these files wouldn't want to playback in Firefox. Safe mode also did not effect this issue. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1373827;1373829;1373832;1373833;,dapal003

Before doing this I was logged into my Firefox profile and should have had my bookmarks and extensions synced. I do not see any reason why this would not be the case. However, after my reinstall of Ubuntu and logging into Firefox profile all of my bookmarks and extensions are gone. I tried checking around Firefox and it only shows bookmarks and extensions from after my reinstall. I have not performed a backup since I reinstalled Ubuntu, but those bookmarks are there. So I don't understand why I can't find my old bookmarks and extensions from before my Ubuntu issue, because I was logged into my Firefox account. My Firefox account information should have been saved to my account not my computer anyway. Please help me I had a lot of important bookmarks on there, but can't remember all of them. </p>",linux;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-830;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",sjschmidl
