I read the article that explains that if ""import from file"" does not appear on the ""logins &amp; passwords"" ""more"" menu (three dots) then, it means I have to go to about:config in the address bar and turn the feature back on.  I went to about:config only to discover that I do not know the name of the preference that I want to toggle. </p><p>Does anyone know the name of that preference? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,other,en-US,1358235;1358236;,angelos009
