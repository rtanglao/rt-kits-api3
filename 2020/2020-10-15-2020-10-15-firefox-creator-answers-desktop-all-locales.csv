Using curl on CLI just gives me a beautiful HTML response. </p><p>I understand that for the majority of users SSL is a good thing.

So my problem is I have to visit a lot of sites for research and every time get distracted by a cookie pop up that I have to accept or lose a lot of screen space. I have Asperger and was wondering, how to set in Firefox what kind of cookies I'm fine with and what don't, basically an API or standard or how you call it, browsers can communicate to cookie managing tools of websites automatically what cookies I want to set and what don't. Also I have some Wordpress websites, so I want to know if Firefos planes to provide a PlugIn for site owners so such automatic cookie settings can also work on my website. Maybe some sort of if-else states that the user of the browser can set, for example: </p><p>If website accepts that no cookie is needed - allow no cookies. </p><p>If Facebook Like Button is required of website - don't allow and inform me to search information on a competitor sites, via a Firefox pop up </p><p>If website allows to save my settings (like dark mode, layout option, ... - always allow </p><p>The problem with no automatic Browser wide solution is, in the heat of a work day, i just accept everything because I have no time to go in for every website and pick what cookies I want, and what don't. </p><p>Also I am a Designer not a Developer so I can't create such a prototype by myself, even if it would be beneficial for everybody. </p><p>What can I do, to get such a Feature, or does it already exist and if how is the API called so that I know how to search for if. </p><p>Thank you guys for this great Browser and have a great day </p>",linux;desktop;cookies;firefox-810;,firefox,cookies,en-US,"",hartmut.doering

Here is how. (and yes as an accident). </p><p>Original goal: get mobile bookmarks onto a saved html document. 1) On my notebook, I first Exported my notebook Bookmarks to html. I'd set them on the desktop. 2) Upon confirmation that the html document was there and filled on the desktop, I deleted my bookmarks. I would restore them later. This was to make way for the mobile bookmarks. 3) I signed into my firefox account on my notebook. I was signed into it on mobile, on the android. 4) I found the mobile bookmarks. I exported as html document.  5) I opened the html document, the second one. There was no content. ODD! 6) I then dragged and dropped the contents in the mobile bookmarks to the other bookmarks, because the would presumably work. When I would export them. 7) I exported them as an html doc to the desktop. Again, nothing in them. 8) This time around, after further inspection, the mobile bookmarks did drag and drop from mobile bookmarks to other bookmarks...but within the mobile bookmark folders nothing was there. This was not like the last time when there was bookmarks in the mobile bookmark section. 9) I check on my android device. The bookmarks had vanished. Presumably this was a sync feature. 10) I check the restore. These bookmarks, the mobile bookmarks, are not there. </p><p>I do not want this mild horror happening to anyone, and I hope that some volunteer takes this up as a project to fix. I am documenting this not to prove a point, but to hopefully help out the next person that this could happen to. I lost many, many important bookmarks. Maybe the next person could lose more. This could be a good project for someone that works on firefox, to check out this bug. I'm sure it's repeatable. </p>",desktop;sync;bookmarks;android;export;firefox-810;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",mikhailgolden
