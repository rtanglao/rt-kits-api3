I've already turned off the option in the settings menu and it doesn't normally do it but occasionally my pc will crash when I have 4-5 tabs open (though that's because I got a bit of a potato laptop because of not reading the fine print but that's neither here nor there) and when this happens and I go to reopen firefox it will try to open those few tabs at once which creates a cycle of my computer freezing up. I tried looking at a couple of firefox help articles and have been directed to this page  (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/restore-previous-session"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/restore-previous-session</a>) but I can't find the info relevant to my problem. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",thomas.loven1
