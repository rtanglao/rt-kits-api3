Here is how. (and yes as an accident). </p><p>Original goal: get mobile bookmarks onto a saved html document. 1) On my notebook, I first Exported my notebook Bookmarks to html. I'd set them on the desktop. 2) Upon confirmation that the html document was there and filled on the desktop, I deleted my bookmarks. I would restore them later. This was to make way for the mobile bookmarks. 3) I signed into my firefox account on my notebook. I was signed into it on mobile, on the android. 4) I found the mobile bookmarks. I exported as html document.  5) I opened the html document, the second one. There was no content. ODD! 6) I then dragged and dropped the contents in the mobile bookmarks to the other bookmarks, because the would presumably work. When I would export them. 7) I exported them as an html doc to the desktop. Again, nothing in them. 8) This time around, after further inspection, the mobile bookmarks did drag and drop from mobile bookmarks to other bookmarks...but within the mobile bookmark folders nothing was there. This was not like the last time when there was bookmarks in the mobile bookmark section. 9) I check on my android device. The bookmarks had vanished. Presumably this was a sync feature. 10) I check the restore. These bookmarks, the mobile bookmarks, are not there. </p><p>I do not want this mild horror happening to anyone, and I hope that some volunteer takes this up as a project to fix. I am documenting this not to prove a point, but to hopefully help out the next person that this could happen to. I lost many, many important bookmarks. Maybe the next person could lose more. This could be a good project for someone that works on firefox, to check out this bug. I'm sure it's repeatable. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",mikhailgolden
