The layout and a lot of functions (like play, full screen etc.) have changed or disappeared. The changes don’t apply in Firefox’s private Mode (and neither in Google Chrome nor on Firefox of my girlfriend’s laptop). I deactivated every single Addon and searched on google - unfortunately, I could not find any solution. Does somebody have an idea? </p><p>I have added two pictures where you can see the comparison between normal and private mode. </p><p>I have the latest version for Firefox and Adobe Shockwave Flash. </p><p>Thanks a lot in advance and enjoy your day, Simon </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",nils_goldi

Video  clips result in a ""MEDIA_ERR_UNKNOWN"" error. I have WebRTC disabled &amp; also run a VPN. With WebRTC enabled I can get the Movies to play, however the video clips still won't play. I don't have any issues in my Chrome browser, using the same VPN &amp; WebRTC apps. Firefox has been uninstalled &amp; reinstalled to no avail. Everything was working fine till the updates. Any ideas on how to get my video clips &amp; also my Movies to run in Firefox? </p>",desktop;other;firefox-810;firefox-8102;,firefox,other,en-US,"",pvdberg

When I updated to 68esr I set the value in the GPO to the same folder. about:config shows the preference as <em>locked.</em> </p><p>Recently I decided to move the cache folder to the same drive as the profile folder. So I edited the group policy to point to F:\users\Tanya\Firefox. Updated the group policy and opened firefox. It continued to use H:\Firefox. </p><p>So set the policy to not configured and about:config showed h:\firefox. So as a test I set the group policy to iamcountessconsuelabananahammock (Not even a valid path name). No complaints, but firefox continued to write to h:\firefox. </p><p>So it seems the only purpose of the group policy is to lock the value, and the content of the GPO is not relevant at all.

It would always redirect even if there was no server listening at port 80! Even, if I added query parameters like ?q=123456, it still did it. </p><p>I had set up the web server to listen on port 80 at 192.168.138.210 and I could never get firefox to load the http page. I created a simple node http server and the same issue occurred. I finally realized that it was the browser was doing the https redirect. I disabled all extensions and it still occurred. I tried  `Private Window` and the issue went away. Chrome was fine. I also tested `wget` and it was fine. </p><p>Once I realized the Firefox profile was the issue, I then cleared the cache in the browser and presto, problem went away. </p><p>I cannot repeat this error in Firefox so a Bug report is probably not warranted. In hindsight, I should have made a copy of the profile :( </p><p>Hope this information helps someone else avoid the pain of this and also a simple warning to those testing new web servers, don't assume any complex web browser is doing the right thing, use simple tools like wget or netcat to see whats going on at the lowest possible level before passing blame. </p><p>Here are a couple of goto *nix tests I have used: </p><p>Netcat trick to send a request to http://192.168.138.210:80/ % printf ""GET / HTTP/1.0\r\n\r\n"" | nc 192.168.138.210 80 </p><p>Handy wget script that gives all the necessities of more complex calls like https for troubleshooting certificate resolution etc.: % curl -v -I --insecure <a href=""https://google.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://google.com</a> 2&gt;&amp;1 | egrep -v '^&gt; |^&lt; |^{|^}|^* T|^* AL|^  0' </p>",linux;desktop;tips;firefox-810;,firefox,tips,en-US,1359122;,tim.c.quinn
