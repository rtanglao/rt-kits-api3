Is there a way, in firefox 81.0.2 (latest as of this post according to mozilla) to remove amazon and google from the ""top sites"" suggestions. For every other website, firefox lets you remove them from the list easily, but not with amazon or google. Ive removed it, deleted all history, clicked the dismiss button, the remove button, nothing, its still there. To prove that its an advertisement by firefox, even when I tried editing the link, firefox simply re-added the original one for me (how convenient!). Ive been with firefox almost 2 decades now, but if they are going to force advertising like this than obviously I need to look into other options. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1359340;1359346;1359351;,andrew.l.johnston
