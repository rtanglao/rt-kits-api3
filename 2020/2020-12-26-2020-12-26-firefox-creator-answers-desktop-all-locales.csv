They also couldn't be made to hold a site with the editing tool on each square, and nothing will bookmark. </p><p>I found a previous question about this from years ago, which was solved when the questioner verified that the History wasn't being created--it was blank--and the person answering the question said something about removing the ""places.sqlite database file"", which would then prompt Firefox to create a new file by that name, and track history and populate the Top Sites. An article was mentioned in that solution to help walk through the process, but I didn't see any link or reference to what that article was. </p><p>That exact same issue seems to be happening for me--my Top Sites won't load, won't be made to save anything, and I have no History despite the reinstall happening a couple of days ago--and this sounds like the solution may work for me as well but I've no idea where to find it or how to execute the recommended procedure. </p><p>Would anyone know where to find that article, or if there's an updated method to tackle the issue? </p><p>Related: I have Firefox on my phone and on another computer in the house, and I'd thought they would all sync up to share the same bookmarks, etc., but that hasn't happened. Is this connected to the same issue? Meaning, once the History/Top Sites/bookmark issue is resolved, will doing a Sync actually get my Firefoxes all talking together and sharing the same bookmarks? </p><p>Thanks for your time. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-81;firefox-840;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",reay.jespersen

Looking at Mozilla support link you sent me I see some very interesting <a href=""http://information.In"" rel=""nofollow"">information.In</a> particular the Technical scan which is being offered at a much lower price then the others. I was thinking because I do not use my laptop often it could have a free program run it and I will only use the Technical Scan for desktop.Telstra has not offered a solution so far therefore your future advice is greatly appreciated.Scanguard has not responded either. Hear from you soon. Merry Christmas cheers Don </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1378882;,CAMPBELLVN

I need to know what boxes are checked (if any) as default. I will not select Use default to find this out because I do not want my other settings to change to default. Can anyone tell me what the default setting is for this option?
