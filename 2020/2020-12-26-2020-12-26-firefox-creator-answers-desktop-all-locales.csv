I could not get many items running, and just had to start from scratch. </p><p>That being said, I surely do not recall that every time I clicked a link, it would open in a new tab. I mean, every single time. Who ever thought that was a good idea. </p><p>Anyone have a clue as to what's happening here? I usually only want a new tab to open when either I choose it as a right-click option, or when builders have invested it specifically in their code, as they know it will navigate away from their site, etc... </p><p>I would be most thankful to get this baby back running like normal. Your help is appreciated!  </p><p>Btw, fresh windows 10 install. The only extensions I have running are adblock, lastpass, blur, downloadthemall and new tab homepage (which just let's me determine the page address.) </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1378926;,davez18

I have an iMac, 2010 that is running UBUNTU 20.04 as a development platform.  Everything works pretty well (sound, WiFi, Monitor), but I get the error message above when running a certain application.  The same application works OK when using Chrome, although not sure that Chrome is actually using WebGL </p><p>I tried tweaking a few settings in the browser and when I go to <a href=""http://get.webgl.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://get.webgl.org</a> I get the little spinning cube that suggests that my browser supports WebGL, but I still get that error message with the App.  It might be related to the graphics drivers or my UBUNTU install, or the application software itself.  Just kind of curious if there is a fix for that.  I use the LINUX box mostly for development and I doubt there are a ton of people using FireFox on UBUNTU for web browsing, but not so sure about that. </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-840;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",sscotti

Turns out that's impossible but even inspecting its GUI structure with Xcode's Accessibility Inspector provided with no valuable objects aside from the main window, the menu bar and the ""traffic lights"" controls. May I kindly suggest for Firefox developers to extend the set of available commands and objects in Firefox's Dictionary to include basic classes and commands for manipulating link references, page loading etc?

System's font size is fine. But, the font size of Firefox's interface is so tiny. The font size of webpages are fine and I am able to change it in the Preferences.  </p><p>When I searched on Google, the other users having same problem recommended to add a 'userChrome.css' file with some code that specify the font size to the Firefox's folder. Then, I came to know that Mozilla has disabled the userChrome.css in recent Firefox versions. I also changed a setting in about:config to make the Firefox accept the userChrome.css. But, the font size is not changing yet.  </p><p>Please, guide me how to change the font size of Firefox's interface.

They also couldn't be made to hold a site with the editing tool on each square, and nothing will bookmark. </p><p>I found a previous question about this from years ago, which was solved when the questioner verified that the History wasn't being created--it was blank--and the person answering the question said something about removing the ""places.sqlite database file"", which would then prompt Firefox to create a new file by that name, and track history and populate the Top Sites. An article was mentioned in that solution to help walk through the process, but I didn't see any link or reference to what that article was. </p><p>That exact same issue seems to be happening for me--my Top Sites won't load, won't be made to save anything, and I have no History despite the reinstall happening a couple of days ago--and this sounds like the solution may work for me as well but I've no idea where to find it or how to execute the recommended procedure. </p><p>Would anyone know where to find that article, or if there's an updated method to tackle the issue? </p><p>Related: I have Firefox on my phone and on another computer in the house, and I'd thought they would all sync up to share the same bookmarks, etc., but that hasn't happened. Is this connected to the same issue? Meaning, once the History/Top Sites/bookmark issue is resolved, will doing a Sync actually get my Firefoxes all talking together and sharing the same bookmarks? </p><p>Thanks for your time. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-81;firefox-840;,firefox,customize,en-US,1378907;,reay.jespersen
