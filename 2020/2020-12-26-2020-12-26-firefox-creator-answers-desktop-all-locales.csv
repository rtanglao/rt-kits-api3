Turns out that's impossible but even inspecting its GUI structure with Xcode's Accessibility Inspector provided with no valuable objects aside from the main window, the menu bar and the ""traffic lights"" controls. May I kindly suggest for Firefox developers to extend the set of available commands and objects in Firefox's Dictionary to include basic classes and commands for manipulating link references, page loading etc? Thank you. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",ilja.shebalin

System's font size is fine. But, the font size of Firefox's interface is so tiny. The font size of webpages are fine and I am able to change it in the Preferences.  </p><p>When I searched on Google, the other users having same problem recommended to add a 'userChrome.css' file with some code that specify the font size to the Firefox's folder. Then, I came to know that Mozilla has disabled the userChrome.css in recent Firefox versions. I also changed a setting in about:config to make the Firefox accept the userChrome.css. But, the font size is not changing yet.  </p><p>Please, guide me how to change the font size of Firefox's interface.  Thanks in advance :) </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jeyaganesh

It seems to me they would be more secure if they also include special characters.  e.g. ! @ # $ % ^ &amp; *  Is there a way to include these in Firefox auto-generated passwords? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",PickerDad

They also couldn't be made to hold a site with the editing tool on each square, and nothing will bookmark. </p><p>I found a previous question about this from years ago, which was solved when the questioner verified that the History wasn't being created--it was blank--and the person answering the question said something about removing the ""places.sqlite database file"", which would then prompt Firefox to create a new file by that name, and track history and populate the Top Sites. An article was mentioned in that solution to help walk through the process, but I didn't see any link or reference to what that article was. </p><p>That exact same issue seems to be happening for me--my Top Sites won't load, won't be made to save anything, and I have no History despite the reinstall happening a couple of days ago--and this sounds like the solution may work for me as well but I've no idea where to find it or how to execute the recommended procedure. </p><p>Would anyone know where to find that article, or if there's an updated method to tackle the issue? </p><p>Related: I have Firefox on my phone and on another computer in the house, and I'd thought they would all sync up to share the same bookmarks, etc., but that hasn't happened. Is this connected to the same issue? Meaning, once the History/Top Sites/bookmark issue is resolved, will doing a Sync actually get my Firefoxes all talking together and sharing the same bookmarks? </p><p>Thanks for your time. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-81;firefox-840;,firefox,customize,en-US,1378907;,reay.jespersen

Looking at Mozilla support link you sent me I see some very interesting <a href=""http://information.In"" rel=""nofollow"">information.In</a> particular the Technical scan which is being offered at a much lower price then the others. I was thinking because I do not use my laptop often it could have a free program run it and I will only use the Technical Scan for desktop.Telstra has not offered a solution so far therefore your future advice is greatly appreciated.Scanguard has not responded either. Hear from you soon. Merry Christmas cheers Don </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1378882;,CAMPBELLVN
