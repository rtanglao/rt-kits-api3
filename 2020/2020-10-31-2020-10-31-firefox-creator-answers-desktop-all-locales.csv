I have CoolerMaster masterkeys keyboard and it has Play/Pause key that can be used by clicking Fn + Insert. Before the last update the function worked as it should - when I was listening to music using either Spotify or Foobar and used the play/pause key, it only had effect on those applications (even though I had Firefox open).  </p><p>Now, since last update, the shortcut also has effect on Firefox - for example I'm listening to music with Foobar and have a Youtube tab in Firefox with a video stopped and when I use the shortcut - play/pause is done on both of the applications - Foobar and Firefox. It is really annoying and unwanted behavior. </p><p>I'm not sure if it has something to do with Firefox. But maybe there is some kind of configuration that can be applied to mitigate this behavior? </p><p>I'm using Windows 10, just so you know. </p><p>Thank you, </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",dudek1337

When I go to print from various web sites, I get a print window pop up. It shows a full size page output.  Depending upon the site, the actual print output size varies from about 30 percent of the paper size to more than 100%, leaving some of the page overflowing. For example, when I go to print a Washington post crossword puzzle, it properly fills the page, without changing any setting, if I go to print the Wall Street Journal puzzle, it appears to be reduced in size by more than half. </p><p>If I close the pop up, and open the Firefox menu and click on the print icon, I get a page which shows the item to be printed, and I note that the scale option is set to 70%.  This apparently works fine for the WAPO puzzle, but renders the puzzle too small for the WSJ.  To get the WSJ puzzle full size, I have to change the scale option to 150%, which, of course, renders the output much to large.  Another site requires a 100% scale option to produce the proper size output. </p><p>I can find no way on the pop up print control to change the scale option or any way to make all of these sites print the proper size without changing the scale option. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,other,en-US,"",wclaiborn
