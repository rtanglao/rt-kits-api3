Can you please help?,"<p>The other day a few programs got downloaded by accident so I went to Control (Windows 10) and deleted them. I recall at the time that it also added an add on or two in my Firefox Browser. </p><p>A couple of things are not working normally when I do a Google search with Firefox so I thought I should go back and delete the add ons that went into my Firefox which I didn't want. </p><p>But when I now go to tools and down to add ons all I get is a blank page. </p><p>I suspect the problem can be answer by deleting Firefox from my computer and downloading from the start but that will delete all the add ons that I have in the past put into Firefox and I cannot remember them all except Add Block, Webmail Ad Blocker and Adblock Plus. </p><p>Can someone please advise me but remember I am old and not at all computer savvy so any help will have to be in very basic description or guide. </p><p>Please ??????? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-820;firefox-8202;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",avwood

For example, on this site: </p><p><a href=""https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/</a> </p><p>When I page down to the bottom and page back up, it takes 19 Page Down keystrokes to get to the bottom. It take one to four Page Ups to get back to the top, and each of the Page Ups varies in distance. </p><p>This happens on some other web sites, but not all. It happens on this forum. Sometimes it takes more Page Up keypresses to get to the top than it did Page Downs to get to the bottom. </p><p>I'm using Firefox 82.0.2 on Windows 7. It happens in safe mode. It does not happen on Linux Mint. </p><p>Is there a setting or change I can make to get this to work properly? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",bob197
