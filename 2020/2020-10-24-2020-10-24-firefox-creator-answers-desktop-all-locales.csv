The page actually does save but shows it as failed. If I double-click on the ""failed"" page in the Download history, the download history says that it saved, but if I open the re-saved page the re-saved webpage many times looks like a non-html page or simply only saves part of the page. This is puzzling in that if I ignore the false message that the page failed to save and open the page from my download folder, all looks fine.
