This started not too long ago, maybe a month or so. It happens randomly and disappears if I relaunch Firefox. Initially I thought that this only occurred when my computer is connected to an external display, I'm using an old MacBook Pro with an integrated Intel graphics chip. So I figured maybe it was struggling with the resolution of my external monitor.  But now it happened without it being connected to the monitor.

If I go over to Edge for the same page, the printout is complete and perfect. This has been my long-term experience of Firefox compared to other major browsers. I have already implemented all of the advice on good printouts on Firefox, margins and other settings and so forth.  When I posted about this issue perhaps two years ago, someone posted back that Firefox had never been designed to be a complete browser, and that printing had never been fully developed. I cannot know if that is a true statement, but I can say it fits the facts as I experience them.  I remain puzzled as to why Firefox would ignore major printing issues to this degree, unless there is just some internal viewpoint that printing is wasteful and rarely really needed. If I want to look at five mutual funds, I want to print out their basics and spread those printouts on the table and look at all five at once. The computer screen has a limited space and does not well allow for that, not in a time-effective way. Printing in moderation is very useful and important.
