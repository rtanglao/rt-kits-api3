I was recommended to sync another device during install, I did that too.  I worked for a few hours on firefox just now, then it crashed.  It reported data it had but now I have nothing.  No history, no bookmarks, NOTHING.  I logged in, my username and password worked find but it's like a fresh install, no data.  Over 10 years of history, hundreds and hundreds of pages and passwords all gone.  I synched to my phone as it insisted I install another device.  Supposedly that was done but I have no idea how to use that or what it can do.  They claimed it was a backup. </p><p>I'm at a total loss. </p><p>Andrew </p>",windows-7;desktop;sync;firefox-830;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",andrew126
