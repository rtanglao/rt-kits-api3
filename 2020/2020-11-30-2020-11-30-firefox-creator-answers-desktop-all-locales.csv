I access the administrative functions with UniFi Controller software which accesses those functions via <strong>https://localhost:8443</strong>. The Gateway Roouter itself is at 10.0.0.1:443, but cannot be administered at this address. </p><p>When I try to access the website, I get the standard Firefox <em>invalid security certificate</em> warning as the certificate is self-signed (image 1). Once I <em>Accept the Risk and Continue</em>, I can successfully log into the site. But once I quit my Firefox session, whenever I launch Firefox and try to access the site, I am again given the same <em>invalid security certificate</em>.  </p><p>Previously, I was able to create a <em>certificate exception</em> which bypassed that warning, but no longer.  </p><p>When I go into Firefox's Preferences : Privacy &amp; Security : Certificates : View Certificates page, I can see a <em>Temporary</em> exception (image 2), which presumably only lasts for the current session. I try to <em>Add Exception</em>, enter my localhost port number' (image 3), then click on <em>Get Certificate</em>. It tells me that I have <em>valid, verified identification. There is no need to add an exception</em> (image 4).  </p><p>And yet, every time I visit the localhost website, I am prompted with the warning. Any ideas of what I might do avoid this warning every time I want to access it? Is there some way to allow this device (or even ALL devices) on my home network to be trusted? </p><p>Also attached are images of my UniFi Certificate. </p><p>Thank you for any assistance. </p>",mac-os;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-830;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",mhwill
