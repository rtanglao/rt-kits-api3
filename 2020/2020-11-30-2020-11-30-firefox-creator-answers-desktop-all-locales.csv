I might just be an idiot but i can't seem to find any documentation on whether collections syncs between desktop and mobile; an indication that this is generally thought to be so obvious it needs no documentation. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-820;,firefox,other,en-US,"",levisjeans5

For instance, if I create 2 very simple and cut-down test files: Test1.html and Test2.html, that contain the following JavaScript: </p><p><strong>Test1.html</strong> window.sessionStorage.setItem (""html"", element.innerHTML); alert (""posting "" + window.sessionStorage.getItem (""html"")); window.open (""Test2.html"", ""_self""); </p><p><strong>Test2.html</strong> var html=window.sessionStorage.getItem (""html""); alert (""received "" + html); </p><p>then it works if the two files are in the same directory. But if Test2 is in a subdirectory, and I change the open call to: </p><p>window.open ("".\\subdir\\Test2.html"", ""_self""); </p><p>then it receives null instead of the HTML that Test1 is sending. I am guessing that there is some code that is treating the change of directory as a cross-origin issue, even though they're under the same root directory. </p><p>I appreciate that the specification may be a bit vague in this non-Web situation, but Chrome does what I would expect.

What can I do?","<p>Firefox had been telling me I needed to do an update for a couple of weeks. So like a fool, today of all days, I said yes. But I did look at what the update was going to do to make my final decision. It looked good so I said OK. </p><p>What it actually did was download the complete app and ask if I wanted to keep the old version as well. So I kept the older version (which had been up to date to this point) and opened the new one. It appeared to be totally ""plain vanilla"" with none of my bookmarks or windows, etc. I looked for my Bookmarks and all it had was some of my bookmarks from the Bookmarks Bar, none of my tons of years of important and properly organized bookmark folders. </p><p>I immediately quit, rebooted my computer, and went back to my older app - remember the one I did say to keep - and I got exactly the same behavior from it. I then completely trashed the ""new"" version and rebooted my computer again . . . then tried the older version . . . but that time things got worse. I did not even get the old Bookmarks Menu bar. </p><p>I then rebooted and went to my backup, brought back the copy from my last backup a month ago, and tried to run it. This time I got a message saying that opening the older version could destroy all my settings . . . but I did not care as I would rather go back a month ago than be where I am now! However, it would not allow me to open the older version because of the possibility of destroying . . . nothing! </p><p>HOW do I at least get back to my older version that would have probably 90% of my older Bookmarks/Folders and settings? I have that older copy and a full backup of my HD . . . but I do not know what, other than the Foxfire Application I need to look for and replace on my system. I assume there are some files stored in System folders that I need to replace, but I could not find them as I can't find anything in the Library or System directories that are identifiable as Firefox files. </p><p>All help appreciated . . . guess there will be no Cyber Monday shopping for me! </p><p>Thanks! </p>",mac-os;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-830;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1371775;1371776;,kfairey
