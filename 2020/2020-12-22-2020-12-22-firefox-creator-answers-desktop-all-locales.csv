I restored a Windows system image made October 15th, that had Firefox version 81.0.2 (64-bit).  The error message does not occur there using the same application software that does receive the error. </p><p>The error message doesn't seem to cause any issues.  The 4 video streams still play normally.  Does this error message indicate that there is a latent error in my application code that I need to resolve?  Can you give an ideas what might be the cause of the issue?  Thanks for any help in advance. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",mcwetzel158
