Attempts to navigate to to most sites cause the tab to disappear altogether, as do attempts to click on links to pages within sites such as Amazon. I had never seen any of these problems in my previous versions of Firefox extending back well over 15 years. Attempting to navigate to these same locations within Edge encounters no problems at all, leading me to infer that the problem is within this version of Firefox. Worse still, all my attempts to revert to an earlier version, using either the .msi or .exe file, fail to run. They begin execution and then just cease executing without a trace. I have tried version 79, 78, 77, and 76 with the same result. I have tried turning off my antivirus protection with no effect. I am about to become a disgusted former user of Firefox unless I can get some help here quickly. </p><p>Thanks for any help that might be offered here. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jskprivate

I use a program called Audioswitch to switch between speakers/headset at the touch of a keybind.  I uninstalled and tried refreshing firefox but I still come across the issue where I switch from my headset to my speakers and the audio still only comes out of my headset.  On other browsers, i can switch it manually from windows and they all work just fine.   </p><p>So far I've uninstalled all extra apps such as audioswitch, voicemeeter banana (this issue did start within the same hour I installed and started messing around with this program, haha), and sounswitch (another program like audioswitch). </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",riveroselliott

Received a message at the bottom of Firefox screen asking if I wanted to speed-up Firefox press this button. Pressed button not realizing it would reset Firefox software losing all of my history, presets, etc. All of my passwords, including important banking,unemployment commission passwords and presets, education, everything all are missing. There was no warning or message stating that DATA MAY BE LOST or how to save information or locate previously saved presets or websites.  In essence: I'm screwed.  Spent hours going through everything I could think of on the Firefox website looking for ways to restore the data file so I could access/transfer passwords and bookmarks to current version of Firefox.  Any suggestions and or help would be greatly appreciated. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,1377820;,jaybwn
