Strangely though, whenever I would try to open these windows, they would briefly display the animation of expanding onto my screen, but then would immediately disappear. This animation only happened the first time for each windows. I cannot interact with these invisible windows in any way. They still exist when I right-click Firefox to see my list of windows. So they aren't gone. Moreover, whenever I try to open one of these windows on top another program (i.e. Spotify) that program will go ""dull"" (literally darken its look) and my Macbook's top bar will switch to Firefox. It's the strangest thing. There was only 1 of the 7 windows that actually appeared when I clicked them all, and that window was one that I had adjusted to fill only half my screen. All the others were full-screen windows. Perhaps this is telling in some way? I have already attempted to restart my computer and I also quit Firefox and started it up anew.
