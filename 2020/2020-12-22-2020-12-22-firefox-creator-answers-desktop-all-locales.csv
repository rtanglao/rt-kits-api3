I use a program called Audioswitch to switch between speakers/headset at the touch of a keybind.  I uninstalled and tried refreshing firefox but I still come across the issue where I switch from my headset to my speakers and the audio still only comes out of my headset.  On other browsers, i can switch it manually from windows and they all work just fine.   </p><p>So far I've uninstalled all extra apps such as audioswitch, voicemeeter banana (this issue did start within the same hour I installed and started messing around with this program, haha), and sounswitch (another program like audioswitch). </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",riveroselliott

Received a message at the bottom of Firefox screen asking if I wanted to speed-up Firefox press this button. Pressed button not realizing it would reset Firefox software losing all of my history, presets, etc. All of my passwords, including important banking,unemployment commission passwords and presets, education, everything all are missing. There was no warning or message stating that DATA MAY BE LOST or how to save information or locate previously saved presets or websites.  In essence: I'm screwed.  Spent hours going through everything I could think of on the Firefox website looking for ways to restore the data file so I could access/transfer passwords and bookmarks to current version of Firefox.  Any suggestions and or help would be greatly appreciated. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,1377820;,jaybwn
