(then I just rotate the file to landscape on Preview or PDFexpert to read the presentation).   </p><p>When I try to do the same on Firefox, on the print page, the presentation does not rotate and remain landscape. The problem is, when I choose landscape to print, then the presentation is not centered on the page and skewed to one side so I get much wider margin on one side.   </p><p>Is there a way to fix this issue?     </p><p>I appreciate any advice or input! </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-830;,firefox,other,en-US,"",和音
