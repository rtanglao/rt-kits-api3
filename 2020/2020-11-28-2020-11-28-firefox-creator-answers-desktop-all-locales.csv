I have made Firefox the default browser by going to the Apple menu and choosing System Preferences then choosing General.  I have also made Firefox the default browser by going to the Firefox menu and choosing Preferences then General.  On that screen it says that Firefox is not my default browser and there is a box to click on that says ""Make Default"".  I click on it then click on ""use Firefox"", but when I click on links in my email Safari still opens.  Any suggestions. </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-830;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",skayj960

(then I just rotate the file to landscape on Preview or PDFexpert to read the presentation).   </p><p>When I try to do the same on Firefox, on the print page, the presentation does not rotate and remain landscape. The problem is, when I choose landscape to print, then the presentation is not centered on the page and skewed to one side so I get much wider margin on one side.   </p><p>Is there a way to fix this issue?     </p><p>I appreciate any advice or input! </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-830;,firefox,other,en-US,"",和音
