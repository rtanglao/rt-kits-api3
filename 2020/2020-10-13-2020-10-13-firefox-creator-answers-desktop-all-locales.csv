I'm currently in Firefox 81.0 and it is making we want to find someone who can help me downgrade to Firefox 70 or Firefox 50 depending on when the issue started or where something got broken with an update. I think what is going on is you are rushing to get updates out to compete against someone else and that is leading to random issues, and that needs to change as you need to stop worrying about whether or not you lose users. Right now, I can't even use Facebook share anymore and is making me want to switch to a different browser because of this. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1357662;1357666;,erikmouse1

That way one could gain vertical display space by hiding the Menu bar. After all, the some of the Menu bar options are already duplicated, but not the ones I could use.

I liked the Bing homepage because it had a new photo every day, and most of those photos were downloadable to use as wallpapers. Looks like I may go back to Internet Explorer [I don't like Edge]. Why won't Firefox allow Bing now? - it's not a security risk. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,customize,en-US,1357646;,ariari84
