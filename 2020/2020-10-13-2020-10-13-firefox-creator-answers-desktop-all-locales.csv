I cannot click the three bar link for more options, change the safe search option, or sign in to my Microsoft account. All these links are dead.  When on a page I cannot use the filter link.  I also cannot click on anything at all while the banner notice is up. I have tried to get help form Microsoft and they were unable to do anything. They suggested using their browser Edge. They suggested emptying the cache, which I did with no change, and they suggested uninstalling Firefox and reinstalling it. I do not want to do this because it will destroy al my formatting and lose lots of links, etc... as it has every other time I have done this.  I hope someone here will be able to help me.

I run Firefox on Ubuntu20.04 here and I have no clue what the issue could be. Chromium works. It works on Windows. I tried the safe mode without success. I just want to fix this before I run into this more frequently. </p><p>I am utterly clueless. I just today installed Firefox again on my Ubuntu machine.

I watch a video and go back I have to sign in again, I click on subscriptions I have to sign in again. I cannot comment or subscribe to anything. I have tried every common fix for this. I have tried clearing cookies and cache, forgetting website, clearing history I even used software to remove every bit of Firefox in my system right down to registry. I have tried turning off windows defender and virus scanner no change. Tried Firefox it in safe mode with same results. It works fine in Chrome I really would like an answer to this because I am not going to become a lemming and just use chrome! </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,websites,en-US,1357645;1357650;,jarack1
