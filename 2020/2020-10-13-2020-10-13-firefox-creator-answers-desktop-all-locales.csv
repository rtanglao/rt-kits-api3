After I open Firefox I get two instance of the primary password rather than one. This does not happen immediately. I have roughly 20 tabs pinned, so quite a number of websites are opened during startup. My guess is that this takes such an amount of time, Firefox is simply triggered to open another window. Still I think this behaviour is odd and it has happened to me before in a version where we still had the master password. This sounds disengaged, but I never bothered to report this behaviour until now. </p><p>I am not certain whether this is a feature or a bug. </p><p>I could remove a lot of pinned tabs, but I rather would not.

I have never had this before. It comes up on every page that is opened in Bing. I have waited and never seen a web page open or anything. Also, none of the functions on the Bing page are working. I cannot click the three bar link for more options, change the safe search option, or sign in to my Microsoft account. All these links are dead.  When on a page I cannot use the filter link.  I also cannot click on anything at all while the banner notice is up. I have tried to get help form Microsoft and they were unable to do anything. They suggested using their browser Edge. They suggested emptying the cache, which I did with no change, and they suggested uninstalling Firefox and reinstalling it. I do not want to do this because it will destroy al my formatting and lose lots of links, etc... as it has every other time I have done this.  I hope someone here will be able to help me. I prefer Bing search engine to all the others. I have tried Google and DuckDuckGo and they do not work for me, or find what I am searching for as well as Bing has. The others seem to be more for purchasing and not searching and so I do not like or trust them. Using Windows 10 on a Desk top PC, and had no trouble with Bing until the last week or so. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,other,en-US,1357675;1357679;,kluu

I'm currently in Firefox 81.0 and it is making we want to find someone who can help me downgrade to Firefox 70 or Firefox 50 depending on when the issue started or where something got broken with an update. I think what is going on is you are rushing to get updates out to compete against someone else and that is leading to random issues, and that needs to change as you need to stop worrying about whether or not you lose users. Right now, I can't even use Facebook share anymore and is making me want to switch to a different browser because of this. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1357662;1357666;,erikmouse1
