Disabled all plugins and extension and launch Firefox: The pointer keeps spinning. 3. Downloaded Firefox 80 and launched: Pointer keeps spinning. 4. Changed home page to a blank screen: Pointer keeps spinning. 5. Uninstalled Firefox ESR and re-installed: Pointer keeps spinning. 6. Checked for viruses, trojans, and other malware: none found. </p><p>Interestingly, if I launch Firefox ESR from a terminal (eg ""firefox-esr &amp;"") the spinning mouse pointer is not present.

I watch a video and go back I have to sign in again, I click on subscriptions I have to sign in again. I cannot comment or subscribe to anything. I have tried every common fix for this. I have tried clearing cookies and cache, forgetting website, clearing history I even used software to remove every bit of Firefox in my system right down to registry. I have tried turning off windows defender and virus scanner no change. Tried Firefox it in safe mode with same results. It works fine in Chrome I really would like an answer to this because I am not going to become a lemming and just use chrome! </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,websites,en-US,1357645;1357650;,jarack1
