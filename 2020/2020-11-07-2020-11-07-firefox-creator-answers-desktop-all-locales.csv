I use LastPass for all of this, and its Firefox extension is working pretty well. The issue is that any time I right-click in a password field to get the LastPass options, there in the menu above them, the very first item, is Firefox's own ""Fill password"", which of course does nothing because I have saved nothing for it to use.  </p><p>I used to click on this regularly by mistake. After long use I've finally developed the reflex to ignore it and go to the bottom of that list where the LastPass commands are, but it should not be appearing at all. First, because I've already set the options to say I do not want to use the password manager, and second, because there is another password manager in place, and Firefox should only ever use one at a time to prevent conflicts. </p><p>If there's anything I can do to fix this, I'd love to know about it, but I suspect it has to be a change request, and I can't find out from this site how to submit those. Please advise. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-820;firefox-8202;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",fastauntie1

I put them in the order that I like them. It's very frustrating. I was using the bookmarks editor and as I was arranging the bookmarks, within seconds they would automatically go back to alphabetical order. How do I make that stop? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",rayzanon
