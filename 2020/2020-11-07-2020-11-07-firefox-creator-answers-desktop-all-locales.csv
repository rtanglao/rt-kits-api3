I put them in the order that I like them. It's very frustrating. I was using the bookmarks editor and as I was arranging the bookmarks, within seconds they would automatically go back to alphabetical order. How do I make that stop? </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",rayzanon
