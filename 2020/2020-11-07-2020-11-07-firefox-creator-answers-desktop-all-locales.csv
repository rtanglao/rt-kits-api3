When i close the tab, i would have to go back to youtube(which audio slider still think its playing) and mute and unmute the audio on their player. </p><p>On version 82 Window.

The sync function is not easy to use, it syncs somewhat randomly. Not user friendly at all, to say the least! A real headache. </p><p>I'd like to sync the state disabled/enabled of my extensions. I guess it's not possible according to this page:   <a href=""http://wiki.mozilla.org/Services/Sync/Addon_Sync#Can_I_have_different_enabled_states_on_different_machines.3F"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.mozilla.org/Services/Sync/Addon_Sync#Can_I_have_different_enabled_states_on_different_machines.3F</a> Note:  services.sync.addons.ignoreUserEnabledChanges is set on default, i.e ""false"", so it shouldn't ""ignore"", and services.sync.prefs.sync.addons.ignoreUserEnabledChanges is set on ""true"", so shouldn't it propagate to another machine? </p><p>I don't want different enabled states on different machines, I want the same, but syncing a new machine only download automatically my full list of addons, and they are all activated. Also, they all, or almost, open pages to say things like ""Hey, thank you for installing this addon, blablah..."" which is particularly irritating, opening one tab after another tab while I'm trying to work. </p><p>Profiles, I used to use them a lot, but seem dead or almost, for the benefit of containers.   But, according to my understandings, containers are for keeping separate sessions cookies (which was easy to do anyway before with a good cookies managers), but don't allow to have a separate list of addon activated for different uses (addons for programming, addons for playing, etc...) </p><p>Anyway, FF, unlike Chrome (that is really more handy for such things that FF), doesn't show the current profile. So we don't know what is the current one, unless letting permanently opened about:profiles or <a href=""https://accounts.firefox.com/settings/clients"" rel=""nofollow"">https://accounts.firefox.com/settings/clients</a>.

(Was that profiles did) </p><p>My problem is that my profiles are not local. I use a machine to create a profile, and I need to use this profile on another machine. But it simply doesn't work without using a third-party software and copying all the files.     I don't understand why profiles don't sync. Having all my profiles synced and activated at the same time, connected, like I see on <a href=""http://accounts.firefox.com/settings/clients"" rel=""nofollow"">accounts.firefox.com/settings/clients</a>, is useless in my opinion.
