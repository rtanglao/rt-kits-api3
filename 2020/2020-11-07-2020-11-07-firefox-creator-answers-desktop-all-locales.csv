After long use I've finally developed the reflex to ignore it and go to the bottom of that list where the LastPass commands are, but it should not be appearing at all. First, because I've already set the options to say I do not want to use the password manager, and second, because there is another password manager in place, and Firefox should only ever use one at a time to prevent conflicts. </p><p>If there's anything I can do to fix this, I'd love to know about it, but I suspect it has to be a change request, and I can't find out from this site how to submit those.
