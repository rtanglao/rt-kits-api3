This shows up without any userChrome file.  </p><p>about:support shows my Profile.   vwy0y5ix.default-release I also have under the Profile folder this:  jcueuz5y.default </p><p>Question:  Why 2 profiles now as I had only one before?

I am certain that this will be fixed over time, but is there any way to go back on the meantime? </p><p>No images attached since all the PDF documents I edit have some degree of private/confidential information. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",gd58hugo

It looses all my temp tabs in the tab menu and forces its search engine onto my computer.,"<p>MS has begun 'grabbing' my FF browser - does this about once a week.  It closes my tabs, kills my search engine and substitutes bing.  This, I assume, is malware from MS and may have come in with the new Windows 10: </p><p>First - I want to make Mozilla aware this is happening. </p><p>Second - how can I prevent those bastards from grabbing the browser and making me re-install my tabs - all this takes about a half hour? </p><p>Thanks, </p><p>DMS </p>",desktop;beta;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",rangerdon
