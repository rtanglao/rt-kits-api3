Google searches appeared with the normal white background color up until today. Now, the searches only appear with the white background color if I leave my operating system with a light theme. I tried using terminal to override the system background color for Firefox to try and get my searches to appear white again, but this didn't work. I also tried using an app which would run the commands itself (in case I had input the wrong commands), but this also didn't work. The odd thing is that even if I turn the Firefox theme to light or any other color, the Google searches still appear in dark mode. Also Firefox is the only browser where the searches appear in dark mode; in both Safari and Chrome the searches still have a white background. Is there any settings I can change in Firefox to fix this or anything else I can do? </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-830;,firefox,customize,en-US,1375313;,doctorstarbies

I headed to Firefox and found essentially the same announcement. </p><p>I am wondering how Mozilla sees this affecting the existing web and why it is ostensibly being supported? My understanding is that a significant portion of the web makes use of flash and is no longer maintained, meaning that there will be no porting to html5. I know that the internet archives has started developing an alternative to flash in order to maintain the ability to view these websites. Why did Mozilla not go with that approach? Are there any links to discussion pages about this topic where I can read more about the decision? </p><p>Thank you Warm regards </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,1375305;1375306;,NFRIDGE1

I need help on a very strange problem I had recently with my Firefox. I have Firefox 83.0 64-bit installed on my Windows 7 Home Basic desktop PC. Some time after maybe version 81 and above, I noticed that my Firefox randomly closes and reopens without showing any error messages. I noticed that the most consistent time this phenomenon happens is when I turn on my PC and start Firefox, it almost always closes and reopens, sometimes even more than once. It acts like the browser crashed, but the weird thing is it doesn't show any error message saying that the browser crashed. Once I opened Firefox at least once after I turn on my PC, even if I manually closed it and reopen it later, it will not crash on Firefox startup, it will probably only crash again after I restarted my PC and open Firefox. Also rarely, Firefox randomly closes and reopens whenever I browser whatever website with no reason whatsoever, but this only happens 3 out of 10 times. </p><p>I opened Troubleshooting Information to look for clues on what might be causing this, and I noticed ""Launcher Process"" is ""Disabled due to failure"". I am not sure what that means though, but I have a feeling this might be related somehow? </p><p>If anyone has any idea on what's going on, please help me.
