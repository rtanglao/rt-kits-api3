So set up new account and that went ok. When tried to set up secondary email got same problem in email that was sent, wrong MacOS and wrong IP address in sent email. </p><p>Is it ok to just ignore the OS and IP address and go ahead since the information comes in right when expected for the right email account? His it asking to verify a IP address for Firefox that I do not know how to find? I think the last computer I pulled Firefox up on was running Mac 10.something so is it just confused with the last time I used the browser? </p><p>I am older and not very computer savvy so answers need to be simple. If you can help me I would appreciate it. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",cev1001

The cookie has a life of 3 months. In my Firefox setting I have NOT set delete cookies on closing Firefox and I have set this domain as an exception always to be allowed. This morning, and on 3 other recent occasions, I have been able to access this site but suddenly, while the PC (Windows 10 64-bit) is still running and Firefox has not been closed I find I have to re-enter the cookie from the application because it has been deleted. Other cookies are still there. Last night I did run virus scanners and CC-Cleaner BUT this cookie was there this morning and has been for 4 hours until it disappeared. On the previous 3 occasions I had not run any scanners. Any  ideas? Also, as an aside, in Firefox we used to be able to click on a domain to examine the cookies - whay has this been removed? </p>",desktop;cookies;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,cookies,en-US,"",kramster

It seems the more the coders ""improve"" it, the worse it gets. It's bad enough I can't get LogMeIn remote to work (it's just fine on Chrome &amp; Edge) but now if I try to log into a site from two different units I'm successful on the one but the other returns an error message. Suggestion? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,other,en-US,1375221;,RealGomer
