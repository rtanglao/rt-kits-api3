I used to be able to (very recently!) and I am not aware of changing any settings. I can log in if I am on Safari. A very rude support person on Weebly said there was nothing they could do their end. I don't understand it. I'm not very techie - but I prefer using Firefox. Is it something to do with the latest version?  What can I do about it? thanks for your help.
