(Generated file opens in Foxit PhantomPDF and contains the first page of the printed www page.) If I try to print the same www page again (immediately after), it is always successful and all pages of the www page are printed. What is the reason of this strange behavior? It happens only sometimes and only on some www pages. I don't know if it is caused by Foxit or by Firefox because the error dialog box contains no information who threw the error. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",sevec

I first noticed this with a few favicons. Sometimes they would show corrupted, other times they would load properly. I also have now seen it on a webpage as shown in the attached image (percentage counter). The corruption seems to be of the same type, square with patterned lines of color. It seems to be some sort of rendering issue. The same page renders without corruption inside other browsers, so it is Firefox-specific. Any help much appreciated! </p>",desktop;other;macos;firefox-830;,firefox,other,en-US,1373098;,cesurf

It used to be when I granted permission for my microphone to be used on that site, it applied to every page on it throughout the session, as long as I did not close out, sign out or close the window. Now, every time I go to speak, when on a new page, it asks for permission. Since this is a language learning site, this has become a real pain. </p><p>There is no ""remember this setting"" dialog either when I first give permission to use the microphone. It is asking for permission for the general site, so it's not asking for each page. When I check the permissions box after moving to the next page, no permissions are granted. </p><p>Nothing that I can tell has changed. It's not doing this with other browsers, which is concerning.  </p><p>I checked my settings site and nothing has changed. I also did Firefox refresh and that did not help.
