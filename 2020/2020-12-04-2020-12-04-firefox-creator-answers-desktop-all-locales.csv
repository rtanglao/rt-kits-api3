I can see the first photo of an article but the rest of the article shows blank rectangles. I've researched this online, and I see that more than a few are having this problem. I finally exported my bookmarks and deleted Firefox, using the Programs section of the Control Panel. I followed instructions from a ""Sunshare"" website. The instructions also said to go to File Explorer &gt; Users &gt; Isumsoft Li and remove a couple of app data files - there is no Isumsoft folder though. I'm also instructed to go to Program Files and remove the Mozilla Firefox folder, and there is no such folder that any of my searches show.  </p><p>So anyway I deleted and reinstalled Firefox, restarted my PC, and I still have the same problem. I'd definitely like to keep using Firefox because of privacy but I'll have to find another browser if I can't get it to work. </p><p>I don't know why the upgrades I've installed won't address this problem, but that's not relevant to this post. Can anyone tell me how to fix this? Greatly appreciate any help here. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",im_seldom

I installed the latest download, signed into my Firefox account - and suddenly, it knew all my previous-used passwords and bookmarks.
