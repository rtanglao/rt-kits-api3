Resulta que estoy usando Firefox hace un tiempo, pero desde hace unos días, un sitio en especifico (<a class=""new"" href=""/es/kb/new?title=onlinesoccermanager.com"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""La página no existe."">onlinesoccermanager.com</a>) tiene puesto el zoom automático. Resulta que, de vez en cuando, necesito poner la página en tamaño 90%, pero generalmente me gusta tenerla en 100%. No sé por qué, pero Firefox detectó que quiero que la página esté en todo momento en 90%. Si, puedo ponerlo en 100% con la combinación de teclas, pero solo dura hasta que: o cambio de pestaña, o recargo la página. Por favor, ayuda. Es muy molesto. Me da serios dolores de cuello. Gracias. </p><p>Hello, community. It turns out that I have been using Firefox for a while, but for a few days, a specific site (<a class=""new"" href=""/es/kb/new?title=onlinesoccermanager.com"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""La página no existe."">onlinesoccermanager.com</a>) has automatic zoom on. Turns out, every once in a while I need to size the page to 90%, but I generally like to have it 100%. I don't know why, but Firefox detected that I want the page to be at 90% at all times. Yes, I can set it to 100% with the key combination, but it only lasts until I change the tab, or I reload the page. Please help. Is very annoying. It gives me serious neck pain. Thank you. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,websites,es,"",ValbjörnBjarnason
