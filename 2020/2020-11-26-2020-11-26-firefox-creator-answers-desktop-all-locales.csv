I worked offline on a couple of mails on yahoo webmail, intending to send them in the morning. On waking up, I went online to send wanted to send them, but they could not. Needless to say, the texts of those mails have been lost and were not saved as drafts.  All my firefox pages, old and new, now open as bare pages, without links, formatting, pics or functionalities. I am not even able to upload here an image of my screen on a typical page. My email is denisbridoux@yahoo.com. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",denisbridoux

The sites work like they used to now. </p><p>I'm still confused about Firefox Sync's functionality because when I set it up to sync my tabs it never wants to do it, but immediately after the refresh it downloaded all of my Add-ons right away, which was nice to see. However, my settings/options from those Add-ons are missing, like my uBlock filter lists or various Tampermonkey user scripts. </p><p>Is there any way I could recover the Add-on settings from the profile backup which the refresh created on my Desktop? There's a folder called browser-extension-data with some other folders inside, but they're all empty. I tried looking for it myself but couldn't find solutions. I also have a complete profile backup I manually made just before I the Refresh as a safety measure if needed. Thank you very much..! </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",syuro

For instance, it happens when a software forcefully opens a ""Thank you for installing"" site while Firefox wasn't running, or when I accidentally open a link in a new window while being on private mode, when I meant to open it in a new <em>private</em> window instead.. </p><p>On a different browser I used before switching to Firefox, I used to resolve this by going to it's profile location and looking at two files named ""Current Session"" and ""Last Session"". I could just rename the ""Last Session"" file to ""Current Session"", and all of my tabs would return. I was hoping Firefox would have something similar, but it seems either impossible or maybe just a bit more complicated, since I cannot find anything regarding this on the web. </p><p>Each time this happens to me, I go to my Firefox profile folder but cannot really find anything regarding sessions I could replace and restore. Only thing I managed to back up from the various important tabs I lost were six files in a fashion like this: </p><p>recovery.jsonlz4, upgrade.jsonlz4-[a lot of numbers] </p><p>Can I use these files to recover my lost tabs somehow, similar to how I used to do it in the different browser? Hopefully I'm understandable, it's a bit complicated to explain for me. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",syuro
