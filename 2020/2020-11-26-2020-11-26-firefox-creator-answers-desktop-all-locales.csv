There is a server within the network running a webapplication (ASPX). The firewall regulations are very strict, so there are only two hands full of websites reachable from the network. Until now (version 82.x) it was enough to put the adress http://server in the address line of Firefox to open the application. After updating to version 83.0 the server is not reachable anymore, firefox automatically tries to open <a href=""http://www.server.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.server.com</a> ""ping server"" works, use of \\server in windows explorer and opening an RDP-Connection to ""server"" works also! </p><p>Why is that so and are there any solutions? </p><p>Thanks in advance! </p><p>Best regards </p><p>Peter </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",peter.fasol

One of them is Prime Video.  I've never been able to use Prime with Firefox. It let's me navigate inside the website but when it's time to stream the movie/series/stuff that I choose, it tells me that I can't because I need to get the latest version of Firefox.  Well... It's nothing special in this case, since it's just entertainment. But very recently (less than a week) I have the same problem with whatsapp web. And this is quite annoying since I use it for work and to have another browser open makes me slow down on my job. Can you tell me if there's a solution to this? My version of Mozilla Firefox is 83.0 (64 bit) and it says it's the latest. No need to update. Sorry, the pictures are in italian (I'm from Italy). Let me know if you need any help with translation. Thank you in advance! </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",ferrante.alessandro

The sites work like they used to now. </p><p>I'm still confused about Firefox Sync's functionality because when I set it up to sync my tabs it never wants to do it, but immediately after the refresh it downloaded all of my Add-ons right away, which was nice to see. However, my settings/options from those Add-ons are missing, like my uBlock filter lists or various Tampermonkey user scripts. </p><p>Is there any way I could recover the Add-on settings from the profile backup which the refresh created on my Desktop? There's a folder called browser-extension-data with some other folders inside, but they're all empty. I tried looking for it myself but couldn't find solutions. I also have a complete profile backup I manually made just before I the Refresh as a safety measure if needed. Thank you very much..! </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",syuro

For instance, it happens when a software forcefully opens a ""Thank you for installing"" site while Firefox wasn't running, or when I accidentally open a link in a new window while being on private mode, when I meant to open it in a new <em>private</em> window instead.. </p><p>On a different browser I used before switching to Firefox, I used to resolve this by going to it's profile location and looking at two files named ""Current Session"" and ""Last Session"". I could just rename the ""Last Session"" file to ""Current Session"", and all of my tabs would return. I was hoping Firefox would have something similar, but it seems either impossible or maybe just a bit more complicated, since I cannot find anything regarding this on the web. </p><p>Each time this happens to me, I go to my Firefox profile folder but cannot really find anything regarding sessions I could replace and restore. Only thing I managed to back up from the various important tabs I lost were six files in a fashion like this: </p><p>recovery.jsonlz4, upgrade.jsonlz4-[a lot of numbers] </p><p>Can I use these files to recover my lost tabs somehow, similar to how I used to do it in the different browser? Hopefully I'm understandable, it's a bit complicated to explain for me. </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",syuro
