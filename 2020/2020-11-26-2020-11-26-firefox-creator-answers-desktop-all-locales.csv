In Google chrome one can expect absolutely all settings to sync across browser instances instantly. In Firefox only parts of the settings are synced. This makes Firefox unreliable and inconvenient because it is not apparent to the user which settings are synced and which are not. </p><p>Here is my experience: </p><p>- I made a new Firefox account - Signed in - Made sure syncing is on for: </p> <ul><li> Bookmarks </li><li> Credit cards </li><li> History </li><li> Add-ons </li><li> Logins and password </li><li> Options </li></ul> <p>- Added some add-ons, added some bookmarks - Customized the interface - Changed some Settings - Opened a Windows 10 VM - Installed Firefox 83 (so both computers have the same version) - Logged in with my Firefox account - Waited for the sync </p><p>So far I can see that my extensions are synced and my bookmarks. However there are some things that don't sync: </p><p>- Customization for controls, buttons and toolbars - Default search engine - Alternative search engines - Settings for ""Firefox Data Collection and Use"" </p><p>There might be more settings that don't sync, which I have not tested. Is this behavior expected? If so I might switch back to Chrome. Syncing only certain settings defeats the purpose of syncing, at least for me. </p><p>Also is there any list or information about which settings are syncing and which are not? </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",32411844

There are often times when I don't need to enable Firefox Password from filling in passwords and don't need to login to my account at any particular website, but want to lookup information.  For example, I may want to see if an item is available on Amazon and what the options are without having to login to my account.  But as soon as I go to Amazon -- and for every, single page I access while there -- the ""Enter Primary Password"" box pops up and I can't continue without clicking ""cancel"".  If I enter my Primary Password just once it stops asking.  But I'd prefer to be able to easily tell Firefox to not enable Firefox Password and ask for my Primary Password until I want it enabled; perhaps by having a toggle button in the menu bar? I see there's what sort of looks like a method for this if you search for ""Firefox keeps asking for Primary Password"", but it state that it applies when using AVG and another security software, but I'm not using either of those.  Maybe it continues to ask after entering it when using one of these software?  I tried it anyway and it didn't make any difference. Is there a way to do this?

The sites work like they used to now. </p><p>I'm still confused about Firefox Sync's functionality because when I set it up to sync my tabs it never wants to do it, but immediately after the refresh it downloaded all of my Add-ons right away, which was nice to see. However, my settings/options from those Add-ons are missing, like my uBlock filter lists or various Tampermonkey user scripts. </p><p>Is there any way I could recover the Add-on settings from the profile backup which the refresh created on my Desktop? There's a folder called browser-extension-data with some other folders inside, but they're all empty. I tried looking for it myself but couldn't find solutions. I also have a complete profile backup I manually made just before I the Refresh as a safety measure if needed. Thank you very much..! </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",syuro

For instance, it happens when a software forcefully opens a ""Thank you for installing"" site while Firefox wasn't running, or when I accidentally open a link in a new window while being on private mode, when I meant to open it in a new <em>private</em> window instead.. </p><p>On a different browser I used before switching to Firefox, I used to resolve this by going to it's profile location and looking at two files named ""Current Session"" and ""Last Session"". I could just rename the ""Last Session"" file to ""Current Session"", and all of my tabs would return. I was hoping Firefox would have something similar, but it seems either impossible or maybe just a bit more complicated, since I cannot find anything regarding this on the web. </p><p>Each time this happens to me, I go to my Firefox profile folder but cannot really find anything regarding sessions I could replace and restore. Only thing I managed to back up from the various important tabs I lost were six files in a fashion like this: </p><p>recovery.jsonlz4, upgrade.jsonlz4-[a lot of numbers] </p><p>Can I use these files to recover my lost tabs somehow, similar to how I used to do it in the different browser? Hopefully I'm understandable, it's a bit complicated to explain for me. </p>",desktop;tabs;escalate;windows-10;sessionrestore;firefox-830;,firefox,tabs,en-US,"",syuro
