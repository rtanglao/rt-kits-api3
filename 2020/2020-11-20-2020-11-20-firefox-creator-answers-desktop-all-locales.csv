I had a HTML bookmark file which I had exported from my Firefox before. It is a 3MB file containing over 200 bookmarks organized into folders. When I import it, nothing happens! Only about 10 of the bookmarks (last added bookmarks I guess) are added to the bookmarks menu. So there is two major problems: 1. I want all of my bookmarks imported. 2. I want them in the ""folders"" the way I categorized them before, NOT just a few links scattered in the bookmarks menu! that's absolutely useless. </p><p>This will be a huge time-consuming task to add and organize 200 bookmarks again manually. If Firefox can't solve this, I will definitely migrate to Chrome. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",bisetoun

Now, some weeks ago, occasionally my browser freezes during loading of websites and it was also no longer possible to close the browser at normal way. I had to use the the Mac option 'close immediately' (sofort beenden). I could work with other programs and also with the Safari browser quite normal but I could no longer shut down my computer. The only possibility to get a shut down was to press the on/off button for several seconds. This behavior of Firefox is now reproducible. Sometimes I can open several websites without problems  before Firefox freezes, sometimes it freezes immediately after starting Firefox. In all these cases I had to close Firefox by the 'sofort beenden' option and I could no longer shut down my computer the normal way. No problems at all if I don't use Firefox and use the Safari browser instead. I use the latest version of Firefox (82.0.3) and Mac OS Catalina (10.15.7). I have already deinstalled Firefox and reinstalled it after a new download from the Mozilla website but got no change of this behavior. I run 'Malwarebytes' and scanned the computer with the AVG antivirus software and both didn't show any deficiencies . Perhaps somebody is able to help me, many thanks for this. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",duru99

Of course this had to break something. For years I have had a bookmark to ""about:config?filter=signon.rememberSignoabout:config?filter=signon.rememberSignons"" This allowed me to easily toggle on or off the prompt for my master password when I browsed a site for which I had stored credentials.  This bookmark no longer works. It takes me to the generic about:config page but does not fill in the setting which I am looking for.   Is there a way to fix this? </p><p>I used to have some sort of addon or other feature which allowed me to only unlock my saved credentials when I wanted to logon to a site.  When that broke or went away I found the about:config setting and created a bookmark to it. Being prompted to unlock my stored credentials every time I hit a site for which I have credentials is very annoying. Leaving my credentials file unlocked is a security concern. </p><p>Any advice would be appreciated. </p><p>TIA, </p><p>Ken </p>",linux;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-680;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",r5igti

Now my Lastpass pw mgr, can't get clipboard permission cause the page just comes up blank,when I try to copy/paste a pw, to sign into sync even, I had to past from outside using another browser &amp; don't have containers on it, Brave should catch up to this, cause Chrome,clearly doesn't have containers, so I'm done using it &amp; now w/o Firefox working right I'm screwed, it's so aggravating, Just when I thought firefox was doing good again, nope, you're back on my shitlist. I'm pissed just like this guy! I got my bookmarks &amp; think I got the sync working but you shouldn't suggest refresh to fix issues, now how do I get my lastpass working? cause I have pop up blockers disabled &amp; the permission page for firefox won't come up, just a blank page every time I try to copy a pw to paste in, manually, ugh, I hate this!  </p><p>REFRESH HAS TOTALLY SCREWED UP MY COMPUTER - WHY DON'T YOU WARN PEOPLE </p><pre>   9 replies    3 have this problem    409 views    Last reply by Andrew </pre> <p>4 years ago KC KC 12/20/15, 1:45 PM </p><p>I stupidly accepted the Firefox suggestion to refresh my browser and everything i worked so hard for is gone.
