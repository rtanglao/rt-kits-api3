I watch a YouTube video and then this message comes up on another YouTube tab I have open and Firefox switches to that tab and ruins my watching the video I was watching. </p><p>Is there anyway of disabling the message from ever coming up? I increased the values in dom.max_script_run_time and dom.max_script_run_time_without_important_user_input which was a possible solution I read but that does nothing. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",davebesag

Now my Lastpass pw mgr, can't get clipboard permission cause the page just comes up blank,when I try to copy/paste a pw, to sign into sync even, I had to past from outside using another browser &amp; don't have containers on it, Brave should catch up to this, cause Chrome,clearly doesn't have containers, so I'm done using it &amp; now w/o Firefox working right I'm screwed, it's so aggravating, Just when I thought firefox was doing good again, nope, you're back on my shitlist. I'm pissed just like this guy! I got my bookmarks &amp; think I got the sync working but you shouldn't suggest refresh to fix issues, now how do I get my lastpass working? cause I have pop up blockers disabled &amp; the permission page for firefox won't come up, just a blank page every time I try to copy a pw to paste in, manually, ugh, I hate this!  </p><p>REFRESH HAS TOTALLY SCREWED UP MY COMPUTER - WHY DON'T YOU WARN PEOPLE </p><pre>   9 replies    3 have this problem    409 views    Last reply by Andrew </pre> <p>4 years ago KC KC 12/20/15, 1:45 PM </p><p>I stupidly accepted the Firefox suggestion to refresh my browser and everything i worked so hard for is gone.   Its going to take me forever to FIX what your stupid site has screwed up.   YOU REALLY OUGHT TO TELL PEOPLE IF YOU USE THIS YOUR GOING TO BE SCREWED </p><p>So I thought I'd just delete it and start over but even that has so many steps I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS STUPID CRAP AND I REALLY HATE FIREFOX FOR SCREWING UP MY COMPUTER AND MY DAY </p><p>I AM SOOOOOOOO SCREWED -   all my bookmarks  I HATE YOU I HATE FIREFOX I CAME TO YOUR SITE THINKING IT WOULD BE SAFE AND YOU HAVE DESTROYED EVERYTHING </p><p>I SEE in another thread about deleting firefox and creating another profile and about 10 million other steps i don't know how to do but if I close firefox as you said then i can see your frigging directions I HATE YOU </p><p>Modified February 16, 2016 at 10:39:48 AM PST by KC Chosen solution </p><p>I understand that you're frustrated, but it only takes a couple minutes to copy the files. Take it step by step. Do not delete anything, that will only make it worse. Do not use Windows' system restore feature, that may make it totally irreversible. </p><p>In another thread (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1098179"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/questions/1098179</a>) you said the steps I posted were not clear.

I am running Windows 8 on a Dell Inspiron 660 desktop which uses Intel's built in HD graphics 2500. </p><p>Up until Firefox update 82.0.2, I had no issues with Firefox whatsoever.   Applying the update to 83.0 resulted in numerous error messages along the lines that my display driver had stopped responding (but successfully recovered).   </p><p>While glancing through some of the event error logs, as best I recall having seen, at least one made a reference that Firefox could not access the graphics card (or something to that effect). </p><p>I then opted to perform a system restore and rolled back my system to where I was once again using Firefox update 82.0.2 successfully and without issues.   FYI, I am using the last intel display driver available for my Dell, so updating my display driver isn't an option.  </p><p>Unless and until others report a similar issue, guess I will continue using Firefox as updated to 82.0.2 and not downloading any further updates.   Any comments would be appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-8;needsinfo;firefox-820;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1369054;,ikey48
