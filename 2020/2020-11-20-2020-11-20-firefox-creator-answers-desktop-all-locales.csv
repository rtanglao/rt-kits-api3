I am running Windows 8 on a Dell Inspiron 660 desktop which uses Intel's built in HD graphics 2500. </p><p>Up until Firefox update 82.0.2, I had no issues with Firefox whatsoever.   Applying the update to 83.0 resulted in numerous error messages along the lines that my display driver had stopped responding (but successfully recovered).   </p><p>While glancing through some of the event error logs, as best I recall having seen, at least one made a reference that Firefox could not access the graphics card (or something to that effect). </p><p>I then opted to perform a system restore and rolled back my system to where I was once again using Firefox update 82.0.2 successfully and without issues.   FYI, I am using the last intel display driver available for my Dell, so updating my display driver isn't an option.  </p><p>Unless and until others report a similar issue, guess I will continue using Firefox as updated to 82.0.2 and not downloading any further updates.   Any comments would be appreciated. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-8;firefox-820;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ikey48
