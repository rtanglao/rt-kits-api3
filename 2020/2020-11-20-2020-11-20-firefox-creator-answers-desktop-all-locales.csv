The Activity Monitor show Zero Idle percent.  The new MBAir has 8 Gbs of ram; Intel Iris Plus Graphics 1536 MB; 1.1GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i3.  On my year old iMac, Firefox behaves properly, with right now more than 86% Idle re: the CPU.  The Performance settings are identical (and the default settings) on both machines (Recommended Performance Settings).  Anyone else have this problem?

Of course this had to break something. For years I have had a bookmark to ""about:config?filter=signon.rememberSignoabout:config?filter=signon.rememberSignons"" This allowed me to easily toggle on or off the prompt for my master password when I browsed a site for which I had stored credentials.  This bookmark no longer works. It takes me to the generic about:config page but does not fill in the setting which I am looking for.   Is there a way to fix this? </p><p>I used to have some sort of addon or other feature which allowed me to only unlock my saved credentials when I wanted to logon to a site.  When that broke or went away I found the about:config setting and created a bookmark to it. Being prompted to unlock my stored credentials every time I hit a site for which I have credentials is very annoying. Leaving my credentials file unlocked is a security concern. </p><p>Any advice would be appreciated. </p><p>TIA, </p><p>Ken </p>",linux;desktop;bookmarks;firefox-680;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",r5igti

Now my Lastpass pw mgr, can't get clipboard permission cause the page just comes up blank,when I try to copy/paste a pw, to sign into sync even, I had to past from outside using another browser &amp; don't have containers on it, Brave should catch up to this, cause Chrome,clearly doesn't have containers, so I'm done using it &amp; now w/o Firefox working right I'm screwed, it's so aggravating, Just when I thought firefox was doing good again, nope, you're back on my shitlist. I'm pissed just like this guy! I got my bookmarks &amp; think I got the sync working but you shouldn't suggest refresh to fix issues, now how do I get my lastpass working? cause I have pop up blockers disabled &amp; the permission page for firefox won't come up, just a blank page every time I try to copy a pw to paste in, manually, ugh, I hate this!  </p><p>REFRESH HAS TOTALLY SCREWED UP MY COMPUTER - WHY DON'T YOU WARN PEOPLE </p><pre>   9 replies    3 have this problem    409 views    Last reply by Andrew </pre> <p>4 years ago KC KC 12/20/15, 1:45 PM </p><p>I stupidly accepted the Firefox suggestion to refresh my browser and everything i worked so hard for is gone.

I am running Windows 8 on a Dell Inspiron 660 desktop which uses Intel's built in HD graphics 2500. </p><p>Up until Firefox update 82.0.2, I had no issues with Firefox whatsoever.   Applying the update to 83.0 resulted in numerous error messages along the lines that my display driver had stopped responding (but successfully recovered).   </p><p>While glancing through some of the event error logs, as best I recall having seen, at least one made a reference that Firefox could not access the graphics card (or something to that effect). </p><p>I then opted to perform a system restore and rolled back my system to where I was once again using Firefox update 82.0.2 successfully and without issues.   FYI, I am using the last intel display driver available for my Dell, so updating my display driver isn't an option.  </p><p>Unless and until others report a similar issue, guess I will continue using Firefox as updated to 82.0.2 and not downloading any further updates.
