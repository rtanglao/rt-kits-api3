The computer (linux) is always on, and firefox is also always running (except when I update to a new version). But I was not using the computer for a while. Today I sat at the computer expecting to see all my tabs that I sent to it via ""send tab to device"", but as soon as firefox started syncing, everything slowed down to a crawl (to the point where even typing to a terminal would have upwards to several seconds of lag). Weirdly, it doesn't seem as if there's a lot of CPU or IO being used, according to top and iotop - but I was seeing multiple ""migration"" processes (that went away after quitting firefox), suggesting that there are many threads doing very little work in aggregate. After googling a bit I tried setting sync.log.appender.console to Debug and looking at debug console, which didn't tell me anything interesting - it actually looks as if the sync itself completes fast. And, in fact, my bookmarks seem to have synced to today's state correctly. (restarting after updating to current version does not seem to help; running in safe mode also doesn't seem to help) </p><p>1) What's up? How do I stop this from happening? </p><p>2) How do I get my ""sent"" tabs? Even a list for the past 2 weeks would be fine. Working it out from browsing history would be ... a lot of needles in even more piles of hay. </p>",linux;desktop;sync;firefox-820;firefox-8203;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",xKiv

Using this URL <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/back-and-restore-information-firefox-profiles"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/back-and-restore-information-firefox-profiles</a> I've backed up files to an external drive. Then followed the instructions ""Restoring to a different location"" which in my case is another partition on the same hard drive. It just does not work. </p><p>I create a new folder, Thunderbird, and a new profile in it on Y using the link in the instructions  @ 2. Use the Thunderbird Profile Manager to create a new profile in your desired location by ... Press Windows Key +R on the keyboard to open the Run dialog. Then enter ""thunderbird.exe -p"" and click OK.  exit the Profile Manager ... </p><p>Profile created and I see the file in Thunderbird folder on Y drive, path Y\Jim\Thunderbird\t55nr5v1.jim-combined. Profile manager sees default profile name on c partition and new profile on y partition. Try to launch Thunderbird with jim-combined profile. I deselect use selected profile at startup and start.  </p><p>First time no start up-no error messages. Second dbl click it starts to default on c partition. A t55nr5v1.jim-combined folder has been created in the Y partition but at the root folder, Jim, and not in the Thunderbird folder that was selected when creating the new profile-this folder is MT.  </p><p>I re-open the profile manager as above, thunderbird.exe -p, and the new profile created is no where to be found. I start the program from here and default on C opens.  </p><p>Close program, move t55nr5v1.jim-combined, which has a file times.json in, in to the Thunderbird folder as originally set up and open profile mgr. Nothing. </p><p>I do not think Thunderbird can work on a drive that is partitioned? If it can can someone tell me how. I've lost hours and my C partition is out of space and the 2+ GB of files needs to move. </p><p>I tried another section that was on this page a few days ago but is now gone that talked about editing the the <a href=""http://profile.int"" rel=""nofollow"">profile.int</a>. Tried all the iterations of // or \\ absolute to relative paths, changing to 1 to 0 all w/o any luck. </p><p>This page, <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/moving-thunderbird-data-to-a-new-computer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/moving-thunderbird-data-to-a-new-computer</a>, was much more helpful at showing what going up 3 levels means.

The only thing I can do is search for and watch videos. I can't access settings, notifications, or my account. The toolbar on the left side of the page (where your history, playlists, and subscriptions are) works for me most of the time, but not always. Whenever I try to open those menus I just getting the little spinning wheel. I can't post or edit comments (I can see them though).  Live chats don't work either, it always says I'm disconnected. I've tried everything I can think of to solve it, but nothing has worked. I've cleared all my cookies and cache (multiple times), I've tried booting it up in Safe Mode (the problem is still present there), disabling ad blocker, nothing works. The problem does not exist in any other browser or on my iPhone. Anyone have any ideas of what to do? I'd hate to run two browsers just for one site and I don't want to switch away from Firefox. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,websites,en-US,1366866;,HoennMaster
