Sorry if my explanation is long but I want to detail all the steps I already tried, in case I made a mistake somewhere. </p><p>So Windows forced me to do an update and when I restarted my computer and launched Firefox my restore session window didn't appear. Instead of the restore page I got this in the main tab: <em>File not found </em> Firefox can’t find the file at /C:/Program<em> </em> </p><p>(at that point I didn't had time to figure out the bug so I just opened new tabs and did my studies/emails) After my studies I looked in the 3-bar menu and restore session was greyed out. I then went in <em>Help- Troubleshooting info</em> and opened the profile folder. In the <em>sessionstore-backups</em> folder there was: <em>previous.jsonlz4 </em> recovery.baklz4 recovery.jsonlz4<em> </em> There was also three <em>upgrade.jsonlz4-</em> followed by a string number which includes the date. </p><p>I made a backup copy on the desktop of the <em>sessionstore-backups</em> folder and then (after closing Firefox), deleted the 2 recovery files which where dated from after my Firefox restart and kept the <em>previous.jsonlz4</em>. When I reopened Firefox it opened the last session (my studies) and not the session from before the windows update. </p><p>I then closed again Firefox and wanted to try to delete the recovery files again, but then change the name of <em>previous.jsonklz4</em> to <em>recovery.jsonklz4</em>. (at that point something weird happened. I deleted the files but the paste didn't work. When I went back on the desktop to copy again the files from my backup folder, it had totally disappeared, just like that. It was there a minute earlier. And I didn't find it in the trash). </p><p>So I changed my plan and used the files from the last session that I had just deleted. The three <em>upgrade.jsonlz4-</em> files where still there, so I took the most recent, dated from 2 days ago, and changed it's name from <em>upgrade.jsonlz4-20201108180448</em> to <em>recovery.jsonklz4</em>. I then deleted all the other file in the  <em>sessionstore-backups</em> folder. When I opened Firefox it still restored my last session from my studies, not the one from before the Windows update. </p><p>So I have two questions: </p> <ol><li> Is there something I can do to restore my session from before the Windows update? </li><li> How can Firefox restore my last session if I deleted all the files in the <em>sessionstore-backups</em> folder? Is there another file elsewhere that has my session info? </li></ol> <p>Thanks a lot in advance, Olivier </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",fdragon09

On many sites (in some circumstances) on their loaded pages I see 'black rectangles' which mysteriously disappear after some time as like as they previously have shown... </p><p>It is very strange and annoying. Before version 82 I have no memory to see that before. I don't know what Firefox developers do, but if their job is to decrease user level of satisfaction of using Firefox browser, than they give their best. </p><p>These randomly appeared black rectangles on different pages make me nervous. They are like some missing part of a page. Like Firefox, on its desire to show site content as soon as possible, doesn't wait to receive all data packages and on later period (when delayed packages arrive) then fill the black rectangles with data and the pages are represented as they should be. My International Internet Connection is around 20 Mbps and my Homeland Internet Connection is around 50 Mbps, so I don't think that Internet Connection is the reason for these black rectangles. I've set Google as my home page and these black rectangles show even on Firefox starting process when Firefox loads Google site. I don't keep sites' cache data. And I am very curious why on earlier versions of Firefox I didn't notice these black rectangles. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1367018;,mks19

It just stays there with the correct URL that I've clicked but the web page doesn't load.

The computer (linux) is always on, and firefox is also always running (except when I update to a new version). But I was not using the computer for a while. Today I sat at the computer expecting to see all my tabs that I sent to it via ""send tab to device"", but as soon as firefox started syncing, everything slowed down to a crawl (to the point where even typing to a terminal would have upwards to several seconds of lag). Weirdly, it doesn't seem as if there's a lot of CPU or IO being used, according to top and iotop - but I was seeing multiple ""migration"" processes (that went away after quitting firefox), suggesting that there are many threads doing very little work in aggregate. After googling a bit I tried setting sync.log.appender.console to Debug and looking at debug console, which didn't tell me anything interesting - it actually looks as if the sync itself completes fast. And, in fact, my bookmarks seem to have synced to today's state correctly.
