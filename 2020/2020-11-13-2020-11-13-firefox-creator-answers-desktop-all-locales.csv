I am still using Flash Player for some web sites and am ask to activate before video will work.  At the end of the year I am told that Flash Player will no longer work.  I asked one of the sites what I should do and they recommended using Chrome and html5 to watch video.  I have also checked several sites to see what can be done with Firefox to continue watching video without changing browsers.  I wish Firefox would put out a step by step process to fix this problem and allow me to use html5 in a Firefox browser.  I am reluctant to uninstall Flash Player until I understand how to make html5 or whatever is required to continue to watch live stream and youtube.  It looks like I have until January before Flash Player is inoperative. BTW, I have Firefox version 82, running Win10 with Shockwave Flash 32.0 r0.

I'm not sure what I'm doing to break it, or it was always broken. All the containers work correctly for me and I love them, but it seems that most of the time when I am trying to leave a container, it won't let me leave. </p><p>I can change containers to other containers, but when I choose ""no container"" it seems to always just duplicate the tab in the exact same container rather than leaving it. It always seems to open a duplicate tab outside the container for just a second, then close that tab and replace it with a duplicate tab still inside the same container. Very strange behavior. </p><p>Thank you for your time and work! </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-820;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",crwagn

The computer (linux) is always on, and firefox is also always running (except when I update to a new version). But I was not using the computer for a while. Today I sat at the computer expecting to see all my tabs that I sent to it via ""send tab to device"", but as soon as firefox started syncing, everything slowed down to a crawl (to the point where even typing to a terminal would have upwards to several seconds of lag). Weirdly, it doesn't seem as if there's a lot of CPU or IO being used, according to top and iotop - but I was seeing multiple ""migration"" processes (that went away after quitting firefox), suggesting that there are many threads doing very little work in aggregate. After googling a bit I tried setting sync.log.appender.console to Debug and looking at debug console, which didn't tell me anything interesting - it actually looks as if the sync itself completes fast. And, in fact, my bookmarks seem to have synced to today's state correctly. (restarting after updating to current version does not seem to help; running in safe mode also doesn't seem to help) </p><p>1) What's up? How do I stop this from happening? </p><p>2) How do I get my ""sent"" tabs? Even a list for the past 2 weeks would be fine.
