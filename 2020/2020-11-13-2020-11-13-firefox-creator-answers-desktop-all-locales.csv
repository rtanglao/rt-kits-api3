The only thing I can do is search for and watch videos. I can't access settings, notifications, or my account. The toolbar on the left side of the page (where your history, playlists, and subscriptions are) works for me most of the time, but not always. Whenever I try to open those menus I just getting the little spinning wheel. I can't post or edit comments (I can see them though).  Live chats don't work either, it always says I'm disconnected. I've tried everything I can think of to solve it, but nothing has worked. I've cleared all my cookies and cache (multiple times), I've tried booting it up in Safe Mode (the problem is still present there), nothing works. The problem does not exist in any other browser or on my iPhone. Anyone have any ideas of what to do? I'd hate to run two browsers just for one site and I don't want to switch away from Firefox. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",HoennMaster
