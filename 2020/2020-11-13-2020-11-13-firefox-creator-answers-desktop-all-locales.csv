This doesn't apply to Firefox (neither Chrome), cause I get a lot of latency from just having google opened in the background. 2 - A LOT of the time, when i click on a link, or open a bookmark or just open a site from results, I get a white tab that will not going to load... It just stays there with the correct URL that I've clicked but the web page doesn't load. To counter this, I have to open multiple tabs or even restart Firefox entirely. 3 - When pages does load, I cannot say that this browser can go as fast as Edge. Youtube puts me at 144p, and when I go higher, it starts to buffer every couple of seconds... this on Edge doesn't happen at all. I whatch 1080p video with little to no interruption all the time. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;needsinfo;windows-10;firefox-820;firefox-8203;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1366988;1366990;,max97.265

The computer (linux) is always on, and firefox is also always running (except when I update to a new version). But I was not using the computer for a while. Today I sat at the computer expecting to see all my tabs that I sent to it via ""send tab to device"", but as soon as firefox started syncing, everything slowed down to a crawl (to the point where even typing to a terminal would have upwards to several seconds of lag). Weirdly, it doesn't seem as if there's a lot of CPU or IO being used, according to top and iotop - but I was seeing multiple ""migration"" processes (that went away after quitting firefox), suggesting that there are many threads doing very little work in aggregate. After googling a bit I tried setting sync.log.appender.console to Debug and looking at debug console, which didn't tell me anything interesting - it actually looks as if the sync itself completes fast. And, in fact, my bookmarks seem to have synced to today's state correctly. (restarting after updating to current version does not seem to help; running in safe mode also doesn't seem to help) </p><p>1) What's up? How do I stop this from happening? </p><p>2) How do I get my ""sent"" tabs? Even a list for the past 2 weeks would be fine.
