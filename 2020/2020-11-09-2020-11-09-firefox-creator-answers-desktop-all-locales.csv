I have always been able to open an attachment, be it Word, PDF or whatever.  Just in the last couple of days, instead, it immediately asks me where to save.  I don't want to save, just to open, look, maybe print.  It forces me to save on the desktop - then open - then discard or print.   What happened?  What changed? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,other,en-US,"",PKSchwarz

When you click on one of the articles, the page half loads then Firefox pops up a yellow bar at the top that says - ""A web page is slowing down your browser. What would you like to do.  Stop it.  Wait."" </p><p>If I click wait, the pop up comes back.  If I stop it, the page doesn't load fully. This happens every single time, it's not intermittent and it's not happening with that website on any of the other browsers I have - MS Edge, Chrome, Opera. No other website I use causes this in Firefox. </p><p>The website is <a href=""https://www.heraldscotland.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.heraldscotland.com</a> </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Jota64

Minhas extensões sumiram da barra de ferramenta e não consigo restaurá-las pois não aparecem em ""Personalizar Firefox"" pra mim poder arrastá-las para a barra de ferramentas. Tenho uma extensão chamada FVD Downloader para baixar videos da internet que só é possível usá-la se ela aparecer na barra de ferramentas, o mesmo também para o Adblock.  Não é problema com extensões desatualizadas e sim do firefox. Deve ter acontecido com as últimas atualizações do firefox. Preciso que seja consertado esse problema. </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-820;,firefox,customize,pt-BR,"",thiago_fo28
