I made sure I had the latest Firefox update, restarted my computer, checked in internet connection, everything I could think of. There is no error message; it just stops loading and the page is totally blank, as you can see on the attached image. I've run out of ideas and know-how. Anyone else had this issue and resolved it? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",jvelmore

I start Firefox or it's already running. I go to the Tools menu or someplace similar, and click something. After that click, the add-on now will either save or copy what would be in the cache to another location till either I turn if off or I close Firefox. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-770;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",billtest002

When you click on one of the articles, the page half loads then Firefox pops up a yellow bar at the top that says - ""A web page is slowing down your browser. What would you like to do.  Stop it.  Wait."" </p><p>If I click wait, the pop up comes back.  If I stop it, the page doesn't load fully. This happens every single time, it's not intermittent and it's not happening with that website on any of the other browsers I have - MS Edge, Chrome, Opera. No other website I use causes this in Firefox. </p><p>The website is <a href=""https://www.heraldscotland.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.heraldscotland.com</a> </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Jota64

Minhas extensões sumiram da barra de ferramenta e não consigo restaurá-las pois não aparecem em ""Personalizar Firefox"" pra mim poder arrastá-las para a barra de ferramentas. Tenho uma extensão chamada FVD Downloader para baixar videos da internet que só é possível usá-la se ela aparecer na barra de ferramentas, o mesmo também para o Adblock.  Não é problema com extensões desatualizadas e sim do firefox. Deve ter acontecido com as últimas atualizações do firefox. Preciso que seja consertado esse problema. </p>",windows-7;desktop;customize;firefox-820;,firefox,customize,pt-BR,"",thiago_fo28
