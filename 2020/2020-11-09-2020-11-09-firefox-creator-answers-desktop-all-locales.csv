I did everything suggested on the Mozilla Troubleshoot list (e.g., Update, Start in Safe Mode, Virus &amp; Malware check, hardware check, Refresh Firefox, etc) but it is still occurring--to the point I'm now compelled to use an alternative browser. However, I'd PREFER to use Firefox. </p><p>My only option as I see it is to Uninstall and Reinstall. Am I missing an easier/cleaner fix? Is a Reinstallation likely to fix the issue, or is there something else happening? </p><p>Cheers A </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-8202;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1365611;1365617;,alizians

My computer is on the older side, but with  ram upgrade to 8 gigs and a new larger hard drive I got it running nicely. Then along came e10s, and, well, now it's a nightmare. The sluggishness is frustrating to say the least, especially when I play my favorite on line game. I used to be able to apply all the fixes out there and remedy the situation, but now nothing works anymore to disable e10s, or is there a way still? The latest remedy, from about a year ago, was to set an environment variable, and some folks reported this working for them, but not so for me. I always make sure not to have a bunch of stuff running in the background, nor do I have a bunch of add-ons and such. Simple, bare bones...Can someone out there help please? </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-820;firefox-8202;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1365613;,cjohnson57
