Very slow browser performance, missing page elements and mainly using social networks like Facebook the browser behaves very slow, slow, getting slower until, to display any post or try to like a comment, the browser crashes and the message ""a page is causing browser problems, want to take action"" appears. </p><p>I use Firefox with Adblock Plus but I have already tested it with other blockers and the behavior is the same, only changes which page Firefox crashes. Using other blockers, Firefox even behaves well but on Youtube ... The slowness stays there. It looks like a scratched CD when the video freezes. </p><p>If I don't use any blockers, the browser works normally, but as the advertisements are a nuisance, I would like Firefox to work ideally again with Adblock Plus. </p><p>Even to come here in the Community and post this text the browser keeps crashing. It takes a few seconds for the words to appear. </p><p>And unfortunately, the option ""Send opinion about Firefox"" stopped working when a search appeared ""Firefox makes me happy or sad"" where I could put some information and mark which site has problems. I don't know if this solves the problems (I have already reported on that channel several times) but now when I log in there is only a message ""thanks for participating in the Firefox survey"". What research? </p><p>Please, check why Firefox since several versions ago has this problem with ad blockers and present solutions ... Or probably fix this bug in a future version. Unfortunately I had to stop using it on a daily basis as it was impossible to use. </p><p>Ah ... Yes, I already tried to reinstall Firefox, run without any extension, all those standard operations ... Nothing unusual. If I deactivate the ad blocker I have no problem, the ads have become a problem. </p><p>alissonpc </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1373403;1373504;,alissonpc

And, when the video is in a modern, widescreen aspect ratio, it usually works. </p><p>The problem is that when I try to watch, in fullscreen, a video that's in a 4:3 ratio, as many are on Netflix, Amazon and the like, the Picture-in-Picture window will often, presumably registering the black space on either side, zoom right into the video, cutting off a massive portion of the frame and filling the screen completely. Sometimes it doesn't do that at all, sometime it can be fixed by restarting the video and fiddling with the timings and sometimes there's just seemingly nothing I can do and it just will not stop doing it, no matter how much I reload or what I do!  </p><p><em>Please</em> tell me how I can get the damn thing to just keep the video in place and stop it deciding ""Hey!
