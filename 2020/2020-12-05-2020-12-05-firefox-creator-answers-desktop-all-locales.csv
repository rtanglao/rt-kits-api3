I am asking this because of i want all links open with new tabs. I have read the article: <a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1205311"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1205311</a>, the extension that the expert recommends does not work as expected, but middle click works perfect everywhere. I am sorry if I doubled the known question, but i failed to find anything clear. Thank you. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",amilt

And, when the video is in a modern, widescreen aspect ratio, it usually works. </p><p>The problem is that when I try to watch, in fullscreen, a video that's in a 4:3 ratio, as many are on Netflix, Amazon and the like, the Picture-in-Picture window will often, presumably registering the black space on either side, zoom right into the video, cutting off a massive portion of the frame and filling the screen completely. Sometimes it doesn't do that at all, sometime it can be fixed by restarting the video and fiddling with the timings and sometimes there's just seemingly nothing I can do and it just will not stop doing it, no matter how much I reload or what I do!  </p><p><em>Please</em> tell me how I can get the damn thing to just keep the video in place and stop it deciding ""Hey! You don't need to see <em>all</em> of the video, do you?! No, of course you don't!"" </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,other,en-US,"",killeriguana666
