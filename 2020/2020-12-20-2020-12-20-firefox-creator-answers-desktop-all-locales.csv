Up to and with version 79.0 there were no ""jerks"" even so all ani's ran at the same time. Now I am aware that the code of my website is anything but well efficient or short and sweet. Also my PC with a Windows 7 Ultimate is rather not up to date, but as I said up to and with Firefox 79.0 everything worked fine for me. Also on my smartphones Xiomi Mi MIX 2s (Android 10(lineage_polaris OS)) &amp; BQ Aquaris X (Android 8(lineage_bardock OS)) the same picture, up to 79.0 OK, from then and up to 84.0 no longer. Especially with the flag Ani <a href=""https://mihalic.ch/index2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mihalic.ch/index2.html</a> and the Orbit Ani Index.html, as well as the animated menu function description that can be displayed, somehow something no longer works well during rendering.  </p><p>If you could give me a hint, if in the future there is any hope at all for such' amateur html code, I would be grateful &amp; glad. With kind regards and best wishes for this as well as the next year 2021 - Love Mario </p><p>Translated with <a href=""http://www.DeepL.com/Translator"" rel=""nofollow"">www.DeepL.com/Translator</a> (free version) </p><p>Hallo Firefox Support Team, </p><p>Seit den Updates von Firefox 79.0 aufwärts (bis und mit 84.0) laufen einige Animationen, meiner Kindergedichte Webseite, nicht mehr flüssig und rund ab. Bis und mit Version 79.0 gab es keinerlei ""Ruckeleien"" auch so alle Ani's zugleich liefen. Nun bin ich mir bewusst dass der Code meiner Webseite alles andere als gut effizient oder kurz und knapp gehalten ist. Auch mein PC mit einem Windows 7 Ultimate ist ja eher nicht zeitgemäss, doch wie gesagt bis und mit Firefox 79.0 klappte mir noch alles gut. Auch auf meinen Smartphones Xiomi Mi MIX 2s (Android 10(Lineage_polaris OS))&amp; BQ Aquaris X (Android 8(lineage_bardock OS)) das gleiche Bild, bis 79.0 OK, ab da und bis 84.0 nicht mehr. Vor allem bei der Fahnen Ani index2.html und der Orbit Ani Index.html, sowie der einblendbaren animierten Menü Funktions beschreibung klappt irgendwie beim Rendern zeitlich was nicht mehr gut.  </p><p>Wenn sie mir einen Tipp geben könnten, falls künftig überhaupt noch Hoffnung für solch' laienhaften html code besteht, wäre ich dankbar &amp; froh.

Yesterday I sent two or three E-mails successfully, but then on the next one I got a message saying "" too many messages - TT 1602."" I checked to see what this meant, and discovered a post saying I should change my outgoing server setting from 587 to 25. ( but 587 has always worked fine until now ! ) Changed the setting to 25 and re-sent the E-mail. There was a different error message which said the server address had not been recognised. However, the E-mail did get sent. Tried the same thing with a second E-mail, got the same message, but the E-mail got sent. This morning I decided to re-set my outgoing server connection back to 587 to see what would happen when I attempted to send another E-mail. Back on 587 all seems to be working OK once more. But for how long ? Is there a problem with Thunderbird ? Can someone perhaps explain what are the "" correct "" server connections / settings for both in-coming and out-going servers ?

I can connect with Paypal via someone else's site.  (This had a been a problem in the past, but now, isn't.)

When I do, the whole page goes BLANK. </p><p>When I try doing this with Google Chrome, the page comes up properly... EXCEPT, in that browser, suddenly, it doesn't want to connect to MY BANK.

WTF?  I suspect the problem is with Firefox... but can't be sure.  I have called my bank, they assure me there IS no problem at their end. </p><p>So at the moment, if I want to use Paypal via a site like EBAY, no problem.  But if I want to send money thru Paypal's site itself, at the moment, I CAN'T.  And I can't even get an answer from them.
