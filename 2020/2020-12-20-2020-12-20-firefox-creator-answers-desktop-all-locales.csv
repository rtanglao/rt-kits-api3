I finally was able to login in to the machine. It took a long time for it to go through the windows up date. When it did Window had changed all by browser setting for BING to be my browser. I spent time trying to clean up that mess. When I got to Firefox, it opened like I had never be in it before. When I did get logged in to the account and Firefox opened I had No Book Marks. While, working on the help request I check my pocket (I really love that Feature) and I was prompted to sign in and did. I behave like I had never accessed Pockets. I tried 3 times to use my account information and got user information is invalid (It's been the same since I started using pockets .  I be weeks fixing the book marks and may never get all the Pocket stuff back.  </p><p>I have a Laptop that uses Firefox. I checked it to see if there was any (silly stuff with it) and both bookmarks and pocket content have been available on it.  The check show the bookmarks appear to 100% ok. There is no pocket icon on the laptop and the icon on the PC directs me to create an account or sign in my email and password are the same to login for Firefox and Pocket.

Not so. I have checked all the shortcuts in Firefox and Snap and see no problems. I enclose a shot of the Firefox History stuff that gets superimposed at the top of the scrolling snapshot. I also tried deleting all my history but still got something. Not only does it include login stuff but also logout stuff.

I can connect with Paypal via someone else's site.  (This had a been a problem in the past, but now, isn't.)  However... for the first time... when I go to Paypal's site direct using Firefox, I can sign in, everything looks okay... UNTIL I try to click on ""<strong>SEND AND RECEIVE</strong>"".  When I do, the whole page goes BLANK. </p><p>When I try doing this with Google Chrome, the page comes up properly... EXCEPT, in that browser, suddenly, it doesn't want to connect to MY BANK.  Even though in one corner of the page, I can see my bank clearly listed. </p><p>I've tried several times calling Paypal on the phone in the last 2-3 weeks, but each time, I get a recorded message saying, ""a tech support person MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE"".  WTF?  I suspect the problem is with Firefox... but can't be sure.  I have called my bank, they assure me there IS no problem at their end. </p><p>So at the moment, if I want to use Paypal via a site like EBAY, no problem.  But if I want to send money thru Paypal's site itself, at the moment, I CAN'T.  And I can't even get an answer from them. (This is preventing me from buying from sellers at the ""Todolcollecion"" site in Spain, which I have used MANY times in the past.) </p><p>Any ideas? </p>",windows-7;desktop;websites;firefox-840;,firefox,websites,en-US,1377314;,profh0011
