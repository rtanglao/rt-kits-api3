Yesterday I sent two or three E-mails successfully, but then on the next one I got a message saying "" too many messages - TT 1602."" I checked to see what this meant, and discovered a post saying I should change my outgoing server setting from 587 to 25. ( but 587 has always worked fine until now ! ) Changed the setting to 25 and re-sent the E-mail. There was a different error message which said the server address had not been recognised. However, the E-mail did get sent. Tried the same thing with a second E-mail, got the same message, but the E-mail got sent. This morning I decided to re-set my outgoing server connection back to 587 to see what would happen when I attempted to send another E-mail. Back on 587 all seems to be working OK once more. But for how long ? Is there a problem with Thunderbird ? Can someone perhaps explain what are the "" correct "" server connections / settings for both in-coming and out-going servers ? Thank you very much. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Steamgo

(b) allow popups for the site I'm visiting - again, not what I want, or (c) allow this specific popup this time. </p><p>It would be great if there were options like: </p><p>- allow popups taking me to domain/url x (e.g. I trust my nextcloud site) - allow popups clicked from the bookmarks toolbar - allow popups from a particular bookmarklet </p><p>Do any work arounds exist?

I can connect with Paypal via someone else's site.  (This had a been a problem in the past, but now, isn't.)  However... for the first time... when I go to Paypal's site direct using Firefox, I can sign in, everything looks okay... UNTIL I try to click on ""<strong>SEND AND RECEIVE</strong>"".  When I do, the whole page goes BLANK. </p><p>When I try doing this with Google Chrome, the page comes up properly... EXCEPT, in that browser, suddenly, it doesn't want to connect to MY BANK.  Even though in one corner of the page, I can see my bank clearly listed. </p><p>I've tried several times calling Paypal on the phone in the last 2-3 weeks, but each time, I get a recorded message saying, ""a tech support person MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE"".  WTF?  I suspect the problem is with Firefox... but can't be sure.  I have called my bank, they assure me there IS no problem at their end. </p><p>So at the moment, if I want to use Paypal via a site like EBAY, no problem.  But if I want to send money thru Paypal's site itself, at the moment, I CAN'T.  And I can't even get an answer from them.
