I am running the latest version of Firefox (I think) version 84.0.  I exported my logins on my old PC to a .csv file with no problem.  Now, I'm trying get Firefox to load that file. I've seen help responses that talk about getting to a submenu in the Login/Password section, but those responses indicate that one of the choices should be ""Import from a file"". But I'm not seeing that choice.  I see ""Import from another browser"" in that menu, but I don't see ""Import from a file""... any suggestions? </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1377275;,jrcooperjr

I found instructions on the web, but I can't make them work without sight.    To turn on cookies: list of 5 items 1. Click the menu button. ...  2. Select the Privacy &amp; Security panel and go to the Cookies and Site Data section. 3. Make sure Accept cookies and site data from websites (recommended) is selected. 4. Make sure Accept third-party cookies and site data is set to Always. ...  5. Click Exceptions…. Using only the keyboard, I cannot find the section of which they speak in the above instructions, though I found something called Menu.  So how can a totally-blind person reliably reach Security and Privacy section to adjust cookies?  I have had a couple of sites pop up an error saying that I apparently have cookies disabled; but I don't remember disabling them, nor do I actually know how to do it.  I will appreciate help. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1377261;1377264;,knobman
