Suddenly I had no sound. I panicked. I checked everything but it all looked ok. I opened another browser (Microsoft Edge) and I did have sound there. I know Flash is going away but I listen to a lot of video and need to know what it is I am supposed to do in order to get sound in FF. I run Win10 Home, version 1909. installed on 1/14/2020. What I did was to reinstall Flash and then finished listening to my shows. I hope you are able to help me. Thanks Helene </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",tek360

Not so. I have checked all the shortcuts in Firefox and Snap and see no problems. I enclose a shot of the Firefox History stuff that gets superimposed at the top of the scrolling snapshot. I also tried deleting all my history but still got something. Not only does it include login stuff but also logout stuff.

I can connect with Paypal via someone else's site.  (This had a been a problem in the past, but now, isn't.)  However... for the first time... when I go to Paypal's site direct using Firefox, I can sign in, everything looks okay... UNTIL I try to click on ""<strong>SEND AND RECEIVE</strong>"".  When I do, the whole page goes BLANK. </p><p>When I try doing this with Google Chrome, the page comes up properly... EXCEPT, in that browser, suddenly, it doesn't want to connect to MY BANK.  Even though in one corner of the page, I can see my bank clearly listed. </p><p>I've tried several times calling Paypal on the phone in the last 2-3 weeks, but each time, I get a recorded message saying, ""a tech support person MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE"".  WTF?  I suspect the problem is with Firefox... but can't be sure.  I have called my bank, they assure me there IS no problem at their end. </p><p>So at the moment, if I want to use Paypal via a site like EBAY, no problem.  But if I want to send money thru Paypal's site itself, at the moment, I CAN'T.  And I can't even get an answer from them. (This is preventing me from buying from sellers at the ""Todolcollecion"" site in Spain, which I have used MANY times in the past.) </p><p>Any ideas? </p>",windows-7;desktop;websites;firefox-840;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",profh0011
