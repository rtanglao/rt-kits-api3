Today it's crashed 4-5 times in 10 minutes. I tried sfc /scannow just now and there were no integrity violations. I've always submitted the crash report immediately after each event, however the last few were unsubmitted when I checked the log just now, so I've submitted them too. Firefox has always been updated to the latest version. Any ideas? Cheers Ian </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-810;firefox-8102;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",zobrdrool
