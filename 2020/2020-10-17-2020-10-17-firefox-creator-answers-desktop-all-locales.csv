This problem only occurred tonight. I have two Facebook accounts. One account works perfectly as it always has done but the other account will not load up at all. When I enter ""<a href=""http://www.facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.facebook.com</a>"" with account B selected, it does a lot of searching and then stops without bringing up a Facebook page. When I use other browsers such as Internet Explorer or Google Chrome, both my Facebook accounts come up no problem. It is as though a block was placed on account B but not on account A as far as Firefox is concerned.  Any advice would be gratefully appreciated. I am running a PC with Windows 7 and I have the latest version of Firefox installed. </p>",windows-7;desktop;websites;firefox-810;,firefox,websites,en-US,1358998;,himself1

It seems like after a while or if I have more than a couple tabs already open, clicking on a link or choosing a bookmarked site to open a new tab does nothing.  By nothing I mean the tab will open with the URL displayed, but FF is not actively trying to connect to the requested URL.  The stop and refresh buttons are grayed out.  My only course of action is to close that tab and try again, which typically just repeats the previous steps.  It's not website dependent because once this begins happening, any attempt to open a website in a new tab hangs. </p><p>I do not remember if attempts to open new websites in existing tabs are successful as I cannot duplicate the problem right now.  The only think I know that's successful it to close FF and restart it.  When I close the program and reopen it, I notice quite frequently that I get a message that FF is already open so I tell it to close and reopen.  Also, the last time this problem happened was a few minutes ago and I had four tabs open.  I noticed that there were TEN separate processes running, all called ""firefox.exe"".  Opening an error-free, single-tab instance of FF resulted in four separate processes running.  Right now, I have two tabs open - the one in which I'm writing this question plus another, static page.  This is resulting in SEVEN separate processes running! </p><p>I have not attempted to refresh FF yet as I currently don't want to hassle with all the customization I've done and most likely forgotten how to do. </p><p>I'm running Win7 Pro with 16GB.

Today it's crashed 4-5 times in 10 minutes. I tried sfc /scannow just now and there were no integrity violations. I've always submitted the crash report immediately after each event, however the last few were unsubmitted when I checked the log just now, so I've submitted them too. Firefox has always been updated to the latest version. Any ideas? Cheers Ian </p>",windows-7;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-810;firefox-8102;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1358802;1358841;,zobrdrool
