(used PaleMoon before) ""The keyword.URL preference is no longer used in Firefox 23 or above and setting the engine for address bar searches is now done from the Search Bar -see  Search with the Firefox address bar."" </p><p>However, the ""Search with the Firefox address bar"" page shows (if I have not overlooked something) only the GUI guide and it is only for the current profile. My question is rather; is there a way to change the default search engine from Google to DuckDuckGo by a config file, e.g. lockPref, please? I would like the setting to affect all the profiles and be in the installation folder if possible. </p><p>Thank you very much for any information. Also, I am sorry if I have overlooked a post dealing with this problem - the search query ""default search"" returns 870 posts. Here comes the 871st I guess, heh. </p>",linux;desktop;customize;firefox-810;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",Carduus

I have all my settings in the FF options to use Adobe Reader for all PDF and other Adobe documents to use Adobe Reader, but FF still insists on opening PDF files and changing all PDF icons to the FF icon (i.e., breaking the PDF associations with Adobe Reader that I had previously set). I have to go into my control panel to associate the PDF extension with Adobe each time this happens. </p><p>How can I stop FF from doing this? </p>",desktop;customize;,firefox,customize,en-US,1358790;,LesF
