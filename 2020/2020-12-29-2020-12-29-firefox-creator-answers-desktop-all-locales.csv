I have Firefox and Firefox Sync installed/setup on a number of PCs and Phones. I turned on an old machine, I think in July 2020, and polluted my sync with old bookmarks. Now Marc had some good advice here: </p><p><a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1212089#answer-1099270"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1212089#answer-1099270</a> </p><p>&gt; For what it's worth, another reliable way to remove all data from the server is to visit about:preferences#sync, disable one of the data-types (say, bookmarks) and perform a manual sync - all bookmarks will then be removed from the server. Re-enabling and re-syncing will re-upload all your local bookmarks </p><p>So I found this process worked to restore a previous good set of bookmarks before the polluted sync: 1) on any PC, perform the above to remove the online sync 2) disable all syncing on that PC 3) restore previous known-good bookmarks 4) re-enable syncing </p><p>But then, any one of your other devices, which all synced the polluted sync, will just sync the  polluted sync back to the server again, which will then sync it back to all devices: so my polluted sync returned again, everywhere. In particular, I found that any phone you have syncing will keep the bad sync running and cause it to be re-synced everywhere, until you uninstall Firefox from that phone. So the following is how I finally managed to return to my pre-bad-sync state (which had to be done in exactly this order): </p><p>1) uninstall Firefox on any phone 2) disconnect any PCs from the internet 3) on your 'newest' PC, do the above 4 steps to restore good sync on that machine and to the online sync server 4) on any other PCs, copy the JSON bookmarks file you used in the last step to those PCs and restore it to those also, reconnect them after (since they will no longer pollute the good online sync once their data has been made good) 5) reinstall Firefox on all phones and set up each to sync again </p><p>As you can imagine, this was quite time consuming to get right, and I now live in fear of turning on an old PC (in particular we don't know HOW stale an old sync has to be to cause this problem, so its a constant worry!). And note that bookmarks was all I cared about: I don't know what I would have done if I also cared about other sync data </p><p>This is a complex issue, hence I want to limit what I'm asking here. I just want to know the best/easiest way of avoiding this happening again.  How about this: If we are, perhaps, safe to assume that any PC which has synced in the past year is 'safe' from this problem, maybe the easiest solution is to treat any PC which hasn't been turned on for longer than 1 year with kid gloves? If so, what's the simplest thing to do when turning on any such PC? The first step is surely to disconnect it from the internet before Firefox starts up, and then what? (remove Firefox entirely? restore good JSON? delete user profile? etc etc - I'd like to know what are the exact steps I take, in order, so maybe a bullet list (I have both Macos and Windows machines, and an Iphone and an Android phone). I'd also like to know if this issue is likely to affect phones in just the same way: say I turn on an old phone because I have to take my new phone to be repaired: is this just as dangerous as turning on an old PC? </p><p>I'd welcome any other thoughts on this issue also of course. (Note I haven't shared data about my OS/Browser etc since by its very nature this issue is cross-platform and spans numerous versions of FF) </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",tonywoode

It explains why cookies can be a security and privacy risk (copy of part the article below). </p><p>With this in mind, '''<em><strong>I am wondering how wise it is to keep any cookies that do not expire quickly on their own, but particularly those kept to “help” (for convenience) to avoid MF authentication. If hijacked, the hijackers could get access to what they should not have.'''</strong></em> </p><p><strong>Do I understand correctly that not deleting cookies on the computer can open it up to hijackers? </strong> If so, is cookie hijacking a frequent occurrence? It seems that there are many methods to hijack cookies.  There are websites that do not use HTTPS.  Does using VPN help?<strong> </strong> </p> <hr> <p>""It’s not like you can get a virus from a cookie; after all, they are just simple text files and do not contain any sort of executable. Yet, depending on how cookies are used and exposed, they can represent a serious security risk. </p><p>For instance, cookies can be hijacked. As most websites utilize cookies as the only identifiers for user sessions, if a cookie is hijacked, an attacker could be able to impersonate a user and gain unauthorized access. </p><p>This may happen in several different ways: </p><p><strong>Capturing cookies over insecure channels</strong>: Any cookie related to authentication should always be transmitted securely, but that is not always the case. One example is cookies without a security flag. When a cookie is set with the Secure flag, it instructs the browser that the cookie can only be accessed over secure SSL/TLS channels. If the secure flag is not set, a cookie can be transmitted in cleartext — for instance, if the user visits any HTTP URLs within the cookie’s scope. This would allow an attacker eavesdropping network traffic to easily capture the cookie and use it to gain illegitimate access.  </p><p><strong>Session fixation</strong>: This is another attack that allows an attacker to hijack a valid user session. This time, it exploits a limitation in the way the web application manages the session ID. For example, if an application allows a session token in the query parameters, an attacker may send a user an URL with a specific session ID included in its arguments. Now, when the user authenticates by using this URL, the attacker can hijack the session.  </p><p><strong>Cross-site scripting (XSS</strong>): Another way to steal cookies is using cross-site scripting to exploit websites that allows users to post unfiltered HTML and JavaScript content. For example, if a user clicks on a malicious link posted by an attacker, it may execute the JavaScript code and cause the victim’s web browser to send the victim’s cookies to a website the attacker controls.  </p><p><strong>Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)</strong>: This is a type of attack that exploits a website by making it execute unauthorized commands that are transmitted from a user that the web application trusts.  In a CSRF attack, the attacker’s objective is to use an innocent victim to unknowingly submit a maliciously crafted web request to a website that the victim has privileged access to. Since the victim is already logged, any request coming from his browser will be deemed as trustworthy and be executed.  </p><p>For an CSRF attack to work, an attacker must first identify a reproducible web request that executes a specific action — for example, changing a password on the target page. Once such a request is identified, a link can be created that generates this malicious request and that link can be embedded on a page within the attacker’s control. Even worse, it may not even be necessary for the victim to click the link. For instance, it may be embedded within an html image tag on an email sent to the victim, which will automatically be loaded when the victim opens their email.  </p><p><strong>Cookie tossing</strong>: A cookie tossing attack is based on providing a user with a malicious cookie that has been designed to look like it came from the targeted site’s subdomain. Of course, this becomes especially problematic when a  website allows untrusted people to host subdomains under its domain. When the user visits the target site, all cookies are sent, both valid and the ones appearing to be from subdomains.  In this attack, the ability to take over a session is quite limited, because the attacker can only write information, not read anything. However, cookie tossing can be used to set arbitrary cookie values that, in some cases, can be used for a CSRF attack or an XSS injection, depending on what the main domain does with the content of the cookie. </p><p>Cookies may also represent a severe risk to privacy.
