And they all have to deal with when ever I try to move one tab from one window to another. </p><p>It used to be that I would try to move the tab, but then it didn't actually move it because just low enough for Firefox to decide that I actually wanted it to be a bookmark instead. Then it started to make it a bookmark because it was too high and hit the bookmark menu tab. </p><p>And now today it has added on the worst one yet, where if I don't put the tab right between the tabs of the other window it now decides that I actually wanted to turn one of those tabs into the one I was moving over. </p><p>Out of all of those this mos recent one is the most worthless of features because how much use it could give is vastly outweighed by its constant hindrance. </p><p>Is there any way to turn off any/all of these features? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,customize,en-US,1371395;,ZachTJ00

There is a blue ""Reload"" button, and when I click it, I can briefly see the screenshot for a split second before ""The Media Could Not Be Played"" re-appears. </p><p>With YouTube videos, they fail to play and I get the message ""An error occurred.
