I am in a serious dllema here.  I was just about to hire someone to do this work on upwork or fiverr or the like when I did a search and confirmed that my saved passwords are also stored in this file.  I have tried Everything I can find to get my 90 megs of tabs back, which a stupid verizon hot spot network log in screen crashed and I am just about at the end of my rope.  I  </p><p>have been through hours and hours of fooling with this.

And they all have to deal with when ever I try to move one tab from one window to another. </p><p>It used to be that I would try to move the tab, but then it didn't actually move it because just low enough for Firefox to decide that I actually wanted it to be a bookmark instead. Then it started to make it a bookmark because it was too high and hit the bookmark menu tab. </p><p>And now today it has added on the worst one yet, where if I don't put the tab right between the tabs of the other window it now decides that I actually wanted to turn one of those tabs into the one I was moving over. </p><p>Out of all of those this mos recent one is the most worthless of features because how much use it could give is vastly outweighed by its constant hindrance. </p><p>Is there any way to turn off any/all of these features? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",ZachTJ00

Specifically, when I read webpages which have embedded Twitter images or videos, I see the message ""The Media Could Not Be Played"" where a screenshot of the media used to appear.  There is a blue ""Reload"" button, and when I click it, I can briefly see the screenshot for a split second before ""The Media Could Not Be Played"" re-appears. </p><p>With YouTube videos, they fail to play and I get the message ""An error occurred.  Please try again later"".  This happens with both embedded videos on webpages, and directly on the YouTube website itself. </p><p>All of this media works properly when I open the same pages in another browser like Chrome.  I would prefer not to switch browsers.  Is there a way to fix this error? </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-710;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1371356;,box37

I had been using it before to chat, but not on Firefox at all during the session at the time. No music or videos were playing in any of my tabs. After a while, it no longer picked it up, but I know for certain that there was no output of sound coming from my computer.
