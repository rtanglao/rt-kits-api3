I hope this makes sense. In other words, right now I'm on the Mozilla support page writing this. If I click on a bookmark in the bookmarks bar, it always opens a new tab. I want to force it to stay on this tab and go to the bookmark. Thanks. </p>",desktop;beta;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1363505;1363523;,PlainDave

For the past few years, these websites all stay logged in, even when I have Firefox set to delete cookies when the browser is closed, in part because I have these websites all carefully noted in the cookies and site data exceptions. As I said, I've never had problems for the past few years. But since the most recent update a few weeks ago, all of my websites log me out after 24 hrs. I even changed the main cookies settings to not delete any cookies when the browser is closed, but that makes no difference. Something has changed in the most recent Firefox that has disabled the managed exceptions to cookie deletion. I'd love some help on how to fix this, as changing settings does not seem to do it. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-820;firefox-8202;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1363438;1363444;1363446;,decorus_veritas
