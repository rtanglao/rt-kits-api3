Task manager says it takes around 1 GB Ram It also says that 8 GB system memory is still free. When I start virtual machine in VMWARE (ver. 16) I get a problem. (VM is configured to use 6 GR of RAM.) VMWare reports an error when opening the vdmk file for some reason. If I click on retry usually system crashes. (no message, just black screen, never responding). In some cases it responds after several minutes but crashes later. Sometimes Firefox crashes, it simply disappears from screen. </p><p>I tried to investigate what could be the reason and I tried different combinations but this happens only when Firefox is open. If I have any other memory intensive programs open and I open VM it never crashes. </p><p>Anybody having the same issue? </p><p>Thanks for help </p><p>Jaro </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jgriscik

For the past few years, these websites all stay logged in, even when I have Firefox set to delete cookies when the browser is closed, in part because I have these websites all carefully noted in the cookies and site data exceptions. As I said, I've never had problems for the past few years. But since the most recent update a few weeks ago, all of my websites log me out after 24 hrs. I even changed the main cookies settings to not delete any cookies when the browser is closed, but that makes no difference. Something has changed in the most recent Firefox that has disabled the managed exceptions to cookie deletion. I'd love some help on how to fix this, as changing settings does not seem to do it. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-820;firefox-8202;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1363438;1363444;1363446;,decorus_veritas
