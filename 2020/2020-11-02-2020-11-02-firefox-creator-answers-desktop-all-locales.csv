Próbáltam már minden lehetséges megoldást, amit a neten találtam, de egyik sem oldotta meg a kérdést.

Maybe I should just install them in seperate Locations? But wouldn't the Profile Folder in /AppData/ still be the same and i had the same Problem when opening a wrong profile by accident? How can I get rid off braking my profiles by accident? Right now i changed the order of the Profiles and seperated Default &amp; Devleoper Profiles from eacht other with a ""seperation profile"" in between them named ""______________________"", so I don't accidentely open the wrong Profile in about:profiles, but there has to be a better solution, right? I also checked out the Profile Manager, but don't see the benefit in switching between Profiles. I probably could use shortcuts, make a shortcut for every Default Profile and a shortcut for every Developer Profile i have and open them by click, but i prefer to switch Profiles in about:config or at least that's the most comfortable way i know to do it. </p><p>Thanks for your Help </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",michael.hammer

Since few weeks, a specific request is not properly handled by firefox. The request is sended to the API, but it doesn't appear in the ""network"" tab of the inspector (opened with F12), so that my application can't get the return of the API. </p><p><br> <strong>B/ More in depht</strong> </p><p>More precisions about the problem : - the server use HTTPS with auto-signed certificate - the request is called as POST - the array of posted data is more than 10 short elements sized - the API return a message in few minuts (the app wait correctly the return) </p><p><br> <strong>C/ What I tested before ask here ?</strong> - Using a different navigator (exclude a programming problem) --&gt; works - Try to make an other POST request, here for login (works fine) (exclude API or security problem) --&gt; works - Using a old version of firefox (62) --&gt; works fine - Then update to actual firefox version (82.0.2) --&gt; doesn't works anymore - Using ""private navigation"" --&gt; works - Delete cached data and cookies --&gt; doesn't change anything - When I'm developping I use a local webserver for the web application, but the target API is the same --&gt; works (and using same version of firefox) </p><p><br> <strong>D/ The request doesn't appear in the network tracker tab</strong> This THE mysterious point : when I launch the network tab, I can see all requests sended by my application. I GET my differents pages fine, I can log-in fine using POST (and I see this request), but when I would launch the other POST request : firefox doesn't catch any new request. In normal case, firefox catch the request and waits for a response ; but now : there's nothing. </p><p>I join you screenshots in both normal &amp; private navigation modes. In private navigation mode, we can see that firefox handled the POST request and waits for response In ""normal"" mode, when can't see the POST request, but we can see that a PATCH request works In addition, the last image show the access.log of the Apache2 server, and we can see that the API give the response (but firefox doens't see that) </p><p><br> I don't very know where to search now, this is why I post my message here, I hope someone helps me ! :) Thanks in advance and sorry for english mistakes ! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",marbonmb

As I said, I've never had problems for the past few years. But since the most recent update a few weeks ago, all of my websites log me out after 24 hrs. I even changed the main cookies settings to not delete any cookies when the browser is closed, but that makes no difference.
