Logo, baixei o Adwcleaner e o Malwarebytes e eles acharam um adware relacionado a Amazon, da extensão do Amazon assistant (a única que usava). Também baixei o Adblock para me previnir futuramente. Enfim, meus dados estão seguros mesmo tendo entrado naquela página e não ter clicado em nada? Obrigado! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,pt-BR,"",arwscs

""Abandoning"" a lost bookmark location and creating a duplicate does not seem right. </p><p>There MUST be a way to find where a bookmark is located.  What am I missing? </p><p>Thanks in advance, Beverly Howard </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-81;firefox-820;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",bevhoward
1311314,2020-11-01 16:03:04 -0800,2020-11-01 16:45:47 -0800,Firefox Cookies Being Deleted,"<p>Since the most recent Firefox for Windows update, all of my Firefox browsers on my PCs have suddenly stopped saving my already logged in cookies for my major use websites, such as Facebook, Outlook, Amazon, and Netflix. For the past few years, these websites all stay logged in, even when I have Firefox set to delete cookies when the browser is closed, in part because I have these websites all carefully noted in the cookies and site data exceptions. As I said, I've never had problems for the past few years. But since the most recent update a few weeks ago, all of my websites log me out after 24 hrs. I even changed the main cookies settings to not delete any cookies when the browser is closed, but that makes no difference. Something has changed in the most recent Firefox that has disabled the managed exceptions to cookie deletion. I'd love some help on how to fix this, as changing settings does not seem to do it. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-820;firefox-8202;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1363438;1363444;1363446;,decorus_veritas
