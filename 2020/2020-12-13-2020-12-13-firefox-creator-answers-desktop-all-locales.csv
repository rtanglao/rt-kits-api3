How do I get the old one back?,"<p>When I opened Firefox I received a ""news message"" that makes no sense to me.  How can I revert Firefox to its former usefulness?  There is something about the former installation of Firefox being undisturbed, but I cannot find that installation.  Apparently this has something to do with sync-ing my desktop Firefox with other installations -- I've less than zero interest in sync-ing. </p><p>What happened to the bookmarks I had stored in the bookmark bar?

Seems to only happen when browsing eBay. The issues appears frequently but randomly. May occur immediately or after an hour of browsing. I have updated drives with no change. I have tried disabling hardware acceleration and while that did seem to help the performance hit was unacceptable. This is a very basic i7 with Intel HD graphics so nothing sophisticated. Screen captures are attached. The screen will completely corrupt then fix itself in a few seconds to minutes. A few versions back I used to see black lines on eBay pages but that has been cleared up for a while. Now it is this. I have refreshed Firefox, done a complete uninstall/reinstall, cleared all cache and browser history and tested other browsers. Issue seems to follow Firefox. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mail_list
