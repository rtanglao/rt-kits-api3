I tried other websites, where I didn't have any problem. Other keys (SHIFT, ALT) don't cause the same issue. </p><p>I tried to click only CTRL, which caused the issue. </p><p>Finally, with a hunch, I disabled the CTRL pointer location in GNOME Tweaks and the problem was gone. Somehow, something about <a href=""http://duckduckgo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">duckduckgo.com</a> with pointer location, focus is lost. I didn't that shouldn't happen and potentially more websites are affected by this. </p><p>Is this a bug? Or is there a problem on <a href=""http://duckduckgo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">duckduckgo.com</a> side? </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",sarentasciyan
