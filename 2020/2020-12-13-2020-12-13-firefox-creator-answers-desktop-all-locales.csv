Seems to only happen when browsing eBay. The issues appears frequently but randomly. May occur immediately or after an hour of browsing. I have updated drives with no change. I have tried disabling hardware acceleration and while that did seem to help the performance hit was unacceptable. This is a very basic i7 with Intel HD graphics so nothing sophisticated. Screen captures are attached. The screen will completely corrupt then fix itself in a few seconds to minutes. A few versions back I used to see black lines on eBay pages but that has been cleared up for a while. Now it is this. I have refreshed Firefox, done a complete uninstall/reinstall, cleared all cache and browser history and tested other browsers. Issue seems to follow Firefox. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mail_list

I tried other websites, where I didn't have any problem. Other keys (SHIFT, ALT) don't cause the same issue. </p><p>I tried to click only CTRL, which caused the issue. </p><p>Finally, with a hunch, I disabled the CTRL pointer location in GNOME Tweaks and the problem was gone. Somehow, something about <a href=""http://duckduckgo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">duckduckgo.com</a> with pointer location, focus is lost. I didn't that shouldn't happen and potentially more websites are affected by this. </p><p>Is this a bug? Or is there a problem on <a href=""http://duckduckgo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">duckduckgo.com</a> side? </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",sarentasciyan
