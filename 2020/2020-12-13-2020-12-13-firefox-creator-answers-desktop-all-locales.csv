I had all my bookmarks linked to my profile before I sent it in for repair. </p><p>I received my laptop a couple of days ago and I can see the web history going back to when I purchased the laptop, but there are no bookmarks (save a single one) from before I sent in my laptop for repair. </p><p>I looked at the about:profiles but one is a default profile with no history and one is default-release with my web history (and one bookmark). Neither have my the entirety of my bookmarks.  </p><p>Please let me know if there's anything I can do to recover my BMs. </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",kadrii
