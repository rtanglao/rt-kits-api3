Since I set those preferences some websites, mainly ones with form fields, come up as a boxed question mark. Also when I do an internet search is comes out crazy alien like text / weird code. See attached screen shot of a basic search for 'books'. I prefer using Firefox over Safari and would love to remedy this. </p><p>Using current version 83 on Mac OS 10.15.7. </p><p>Thank you </p>",mac-os;desktop;customize;firefox-830;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",bba3littlebirds

Click here to visit our frequently asked questions about HTML5 video."" so I've tried to click on the link but then Firefox said my browser was already up to date. I've then tried to disable my adds on and try in safe mode but that did not help. I've tried installing some adds on, that didn't help either. I've tried uninstalling and installing back Firefox, that didn't work. every media.mediasource config are enabled, that didn't work. and when i try using another browser, the media can be played just fine (i used chromium). So if someone has any idea as to what might be causing this issue i'd be grateful (also, older video seems to be working just fine) </p>",linux;desktop;websites;firefox-830;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",guillaumemannone
