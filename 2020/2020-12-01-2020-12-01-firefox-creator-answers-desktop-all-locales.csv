Simple. <strong>Problem:</strong> When Left Clicking to stop the scroll, Firefox positions the web page much further down the page requiring manual scrolling back to find the article.

But now when I turn my computer on and Firefox opens, things go very slowly. Opening a new window (tab) can take up to a minute.  If I get 3/4 windows open, moving from one to another can take ages. Eventually, after about five minutes, everything is as it should be, and I can do everything at the usual great speed. But if I am away from the computer for an hour or so and then return to it, everything is ridiculously slow again.  After about five minutes, it's flying again! Once it gets going again, things are so good and fast I can't believe there is a major problem. I have done a Refresh of Firefox, but no joy.  I have turned the computer on/off/on at the mains, but no joy. I don't want to do an Uninstall/Install unless really necessary. I have 8GB of Ram, and loads of space on the C drive.  But I am NOT tech savvy at all.  When I go to Task Manager, it can show up to a dozen processes for Firefox.  Is that normal?  If I have only Firefox open, Memory shows at 50%.  Is that normal? I would be grateful for any ideas. But I repeat, I am tech useless, so I need everything spelled out in the most basic English. I look forward to hearing from somebody!

It's difficult to explain, but basically, I'll sign on to Youtube. Youtube will show my profile with all my video recommendations and subscriptions. But, if I click the red Youtube home button on the top left of the page to refresh the site or click a different video, Youtube signs me out and shows me the homepage as if I was signed out or did not have an account. When I do sign back in again, my video recommendations are all messed up (they are mostly the general video recommendations from the unsigned in home page and nothing related to the channels or videos that I watch). When I go to my subscriptions, I have to sign in again. It's becoming really frustrating. I did a full uninstall of Firefox, and it briefly worked, but then Youtube went back to the way it's been behaving. I've cleared my history and cache. I've disabled all extensions. I've logged in and out. Nothing seems to work. Youtube does seem to work normally on Chrome and Edge, and I have not had any issues with any other websites on Firefox. Is anyone else experiencing this problem or have any advice?  </p><p>I really enjoy using Firefox, and since everything else seems to work, I'd prefer to keep using it. I really don't want to have to resort to using Chrome or Edge to watch Youtube videos.  </p><p>I'm running Firefox version 83.0 (64bit) on Windows 10 </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,other,en-US,"",mrmet118

Why?,"<p>Hi, I used to be able to simply use the ""Print"" option in Firefox by selecting it from the top right ""3 horizontal bars"" dropdown, and it would print the pages I was looking at using the printer settings I had for the printer I chose.  Now it ignores an important printer setting I have set ""Double-sided Printing"" for my HP Officejet Pro 6978 printer and prints on only one side of the paper.  Why did this change, and how do I get Firefox to obey the settings I have set for this printer?   I am using Firefox 83.0 (64-bit) with WIndows 10, and my Windows 10 is up to date with all updates.

I've tried uninstalling and installing back Firefox, that didn't work. every media.mediasource config are enabled, that didn't work. and when i try using another browser, the media can be played just fine (i used chromium).
