It kept telling me I need to enable secure playback. So I checked and ""Play DRM-controlled content"" is enabled. I did some googling to see what could be the problem. Turns out I need Google Widevine enabled, so I check the plugins page where I find out I don't even have Widevine installed. I also checked the default profile folder (root directory) to see if there's even a gmp-widevinecdm folder there but I couldn't find anything. </p><p>Is there a way for me to reinstall Widevine without having to create a new profile? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",alexghudson

YouTube videos in theater/full-screen mode lag if resolution is higher than 360p and cause the CPU usage to burst. This happens for large web pages as well: when I scroll the page, text overlaps and everything is terribly slow.  I've checked and this seems to be a Firefox related problem; videos play smoothly both on VLC and Chromium. I've tried all official troubleshooting suggestions: changing to default theme, refreshing Firefox, starting in safe-mode, disabling extensions, disabling hardware acceleration and so on, with no success. I've never had any problems with Firefox for Linux before and I wonder what could be the cause.  </p><p>I attached screenshots for comparison of CPU usage for the same video playing in theater mode in Firefox and Chromium. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",giuli4994
