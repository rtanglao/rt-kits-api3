Previously it would cycle through address/search bar items. Now it is opening up the autocomplete window for the address bar.  </p><p>There are already keys that do that. (Down arrow, etc) I don't want another, particularly not another that I frequently used to tab over to the search box and favorites.  </p><p>Does anyone know a way to revert or disable this behavior without completely disabling the auto complete window under that address bar? Alternatively, whatever shortcut keys now cycle through address bar items. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-81;firefox-830;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",rb0014
