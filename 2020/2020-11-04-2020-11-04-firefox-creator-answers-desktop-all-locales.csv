To do that, the <strong>Options&gt;Home&gt;Homepage and new windows&gt;Custom URLs</strong> included the address of the gmail Inbox, i.e. <strong><a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox</a></strong>.   </p><p>However, since Firefox v82.0 installed, I cannot get gmail to open automatically on Firefox startup. Even time, I am forced to say I want to sign in and then enter user name and password (obviously I have those saved so i just have to accept their entry but that's not the point). </p><p>This is already annoying. However, as I live in a Spanish-speaking country, gmail automatically defaults to Spanish and I have to reset it, each time, to English.  If the inbox opened as it used to do, it would presumably not default to Spanish (""helpful"" Google service) as it never used to to that.  </p><p>Firefox has my gmail username and password saved so what am I doing wrong? Why has this changed from earlier Firefox versions and I how do I get around whatever is forcing this? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,customize,en-US,1364075;,paulindr

Once that happens the user.prefs show the label printer paper height and width for the main laserjet printer, until manually edited. Once corrected it seems to work fine, until the label printer is used again. </p><p>The issue appeared over the weekend, which I believe is when the new update to FireFox was released. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",joshua.yoder84

While I was away from home for a couple of months, I bought a laptop and installed Firefox, and immediately got the .chrome set up to put the tabs where they belong. No problem. I got home and made the ""mistake"" of updating Firefox on my desktop PC. Shouldn't be an issue; just e-mail myself the .chrome files from my laptop and drop them in the same location, right? </p><p>No. </p><p>So what is the deal? Did the previous version use a different location that I need to find and delete first? Do I need to say additional Hail Marys? </p><p>Both PCs are running the same Windows version (10), with the same Firefox version (82.whatever), with the same .chrome in the same file location on the respective hard drives. In fact, both hard drives are M.2 SSD. So what did I do wrong (besides allowing the update)? </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1364052;,cionaoith
