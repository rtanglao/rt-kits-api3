If it is video, the video continues to play without sound. When it is audio-only, such as bandcamp, the timestamp stops. Audio resumes playing if I rewind or manually move the timestamp handle (scrubber?) back. This must be repeated each time the media is paused. Audio does not resume playing if play and pause are pressed, or if the site is refreshed. </p><p>Troubleshooting steps attempted so far: </p> <ul><li> Tried a different browser.

I have always been able to have my WinLiveMail open whenever I clicked a mailto link on a website.  Recently that function stopped working.  It still works on another laptop, but not mine, so I'm guessing some setting changed, but for the life of me I have no idea what it might be.  Running Win7 Pro 64 and the latest version of FF.  The general&gt;applications&gt;mailto is set to Windows Live Mail as it always has.  I changed it to GMail and it works.  I changed it to FireFox and it opens the window offering choices, but it won't open WLM. PopUps is unchecked but I can't figure why it's not working.  It used to.  Worked for years, regardless of the version of FF running.  All the add-ons and extensions have been disabled and FF has been run in Safe Mode and it still will not open.  Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Nothing I find when I 'Google' the issue is helpful, and most of the posts are years old.  I downgraded FF to an earlier version and all that did was cause my profile to disappear and really mess up my saved configuration.  Fortunately I backed up the old profile and just renamed it to the new one created by the re install of the latest version and all my stuff came back.  Just a side note as to what happens when I do click the mailto link, regadless of the site. The top menu banner flashes as I click it and that's all.  Not other movement or screen changes whatsoever.  Thanks in advance for any suggestions. </p>",windows-7;desktop;beta;fix-problems;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",eapepin

There seems to be a bug in FF's bookmark toolbar. When I click on any toolbar folder and then right-click a url within that folder, I find that all the options (Open, Open in a New Tab, Open in a New Window, New Bookmark etc) start flickering when I run the cursor over them. They do not stay a solid blue as expected. This happens only with the urls nestled within any particular folder. Right-clicking a folder or url directly from the toolbar works properly, ie; they remain a solid blue and only change as I scroll through each option. </p><p>Things I've tried w/out success ... Restarting the browser with addons disabled.  Refreshing the browser. Tried a different mouse. A complete uninstall/reinstall of FF with only the bookmarks.js file exported/imported. </p><p>I thought the bookmarks.js file might have been corrupted so I went into the new Profiles folder and removed 'bookmarkbackups' and 'places.sqlite'. After restarting all bookmarks were gone (as expected) so I created a new toolbar folder, added 3 or 4 urls and tried once more, but again the same flickering problem. Not sure what else to do. Does anybody know what might be causing this and how I could fix it? I've added a screenshot taken a from a screen recording. Obviously it doesn't show the flickering but it might help to give a clearer picture. Thanks </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-820;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Tt108

To do that, the <strong>Options&gt;Home&gt;Homepage and new windows&gt;Custom URLs</strong> included the address of the gmail Inbox, i.e. <strong><a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox</a></strong>.   </p><p>However, since Firefox v82.0 installed, I cannot get gmail to open automatically on Firefox startup. Even time, I am forced to say I want to sign in and then enter user name and password (obviously I have those saved so i just have to accept their entry but that's not the point). </p><p>This is already annoying. However, as I live in a Spanish-speaking country, gmail automatically defaults to Spanish and I have to reset it, each time, to English.  If the inbox opened as it used to do, it would presumably not default to Spanish (""helpful"" Google service) as it never used to to that.  </p><p>Firefox has my gmail username and password saved so what am I doing wrong?
