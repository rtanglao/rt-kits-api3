Once that happens the user.prefs show the label printer paper height and width for the main laserjet printer, until manually edited. Once corrected it seems to work fine, until the label printer is used again. </p><p>The issue appeared over the weekend, which I believe is when the new update to FireFox was released. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",joshua.yoder84

While I was away from home for a couple of months, I bought a laptop and installed Firefox, and immediately got the .chrome set up to put the tabs where they belong. No problem. I got home and made the ""mistake"" of updating Firefox on my desktop PC. Shouldn't be an issue; just e-mail myself the .chrome files from my laptop and drop them in the same location, right? </p><p>No. </p><p>So what is the deal? Did the previous version use a different location that I need to find and delete first? Do I need to say additional Hail Marys? </p><p>Both PCs are running the same Windows version (10), with the same Firefox version (82.whatever), with the same .chrome in the same file location on the respective hard drives. In fact, both hard drives are M.2 SSD. So what did I do wrong (besides allowing the update)? </p>",desktop;tabs;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,tabs,en-US,1364052;,cionaoith
