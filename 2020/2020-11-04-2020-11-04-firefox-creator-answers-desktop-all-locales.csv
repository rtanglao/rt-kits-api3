Even though browser.urlbar.maxHistoricalSearchSuggestions is set to 0 and history searches are off in the settings etc. Can you show me a way to restore the search? See attachment for better understanding. (at least I hope) </p><p>Clearing cache doesnt help, because it also deletes form entries and doesnt prevent Firefox from storing my historical searches. </p><p>Thank you kind regards </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",shago3

This is not a myth, it actually happened.  It took me well over a week to get my account unlocked.  I lost a week of trading because of this apparently well known glitch on Firefox.  Now, I can't even load or log in to coinbase from Firefox.  Why???? </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",bekglm1

I believe my Firefox browser was updated - it now is version 82.0.2 and I now have a folder labelled Old Firefox Data on my desktop. The update lost all of my settings and add-ons. So, I changed the settings back to the former state. And, I downloaded / installed the add-ons, which show as ""Enabled"" . But, the add-ons don't appear on the toolbar. </p><p>If I go to Options and set Enhance Tracking Protection to Standard and History to Remember History, then I can 1) see the add-ons in the Customize section and 2) successful place the add-ons on the toolbar. But, after I vhange Enhanced Tracking Protection back to Strict and History to Never Remember, then the add-ons again disappear from the toolbar. </p><p>Can you please advise me of the fix to this problem. </p><p>Thanks much </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",rnewell.m1

There seems to be a bug in the folders in FF's bookmark toolbar. When I click on any toolbar folder and then right-click a url within that folder, I find that all the options (Open, Open in a New Tab, Open in a New Window, New Bookmark etc) start flickering when I run the cursor over them. They do not stay a solid blue as expected. This happens only with the urls nestled within any particular folder. Right-clicking a folder or url directly from the toolbar works properly, ie; they remain a solid blue and only change as I scroll through each option. </p><p>Things I've tried w/out success ... Restarting the browser with addons disabled.  Refreshing the browser. Tried a different mouse. A complete uninstall/reinstall of FF with only the bookmarks.js file exported/imported. </p><p>I thought the bookmarks.js file might have been corrupted so I went into the new Profiles folder and removed 'bookmarkbackups' and 'places.sqlite'. After restarting all bookmarks were gone (as expected) so I created a new toolbar folder with 3 or 4 urls and tried once more, but again the same flickering problem. Not sure what else to do. Does anybody know what might be causing this and how I could fix it? I've added a screenshot taken a from a screen recording. Obviously it doesn't show the flickering but it might help to give a clearer picture. Thanks </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-820;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Tt108

To do that, the <strong>Options&gt;Home&gt;Homepage and new windows&gt;Custom URLs</strong> included the address of the gmail Inbox, i.e. <strong><a href=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox</a></strong>.   </p><p>However, since Firefox v82.0 installed, I cannot get gmail to open automatically on Firefox startup. Even time, I am forced to say I want to sign in and then enter user name and password (obviously I have those saved so i just have to accept their entry but that's not the point). </p><p>This is already annoying. However, as I live in a Spanish-speaking country, gmail automatically defaults to Spanish and I have to reset it, each time, to English.  If the inbox opened as it used to do, it would presumably not default to Spanish (""helpful"" Google service) as it never used to to that.  </p><p>Firefox has my gmail username and password saved so what am I doing wrong? Why has this changed from earlier Firefox versions and I how do I get around whatever is forcing this? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,customize,en-US,1364075;,paulindr

While I was away from home for a couple of months, I bought a laptop and installed Firefox, and immediately got the .chrome set up to put the tabs where they belong. No problem.

Shouldn't be an issue; just e-mail myself the .chrome files from my laptop and drop them in the same location, right? </p><p>No. </p><p>So what is the deal? Did the previous version use a different location that I need to find and delete first? Do I need to say additional Hail Marys? </p><p>Both PCs are running the same Windows version (10), with the same Firefox version (82.whatever), with the same .chrome in the same file location on the respective hard drives.
