I can use chrome and edge with no issues but firefox is not working properly. It tries to create the same label 3 times at the same time. It creates the same label in my download and 2 as a pdf. they are all the same label. It should only create 1 label.   I refreshed Firefox, removed cookies and history and still does the same thing. I print using Adobe for my labels. I also tried having labels automatically open on Firefox without adobe and that caused issues too where it would go to my downloads folder and then I would have to select the file and open it. It worked seamlessly until 2 weeks ago.  I would prefer it to open the labels using a pdf extension on Firefox without using adobe and without requiring me to constantly go to downloads to select the file to open.  Any help would be appreciated </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",rubes124

If I just ignore the video and scroll down without explicitly stopping the video, I get a popup window playing the video.  Apparently the popup blocker doesn't consider this to be a popup.
