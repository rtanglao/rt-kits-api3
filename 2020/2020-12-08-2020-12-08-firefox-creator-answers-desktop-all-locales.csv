When I purposely restarted my computer, for an unknown reason, a session came up but my previous session did not automatically restore as usually it does. I did something in that window and was thinking about something else and deleted it, ie: the session. OH S _  _  _!  Just lost my restore previous session opportunity..... I opened another session (and restore previous session was grayed - not available) and have not closed my session nor re-started since. Is there any other way to go back and recover my lost session windows and tabs?  .... not from the previous session that I accidentally closed, but from the session before that? Thanks in advance.

However, the Shield also shows that ALL of these tracking websites and cookies as Blocked, while I had to Allow them as exceptions. Otherwise, the website would not function.  </p><p>Is this what the Shield it is meant to display (show ALL cookies as blocked, when in fact they are Allowed)Â ?   </p><p>Also, is there a way to copy out, export or at least print the list of websites under Exceptions?  I am concerned that somehow they are deleted (I was reading that Refresh deletes them, maybe something else does that too) and it took me quite a lot of experimentation to figure out what is that I have to allow for websites I need vs. what I can safely block, when blocking ALL doesn't do the job.  </p><p>Thanks. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Zsuzsu

I can use chrome and edge with no issues but firefox is not working properly. It tries to create the same label 3 times at the same time. It creates the same label in my download and 2 as a pdf. they are all the same label. It should only create 1 label.   I refreshed Firefox, removed cookies and history and still does the same thing. I print using Adobe for my labels. I also tried having labels automatically open on Firefox without adobe and that caused issues too where it would go to my downloads folder and then I would have to select the file and open it. It worked seamlessly until 2 weeks ago.  I would prefer it to open the labels using a pdf extension on Firefox without using adobe and without requiring me to constantly go to downloads to select the file to open.  Any help would be appreciated </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",rubes124
