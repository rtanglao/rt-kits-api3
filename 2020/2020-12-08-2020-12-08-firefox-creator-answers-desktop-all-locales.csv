Now, I'm ready to make the transition fully, but I have a couple of questions.  1. In IE, I liked the fact that webpages and websites were nested within each other, and within a date range. Firefox does do some of this, but I'm wondering if there's a way to make it behave more like IE? As an example of what I want to happen, let's say I've opened the history for the last seven days. In IE, I would get a list of websites, then I'd have to expand each individual website in order to see what pages on that website I visited. In Firefox, this is one long list, sorted alphabetically by page title, regardless of whether the pages are associated with a particular website. Is there a way I can change this?  2. I've gotten used to the fact that in IE, I can enter multiple URLs, and they each open in their own tab when I launch the program. I have five that I visit every day, and would like them to all open at once when I open Firefox, but when I tried adding a second link to my homepage, it didn't like it. Is there a way to do this in Firefox? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",cavbob1993

The functionality is to act when the user stops typing into a textbox for 0.9 seconds, which by trial and error I found was fast enough to act without premature invocation because the user was just typing slowly. </p><p>```javascript // in the initialization code element.addEventListener('keydown', onKeyDownName); ... function onKeyDownName(event) { </p><pre>   if (timer)        clearTimeout(timer);    timer   = setTimeout(update, 900);    alert(""nominalIndex.js: onKeyDownName: timer="" + timer) </pre> <p>}       // function onKeyDownName </p><p>function update() { </p><pre>   alert(""nominalIndex.js: update:"");    // perform the function </pre> <p>} ``` </p><p>The alerts are only inserted, on my private test site only, to try and debug why this code is no longer working.  Each time I type a character I see the alert ""nominalIndex.js: onKeyDownName: timer=nnn"" but no matter how long I wait I never see the alert ""nominalIndex.js: update:"".  To get the function to work the user must take some other action which causes the function update to be called.  There are no messages in the log to explain why the timer isn't popping.  How can I debug this? </p><p>The code works on Chromium 87.0.4280.88 but doesn't work on FireFox 83.0 build id 20201112153044.
