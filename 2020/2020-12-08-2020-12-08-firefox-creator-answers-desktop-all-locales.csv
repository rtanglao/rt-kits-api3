If I just ignore the video and scroll down without explicitly stopping the video, I get a popup window playing the video.  Apparently the popup blocker doesn't consider this to be a popup.

I can remove it using another add-on but that only works for that occasion.  I don't want to install NoScript because it stops Facebook working. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-830;,firefox,other,en-US,"",terauck
