This is something that has been bugging me for some years (yes, it has taken me that long to get around to asking about this). Over the last decade I have amounted a large assortment of bookmarks, which I have carefully structured and also add suitable tags to (as I know what I am likely to search for in future). This works very well for me and it's surprising how my past self has been so accurate at predicting what I may find useful to my present/future self, when it comes to searching for something in my bookmarks. </p><p>Herein lies my problem though. I often need to put in a number of tags to make a given web resource findable in the future. For example, I was just reading up about the Google compute module, and have been trying to enter the following tags: Google Edge TPU (Neural compute) sbc network artificial intelligence machine vision intel stick Quantization </p><p>This number of keywords is too long, yet I don't want to really remove any of these words/acronyms. Why are the bookmarks so heavily restricted with regards to tags? I see that when I look at the bookmarks, there is also a **keywords** option too, but those words are not searchable, so I don't see much value in placing anything in there. </p><p>I am not 100% sure, but I could swear too, that bookmarks used to have a description section too, where I could make notes regarding a weblink (EG: ""this website has particularly good recipes for pasta, but ignore their vegatarian options as they don't review very favorably""). I may be thinking of another web browser from a long time ago. Having a description field for each bookmark (which is not restricted to a ridiculously short length like the **Tags** field) would be an excellent idea. </p><p>so, to summarize: 1. How do I work around having such a short **Tag** field (and when is Mozilla going to fix this?) 2. Can we please have a Description field for each bookmark. Please! </p><p>These are just about my only criticisms of what is otherwise my absolute favorite of browsers. Thanks for the great work and effort by all, and have a prosperous and healthy 2021. </p>",linux;desktop;bookmarks;escalate;hardquestion;firefox-840;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",gawardnz

Opening a system monitor shows a running Firefox process, pointing to the previously clicked URL, but does not respond at all. CPU and RAM usage are both 0 for this process, so it's likely not even doing anything. Not even a SIGTERM will terminate the process, I have to throw at least two SIGKILLs at the process for it to die. Why is this a thing?

I went to ""Feedback"" thinking that was logical, but apparently Mozilla is reworking Feedback so that does not exist, and as i am not a software developer, i suspect a technical bug report is over my head anyway. </p><p>I don't want to go to Edge, but it would seem Mozilla wants me to. This issue has persisted ever since release 79. I would think that the programmer(s) could ""simply"" look at what changed from 78 to 79 and revert, but apparently not. </p><p>I, once again, have to uninstall the latest release (i installed it, allowing an ""upgrade"", thinking that by now someone there would have fixed that which at least to me is a critical routine), and reinstall Version 78.0, since that one isn't f'd up. Maybe it is all the enhanced ""security"" that is now interfering with normal processes, i don't know. That also means I have to get used to the new browser and hopefully finding a reliable password manager to which i can import pages of entries from Kee. </p><p>Yes, i know i will get a share of hate mail for criticizing FF at this point. Just consider how infuriating it is after using it since beta 0.3 and having made donations, having what i see as a critical issue ignored, and worse, forcing me to soon change to Edge if no one fixes it. As much as i hate using the Microsoft browser, at least it does not force the Microsoft ""Save"" dialog box to collapse when trying to print to a pdf, and i am rather disgusted that no one from FF has reached out to try to fix this issue. </p><p>And yes, i did try it in safe mode (run firefox.exe /safe) and ""Restart with Addons disabled"" from the menu|Help, neither of which were successful. </p><p>If any of you know how to get this note to someone competent at FF, please do so and let me know to hold off on switching; i dread having to do that, but printing to pdf is mission critical in the conduct of my business. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;firefox-8401;,firefox,other,en-US,"",bem67
