IOT device,"<p><strong>Release my slave and let it display here </strong>  This is 10.224.219.149  This is on the Third router in this home.  The first is the ISP.  The second plugs into the first and hard-wire and wire to the house in power lines and direct Cat6 cable.  One cat6 NIC connection:  comes to another building and my router where 10.224.219.149 is one of 50 such ports of wireless on my Linksys 1G router in the library/office.  The box is in the other room.  It wireless to this router and the Custom router chip brings in RF and sorts it to this hard-wire (NIC port) set on this tower.  You are blocking an IOT device.  I have two laptops and a palm top and 'Fire' also connected when turned on. Can your icebox handshake like you want ?  One side only, the firmware in the other does what it can.  Changing encryption is possible on one side but not for every IOT device.  This is a Brennan B2 music player that I bought from Amazon.  So can you.  Netframework and the internet product groups are biding an ill game Microsoft started.  This is not the Dark Web you are banning.  I can't manage hundreds of recordings with a knob and buttons.  I need the web access to change sorting and fix items.    How can this be resolved ?  I need help. </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-840;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",Martin357

With .mkv files, the checkbox isn't there, so every time I have to go through the process of changing the default (play) action to save the file.  I've checked preferences and there's no way to add mkv files to the default actions.  I deleted the handlers... file to reset and start over, but same behavior...it wants to play the file, with no option to quit asking and just save it. </p><p>On these same machines, I can do the same download process with any other browser such as Opera, and it just saves the file as I've instructed it to do in preferences.  So why the different (and long-term consistent) and annoying behavior with firefox?  MP4, AVI, fine, but MKV??  No option, and it's not as if it's a new file type or new behavior. </p><p>I suppose one could say ""what's the big deal, just change it when it asks?"", but it seems like nonsensical and pointless behavior, which has continued for a long time, with other browsers able to deal with it properly.  At the very least, how about a way to add file extensions manually to the list of actions in the options? </p><p>Please don't blame the web server for ""not sending the proper information"", as I've seen in some non-solution posts; the .mkv extension should tell enough, and it's over many servers.  I looked in the registry to see if perchance I could patch it in there, but couldn't find entries, so I assume it's all in the handlers file. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,1379822;1379827;,roberthaus
