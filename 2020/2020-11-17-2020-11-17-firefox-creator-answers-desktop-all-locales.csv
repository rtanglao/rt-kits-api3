When I installed my bookmarks from a previous back-up (my previous laptop had died) the new installation assigned wrong web addresses to each and every bookmark title.  I've tried everything that I can think of to reload my bookmarks and tried to make sense of the help in your FAQ pages.  I've uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox but the same issue occurs.  The correct titles for my bookmarks appear in the right place, as I'd assigned in my previous laptop.  However all the icons are like an empty, wire world icon and most of them don't activate.  The ones that do activate a link take me to an entierly unrelated website.  When I look at the individual bookmarks under Bookmarks/show all bookmarks, are all incorrect.  Many of my passwords still work but some don't.  I cannot bookmark a new page - there is just no response at all.  I can't delete bookmarks from my Toolbar or from within the 'show all bookmarks' page.  What is going on and how can I recover my bookmarks so that I have a functioning Firefox please?  Help!  I am wasting time both typing in new searches and in trying to fix this!  I have even dismantled my old laptop and plugged in the old C Drive to my new one - the drive and all the old data is there and visible but this install of Firefox running on this machine will not accept even the old bookmark data!  All the json files that I have seen have no identifying icon - just a blank rectangle as the icon for the file-type.  I've even removed the very few plug-ins that I had and gone back to the original install state for Firefox without any joy!  That's about as much fault-finding info this non-techie user can give.  Over to you please! </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",mike365
