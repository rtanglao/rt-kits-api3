Extensions have been a disaster for me. First I tried adding the 1 Password extension. I did this because when I tried opening a page from 1 Password uninstalled on the browser, it didn't l as it should (has always done so with Safari). I had to open 1Password separately, and copy the information, which is tedious.  </p><p>So I installed the 1Password Extension on Firefox. It  didn't work unless I'd opened the desktop version of 1Password, it still didn't open and fill.  </p><p>So I removed the extension. I then decided to give it another try. The extension shows up on Firefox. But now it has a little lock on the icon. The problem is that clicking on the icon doesn't open anything!  I've rebooted the computer, and only reinstalled the 1Password extension. The same problem occurs, then, without clicking on the problematic icon, I reboot the computer again. It hasn't helped. </p><p><strong>PROBLEM TWO: I'm having an additional problem with extensions. When I click on the extension for Pocket (for instance), the program opens, but fails to recognize that I have a paid subscription, asking me to upgrade. This is true for other sites I have subscriptions to, limiting me using the ""free"" version, which limits what I can open as well as what I can save.</strong> </p><p>It sounds unbelievable, but that's what's happened to me. <strong>I'm </strong>using enhanced tracking protection for all sites.<em> </em> Macbook Pro ; Catalina OS 10.15.7 (19H15) - most recent version Max OS<strong> </strong> </p><p>I appreciate any help you can give me. This is way over my head!

Whenever I maximize a window on my primary monitor (3-monitor display), it goes full-screen but only shows a portion of the content. It brings with it a huge white border (pictured in screenshot) that registers as a portion of the desktop (or perhaps just not as a portion of the window). By that I mean that when I click in it, it is as though I am clicking out of the window and onto whatever app or object is operating behind the Firefox window.  </p><p>Changing the zoom does nothing. It just adjusts the size of the display within that same limited portion. Strangely, when I drag the window onto the second or third monitors, it will maximize without issue. Returning the window to the primary monitor, however, recreates the issue. When in this mode, I cannot access the menu nor tool bars. My only way to manipulate the window is to right click in my taskbar, ""restore"" to a non-maximized state and work from there. When not maximized everything functions normally.  </p><p>I disabled all add-ons and plugins, but the issue persists. I have no fullscreen background applications which should be affecting the application or its resolution. When I launch, in safe mode, it is better. I can maximize. The border is still present, but I am able to access the menu functions with the alt key. My software version is current. The drivers for my GPU are current.  </p><p>Again, this issue happened overnight with no changes on my part whatsoever. I shut my pc down after a day of work.

Vanilla Firefox - no add ons or customization. Freezes have been on mouse click, but also not. - Starting Firefox in Safe Mode makes no difference. - Uninstall and reinstall remedied the situation for a number of hours before freezes began again. When freezes were uniformly on startup, I uninstalled again.

This problem only occurs on Firefox. This problem doesn't occur on Chrome at all. </p><p>The problem is that when sharing the screen in a Google Meeting, Firefox only shares the mouse cursor if I share my monitor screen that I have to the left of my head. </p><p>Sharing the mouse cursor in meetings is quite fundamental to have the audience focus on the specific part of the screen the presenter is talking about, much like a laser pointer. </p><p>I know that Google slides have a laser pointer, but I'm not talking about sharing presentations, but contents of the screens. </p><p>My screen setup is: Laptop's screen External monitor 1 plugged into laptop's HDMI cable (it's a DVI to HDMI cable) External monitor 2 plugged into DVI port on port replicator which is plugged to my laptop's USB port. </p><p>The physical set up is: [2][3] </p><pre>   [1] </pre> <p>This is also how it's shown on my Windows' Display Settings. </p><p>Where: [1] laptop screen [3] monitor connected to port replicator as main monitor [2] monitor to my left, I have to look left to see it. </p><p>[1] and [2] are aligned with my head. Monitor screen [2] extends to the right into monitor screen [3] which extends downwards into laptop screen [1]. </p><p>I entered a Google hangout meeting from my laptop and from my phone. I then shared the screens from my laptop so that I could see the laptop shared screen on my phone. </p><p>I shared each of the 3 screens on by 1, and only the monitor to my left shares the mouse pointer. </p><p>I then shared a window and if I move the window to the screen to the left, it'll share the mouse. But if I move it to the screen in front of my head, the mouse isn't shared, unless I move the cursor all the way to the right until it disappears on from the screen, and that's when it appears on my phone, but on the extreme left side, not right side. </p><p>Sort of similar behaviour happens when I share a non-maximised window from my left monitor. Over the shared window on my left monitor, if I place the mouse on the last 30% right part of the window, on my phone the mouse appears displaced further to the left, like on the first 20% of the shared window. </p><p>It's like the mouse pointer were in a displaced layer that when shared, gets moved to the left on the receiver of the shared screen. </p><p>If I maximise the shared window, this problem goes away. </p><p>I swapped the 2 external monitor cables and the problem persisted, somehow with only the monitor to the left [in spite of the cable swapping] sharing the mouse cursor. </p><p>On Windows' Display Settings, I then stopped the screen extension and just used the laptop one. In this scenario, the mouse pointer over the laptop screen was shared. </p><p>On Windows' Display Settings, I made each of the 3 monitors ""Make this my main display"" and this still didn't make a difference. Only the monitor to the left continued to share the mouse pointer. </p><p>I then disconnected both external monitors and shared my laptop's screen, then the mouse cursor was being shared to my phone. </p><p>So going by trial and error, for me it seems like it's a bug in the way Firefox inherits display settings from Windows 10. </p><p>None of these problems happen on Chrome but I just don't want to use Chrome. </p><p>I also just tried Zoom and I shared my main monitor via a Zoom meeting where I also joined from my phone, and the mouse cursor was shared. </p><p>So it's really a problem between Firefox and Google Meet. Makes me wonder if Google does this intentionally to make Chrome more attractive, as the new blur background feature and background replacement by a photo are also unavailable on Firefox, which seems intentional to me. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-820;firefox-8203;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",riluma

When I installed my bookmarks from a previous back-up (my previous laptop had died) the new installation assigned wrong web addresses to each and every bookmark title.  I've tried everything that I can think of to reload my bookmarks and tried to make sense of the help in your FAQ pages.  I've uninstalled and reinstalled Firefox but the same issue occurs.  The correct titles for my bookmarks appear in the right place, as I'd assigned in my previous laptop.  However all the icons are like an empty, wire world icon and most of them don't activate.  The ones that do activate a link take me to an entierly unrelated website.  When I look at the individual bookmarks under Bookmarks/show all bookmarks, are all incorrect.  Many of my passwords still work but some don't.  I cannot bookmark a new page - there is just no response at all.  I can't delete bookmarks from my Toolbar or from within the 'show all bookmarks' page.  What is going on and how can I recover my bookmarks so that I have a functioning Firefox please?  Help!  I am wasting time both typing in new searches and in trying to fix this!  I have even dismantled my old laptop and plugged in the old C Drive to my new one - the drive and all the old data is there and visible but this install of Firefox running on this machine will not accept even the old bookmark data!  All the json files that I have seen have no identifying icon - just a blank rectangle as the icon for the file-type.  I've even removed the very few plug-ins that I had and gone back to the original install state for Firefox without any joy!  That's about as much fault-finding info this non-techie user can give.  Over to you please! </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1368176;1368370;1368372;,mike365
