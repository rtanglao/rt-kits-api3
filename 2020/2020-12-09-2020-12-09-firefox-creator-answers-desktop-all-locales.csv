After visiting website <a href=""http://nicehash.com"" rel=""nofollow"">nicehash.com</a>, I have downloaded and executed their autodetect system tool.  Firefox was working fine. Then I have downloaded their utility of coin mining and tried to install it. Comodo security immediately warned me about an issue of the software (was trying to modify registry key probaby) and I have blocked it and terminated it. Since then, Firefox won't browse any website, won't close after clicking the X button on the upper right corner, (exiting it only with right clicking on the icon on the taskbar) in general won't operate. I have tried uninstalling it/clean re-installing it, refreshing it, deleting the Mozilla directory from Program Files before doing it and still the same problems. Chrome browser is working fine. Unfortunately system restore to an earlier state won't succeed. Scanning with Eset's NOD32 antivirus won't show any viruses. A help on this would be appreciated because I'm on a dead-end on this. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",integralegr

In the evening, when the theme switches to Dark mode, Firefox's theme changes to Dark also. If I don't shut down my Mac, Firefox's theme will be Light in the morning, which is normal. However, if I shutdown my Mac completely in the evening and turn it back on the next morning, Firefox's theme keeps the last state (Dark) also my system's theme changes to Light. The only workaround is to change my Mac's theme to Dark/Light only, and change it back to Auto again. </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-830;,firefox,other,en-US,"",songoku3496
