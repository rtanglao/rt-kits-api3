Unfortunately, clearing out the unwanted address did not work and the address still auto-fills in the U.R.L. bar (see picture). </p><p>If deleting auto-fill entries doesn't actually work, what will? </p><p>I've always been curious about this, as well, but how does Firefox determine what address auto-fills if I type in a couple of letters? Does it keep a running tally of how many times I've searched for/visited a particular site and use that data? This would be useful to know for the future. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",haltrman93

Afterwards, any open Firefox window or tab would not respond. </p><p>I closed all sessions of Firefox, and confirmed all were closed in Task Manager. Then, any attempt to launch Firefox produced a spinning circle for a few moments, and then nothing. I did extensive searching and did all the suggestions I found. Installing/reinstalling did not change anything. I moved my profile to another location, and tried to launch Firefox (without success), and a new profile was not created. The Profile Manager would not launch. Firefox would not launch in Safe-Mode. I uninstalled Firefox and manually removed all folders and ran Ccleaner to clean up the registry. I then reinstalled without success. </p><p>I tried to roll back the system to a previous restore point of 03 Dec 2020, but that was unsuccessful; there was a suggestion from Microsoft that my antivirus was preventing the restore from being successful. I disabled BitDefender and tried to restore again, with the same failed result. I ran ""sfc /scannow"", which found some problems and fixed them. After Rebooting, I discovered that Firefox launched and worked as expected, but then realized that BitDefender was disabled. After enabling BitDefender, Firefox doesn't launch. </p><p>I added ""c:\Program Files\mozilla firefox\firefox.exe"" as an Exclusion in BitDefender, without success. </p><p>When trying to roll back the system, the feature to scan for affected programs showed I was using Version 69 of Firefox on 03 Dec 2020. </p><p>Did I receive a Firefox update today that caused Firefox to not play well with BitDefender? or is there something else suspected to cause BitDefender to prevent Firefox from launching? </p><p>I am running 64-bit Windows 10. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1374425;1374427;1374453;1374461;,t5montecarlo
