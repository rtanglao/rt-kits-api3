Restarting Firefox didn't help. I checked my extensions and found that it had been automatically disabled. The challenge I'm facing is ... there were specific links that I 'need' that I cannot access. Is there  a way to recover said data? </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,"",grumpygaijin

It shows me signed in, then if I try and subscribe to a user, it says ""your session has expired"" and I have to sign in again. This just keeps going around in a circle. Works fine on Chrome but Firefox is my main browser. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",tokay724

Afterwards, any open Firefox window or tab would not respond. </p><p>I closed all sessions of Firefox, and confirmed all were closed in Task Manager. Then, any attempt to launch Firefox produced a spinning circle for a few moments, and then nothing. I did extensive searching and did all the suggestions I found. Installing/reinstalling did not change anything. I moved my profile to another location, and tried to launch Firefox (without success), and a new profile was not created. The Profile Manager would not launch. Firefox would not launch in Safe-Mode. I uninstalled Firefox and manually removed all folders and ran Ccleaner to clean up the registry. I then reinstalled without success. </p><p>I tried to roll back the system to a previous restore point of 03 Dec 2020, but that was unsuccessful; there was a suggestion from Microsoft that my antivirus was preventing the restore from being successful. I disabled BitDefender and tried to restore again, with the same failed result. I ran ""sfc /scannow"", which found some problems and fixed them. After Rebooting, I discovered that Firefox launched and worked as expected, but then realized that BitDefender was disabled. After enabling BitDefender, Firefox doesn't launch. </p><p>I added ""c:\Program Files\mozilla firefox\firefox.exe"" as an Exclusion in BitDefender, without success. </p><p>When trying to roll back the system, the feature to scan for affected programs showed I was using Version 69 of Firefox on 03 Dec 2020. </p><p>Did I receive a Firefox update today that caused Firefox to not play well with BitDefender? or is there something else suspected to cause BitDefender to prevent Firefox from launching? </p><p>I am running 64-bit Windows 10. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1374425;1374427;,t5montecarlo
