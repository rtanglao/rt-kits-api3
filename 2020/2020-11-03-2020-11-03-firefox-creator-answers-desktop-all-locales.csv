So I will go to a free public WiFi place, spend a few hours downloading, then I go home and use a USB cable to transfer them to my old Dell home PC. </p><p>My phone has been acting up, so I factory reset it. I installed the Firefox browser, I like it because I could save web pages as  a PDF.  </p><p>I installed the new Firefox and had some problems. I saved a bunch of items, but when I linked to my PC there was only one item in downloads, everything else was now in Collections. Collections was new to me and I thought it was just labeling things. </p><p><i>(email address removed by moderator; please do not post personal information on a public website)</i> I will check my phone's memory, I have dozens of items in Collections, I tap them and I can read the articles, but I can't seem to access them from my PC. </p><p>How do do this? Is there a way to go back to the previous...print, save as PDF, method? It seems like you fixed something that wasn't broken. </p><p>Frankly I don't know why there isn't a Save/Download button on display at all times when you see something interesting. What is the logic in starting to Print something, than previewing it, then saving the preview? </p><p>Sorry if I seem a bit irritated. Is it simply time to apply for a new phone? </p><p>Thanks, BA </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1363783;,brandon.la.70

I normally run most web pages at 120-150% and the larger size seems to not passing on to the side columns. The column width issue also occurs on the Washington Post. The only change has been the Firefox update, and standard rebooting and troubleshooting makes no difference. I need to get back to the previous column and text sizes, including applying increased magnification. Is there any option short of trying to revert to the older version, which doesn't look easy. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-820;firefox-8202;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1363762;,amoret
