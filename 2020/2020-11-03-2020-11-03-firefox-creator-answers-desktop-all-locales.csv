The browser bar reads <a href=""https://app.kashflow.com/#login"" rel=""nofollow"">https://app.kashflow.com/#login</a> and doesn't change or move on.  I have tried logging on with add-ons turned off.  I have checked my Firefox is up to date and rebooted my laptop.  All worked fine on Sunday 1st Nov when I last used it.  I can login fine and work as normal if I use Google Chrome... which is not my preferred browser obviously! Any advice, thanks? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1363810;,berri1

Some revert back to a log in screen but most go back to the screen when Firefox shuts down. There are no issues that are evident and nothing comes up in the alerts on my AV, etc. programs. It is really annoying when you have just logged into a mail program e. g. hotmail; aim; and it is in the private browser screen. This one does not reopen and you have to start from the beginning again. It has only been happening over the last week or so and can happen 2 or 3 times in a day, depending on how long the computer is being used - extended day or just a short few hours.  There are no crash reports or error messages from Firefox. It just totally shuts down. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-820;firefox-8202;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",ok007au
