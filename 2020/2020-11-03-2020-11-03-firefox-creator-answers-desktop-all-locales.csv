It's not what I specify (for example, I specify fit to width (or something like that).  So I learned about deleting the printer preferences in about:config.  But then it happened again twice more.  When it is working correctly, the print dialogue box looks like a normal windows one (see attached).  When it is working incorrectly, the dialogue box looks quite different (I don't have a screenshot of that, sorry).  I'd like this to stop happening.  (And  yes, that screenshot confirms that I still play Freecell, 25 years later.) </p><p>Another thing is that every time I start Firefox, it asks if I want it to be the default printer.  But every time I do set it to be the default, but it still asks the next time. </p><p>The third is that whenever I restart FF (or most of the times I restart [and I rarely do restart it except when I reboot]), many websites think I'm coming from a new computer.  I assume this has something to do with cookies, but I allow cookies and certainly if I go to that site a second time w/o restarting, it recognizes the computer.   </p><p>One other quirky behavior - if I've rebooted, often after I've opened FF, then if I click on a link in an email, say, it opens another instance, but once I've closed the first instance, then it returns to normal behavior of opening all links in the same instance.  (I mention all of these in case they are somehow related - although I'd like to get solutions to any.)   </p><p>Any help on these issues (the default one is an extremely minor inconvenience; the other two are far more of an inconvenience) would be greatly appreciated. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,other,en-US,"",zarky1

I saved a bunch of items, but when I linked to my PC there was only one item in downloads, everything else was now in Collections. Collections was new to me and I thought it was just labeling things. </p><p><i>(email address removed by moderator; please do not post personal information on a public website)</i> I will check my phone's memory, I have dozens of items in Collections, I tap them and I can read the articles, but I can't seem to access them from my PC. </p><p>How do do this? Is there a way to go back to the previous...print, save as PDF, method? It seems like you fixed something that wasn't broken. </p><p>Frankly I don't know why there isn't a Save/Download button on display at all times when you see something interesting. What is the logic in starting to Print something, than previewing it, then saving the preview? </p><p>Sorry if I seem a bit irritated.
