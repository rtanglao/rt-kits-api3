I was going through the privacy settings on Firefox today and was reading about ""primary password"" to see if it is a feature I might want to use to control my passwords. NOT control people. Just passwords. And then I saw it. This inane explanation that the word ""master"" somehow perpetuates racism. This is NOT true. The term master, like every word in the dictionary, has multiple meanings in multiple contexts. In the context of passwords, it in no way, shape, or form ""perpetuates racism"" or ""exclude"" or ""damage"" people. We are talking about passwords! Do you know what DOES damage people and promote unnecessary awkwardness among people?? Garbage like this. Trying to surgically change normal, everyday words and impute some dark, sinister, nefarious, or otherwise negative meaning to perfectly innocent words and forms of expression with absolutely zero tie-in to past historical phenomena that occurred across the entire globe. This constant word policing causes more damage, more hurt feelings, more social strife, because it puts everyone on eggshells, constantly worried that the slightest utterance of a syllable is going to be taken the wrong way and used to accuse innocent people of horrible and unthinkable malice. This is a very WRONG approach to take, Mozilla. You are perpetuating and exacerbating ignorance and tension where no tension should be present. You are part of the problem, not the solution. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",iploya
