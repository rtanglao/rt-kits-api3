For this we need to run each script from a different profile. </p><p>However, when I open a new profile and then check which profile I am on I always seem to be on the same profile. (I do this by either going to about:profiles and checking to see which profile is in use or I do this by going to about:support and opening the folder). </p><p>Every time it says I'm on the same profile. Even if I go to about:profiles and choose to launch a profile in a new window and then check which profile I'm on, I am still on the first profile. </p><p>Any idea what is going on?

Tesltra Technician contacted me to ask if they could run tests to determine what was wrong with our connection.We did this and to my horror and disbelief of the technicians we found 53,032 events which was severely impacting the performance of desktop.According to the Technician hackers placed some codes onto my desktop which was making the system slow and crashing on some programs. We tested the banking websites and found further errors. Telstra accessed my desktop with my permission and after several hours fixed it.Desktop now runs smoothly.I asked Telstra how can this happen.I run daily antivirus software which I believed was preventing others from getting access to my system. Telstra advice was to change from Firefox to Google Chrome and change antivirus software.Google Chrome is supposed to be safer however I heard this wasn't right.I have used Firefox for years now and keep it upto date.Currently I am using Scanguard Antiviris Software and use the VPN component daily when using the Internet. In addition I use CC Cleaner daily to clean up browser junk etc. I reported this to Scanguard and as yet have not had a response. I need to know clearly what steps I can take to prevent attacks on my system using Firefox.I used Norton before Scanguard but found after a few years the cost to maintain was increasing.Scanguard offered the same services for lower cost therefore I changed.Everything appeared to be working fine and when a potential threat was found Scanguard alerted and prevented access.This time it didn't work.Please advise.Kind regards Don </pre>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",CAMPBELLVN
