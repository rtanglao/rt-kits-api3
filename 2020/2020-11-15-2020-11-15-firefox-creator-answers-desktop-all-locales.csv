So I went to the public <a href=""http://Facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Facebook.com</a> pages about privacy to examine the latest in their privacy settings, no login required of course. However I was stopped repeatedly by the following error message:  Your Request Couldn't be Processed There was a problem with this request. We're working on getting it fixed as soon as we can. I then pasted the same <a href=""http://Facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Facebook.com</a> web address into Edge and had no problems viewing <a href=""http://facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">facebook.com</a> pages open to the public. Again, I am not trying to sign in and do not have an active Facebook account. Does Firefox management know if Facebook is sabotaging Facebook Container either deliberately or by neglect, or if Facebook is actually working on allowing the use of Facebook Container on Firefox while using <a href=""http://Facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Facebook.com</a> pages? </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1367557;,Quenchoo
