(Screenshot attached). This only happens in full screen mode. Thing's I've found out while trying to fix this: </p><p>- It disappears when I use F11 to fullscreen the website. When disableing the fullscreen, the bar reappears, but turns black (wtf?) - When I'm enabling the titlebar the white bar also disappears, but I don't want to do this since then I'm having a big white titlebar which is even worse </p><p>It's just an optical error but a fix would be highly appreciated. Things I tried yet; </p><p>- start in safe mod - clean reinstallation - disabled windows tablet mode - disabled hardware accleration </p><p>Note: this only happens in Firefox, all other programs works fine. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-820;firefox-8203;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",mark.sellner
