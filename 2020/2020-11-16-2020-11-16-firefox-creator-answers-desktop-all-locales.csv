In Firefox on MacOS 10.14.6, I get much slower speeds than in Chrome on the same machine (2012 Mac mini).  As you can see in the attached screenshots, Chrome maxes out my LAN bandwidth at ~988 Mbps (entire network is 1000 Mbps ethernet) but Firefox only achieves ~642 Mbps.  This was done on the same computer, just in the two different browsers and just a minute or so apart.  I also tried Firefox in Private Mode and got the same ~650 Mbps result.  I've done this repeatedly throughout the day and always get almost the same results; Firefox never gets over ~650 Mbps. </p><p>I also tried Firefox on an Ubuntu machine and get almost identical results as Chrome does on MacOS... ~985 Mbps.  So it seems like Firefox is Ok on Ubuntu, but slower for some reason on MacOS. </p><p>I would expect the two to be about the same in terms of raw throughput.  Does anyone know what might cause this and is there any way to fix it? </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-820;firefox-8203;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",interconnect

(Screenshot attached). This only happens in full screen mode. Thing's I've found out while trying to fix this: </p><p>- It disappears when I use F11 to fullscreen the website. When disableing the fullscreen, the bar reappears, but turns black (wtf?) - When I'm enabling the titlebar the white bar also disappears, but I don't want to do this since then I'm having a big white titlebar which is even worse </p><p>It's just an optical error but a fix would be highly appreciated. Things I tried yet; </p><p>- start in safe mod - clean reinstallation - disabled windows tablet mode - disabled hardware accleration </p><p>Note: this only happens in Firefox, all other programs works fine. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-820;firefox-8203;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",mark.sellner
