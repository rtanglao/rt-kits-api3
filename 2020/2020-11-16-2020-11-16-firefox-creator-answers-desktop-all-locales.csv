Whenever I open Firefox, all the pages of my last session are reopened. If I want to open a new window, it happens again.  I would like to know how I can fix this problem. I'd just like to open a new Firefox window without having all my previous pages opened automatically.  </p><p>Thanks in advance for your help and sorry for my bad English. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",mathg92800

I downloaded Firefox on my desktop tower computer. If I remember correctly the repair person referred to Firefox as a ""browser"". I was also directed to a ""search engine"" by the name of ""Duck Duck Go"". I was informed that these two (2) products worked well together. So I downloaded Firefox and Duck Duck Go on my desktop and they have worked well together. I now have noticed that Mozilla/Firefox are promoting Firefox as a search engine also and not really recommending Duck Duck Go anymore, by not mentioning it.    So here's my dilemma. Do I make sure that I have the most recent version of Firefox on my computer and if I do, then do I download Firefox as my new search engine? If I don't have the latest version of Firefox on my computer then I will download both new programs. Is changing the search engine to Firefox the best decision? I know, I know, I'm asking the Fox to guard the hen house,  no pun </pre> <p>intended.  </p><pre>       Thank You,         Karl Becker        Email address: moondanceacre@gmail.com </pre>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",moondanceacre

But when I add more matches and update the extension it shows a popup asking the user to allow for the newly added permision. Is this expected behaviour. I am asking this since in case of chrome these popups don't appear for force installed extensions even after adding new matches.

In Firefox on MacOS 10.14.6, I get much slower speeds than in Chrome on the same machine (2012 Mac mini).  As you can see in the attached screenshots, Chrome maxes out my LAN bandwidth at ~988 Mbps (entire network is 1000 Mbps ethernet) but Firefox only achieves ~642 Mbps.  This was done on the same computer, just in the two different browsers and just a minute or so apart.  I also tried Firefox in Private Mode and got the same ~650 Mbps result.  I've done this repeatedly throughout the day and always get almost the same results; Firefox never gets over ~650 Mbps. </p><p>I also tried Firefox on an Ubuntu machine and get almost identical results as Chrome does on MacOS... ~985 Mbps.  So it seems like Firefox is Ok on Ubuntu, but slower for some reason on MacOS. </p><p>I would expect the two to be about the same in terms of raw throughput.  Does anyone know what might cause this and is there any way to fix it? </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-820;firefox-8203;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",interconnect
