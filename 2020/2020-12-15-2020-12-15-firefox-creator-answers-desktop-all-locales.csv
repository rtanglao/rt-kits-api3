When I migrated I took a backup of all my e-mails from 2009 to 2019 by putting them in a map in Explorer - they are saved as .elm-files. Today I would like to import my elm-files to Outlook, which is easy (copy and paste). The problem is that Outlook doesn´t know how to sort my elm-files according to their original date. The original date is written in each of my elm-files, but Outlook dates them according to the day when I imported them to Outlook, which means that I can´t see my Thunderbird mails in Outlook in chronological order. Anybody who knows a good solution to this? I have Windows 10. </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",LJV777
