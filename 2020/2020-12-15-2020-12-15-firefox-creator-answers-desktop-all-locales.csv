I have been experiencing a few problems with Firefox over the last month or so. I currently use a Mac desktop and a Macbook and they sync together. I keep Firefox up to date as updates become available. My Macbook is fine but on my desktop I frequently have to Force Quit the application. In addition, I cannot clear my browsing history, cannot add a new bookmark nor able to delete a bookmark.  I thought at first that maybe a bookmark I added may have caused a problem (?) on my desktop but the problem did not transfer over to my laptop upon syncing. I was thinking of uninstalling Firefox and reinstalling it but I wanted to get an expert opinion. Is there a fix for this problem, have I done something wrong?  As well, in your opinion are ad blocking applications such as 'ADBLOCK' or 'U BLOCK ORIGIN' compatible with Firefox / Apple Mac? Thank you in advance for any assistance you can give me, and thank you for continually delivering a superior browser! </p>",mac-os;desktop;beta;fix-problems;firefox-840;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",highend
