I've got an issue with the spellchecker that seems to be a bug. I installed the dictionary, and made sure it was on. However it won't detect even things like gfhjrjdjd as being misspelled. It's really annoying. It doesn't seem to be able to detect text boxes - even this one. There is no option to enable it with right click. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",pjblackmoore

I've been buying a few things off Amazon over the past few months.  But now if I'm quick enough to type out their puzzle I'm then told that they will send me (OTP) One Time Password, but a OTP never arrives.  So, thought I'd check with you to see if you knew of a remedy, or perhaps there is something I need to do within Firefox.  I must add here, that I have used Firefox for many, many years and do all of my/our online shopping with Firefox and never struck a problem before now. Hoping you have a suggestion.
