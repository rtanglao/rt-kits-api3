I found an easy way to easily regain access to data I lost by downloading it again. However, as I said, they are many and doing that 1 by 1 is gonna take weeks. Does anyone have a suggestion as to how I could download more than one of them at the same time? Copying and pasting link by link would be a lot of work and if I could use a shortcut from Firefox or maybe a plugin someone may know, I'd be immensely grateful.

Both logins are without a password. There is no stored data in lockwise for this site. If you save a random password for an unnecessary login ([PASSWORD]-[1111]), then it will be displayed in lockwise. Removing an account from lockwise removes the password, but does not affect the login. The only solution I found was to change the lockwise login. ([PASSWORD]-[1111] -&gt; [1]-[111]), But after deleting this account, the login [PASSWORD] is returned to the drop-down menu. </p>",windows-7;desktop;sync;firefox-820;,firefox,sync,en-US,1361378;1361385;,AquiloSpiritus

I have two Firefox icons on my workspace - one on the desktop and one in the taskbar. Although they appear to be the same icon, they each open two different versions of the Firefox browser. The desktop icon opens the 32-bit and the taskbar opens the 64-bit. I don't like the consistent overriding of my preferences when I open the 32-bit version I often open the browser to find my bookmark toolbar has been deleted. Over and over. Recovering my bookmarks bar is time-consuming and tiresome  The 64-bit version has been consistent. I wanted to create a 64-bit desktop icon and have not found a way to do it.  When I try to create a desktop shortcut for the 64bit Firefox (it only appears on the taskbar), I have mysteriously got Opera icons for each try.  When I create a desktop shortcut from the open home page in the Firefox browser, the shortcut appears with the Startpage or the Opera icon.  I learned that icons have their own folders.... so I found and opened one  for Mozilla Firefox -but the folder has only three Opera icons and one Startpage icon.   I have no idea how the taskbar 64-bit icon has kept its original Firefox appearance from the original install, nor how the 32-bit icon in the desktop has also maintained its appearance. I cannot find any other icon folders in any of the other Mozilla folders. Any suggestions short of starting over with uninstalling the lot and reinstalling? </p>",desktop;other;,firefox,other,en-US,"",dralion

So, thought I'd check with you to see if you knew of a remedy, or perhaps there is something I need to do within Firefox.
