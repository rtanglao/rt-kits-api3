I've been buying a few things off Amazon over the past few months.  But now if I'm quick enough to type out their puzzle I'm then told that they will send me (OTP) One Time Password, but a OTP never arrives.  So, thought I'd check with you to see if you knew of a remedy, or perhaps there is something I need to do within Firefox.  I must add here, that I have used Firefox for many, many years and do all of my/our online shopping with Firefox and never struck a problem before now. Hoping you have a suggestion.
