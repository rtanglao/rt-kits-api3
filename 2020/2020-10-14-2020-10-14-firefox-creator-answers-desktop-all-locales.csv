However I've got two other computers I'd like to try and transfer data from, and unfortunately made the mistake of not syncing the browsers between those two computers beforehand. </p><p>So I'm wondering if it's possible to sync the data between the browsers on all three computers and how to do so, and if I attempt to sync the data between them, will they merge together or will one overwrite the other? </p><p>Thank you for your time and assistance. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",csaffel97

I do not want the drop down to open - at all. </p><p>On a Mac the drop down interferes with the normal entry user interface. The normal text interface is: type to move to first/last character use the up/down arrow. The dropdown interferes with this standard behavior. The up/down arrow will not move the cursor to the first/last character in the url - until/ or unless the user hits &lt;esc&gt; to close the dropdown. </p><p>I have looked at the browser.urlbar preferences and do not see a setting that will change this behavior. </p><p>Is there a way to do this, so that url entry is doen entirely in the url bar - and not in the drop down. (and before this is discussed - I do Not want to have Any type ahead/lookup done on the urls entered, and have already disabled all of these options, so there is no need for the dropdown). </p><p>Thank you Mac OS X 10.13.6 FF 81.0 </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-810;,firefox,other,en-US,"",forsaleinpgh

I used it occasionally to speed-up page loading when my network is slow and it really worked. Even Chrome, Brave and Edge are still providing that option. Really sad to see Firefox doing this. </p><p>PS: I know it still can be changed inside about:config.

Running other browsers such as Chrome and my connection works fine.  I open Firefox, and start going to different websites then soon thereafter Firefox websites aren't loading anymore on Firefox.  I go to my other applications and browsers and they can no longer access the internet.  They act as if there is no internet connection.  </p><p>I go to my internet settings and all shows still connected fine, although nothing that connects to the internet works.  I try to disconnect my connection (with the internet settings) and then re-connect it.  It doesn't change anything. To clear this up, I have to go to my internet router and shut it down and wait for it to come back up and reconnect, then I can use internet applications again, until I go on to Firefox and the issue recurs again.     </p><p>This just started happening a couple days ago, as I had been using Firefox fine for 2 years on this new Thinkpad.   </p><p>Please help. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",abullinger

Now this evening, its asking for a password and no matter how many times I enter it, no go! I read your forums and disabled password authentication under tools.
