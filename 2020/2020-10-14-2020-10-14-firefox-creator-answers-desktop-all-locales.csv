I was a constant user of Firefox until a year or so ago.  The bloat came in and I followed the hordes to Chrome.  Chrome now has similar problems, (21 instances for 3 sites?  Really?), so I looked into Firefox once more and found it has apparently been updated.  I took the plunge and reinstalled looking forward to easier browsing again.  Hmmm. </p><p>I am a user of ebay and pay via Paypal.  (Just saying that, I guess some of you know what is coming now.)  I use Eset Internet Security which has always been very secure, easy to manage and has never given a problem with ebay or Paypal in any way with Chrome.  I have it set to open a separate secure browser for Paypal transactions.  Using Firefox I cannot get any Paypal transaction to complete. </p><p>It has a variety of issues which I seem to meet at random on the way.  Sometimes it just refuses to start, the circling icon sits in the small secure browser screen which is empty white and spins ad infinitum.  Sometimes it gets to an authentication screen with a picture of a code to type in, except the code is missing and the box is empty white.  If I refresh, it shows the code but the first entry is always incorrect then the second entry, if I am offered it, is accepted and I continue to login.  Once the login details have been entered and I see the message confirming the data has been sent to <a href=""http://www.paypal.com"" rel=""nofollow"">www.paypal.com</a>, sometimes it stalls here again and never gets beyond that.  Very occasionally I get past this and see a yellow pling with the message ""Looks like this action is not supported. Please return and report this error so that we can support it in the future. (invalid client_ID or redirect_uri)"".  Well I am reporting it but I'm not holding my breath as this problem has been around for months if other people are to be believed. </p><p>I have cleared all cookies and caches and restarted Firefox.  Nothing.  I found a thread here where someone advised turning off location blocking for Paypal.  No difference.  Payments go through fine with Chrome so it can't be my security settings external to the browser, (Eset), and it can't be a Paypal issue.  What is wrong with Firefox that such a necessary piece of functionality is either broken or is so unusual to set up that so many people, (I've searched so I have seen them), cannot make it work? </p><p>Any advice on this will be warmly welcomed. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1358047;1358051;,bordonbert

It was very efficient. </p><p>Since the latest update, Firefox ""remembers"" any changes in printer settings for the next time it prints.
