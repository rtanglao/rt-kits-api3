Just lately I have been unable to open a link inside a website I visit regularly. <a href=""http://Sailnet.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Sailnet.com</a>. I can open the home page, but when I click on the individual categories, nothing happens and I can’t access some of the messages I have created before the problem. Also, I like the political cartoons on <a href=""http://Politico.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Politico.com</a>. Previously I could scroll through these by just clicking the &gt; next arrow, but this no longer works. I don’t even know if this is a Firefox problem, but I would like to try and fix it. Thanks for anyone’s help. JR </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",hughes_roger
