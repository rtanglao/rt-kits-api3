Hers is fine but mine has a password box that pops up. At first, I just clicked the x and the emails would pour in, but after a few days, that would not work any longer. Sending is fine but receiving will not work. Then after repeatedly enter my password from long ago, the receiving of emails started working for a day. Now this evening, its asking for a password and no matter how many times I enter it, no go! I read your forums and disabled password authentication under tools. No go! </p><p>Can someone please help me. </p><p><br> </p><p>Best, William </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-810;firefox-8102;,firefox,other,en-US,"",mulletbay1

Just lately I have been unable to open a link inside a website I visit regularly. <a href=""http://Sailnet.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Sailnet.com</a>. I can open the home page, but when I click on the individual categories, nothing happens and I can’t access some of the messages I have created before the problem. Also, I like the political cartoons on <a href=""http://Politico.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Politico.com</a>. Previously I could scroll through these by just clicking the &gt; next arrow, but this no longer works. I don’t even know if this is a Firefox problem, but I would like to try and fix it. Thanks for anyone’s help. JR </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",hughes_roger
