Allow?""  My issue is that I cannot find a keyboard-only method to answer that pop-up.  Most of the time, I cannot find the ""click"" control to say either ""allow"" or ""don't allow.""  I hope that there is a way that I can respond to those pop-ups without sighted assistance because I do not have such assistance readily available, and the pop-up apparently disappears after a few seconds.  The old Internet Explorer had a shortcut ALT-N to reach that bar or whatever it was so that a blind person could enter a response.  Firefox needs something like that function if it doesn't already exist so that we who are blind would have access to this type of pop-up equal that of sighted users. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,customize,en-US,1376456;,knobman
