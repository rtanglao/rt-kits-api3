However, when I download one single image at a time, that file seems to download immediately without any issue, and appears in the Downloads window. I rebooted Firefox in safe mode to see if there was an add-on or extension causing the issues, but I still have the problem. I even reset my Downloads folder using the config settings.

A <strong>reliable</strong> and <strong>robust MX mail server</strong> system, that we could rent each month.  </p><p>I'm actually renting 2 Cloud VPS, and my biggest issue was to have a trustable mail server that would not look suspicious for spam filters (spam assassin, Google etc). </p><p>That's the only reason why I pay a Google Suite every month.. to have a reliable and solid  @mydomain email, and be sure my emails will be delivered every time. But I would totally prefer to give you this money better than them. </p><p>I know there's other solutions already, but I think it make sense for Mozilla to have this service, since emails and mail servers are very sensitive regarding privacy, personal data etc. and we all trust you more than Google empire. </p><p>I don't know if you can read this, but please tell me if there's a better place to send this message. </p><p>Thank you very much, Long life to Mozilla, all the best, </p><p>Phil </p>",mac-os;desktop;beta;other;firefox-850;,firefox,other,en-US,"",phlppe.boehm

Allow?""  My issue is that I cannot find a keyboard-only method to answer that pop-up.  Most of the time, I cannot find the ""click"" control to say either ""allow"" or ""don't allow.""  I hope that there is a way that I can respond to those pop-ups without sighted assistance because I do not have such assistance readily available, and the pop-up apparently disappears after a few seconds.  The old Internet Explorer had a shortcut ALT-N to reach that bar or whatever it was so that a blind person could enter a response.  Firefox needs something like that function if it doesn't already exist so that we who are blind would have access to this type of pop-up equal that of sighted users. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,customize,en-US,1376456;,knobman
