But the created exercises are displayed randomly. Sometimes they appear, sometimes they don't. When they appear, if I refresh the page, they disappear ... I am using Firefox version 82.0.3 on Ubuntu 20.04. It's amazing because everything works perfectly with Firefox for Windows and for Android. Where does this display problem come from? How to fix this issue? Here is my test page: <a href=""https://didakeo.com/article-3/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://didakeo.com/article-3/</a> Thanks for your help ! </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-820;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Blogueur

I found I am unable to see the long toolbar after clicking onto my account icon, what I can see is half a length of the original ones. Also, Youtube always keep on logging me out. I've tried clearing the cookies and history, disable all the add-ons, reset the browser as well as boot Firefox into safe mode but none of these work.

I pin Firefox to my Start menu.  I put a shortcut to Firefox on my desktop.  I have even created a new folder on my desktop with a different name and made the contents ""read only"".  I have made Firefox my default Web browser. No matter what I do - if I restart this laptop all of the above goes away.  All Firefox appearances disappear.  A couple days ago, Firefox even disappeared from my Start menu list of all programs.  It's still installed, but I have to navigate to its location to open it. What else can I do?  Is Microsoft doing this on purpose? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,other,en-US,"",dliquin
