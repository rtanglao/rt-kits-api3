I pin Firefox to my Start menu.  I put a shortcut to Firefox on my desktop.  I have even created a new folder on my desktop with a different name and made the contents ""read only"".  I have made Firefox my default Web browser. No matter what I do - if I restart this laptop all of the above goes away.  All Firefox appearances disappear.  A couple days ago, Firefox even disappeared from my Start menu list of all programs.  It's still installed, but I have to navigate to its location to open it. What else can I do?  Is Microsoft doing this on purpose? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,other,en-US,"",dliquin
