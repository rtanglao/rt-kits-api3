If I enter just one word as the search term and press enter, it takes 5-6 seconds and I am taken to that website (for example searching ""facebook"" takes me to <a href=""http://facebook.com"" rel=""nofollow"">facebook.com</a>).  Searching something gibberish like ""asdasd"" takes me to a page to buy that domain). Searching something with a space in it like ""asd asd"" and pressing enter doesn't do anything. Even clicking the ""Go"" arrow doesnt do anything.  </p><p>My history is there in the histroy tab and all the suggestions options in preferences are already set. </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-820;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1359873;,prateek.saini.1999
