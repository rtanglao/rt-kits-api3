Many of the passwords i have stored are either computer generated or are a few of my own variables. Recently I had trouble logging in to Netflix. I called and spoke to different techies who advised me after 2 hours of ""troubleshooting"" to erase all my cookies ""temporarily"" after telling me that other clients reported similar log in trouble with clients who had FIREFOX browsers. They suggested after erasing my cookies to re=enter Netflix via my Microsoft browser, and that I could resume Firefox afterwords. We tried that, and it still didn't work. The next day I tried it again to no avail and finally reset the settings to save cookies as needed. HOWEVER, I began to discover over a period of several days that each and every one of my accounts that I use regularly with the exception of one..that stores my password in its account (plus I remember it) still works. With every other account I had tried so many times to enter with either old passwords OR new ones..and after repeated attempts over a period of time...discovered that the computer would NOT respond to ""saved or remember password"" instructions..and I would be told that I needed a temporary code to re enter password to reset or create a new passwd. i used every variation on Google to create new ones, use old ones and got the same dead end. Then I found that other accounts had stopped ""remembering' passwords that were ""memorized""..and I had to go thru the same process with them. Even in the rare occasion that I got into my gmail account, that only worked once. The next time i logged in i had to request a phone in code. Kindly advise me what is happening. Is it settings, cookies, or something else? THANKyou for your support. Aloha from Hawaii. P.S. I am wondering too if Google, which never seems to recognize my ""location"" or computer ""thinks"" i am somewhere else than my actual location in Molokai, Hawaii. Also, I don't use Google as a search engine. I use Duck Duck go, if that makes a difference. I only keep Google because i still have a gmail email account. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,other,en-US,"",maileorme

Now that is not happening on a regular basis. Typically when I click on the website it now does not start automatically. To resolve this I can ""sign out"" and then sign in using my login credentials. This is obviously a time waster. Once I am signed in again, I might be able to stop the streaming and log back in automatically for the next few hours, but certainly by the next morning the streaming does not start automatically and I need to go through the login process described above. There must be a setting somewhere to allow the automatic streaming to start even if I have not visited that website in the last 2 - 3 days. Any help? suggestions? thoughts?
