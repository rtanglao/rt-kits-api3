This is my last attempt at installing Firefox - currently I am using Brave as a general browser and Chrome as my browser to stream with: Netflix, Crave TV, CBC Gem. After installation, I loaded Netflix and let it run through the Crimes of Grindewald promo. Everything was fine for a few minutes and then my system froze: no mouse, no keyboard. This has happened in the past.  I am using an Acer PC that is only a few years old and more than meets the requirements. I have 0 problems streaming the previously mentioned sitesn chrome, and can stream from a few places on Brave.  I would like to cross over to the grey side, but streaming is very important and there are no substiutes. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you, Shawn </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",nephalim.1967

I'm posting this in hopes of getting help with a UI responsiveness problem that seems specific to Linux when GPU usage is very high. I use distributed computing through BOINC when weather is cold enough to allow it, but I've noticed that when my GPU is working on a task, Firefox is very unresponsive in most regards; scrolling lags behind my actual inputs, it takes longer to render new pages, and videos have issues like video/audio desync and audio stuttering. </p><p>That would seem normal to me considering my system resources are in heavy use, except for two things: these issues do not occur in Blink-based browsers (I've temporarily switched to Brave because of this issue), and more relevantly, they only occur in Firefox in <em>Linux</em>, not Windows Firefox. </p><p>I have already checked if this is because of settings or extensions by creating a new blank profile (which I am using right now), and that's not it - turning off hardware acceleration doesn't help either. </p><p>I see the Troubleshooting Information dump has a lot of system and hardware data in it, but I'd be happy to provide more details if needed. Thanks! </p>",linux;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-810;firefox-8102;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",VII.rosa
