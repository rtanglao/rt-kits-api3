After multiple hours, we still cannot get anything to print from Firefox UNLESS you go into the print settings, and click ""preferences"" in the Windows dialogue box (even if you don't change a single thing), only then will it work perfectly every time. This isn't an acceptable option though as we need it to work rapidly and automatically each time though the browser. </p><p>Our printer is set up correctly, up to date drivers, etc. All programs in windows will print fine, Chrome and Edge print fine, so I'm assuming it's specifically a Firefox issue.
