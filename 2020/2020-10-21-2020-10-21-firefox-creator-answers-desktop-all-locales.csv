I THINK my android phone is synced but the older computer also a window 10 laptop refuses to allow me to sign in with my original password. I have no idea if Im suppose to have a different password on each device or what is wrong that I can not sync everything </p><p>Any HELP and suggestions? </p>,desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",taccardi

I'm posting this in hopes of getting help with a UI responsiveness problem that seems specific to Linux when GPU usage is very high. I use distributed computing through BOINC when weather is cold enough to allow it, but I've noticed that when my GPU is working on a task, Firefox is very unresponsive in most regards; scrolling lags behind my actual inputs, it takes longer to render new pages, and videos have issues like video/audio desync and audio stuttering. </p><p>That would seem normal to me considering my system resources are in heavy use, except for two things: these issues do not occur in Blink-based browsers (I've temporarily switched to Brave because of this issue), and more relevantly, they only occur in Firefox in <em>Linux</em>, not Windows Firefox. </p><p>I have already checked if this is because of settings or extensions by creating a new blank profile (which I am using right now), and that's not it - turning off hardware acceleration doesn't help either. </p><p>I see the Troubleshooting Information dump has a lot of system and hardware data in it, but I'd be happy to provide more details if needed.
