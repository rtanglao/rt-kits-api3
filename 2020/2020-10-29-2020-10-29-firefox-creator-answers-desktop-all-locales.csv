A note has always said to disable popup blockers before launching, but I didn't need to do so in the past. I have now specifically allowed popups for <a href=""https://online.citi.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://online.citi.com</a>, which is the page containing the launch button, but this doesn't help. I can see the launch button change color when I move over it and click, but nothing happens. I also temporarily unchecked the Block popup windows option, but that didn't work either. This popup applet works in Edge, but I'd rather use Firefox. Any help would be appreciated. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",wbozenhard

Lately any time I open a new window it insists on opening several dozen tabs from previous sessions.  I cleaned the cache. No change. I rebooted. NO change. I uninstalled it using an installer (Revo) that supposedly checks for all kinds of leftover files.  I then rebooted. I saw no signs of it on my machine.  I downloaded a fresh copy and installed from scratch.  When I open the initial page it's fine. As soon as I open a new page all the old things are back in a gazillion little tabs. It's kind of annoying. Not to mention the time it takes to close everything by hand. </p><p>Any suggestions will be  appreciated. </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,other,en-US,1362107;,stevek
