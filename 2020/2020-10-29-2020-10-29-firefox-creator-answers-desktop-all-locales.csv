Lately any time I open a new window it insists on opening several dozen tabs from previous sessions.  I cleaned the cache. No change. I rebooted. NO change. I uninstalled it using an installer (Revo) that supposedly checks for all kinds of leftover files.  I then rebooted. I saw no signs of it on my machine.  I downloaded a fresh copy and installed from scratch.  When I open the initial page it's fine. As soon as I open a new page all the old things are back in a gazillion little tabs. It's kind of annoying. Not to mention the time it takes to close everything by hand. </p><p>Any suggestions will be  appreciated. </p>,desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,other,en-US,"",stevek
