1316856,2020-12-05 17:58:50 -0800,2020-12-05 17:58:50 -0800,New Tab Background,<p>I'm writing this on the 6th of December in 2020 using <strong>Firefox 83</strong> on <strong>MacOS 10.15.5 Catalina</strong>.  </p><p>I think it would add a lot to the browsing experience if I was to add an image as the background of <strong>Firefox'</strong>s new tab homepage. This has come up a few times on <em>support.mozilla</em> but they all appear to be either dated or neglect <strong>MacOS</strong> and <em>only</em> consider <strong>Windows</strong> or <strong>Linux</strong>. They all involve going to <em>about:support</em> and opening what people say is listed as the <em>profile directory</em> and creating a folder called <em>chrome</em>. Then creating a <em>.css</em> and pasting/writing certain code. There's a few more small steps and then you're supposed to restart <strong>Firefox</strong> and it's ostensibly there. Can somebody suggest a method that works in 2020 on <strong>MacOS Catalina</strong> with <strong>Firefox 83</strong>? Any information would be greatly appreciated. </p>,mac-os;desktop;tips;firefox-830;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",NCosta

I have my settings set to where things should be remembered and cookies should not be cleared but i am still being logged out of the sites I stay logged into. This issue started in October after one of the firefox updates. I am having the same problem on both of my computers, one with windows 10 and one with windows 7. Firefox appears to be clearing cookies because even though I don't stay logged into ebay due to having two accounts, my search settings in ebay keep getting cleared too, just as they were if I had cleared the cookies myself. And my settings are set to where cookies should not be cleared. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-830;,firefox,other,en-US,1373650;,Dakota66
