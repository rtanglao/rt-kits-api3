I have my settings set to where things should be remembered and cookies should not be cleared but i am still being logged out of the sites I stay logged into. This issue started in October after one of the firefox updates. I am having the same problem on both of my computers, one with windows 10 and one with windows 7. Firefox appears to be clearing cookies because even though I don't stay logged into ebay due to having two accounts, my search settings in ebay keep getting cleared too, just as they were if I had cleared the cookies myself. And my settings are set to where cookies should not be cleared. </p>",windows-7;desktop;other;firefox-830;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Dakota66
