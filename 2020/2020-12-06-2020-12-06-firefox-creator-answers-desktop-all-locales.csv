Now that I have updated to the newest version of Firefox, I cannot find a replacement for Menu Mod. Google recommends Menu Wizard but, that add-on has also been phased out. What add-on will allow users to edit the Firefox menus? And if there is not one, why? I am really regretting updated Firefox because of this. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,customize,en-US,1373670;,jackmummert

They don't have scroll bars and I can't get to items in them that I need to.  Interestingly, the Firefox dropdowns (View History, Firefox Account, Menu) are also all truncated but they all have scroll bars. </p><p>I have discovered that in Windows Display Settings the HP screen Scaling is by default set to ""125% (Recommended)"".  If I set it to 100%, the problem goes away.  If I set it to 150%, the dropdowns get longer but still not enough for me to access stuff at the bottom of the extension dropdowns. </p><p>I'm not sure if this is an HP screen problem, a Firefox problem or a Windows problem.  I'm beginning to think it's an HP one because if I set the HP screen as the primary and set the Dell monitor to 125%, or 150%, there is no problem.  However I thought I'd post this here in case it is a Firefox issue.  I figure Firefox would want to know about it if it is Firefox-related. </p><p>I'd be glad to hear any thoughts on how I might be able to fix this myself, or where you believe the problem lies. </p><p>Cheers, Nick. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",nick.wood

This has come up a few times on <em>support.mozilla</em> but they all appear to be either dated or neglect <strong>MacOS</strong> and <em>only</em> consider <strong>Windows</strong> or <strong>Linux</strong>. They all involve going to <em>about:support</em> and opening what people say is listed as the <em>profile directory</em> and creating a folder called <em>chrome</em>. Then creating a <em>.css</em> and pasting/writing certain code. There's a few more small steps and then you're supposed to restart <strong>Firefox</strong> and it's ostensibly there. Can somebody suggest a method that works in 2020 on <strong>MacOS Catalina</strong> with <strong>Firefox 83</strong>?
