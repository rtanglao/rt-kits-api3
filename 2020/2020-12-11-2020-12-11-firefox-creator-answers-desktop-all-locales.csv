Quando apertar o botão, mesmo logado, não aparece a lista das playlists para adicionar o vídeo. Além disso, mesmo quando aperto o botão para fazer login no canto superior direito do site, ele ainda aparece como se eu não estivesse logado quando eu clico no menu lateral para visualizar as playlists, etc. Vou deixar um print desse erro em anexo. </p><p>Alguém sabe o que é isso?

I DO NOT want this installation to overwrite that earlier version.  But that ""upgrade"" button makes me think that is what is likely to happen.  How do I install it without it overwriting the older extended release version I already have installed? </p><p>On a different topic, I have learned that Flash will be discontinued at the end of this month.  Can anyone tell me how this will impact my browsers?  My online banking site uses Flash extensively, and I prefer using Firefox for that site.  I'm assuming Chrome, which keeps updating itself automatically no matter what I do to stop it, will accommodate the change.  But if I want to keep using that older extended release version of Firefox I have, what is likely to happen?   </p><p>Thank you, </p><p>Dandelion </p>",windows-7;desktop;download-and-install_1;firefox-520;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1375198;,Larkspur19

I recently updated the HD cable and the harddisk to a SSD. I mainly use firefox as my internet browser and I would like to continue to do so. </p><p>Today my macbook crashed, it does so sometimes, but it always restarts with no problem - my firefox too: reopening all my tabs - it is not unusual for me to have 20 tabs open at the same time. </p><p>Today my macbook crashed and restarted, but when I pressed to reopen the firefox app, nothing happened. The little dot that shows, when a macbook application is open, shows for a second or two, but then disappears as if firefox is trying to open, but then shuts down. I tried holding down alt/option key down while starting firefox, but to no awail.  How do I fix this? </p><p>I thought the app maybe needed to update, so I went to download firefox again (through google chrome browser). A new firefox application was then created - 'firefox 2' open with no problem, but I'm not signed in.  </p><p>I can sign in now, but I can't sync - this is due to another unrelated problem concerning my firefox account email, which I haven't updated in due time - the email-domain I had used for my primary email (@sol.dk) has been terminated. This means ALL my saved passwords, my bookmarks, my search histrory - everthing is lost. </p><p>Does anybody have a clue how to solve this primary and secondary problem? 1) Why is my original firefox application for macbook suddenly not working? Is this fixable? 2) If it is not fixable, is there anyway mozilla/firefox can help me retrieve my firefox account with all my passwords and so on?

However lately I've been thinking about how I can ensure that when I communicate on the internet nothing is left on my computer, either where I've been or who / what type of communication has taken place. I perform several financial transactions daily with institutions local and out of country.  I know of a very recent issue one person I know had  on their PC, They lent it for use to someone they know and they were able find history of communications and email addresses etc.  It was a very difficult situation for that person when their email was hacked and websites tracked from a person / persons unknown.   I've turned on the Firefox option of deleting all history  and cookies and have done that in Windows internet options (at least as far as I can determine).  Based on what I've done, is there anywhere on my PC where internet communication is stored that I can remove when I've finished using the internet?

Using the 2 finger on the keypad,  I can increase the scaling making the page even larger but when trying too reduce the scaling it stops at the original setting.  I cannot shrink it further. I tried on different browser and I do not have that issue. Never noticed it before because I usually work with external 4K monitor and the increase scaling in that case is almost mandatory. Tonight i am working on my laptop(Asus Zenbook 14) without external screens and no mouse.  Attached is the screenshot of this page.  I cannot make it smaller.

That is, something in the page automatically launches the print dialogue. Usually that is wanted/expected behavior. For example, you just clicked on a ""Print"" button on the page. In my case, there is one page I use a lot that tries to auto-print a PDF. But I have PDF's set to open outside of FireFox. So the PDF loads in Acrobat (expected behavior), and FireFox tries to print the HTML page that is open in FireFox. Also presumably expected behavior, but not wanted if it is the PDF I want to print. This has gotten annoying, and so I'm looking for a control that suppresses printing. Ten minutes of googleing and all I can find are articles for the control to suppress the dialogue for printing, and instead print directly to the default printer, ie silent printing. I don't want to suppress the dialog. I want to auto-cancel the print job. That is, I want to disallow a web page from invoking the print dialog at all, by overriding the print instruction. Such as setting could either be set for a specific page, set or globally; either would work for me. Is there a control for that? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",daniel164
