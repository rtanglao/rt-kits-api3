Using the 2 finger on the keypad,  I can increase the scaling making the page even larger but when trying too reduce the scaling it stops at the original setting.  I cannot shrink it further. I tried on different browser and I do not have that issue. Never noticed it before because I usually work with external 4K monitor and the increase scaling in that case is almost mandatory. Tonight i am working on my laptop(Asus Zenbook 14) without external screens and no mouse.  Attached is the screenshot of this page.  I cannot make it smaller. Any parameter/trick to resolve this issue? </p><p>JMarc </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,customize,en-US,1374985;1374986;1374999;,JMarc61
1317516,2020-12-10 18:32:10 -0800,2020-12-10 18:32:10 -0800,Suppress auto printing,"<p>Apparently it is possible to write a web page such that it pops up the printer dialogue on load. That is, something in the page automatically launches the print dialogue. Usually that is wanted/expected behavior. For example, you just clicked on a ""Print"" button on the page. In my case, there is one page I use a lot that tries to auto-print a PDF. But I have PDF's set to open outside of FireFox. So the PDF loads in Acrobat (expected behavior), and FireFox tries to print the HTML page that is open in FireFox. Also presumably expected behavior, but not wanted if it is the PDF I want to print. This has gotten annoying, and so I'm looking for a control that suppresses printing. Ten minutes of googleing and all I can find are articles for the control to suppress the dialogue for printing, and instead print directly to the default printer, ie silent printing. I don't want to suppress the dialog. I want to auto-cancel the print job. That is, I want to disallow a web page from invoking the print dialog at all, by overriding the print instruction. Such as setting could either be set for a specific page, set or globally; either would work for me. Is there a control for that? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",daniel164

Esto me pasa con Facebook, Twitter, Instagram y con Linkedin. Es muy molesto tener que ir logueandome cada vez que cierro una pestaña, es más, me pasa hasta con Google, porque algunas veces al cerrar la pestaña de Google, si vuelvo a entrar en Google me pide otra vez que acepte los términos de acuerdo de Google. ¿Cómo puedo evitar esto, es la primera vez que me pasa una cosa así desde que uso Firefox?
