I install the release, all is well. i download a file and firefox does it, however it is not to where i want it. it downloads to the download folder. </p><p>It is then that I realize that the release changed my options of asking me where to download the file. If a USER has specified to be asked where to download the file, this should not be changed with every release change. </p><p>How would you like it if every release asked you what language you would like???  </p><p>Once the settings are made in options, the new release should not modify it to what firefox thinks it should be. </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",bobpatbp
