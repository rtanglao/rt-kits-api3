It used to be integrated in the top row of web browsers, but due to changes in Firefox (among others) it then used a separate taskbar that appeared at the bottom of the screen. This was simple to use, but did require manually turning off at times due to some websites using the bottom of the screen for chats etc. This has just been automatically updated and is now unworkable! I only have access to one identity not four, no automatic login (such as this forum) and the need to click, click, click, click, click, etc. just to get access to a login that I now have to edit, and cut and paste manually. As it is no longer fit for purpose, I want to install a previous version with the taskbar. Does anyone have a link where I can download it from? </p><p>In the meantime, I have asked RoboForm how I can extract the data so I can move onto something that works. They have declined to reply. </p><p>Can someone please advise how I can automatically transfer the existing data into Firefox and use this for my automated ogin information. I can then use the same on my mobile devices. </p><p>Alternatively, can someone offer an alternative solution to RoboForm that works with browers and syncs to mobile devices?

I install the release, all is well. i download a file and firefox does it, however it is not to where i want it. it downloads to the download folder. </p><p>It is then that I realize that the release changed my options of asking me where to download the file. If a USER has specified to be asked where to download the file, this should not be changed with every release change. </p><p>How would you like it if every release asked you what language you would like???  </p><p>Once the settings are made in options, the new release should not modify it to what firefox thinks it should be. </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;download-and-install_1;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,1380057;1380073;,bobpatbp
