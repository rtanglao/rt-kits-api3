I have two other camera devices on this computer, but neither of them are ever listed. </p><p>I use OBS as a video mixer and then Voicemeeter as an audio mixer. Firefox has no trouble selecting between the 8 audio input devices on this computer, so I'm not sure why video would be any different. </p><p>I need Firefox to use OBS's virtual camera for school and work, but it always defaults to Epoccam now. It used to default to my NDI Virtual Input, which I was able to use (but with some issues) to get video out of OBS, it just added an extra hop. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,1380053;,kevinsalvatorelli
