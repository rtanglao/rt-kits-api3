This is unacceptable to me, and I have tried to turn it off in settings, however, under the ""firefox updates""  heading, it only lists a version number.  It seems that it used to have an option to force requests for updates, but it's no longer there.  I have also read that others used that option but while it requested consent, it went ahead anyway until told no.  It doesn't take a recontextualization into a legal or sexual scenario to see how scummy this behavior is, as it is readily apparent.  If this kind of ""windows 10"" style update is all mozilla can offer me, I will happily switch to ungoogled chromium, however if there is a way to make it so updates can <strong>only</strong> happen when I click yes on update then I would much prefer to stick with firefox as it has been my favored browser for my entire life.
