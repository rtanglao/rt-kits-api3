Open Firefox and it just sits won’t even open home page (Tab).  Select another page from Bookmarks, same thing won’t load! Try to sign in to Firefox to Sync, nothing happens. Have even used a third party app to remove all traces of Firefox then reboot, reinstall Firefox and the problem continues. I have Firefox working on three other home computers all working perfectly.   This inability to run Firefox has been going on now for several weeks. Does the Firefox folks offer a app that removes all traces of a Firefox instantiation like it never was on my computer?   Maybe then a fresh install would work again.
