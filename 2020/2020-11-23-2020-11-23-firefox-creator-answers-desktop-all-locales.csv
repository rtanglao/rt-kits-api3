Shocking!  And this is still not fixed after years of developments... Why? To keep this allowed makes it too easy for hackers, especially with multiple screens and a shadow/background screens available which can be running in the background, not seen, when hackers do that.. Kind of the way TeamViewer allows help to be provided remotely. Kind of screen sharing. Oh well...  </p><p>Maybe need lots of complaints from you all to get this changed?..   </p><p><br> Try yourselves to use file://C:/ with 2 // and file:///C:/ with 3 // and both are allowing access to the whole file system and any data file. BONKERS??? But why to use 3 /// if 2 // still works? Insider's job or programming conflict? Why would Firefox programmers allow that? I do not understand... </p><p>I tried to use selective website blocker, but for file:/// that addon says that the page is not supported... Maybe another type of addon could be developed for this to be blocked and secured once and for all, but not sure if Firefox would allow such an access or such a blocking. May cause issues with Downloads and accessing download folder from within Firefox. <em>HOWEVER, they could block any system or file access from the ADDRESS BAR and SEARCH BAR and then do a work-around solution by developing a special warning 'dialog message' each time when any user (owner or remote user) tries to access forlder to see or use any file. That would be a lot like a guest account requiring password to access special folder or file, or wants to perform an action usually not allowed for a guest user. Password is required for that each time, or at leats a visual confirmation. That would help, I hope...</em> </p><p>Would need to re-educate users after this! TOO DANGEROUS TO KEEP THIS IN SUCH A WAY AS IT IS NOW!!!!  </p><p>DOES FIREFOX TEAM UNDERSTAND THIS? Maybe they forgot about this, maybe they did not figure out how to solve this, or maybe someone from an inside is helping hackers to have a very easy access? Not sure, but this ""open doors to all system and data files for anyone"" is shocking! </p><p><br> </p><p><strong>What about business or government people? What about online bullying and harrassment? What about privacy about which Firefox writes so much? Need more complaints to make this a serious issue. So, everyone, please write your own comments or complaints to Firefox and Chrome directly and maybe they will listen. This may take more work than we think, but my ideas may help. What about your ideas? Express them below and maybe they will help as well.</strong> </p><p><br> </p><p>You all can ask them for this to be blocked or solved, so ask. Maybe my ideas will help to get this moving. Write your own to them as well. And Microsoft may need to get involved as well because Firefox, and from what I read, Chrome allows this too... Other browsers may be doing that as well...!!!!!! There are loads of various browsers available!!!! I read something about Windows Policies, but I do not understand what that is...  </p><p><br> </p><p><strong>(( !!! ))</strong> If any of you will try any system changes in an attempt to try solving this issue, make sure you are okay to risk with crashed system requiring reinstall or recovery to be used, and then, write down all the changes you do in detail before carrying any further and applying them because that may ruin the system without a way to recover it. </p><p>Thank you in advance. </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-81;firefox-810;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",network43

Recently I updated my YNAB functionality from downloaded YNAB4 to server-based subscription nYNAB, which hasn't been equipped with all features for Safari, but is super-equipped (via TookKit developers) in Firefox. When I use Command Key to select multiple transactions in nYNAB, and then use the 2-finger scroll function on trackpad to find more below the visible range, the frame zooms out to infinitesimally small font, obviously making the font too small to recognize characters.  Recovering previous font is tedious at best and frustrating to waste time and risks a loss of task concentration. The referenced Support Page doesn't even mention this action. This action does not occur in Safari, by the way, nor do I believe it is unique to nYNAB when using Firefox. </p><p>Please kill this apparently inadvertent Zoom action and substitute a MacTrackpad-friendly shortcut in next release.

I've tried other browsers (Edge, Chrome) and none of this happens. I've also attempted a few fixes like resetting Firefox, reinstalling Firefox, changing settings in the print preview (which is an excellent way to see the problem without even having to print). </p><p>Specific example: A PDF attachment in Roundcube Webmail is printed, and the text fields have the font size adjusting to the height of the field. In this particular instance I will share an example where the original PDF has a form text/memo field that defaults to use Helvetica font with auto-sizing - begins at about 12px and gets smaller to fit the text inside the box. </p><p>Printing this PDF from Firefox (to an actual printer or to PDF) results in the bad font settings mentioned above, and when using a PDF printer I find that the font changed from the original's size 10 to Arial size 62.

For example, If I have one notification waiting from YouTube when launching Firefox, I'll see it twice when opening notification center.  This doesn't happen, if Firefox is running and notifications come in, and it only happens with YouTube. </p><p>Also, This didn't seem to be a problem on Firefox 82.0.3 when I initially upgraded to Big Sur.  It seems to have started with version 83. </p><p>I have completely deleted all firefox data and settings, and started fresh to confirm it wasn't corrupted settings, and it doesn't appear to be.  I also asked about this in #Firefox on freenode, but after a couple hours of waiting never got an answer: so trying here today. </p><p>I've also searched, and no one else seems to have reported this issue, other than me. Is this a known issue, or am I the first?  Also, is there anything I can do outside waiting for a firefox update / big sure updates?  For now, I have disabled desktop notifications in YouTube settings as that's the only problem site I'm experiencing.  This seems to be a firefox, and Youtube specific issue, as the latest version of Chrome is also set to deliver me notifications, and those work correctly, as well as do all other notifications, both system, and app. </p><p>If there is anything I can do to resolve this, please let me know. </p><p>Thanks </p>",mac-os;desktop;websites;firefox-830;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",the.borking.chef
