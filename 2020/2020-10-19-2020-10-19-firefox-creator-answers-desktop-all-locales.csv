With this layout every button on the keyboard is writing an other letter. So instead of writing an “.” the . actually writes an p. the main advantage with msklc is that every button still sends the same key-code. So ctrl c still copies text even if it now writes an u. so I have an ergonomic layout, but i can still use the same shortcuts. This even works in youtube for example. There the j jumps 10 seconds back. So far so good. But now the weard part: This does not work for “.” and for “,”. They would go one frame back and forth respectively. But I now that it can work. I have also tested it in chromium edge. And there it works just fine. I have added some images from an <a href=""https://w3c.github.io/uievents/tools/key-event-viewer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">event viewer</a> .
