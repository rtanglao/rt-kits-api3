To help understand where I am at in the process and what is going wrong, I have tried to sync devices and add devices by opening Firefox on my Windows desktop and logging into my account. From there I select Account settings-Sync settings-Connect another device.  This opens a new tab (Connect another device that has a dialogue box with a 'Show code' button. Clicking on the button produces another dialogue box with a Q-Code displayed that is supposed to 'scan in the code from within Sync settings'.  From there on I am lost.  I cannot discern any Q-code viewer within the sync settings on my Android device and using my camera results in nothing but an image of the code.  Can someone please help with a clear explanation of what I need to do to synchronise Firefox across my platforms and restore my faith in the browser that has served me well for about the past two decades?
