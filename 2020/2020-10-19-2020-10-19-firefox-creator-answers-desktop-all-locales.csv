Curiously, something similar happens with gmail, as it will make me sign in both of my email accounts, even though normally when I bring up the gmail website it usually just asks which account I wish to sign in to. I have not cleared my cookies in the last few days, nor my cache, so this shouldn't be happening. What exactly is happening here? I didn't have this problem in the previous version of Firefox. Can anyone help? </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",Marc7

I finally (through trial an error) found the problem to my situation. I had downloaded an app called ""Privacy Badger"". It would let me sign in to some of my sites. I simply went to my puzzle piece at the top right of the screen. I started checking my apps, one at a time. Privacy Badger was the culprit. I simply turned it off. Everything is working fine. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,websites,en-US,1359388;,marinearty63

It is as if the last update to both Android and the Windows version of Firefox have destroyed the syncing process that previously existed. Trying to follow the prescribed process for syncing has also proven difficult to the point of frustration. I seek a clear set of the steps involved with explanations of the steps that appear to me to have been omitted by the Firefox cognoscenti so that I can achieve the synchronisation of passwords and bookmarks across platforms. To help understand where I am at in the process and what is going wrong, I have tried to sync devices and add devices by opening Firefox on my Windows desktop and logging into my account. From there I select Account settings-Sync settings-Connect another device.  This opens a new tab (Connect another device that has a dialogue box with a 'Show code' button. Clicking on the button produces another dialogue box with a Q-Code displayed that is supposed to 'scan in the code from within Sync settings'.  From there on I am lost.  I cannot discern any Q-code viewer within the sync settings on my Android device and using my camera results in nothing but an image of the code.  Can someone please help with a clear explanation of what I need to do to synchronise Firefox across my platforms and restore my faith in the browser that has served me well for about the past two decades?  I have neither the time nor inclination to trawl through all the KB articles that appear somewhat related but prove simply to add to my frustration with the product. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-810;firefox-8102;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",jackgeorge15

My firefox account is not syncing between my devices. I am logged in to my firefox account on all of my devices. I only have one account. I can save a password on one, but it does not save on my account and I am not able to retrieve it between devices. What is the point of syncing if I can't access my passwords on other accounts? And yes, I have sync turned on. Also, why does it not auto fill across devices when the password is saved??
