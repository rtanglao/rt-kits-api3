I had written detailed information, then scrolled down to the troubleshooting information section and made the mistake of clicking: try these manual steps. </p><p>That link should have opened in a new tab! I lost everything I wrote here, pressing back didn't preserve the text I had entered here. </p><p>I have 7,500 tabs in an old profile on my laptop. After many crashes and using Refresh, I can't fix it as I did before. </p><p>Please fix this Ask Your Question page so it doesn't lose what I've written here so easily. Show a warning, and open links in new tabs. </p><p>And Firefox should have an option to automatically bookmark open tabs so that if anyone experiences this crash/corruption I've had, all their open tabs are safely backed up in bookmarks and Firefox sync. </p><p>Also the Submit Feedback button in Firefox's help menu is still going to a page showing: Please check back soon. Feels like it's been a month since I was last able to send feedback. Please fix this! </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",Aku-Solus
