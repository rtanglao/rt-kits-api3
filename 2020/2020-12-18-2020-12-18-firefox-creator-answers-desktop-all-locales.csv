When I attempt to log in to a website, I get a small message box telling me I should allow Facebook tracking so Facebook can give me good services etc. I am blocked from logging in. The message box has a cancel button but this closes the box only to have it re-appear if I again attempt to type my details. The colored 'picket' fence appears on the page AND each end of the log in button.This website was not in a container however when I put it in one I still am blocked logging in. I informed the website. This morning the website asked me if I am still blocked indicating it was attempting to find a solution. I am still blocked. How to fix?

He stays with me a lot for weeks or even months at a time. He's not an avid smart phone user. He prefers a desktop PC just as I do. The big problem is we can't switch accounts. All his passwords and web sites are linked to his account, the same as mine is to mine. If I log out of my Firefox and he attempts to log into his, we get a warning that all synced items will be merged. We end up not switching. This is very frustrating for him since he doesn't remember his sign-in's. He relies on his Firefox account for that. Is there any way around this? We can do it with Google and his AOL accounts. Anybody have any ideas? </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,other,en-US,"",pzajac

When I am working on the laptop I never save bookmarks but I message them to myself (never been able to save them on my main machine, sigh) and every once in a while I ""restore"" bookmarks from the backup set of the main machine on the laptop. It always takes a while and oftentimes it feels like the process hangs, but so far I managed. </p><p>Today I started wondering again if there's a less frustrating and more efficient way to handle this. The question I started asking myself was: could I use the same FF profile from the laptop &amp; the main machine? Say by saving it in the cloud? </p><p>Thanks for any hint or suggestion! </p>",linux;desktop;tips;firefox-830;,firefox,tips,en-US,"",giampaolo44
