He stays with me a lot for weeks or even months at a time. He's not an avid smart phone user. He prefers a desktop PC just as I do. The big problem is we can't switch accounts. All his passwords and web sites are linked to his account, the same as mine is to mine. If I log out of my Firefox and he attempts to log into his, we get a warning that all synced items will be merged. We end up not switching. This is very frustrating for him since he doesn't remember his sign-in's. He relies on his Firefox account for that. Is there any way around this? We can do it with Google and his AOL accounts.
