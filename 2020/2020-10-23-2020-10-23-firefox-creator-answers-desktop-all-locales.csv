This only affects the window that played the video, &amp; although the other tabs areyet available through [Ctrl]+&lt;hotkey&gt;, all tabs in the wind lack the window/browser control interface.  Firefox returns to normal after a re-opening of the browser.  This disappearance does not resolve by just pressing the [Alt] key or by moving the mouse cursor to the top of the screen or by pressing [f] or [F11] to toggle full screen/normal.  [F4], [Alt]+D, [Ctrl]+L, &amp; [F6] are of no effect as URL input becomes unavailable (including no known access to ""about:"" features.  [F12] does what it normally does (show webpage source code/elements).  [F7] triggers caret browsing prompt.  I did not bother with [F1], but all unmentioned F-keys were of no effect when pressed without combining with other keys.  Perhaps it's a Win7 64-Bit issue, but I hope that you have a FireFox answer.

Granted, I got to that photo in the first place from Google image search but spawned it into an independent window, which should occupy a separate memory space and not reference a previously cached file. While i get the primary application is to allow for multiple res versions while referencing only one file, this behaviour is pointless, irksome and serves no practical purpose when accessing the asset with an explicit URL, plus it puts unnecessary and Big Brother-ish barriers up for the less savvy.  I solved the issue ultimately, but who is at fault here?

Webroot Internet Security Plus v9.0.29.52 is being used at home and a corporate version of Webroot is being used at work.

Instagram, et al. seemed to access fine.  I performed a complete Webroot scan of my computer and one ""threat"" was discovered, but no information about this ""threat"" could be found.  I then just went back to Webroot to get the version number for this complaint and it doesn't even recognize the fact that I performed a manual scan an hour ago. It thinks the last scan was 22 hours ago and it only took one second when in fact the LAST scan took over six minutes! </p><p>In order to author this complaint, I had to restart Firefox.  Currently Amazon is the only website that has retained login information.  All others - Google, Instagram, Facebook, Tumblr AGAIN require logins!
