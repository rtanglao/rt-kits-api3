I have a local html page with link formatted link that :   <a rel=""nofollow"">ssh://server.domain.com</a> If I type in a terminal : xdg-open <a rel=""nofollow"">ssh:/server.domain.com</a>  No problem it works as intended, however in Firefox it doesnt if I use xdg-opn to open a link starting with ssh. I suspect it comes from the fact that meanwhile my links are written like that :  &lt;area shape=""rect"" coords=""1428,438,1463,495"" href=""<a rel=""nofollow"">ssh://server.domain.com</a>"" alt="""" onmouseover=""showTooltip('n14')"" onmouseout=""hideTooltip()""&gt; when putting my mouse over the link it appears in the bottom left corner as:  <a rel=""nofollow"">ssh://server.domain.com</a><strong>/</strong> That trailing slash is most likely the problem ssh:// mime shouldn't consider / to be anything more that a caracter and I don't blame xdg-open here, but why would firefox add a trailing slash to a link while it's not written in the html file in the first place ?

Webroot Internet Security Plus v9.0.29.52 is being used at home and a corporate version of Webroot is being used at work.  Tonight I started the home computer up and found that Amazon required login credentials.  I COPIED the login information from the Firefox ""Saved Logins..."" screen to log into Amazon.  Instagram, et al. seemed to access fine.  I performed a complete Webroot scan of my computer and one ""threat"" was discovered, but no information about this ""threat"" could be found.  I then just went back to Webroot to get the version number for this complaint and it doesn't even recognize the fact that I performed a manual scan an hour ago. It thinks the last scan was 22 hours ago and it only took one second when in fact the LAST scan took over six minutes! </p><p>In order to author this complaint, I had to restart Firefox.  Currently Amazon is the only website that has retained login information.  All others - Google, Instagram, Facebook, Tumblr AGAIN require logins!  AGAIN, I can go to the saved logins within Firefox, COPY the credential information and PASTE it into the appropriate fields in the appropriate website and I'm logged back in...for now. </p><p>PLEASE explain to me how this information is continually being wiped clean and if Webroot isn't doing it, then what is, since Webroot is telling me my system is clean. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-820;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1360446;,gumby_dammit223

However, I have many Firefox (and other browser) exported files I need to consolidate. The Firefox bookmark manager is so good I can drag and drop bookmarks from these other files into Firefox. </p><p>I want to consolidate these bookmarks using the Firefox bookmark engine, but not by interfering with the bookmarks currently in Firefox. Also, since this will take a while, I don’t want to export my current Firefox bookmarks; clean out my current bookmarks; and spend the next two weeks using other browsers while I employ Firefox to clean up my bookmark situation. </p><p>Three Questions 1)	Can I bring up another/unique Firefox window (like an earlier version; a separate window; a second install that I can open/close separate from the install I’m using now) that I can scrub clean of all bookmarks use it to rebuild all my bookmarks by dragging/dropping bookmarks from my many saved .html bookmark files--WITHOUT MESSING WITH MY CURRENT BOOKMARKS? 2)	Alternatively, is it possible to just install the Firefox bookmark engine, separate from the Firefox browser? 3)	Also, is there a simple way to instruct Firefox’s bookmark manager to delete duplicate bookmarks? </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",jar22jar
