It works fine for a couple of hours, but then, all of a sudden, I get blank windows and tabs with a spinning circle animation in the middle of them. After this happens, Firefox becomes completely unresponsive and I can't do absolutely anything else with it until I restart the macbook. Can't reopen it normally, can't try to open the profile manager from terminal because it freezes, can't relaunch in safe mode because it just won't open. Every other piece of software works fine (including other browsers), it only happens with firefox. I have tried everything I can before posting this (this is actually my first time posting in a support forum for any kind of software ever), including:  Doing a clean new install, wiping every file from the previous installation, deleting all plugins and extensions, only using safe mode, deleting old profiles and creating a new one, making sure that I have the correct write/read permissions for the Profiles folder, scanned my whole hdd for malware, cleaning the caché/previous registries, deleting the .parentlock files in the profiles, disabling hardware acceleration, killing manually every process related to firefox from terminal before trying to reopen it, etc. </p><p>I just want to know if there's something else I can do or if the problem is a hardware issue or something. I'm just really tired of this. I've been using Firefox for at least 10+ years, it is without a doubt my favorite browser and I hate to use anything else, but right now I don't see any other options left. Worst thing is I can't even get a crash report because it just completely freezes until a turn off and restart the mac. The closest thing I have to it is a ###!!!

But as visible from thousands of articles to this very particular problem (when i search the community help database for ""Youtube videos stutter"" i get multiple thousands of entries - i read only a handful of them to realize that they are all ""closed"" and not a single one ""solved""), this problem persists since multiple years now. </p><p>I have a very old PC by my side with a very old Firefox (benchmark wise slower than my current PC by a factor of at least 3) ESR 52.9, which is able to play the same videos in the same HD resolution without the slightest stutter. </p><p>The drivers on that old system are - naturally - outdated by half a decade. THAT OLD OUTDATED system with THAT OLD OUTDATED Firefox is well able to play even multiple HD videos side by side. With-OUT any stutter. </p><p>Thus, you can easily deduce by logical reasoning that nighter any outdating of drivers whatsoever nor any outdating of anything else on the system, be it hardware wise or software wise, CAN AT ALL be the culprit of that stuttering. </p><p>While the former holds true, what you actually find in the communities help are completely useless and irrational tips of ""upgrading the browser to the last version"", ""upgrading drivers"" or ""reinstalling any software"" or the like. </p><p>Let me be clear: Nothing of the latter will ever help in overcoming the stuttering of current firefoxes at all. The only one measure that will help here is to revise the code that is underlying the video pipe. </p><p>Since the stuttering regularly only begins after about one to two minutes into the videos, it is strongly suggestive that something in the memory management - probably in the way resources becoming freed after use - is accumulating over time until the stuttering begins. Badly managed garbage collection, perhaps? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1360697;,White-Gandalf
