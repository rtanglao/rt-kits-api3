But as visible from thousands of articles to this very particular problem (when i search the community help database for ""Youtube videos stutter"" i get multiple thousands of entries - i read only a handful of them to realize that they are all ""closed"" and not a single one ""solved""), this problem persists since multiple years now. </p><p>I have a very old PC by my side with a very old Firefox (benchmark wise slower than my current PC by a factor of at least 3) ESR 52.9, which is able to play the same videos in the same HD resolution without the slightest stutter. </p><p>The drivers on that old system are - naturally - outdated by half a decade. THAT OLD OUTDATED system with THAT OLD OUTDATED Firefox is well able to play even multiple HD videos side by side. With-OUT any stutter. </p><p>Thus, you can easily deduce by logical reasoning that nighter any outdating of drivers whatsoever nor any outdating of anything else on the system, be it hardware wise or software wise, CAN AT ALL be the culprit of that stuttering. </p><p>While the former holds true, what you actually find in the communities help are completely useless and irrational tips of ""upgrading the browser to the last version"", ""upgrading drivers"" or ""reinstalling any software"" or the like. </p><p>Let me be clear: Nothing of the latter will ever help in overcoming the stuttering of current firefoxes at all. The only one measure that will help here is to revise the code that is underlying the video pipe. </p><p>Since the stuttering regularly only begins after about one to two minutes into the videos, it is strongly suggestive that something in the memory management - probably in the way resources becoming freed after use - is accumulating over time until the stuttering begins. Badly managed garbage collection, perhaps? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",White-Gandalf

I suspect it comes from the fact that meanwhile my links are written like that :  &lt;area shape=""rect"" coords=""1428,438,1463,495"" href=""<a rel=""nofollow"">ssh://server.domain.com</a>"" alt="""" onmouseover=""showTooltip('n14')"" onmouseout=""hideTooltip()""&gt; when putting my mouse over the link it appears in the bottom left corner as:  <a rel=""nofollow"">ssh://server.domain.com</a><strong>/</strong> That trailing slash is most likely the problem ssh:// mime shouldn't consider / to be anything more that a caracter and I don't blame xdg-open here, but why would firefox add a trailing slash to a link while it's not written in the html file in the first place ?

At home and work I regularly go to Amazon and Google.  At home I go to Instagram, Facebook, Tumblr, and others.  I use Firefox at home and work.  Webroot Internet Security Plus v9.0.29.52 is being used at home and a corporate version of Webroot is being used at work.  Tonight I started the home computer up and found that Amazon required login credentials.  I COPIED the login information from the Firefox ""Saved Logins..."" screen to log into Amazon.  Instagram, et al. seemed to access fine.  I performed a complete Webroot scan of my computer and one ""threat"" was discovered, but no information about this ""threat"" could be found.  I then just went back to Webroot to get the version number for this complaint and it doesn't even recognize the fact that I performed a manual scan an hour ago. It thinks the last scan was 22 hours ago and it only took one second when in fact the LAST scan took over six minutes! </p><p>In order to author this complaint, I had to restart Firefox.  Currently Amazon is the only website that has retained login information.  All others - Google, Instagram, Facebook, Tumblr AGAIN require logins!  AGAIN, I can go to the saved logins within Firefox, COPY the credential information and PASTE it into the appropriate fields in the appropriate website and I'm logged back in...for now. </p><p>PLEASE explain to me how this information is continually being wiped clean and if Webroot isn't doing it, then what is, since Webroot is telling me my system is clean. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-820;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1360446;,gumby_dammit223

However, I have many Firefox (and other browser) exported files I need to consolidate. The Firefox bookmark manager is so good I can drag and drop bookmarks from these other files into Firefox. </p><p>I want to consolidate these bookmarks using the Firefox bookmark engine, but not by interfering with the bookmarks currently in Firefox. Also, since this will take a while, I don’t want to export my current Firefox bookmarks; clean out my current bookmarks; and spend the next two weeks using other browsers while I employ Firefox to clean up my bookmark situation. </p><p>Three Questions 1)	Can I bring up another/unique Firefox window (like an earlier version; a separate window; a second install that I can open/close separate from the install I’m using now) that I can scrub clean of all bookmarks use it to rebuild all my bookmarks by dragging/dropping bookmarks from my many saved .html bookmark files--WITHOUT MESSING WITH MY CURRENT BOOKMARKS? 2)	Alternatively, is it possible to just install the Firefox bookmark engine, separate from the Firefox browser? 3)	Also, is there a simple way to instruct Firefox’s bookmark manager to delete duplicate bookmarks? </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",jar22jar
