Granted, I got to that photo in the first place from Google image search but spawned it into an independent window, which should occupy a separate memory space and not reference a previously cached file. While i get the primary application is to allow for multiple res versions while referencing only one file, this behaviour is pointless, irksome and serves no practical purpose when accessing the asset with an explicit URL, plus it puts unnecessary and Big Brother-ish barriers up for the less savvy.  I solved the issue ultimately, but who is at fault here? Is this a function of Firefox or of the CDN where it's hosted? </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,customize,en-US,1360437;,bartmowrey

At home and work I regularly go to Amazon and Google.  At home I go to Instagram, Facebook, Tumblr, and others.  I use Firefox at home and work.  Webroot Internet Security Plus v9.0.29.52 is being used at home and a corporate version of Webroot is being used at work.  Tonight I started the home computer up and found that Amazon required login credentials.  I COPIED the login information from the Firefox ""Saved Logins..."" screen to log into Amazon.  Instagram, et al. seemed to access fine.  I performed a complete Webroot scan of my computer and one ""threat"" was discovered, but no information about this ""threat"" could be found.  I then just went back to Webroot to get the version number for this complaint and it doesn't even recognize the fact that I performed a manual scan an hour ago. It thinks the last scan was 22 hours ago and it only took one second when in fact the LAST scan took over six minutes! </p><p>In order to author this complaint, I had to restart Firefox.  Currently Amazon is the only website that has retained login information.  All others - Google, Instagram, Facebook, Tumblr AGAIN require logins!  AGAIN, I can go to the saved logins within Firefox, COPY the credential information and PASTE it into the appropriate fields in the appropriate website and I'm logged back in...for now. </p><p>PLEASE explain to me how this information is continually being wiped clean and if Webroot isn't doing it, then what is, since Webroot is telling me my system is clean. </p><p>Thank you. </p>",windows-7;desktop;privacy-and-security_1;firefox-820;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,1360446;,gumby_dammit223

However, I have many Firefox (and other browser) exported files I need to consolidate. The Firefox bookmark manager is so good I can drag and drop bookmarks from these other files into Firefox. </p><p>I want to consolidate these bookmarks using the Firefox bookmark engine, but not by interfering with the bookmarks currently in Firefox. Also, since this will take a while, I don’t want to export my current Firefox bookmarks; clean out my current bookmarks; and spend the next two weeks using other browsers while I employ Firefox to clean up my bookmark situation. </p><p>Three Questions 1)	Can I bring up another/unique Firefox window (like an earlier version; a separate window; a second install that I can open/close separate from the install I’m using now) that I can scrub clean of all bookmarks use it to rebuild all my bookmarks by dragging/dropping bookmarks from my many saved .html bookmark files--WITHOUT MESSING WITH MY CURRENT BOOKMARKS? 2)	Alternatively, is it possible to just install the Firefox bookmark engine, separate from the Firefox browser? 3)	Also, is there a simple way to instruct Firefox’s bookmark manager to delete duplicate bookmarks? </p><p>Thanks </p>",desktop;bookmarks;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,"",jar22jar
