When I click the play button and the loading icon on the youtube video just spins indefinitely. The videos play fine in other browsers.

The scroll wheel functions as intended when using other applications or when firefox is an inactive window (i.e. I can scroll as intended when I have the active cursor within Visual Studio). In the instances that I have noticed the exact moment that the issue begins I would note that Twitter was the active tab. The issue will then persist until the browser is either reset or reinstalled. Rebooting the operating systems does not help.  </p><p>This issue affects exclusively my work laptop, I've never encountered this issue before on my personal desktop where I use a near identical configuration (OS, firefox version, extensions &amp; mouse). This difference leads me to believe that the issue may reside in some piece of software that either Dell or my employer has installed on this machine but I don't have any suspicions as to the culprit.  </p><p>I've explored solutions from my searches on both google and the mozilla support pages to no avail. From these searches I have tried solutions including; altering firefox hardware acceleration settings and altering the Windows mouse scroll wheel settings (which did seem to help in one instance of this issue but forced me to use a massive number of lines per scroll stop).  </p><p>As mentioned above I have been able to resolved this issue before using firefox's reset function in the past but this time the issue has carried across the reset and even in to another install of firefox (v83.0b9 on the developer edition channel).  </p><p>Any help or suggestions that can be offered would be greatly appreciated. The provided troubleshooting data may not come in handy as this query is being written directly after a reset. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-820;firefox-8202;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",stuye98
