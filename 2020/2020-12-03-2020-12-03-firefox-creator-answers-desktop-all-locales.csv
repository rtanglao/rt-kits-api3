I use some add-ons (Screenshot below) but I'm pretty sure they don't interfere with it. I might have switched a parameter of Mozilla or I am blind and I cannot see where I should click to post a new comment on Youtube. I've put another screenshot of the comment section in which you can clearly see there is no option visible to post a new comment under a video.. </p><p>Any idea or recommendation ? </p><p>Have a nice day tho. </p>,desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,websites,en-US,1372817;1372821;,cocodebruyn

I only use Firefox (83.0 64bit) for internet access. CCleaner (free version, 5.74.8198 64 bit) tells me that I have accumulated 5000 some trackers since my last cleaning 3 days ago. Is CCleaner wrong? Is Dell or Windows 10 adding trackers when I am not using my browser?  I have not cleaned out the Dell bloatware because I have not had time to see whether some are useful.  </p><p>I did not have this issue on my old Lenovo laptop.  I would get trackers but not 5000 in 3 days. </p><p>Suggestions would be appreciated. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",McDaniel97
