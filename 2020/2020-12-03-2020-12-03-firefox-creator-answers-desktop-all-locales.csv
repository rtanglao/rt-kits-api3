Or if there was a feature in Customize Firefox that let you add your own button that directed you to a web page that would be cool too! </p>,desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",thatguy2399

I can still see mail including new mail if I log into Gmail website. When I click ""Get messages"" Thunderbird says ""Connected to <a href=""http://imap.gmail.com"" rel=""nofollow"">imap.gmail.com</a>"" but doesn't go on to my Inbox. I can still send messages. I have tried removing Thunderbird and reinstalling it. I had do that manually the automatic install would not recognise my password.  I have tried removing saved passwords and reentered myGmail password. I tried changing my login settings to no password and my Connection security to None. I have tried the suggestions on the Thunderbird website, including disabling my internet security (Eset).

Although clicking on PDFs on most sites ""saves"" the PDFs according to the application PDF settings,  this one particular site opens the PDF file in your built-in viewer instead of saving the file. </p><p>I have both of the PDF Application settings set to ""Save File"" and set ""pdfjs.disabled"" = true.  There are no issues with changing any settings and, other than this one site, Firefox is working just fine. </p><p>I know that there is a ""Save"" button on the viewer, but this just adds two extra steps for these PDF files that I want to save.   </p><p>I inspected the element and it appears to be &lt;a _ngcontent-hmk-c29="""" class=""edoc-linkIcon""&gt;Statements&lt;/a&gt; </p><p>Any suggestions on how to fix this? </p>",desktop;other;windows-81;firefox-830;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jim-bo

Yet every time I restart, I am unable to restore the tabs/windows that were previously open and I have to resort to searching through my history. Is this a bug with Firefox?  </p><p>All the other ""solutions"" I've seen don't restore what has already been closed, but they are more preventative measures for the future. It should work the same way Chrome does. I haven't changed any default settings either and I wasn't browsing in private. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,other,en-US,"",dreamdark31

I use some add-ons (Screenshot below) but I'm pretty sure they don't interfere with it.

I only use Firefox (83.0 64bit) for internet access. CCleaner (free version, 5.74.8198 64 bit) tells me that I have accumulated 5000 some trackers since my last cleaning 3 days ago. Is CCleaner wrong? Is Dell or Windows 10 adding trackers when I am not using my browser?  I have not cleaned out the Dell bloatware because I have not had time to see whether some are useful.  </p><p>I did not have this issue on my old Lenovo laptop.  I would get trackers but not 5000 in 3 days. </p><p>Suggestions would be appreciated. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",McDaniel97
