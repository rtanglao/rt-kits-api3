Although clicking on PDFs on most sites ""saves"" the PDFs according to the application PDF settings,  this one particular site opens the PDF file in your built-in viewer instead of saving the file. </p><p>I have both of the PDF Application settings set to ""Save File"" and set ""pdfjs.disabled"" = true.  There are no issues with changing any settings and, other than this one site, Firefox is working just fine. </p><p>I know that there is a ""Save"" button on the viewer, but this just adds two extra steps for these PDF files that I want to save.   </p><p>I inspected the element and it appears to be &lt;a _ngcontent-hmk-c29="""" class=""edoc-linkIcon""&gt;Statements&lt;/a&gt; </p><p>Any suggestions on how to fix this? </p>",desktop;other;windows-81;firefox-830;,firefox,other,en-US,"",jim-bo

Yet every time I restart, I am unable to restore the tabs/windows that were previously open and I have to resort to searching through my history. Is this a bug with Firefox?  </p><p>All the other ""solutions"" I've seen don't restore what has already been closed, but they are more preventative measures for the future. It should work the same way Chrome does. I haven't changed any default settings either and I wasn't browsing in private. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,other,en-US,"",dreamdark31

I use some add-ons (Screenshot below) but I'm pretty sure they don't interfere with it. I might have switched a parameter of Mozilla or I am blind and I cannot see where I should click to post a new comment on Youtube. I've put another screenshot of the comment section in which you can clearly see there is no option visible to post a new comment under a video.. </p><p>Any idea or recommendationÂ ? </p><p>Have a nice day tho. </p>,desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",cocodebruyn

I only use Firefox (83.0 64bit) for internet access. CCleaner (free version, 5.74.8198 64 bit) tells me that I have accumulated 5000 some trackers since my last cleaning 3 days ago. Is CCleaner wrong? Is Dell or Windows 10 adding trackers when I am not using my browser?  I have not cleaned out the Dell bloatware because I have not had time to see whether some are useful.  </p><p>I did not have this issue on my old Lenovo laptop.  I would get trackers but not 5000 in 3 days. </p><p>Suggestions would be appreciated. </p><p>Thanks! </p>",desktop;privacy-and-security_1;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,privacy-and-security,en-US,"",McDaniel97
