I would like to block all cookies for all websites (at once, not one-by-one by website) and allow cookies only for websites identified as exceptions. I know how to enter the exception one-by-one, but could not figure out the rest. Is there a way to do this?  </p><p>2. I entered 3 websites (one-by-one) to block them from storing cookies (in Manage exceptions). They show up on the list (under Manage Exceptions), but under Manage Data, these websites still stored cookies. Then I went to one of these websites and selected View Page Info&gt;Permissions and selected blocking cookies. The website still stored cookies. How can one prevent websites that appear to be selected to block, to actually block storage of cookies? Either I am doing something incorrectly or this doesn't work. </p><p>Thanks in advance for your help. </p>",desktop;cookies;,firefox,cookies,en-US,1370869;1370874;,Zsuzsu
