Just now I was in a site to purchase an item and clicked to go through PayPal. I could enter all my log in details for PayPal but it would not open the PayPal site. This has happened every time I've tried to use PayPal lately. I then have to go and use Edge and do my purchase through there, no problem at all. </p><p>Often when I've tried to open a log in window that opens in a separate pop up style window, that window will only open as a tiny window in the top left corner. I have to drag the bottom and sides to get it big enough to fill out. Then when you enter that info ready for the next section, it reverts right back to the tiny window once more.  I've done all sorts of things in my settings and mostly no change. I did however get the bank log in window to stop doing it and work properly. </p><p>Another issue is the correct time for me here in Aust is no longer being recognised in some cases. One is the Track My Hours App. I enter 'Start now' and it says 6:55 AM when it's actually 4:55 PM on my computer  clock! It is not the App as I now use it in Edge as well and it is fine there. I never used to have this problem with the much earlier versions of Firefox, it only started a month or so ago when I got a new computer with the latest version installed, at that stage I think it was 72 and I had other problems as well that finally got sorted. </p><p>I really want to continue using Firefox but can't do so with several sites and then waste a lot of time swapping over to another browser.  I have version 83 now. </p><p>Can anyone please help!!! Thanks. </p>",desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-780;,firefox,websites,en-US,1370916;,cheryl.h
