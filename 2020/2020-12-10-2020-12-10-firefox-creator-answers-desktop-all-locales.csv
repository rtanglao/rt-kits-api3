I'm asking about it here because eBay support these days is more or less non-existent and this happens in Firefox and Edge...but not in Brave browser. This was happening on eBay about a year ago and when I enabled the 'Do not prompt for authentication if password is saved' option in FF Options-Network Settings it fixed it, but that's not working now. There was some other FF setting as well, and I was never sure which one actually stopped this behaviour....but I can't see anything else that might be relevant. Does anyone have any idea how to stop this happening?  </p><p>ps: this is not happening on my laptop, which was also updated to Windows 20H2 the same day and has exactly the same FF version and settings [I think].  pps: there are hundreds of other eBay users with the same problem. </p><p>Pic 1 is FF, 2 is Edge </p><p>Thanks, Haruna </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,other,en-US,"",Haruna
