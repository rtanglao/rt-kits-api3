Currently ctrl+R, F5, and right clicking don't give me that option. It's really the only major thing that I feel is missing from this mode (and a feature that Edge and Chromium in general has), sometimes sites just don't work right and you need to refresh them but that can't be done without relaunching the app. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,other,en-US,"",planedrop
