Even once they're completely uninstalled and re-installed, they no longer seem to go into the menu bar as per usual, as if they've been earmarked as not belonging there regardless of a whole new re-install. </p><p>In brief: Is there any way to get the icon/shortcut for installed extensions back into the menu bar once they've been removed from there? </p><p>Thanks for your time. </p>",desktop;customize;windows-81;firefox-840;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",reay.jespersen

Is it even possible? </p><p>I've spent quite a bit of time trying to re-create a userChrome.css file to simulate the App mode, however minimal success only. The best I could gets getting the site I want to launch with no tabs/address bar/title bar which is not desirable as it is missing the Title Bar of the website name, which also is useful for moving the window/app around my desktop. For trying to launch that, I am running it from command line using triggers for an alternate profile withe the customer userChrome.css </p><p>user@pop: firefox -P app -new-instance <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com</a> </p><p>Is there any way built in to create a desktop link to open a site I added as an app? If not is there any other method that I can use to launch the site, either in my default profile, or a specific profile with a custom userChrome.css file that would have a Titlebar window same as when I manually launch the site in app mode? </p><p>What I want to have, is a shortcut on my desktop to launch the window on the right of the attached screenshot without manually having to open Firefox -&gt; Hamburger Menu -&gt; Sites in App Mode -&gt; &lt;selecting site&gt; </p><p>I'm using Ubuntu/PopOS 20 with latest version of Firefox Any help would be great.

The first computer update Firefox to V 84 and I did not make the connection but after it updating it would not play Hulu video. I made the connection when the second computer update because I had to restart Firefox to finish the update. Then when to play a Hulu show and it would not work. It gives a Hulu Error code: P-DEV327 but itâ€™s really funny because it was playing Hulu videos 10 minutes before that? I have google a number of times when trying to fix the first computer but no luck. Any thoughts  Thanks </p>,desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",thauff

When I right clicked on the icon in the taskbar Firefox would flash the start page for about 2 seconds then go back to the screen saver.  I found that if I right clicked and then selected open new tab the program would open and I could select bookmarks and go to that selection, then I had to right click on the HOME icon to get to the home page.  I have a work around, but it's not working like it used to.  I have uninstalled firefox and reinstalled it with the same results.  Any ideas?
