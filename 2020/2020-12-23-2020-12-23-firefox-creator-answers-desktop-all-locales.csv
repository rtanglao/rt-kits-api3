It doesn't matter if I'm browsing, looking at images or watching a video... they all freeze. Videos will continue playing however with no skip/pause in sound. </p><p>It doesn't matter if I'm opening new tabs, scrolling facebook, or just typing here.. it doesn't seem to care what I'm doing when it happens. As I've typed this I've had it happen twice now with no occurrence in another program. </p><p>I thought this was my hard drive failing at first, so I migrated everything to a different hard drive as well as the cache folder... and it still does it. </p><p>I thought it was a particular addon ""Honey"" as it is KNOWN for significant slow downs as it checks for prices/coupons and after disabling it nothing changed. </p><p>I next assumed it had something to do with the session storing(looking at disk activity), so I changed the interval from 15 seconds to 25 minutes and that did nothing. </p><p>I tried doing a ""refresh"" as well as starting without addons and neither of those had any affect, implying the base program without addons is the issue. </p><p>There is no significant CPU spike when this occurs. Really activity is 20% or less average. There is a significant disk spike when this occurs. RAM usage is average with no change. If this were a RAM issue I'd be seeing instability at random, and not a single program. </p><p>I'm not encountering this issue with other programs - only firefox. </p><p>As it happens randomly I can't ""reproduce"" it reliably, but it is continuous and will occur whether I do anything or not. To be said it is not doing this on my desktop... so I guess it could be some conflict with winblows but I haven't a clue what that might be.... if it is please let me know so I can kill it with extreme prejudice. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",jax.endsleigh

Jetzt hängt er macht nicht mal das was er soll und er ist mir zu Aufgeblasen geworden, mit den ganzen Dingen die dazugekommen sind. Leider wie oben schon Mitgeteilt hängt sich zu viel Morzilla als Firma mit rein. Wenn es nicht bald wieder eine änderung gibt, so werde ich den Browser tauschen müssen obwohl es mir sehr schwer fällt. Doch Mitlerweile läuft mein Browser Firefox unter meinem Debian immer schelchter als im gegensatz zu früher. Nicht nur das er so Aufgeblasen worden ist, nein er hat für meine Begriffe zu viele andere Hände im Spiel eben wie der Mutterkonzern Morzilla. Bitte das zu ändern, denn sonst verliert ihr in Deutschland sehr viele anhänger und das wäre doch echt schade.  Daher kommt auf meinen alten Firefox zurück. Sonst muss ich Vivaldi und Brave eine Möglichkeit geben. Da mein Firefox nicht mehr der zuverlässige Browser ist wie bisher. Also trennen wieder von Morzilla bitte. </p>",linux;desktop;other;firefox-780;,firefox,other,en-US,"",carrabelloy1

The first computer update Firefox to V 84 and I did not make the connection but after it updating it would not play Hulu video. I made the connection when the second computer update because I had to restart Firefox to finish the update. Then when to play a Hulu show and it would not work. It gives a Hulu Error code: P-DEV327 but it’s really funny because it was playing Hulu videos 10 minutes before that? I have google a number of times when trying to fix the first computer but no luck. Any thoughts  Thanks </p>,desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",thauff
