The first computer update Firefox to V 84 and I did not make the connection but after it updating it would not play Hulu video. I made the connection when the second computer update because I had to restart Firefox to finish the update. Then when to play a Hulu show and it would not work. It gives a Hulu Error code: P-DEV327 but itâ€™s really funny because it was playing Hulu videos 10 minutes before that? I have google a number of times when trying to fix the first computer but no luck. Any thoughts  Thanks </p>,desktop;websites;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,websites,en-US,"",thauff

GOOD but worrying, the warning came just after I failed to get into my bank account for the first time in four years. Which social media site was this?

When I right clicked on the icon in the taskbar Firefox would flash the start page for about 2 seconds then go back to the screen saver.  I found that if I right clicked and then selected open new tab the program would open and I could select bookmarks and go to that selection, then I had to right click on the HOME icon to get to the home page.  I have a work around, but it's not working like it used to.  I have uninstalled firefox and reinstalled it with the same results.  Any ideas?  Thank you in advance. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-840;,firefox,other,en-US,"",daotm98
