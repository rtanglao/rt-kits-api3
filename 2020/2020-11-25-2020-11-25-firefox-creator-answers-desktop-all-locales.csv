I was able to get a screen shot of it before it completely crashed.  See pic.  The image should be an orange box with a black border but it's all broken into pieces.  The games work fine on Chrome and Internet Explorer.  A couple days ago I did a Windows refresh and just installed Firefox fresh but it still happens.  Anyone have any ideas what would cause this?
