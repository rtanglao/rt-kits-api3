I'd like to know how to diagnose it, know what it's doing, what it's hung up on and if it's related to an addon, tell the creator about it. </p><p>I apologise if this is not the correct way to go about this, I have just run out of patience trying to fix this myself. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1370404;,AppHang

Usually I can shut it down but tonight it crashed my whole system, my monitor went black, but the sound was still working.  I had to manually shut down.  I was able to get a screen shot of it before it completely crashed.  See pic.  The image should be an orange box with a black border but it's all broken into pieces.  The games work fine on Chrome and Internet Explorer.  A couple days ago I did a Windows refresh and just installed Firefox fresh but it still happens.  Anyone have any ideas what would cause this?  Thank you. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",twosides

Anyway.) </p><p>My Top sites are not showing icons in some random cases (screenshot 1), and I can't understand what cases. </p><p>By default, the icons will show the first letter of the website name, i.e. ""G"" for Google Sheets, Google Forums, Google Drive etc. This is nearly useless, so I'm trying to add icons by linking the tiles to image files online (screenshot 2 shows WIX). However, some of them will show, some others won't. </p><p>I assume it has to do with the source of the image, whether it's official or not, but this still makes little sense. And if I add the website URL there instead of an image, it'll show me the full page in the icon, which wouldn't make sense to me. </p><p>How could I solve this? </p><p>Thank you </p>",mac-os;desktop;other;firefox-830;,firefox,other,en-US,"",muvuth
