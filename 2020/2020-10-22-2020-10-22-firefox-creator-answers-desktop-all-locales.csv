On one page of the site an iframe is rendered. The src element of the iframe is a local url. The src url will render an html page which is simply an html form that posts to a remote url. The remote site will do some internal posts and then finally sends a get request back to my app. The final step is to render a local page from my app. All that should happen within the iframe. </p><p>With Firefox the final page is not rendered. I can debug the site and I see the final get request is processed on the server but Firefox doesn't display the page. I've tried returning a redirect to the final page instead of returning the html and then I can see in the dev tools a get request to that (local) url however I just get a blank page in the iframe. </p><p>All this is using https urls.

Years worth of bookmarks are gone. </p><p>Used help topics to try the Import/Export-Restore Bookmark option.  However the only json Mozilla extension I could find was related to my last attempt. </p><p>Running Wins 10-Mozilla/Firefox updated to 82.0 this morning.  After the update my screen began to flicker and pull up sections of page in dark black.  After verify the issue was with Moz I tried to revert back to older version.  I was frustrated bc of the screen issues and as stated-did NOT do anything strongly suggested b4 going to previous version. </p><p>Although I chose previous version (64 bit) I actually ended up with a newly installed 82.0  However all bookmarks still gone &amp; just icing on cake the flicker is still there. </p><p>Any help would mean to world. Thnx </p>",desktop;bookmarks;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,bookmarks,en-US,1360150;1360159;1360163;1360167;1360168;1360170;,Michelese
