After the update my screen began to flicker and pull up sections of page in dark black.  After verify the issue was with Moz I tried to revert back to older version.  I was frustrated bc of the screen issues and as stated-did NOT do anything strongly suggested b4 going to previous version. </p><p>Although I chose previous version (64 bit) I actually ended up with a newly installed 82.0  However all bookmarks still gone &amp; just icing on cake the flicker is still there. </p><p>Any help would mean to world.
