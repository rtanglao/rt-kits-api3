Prior to doing so, I got my Firefox Account set up and synced on my old computer so that I could have all my passwords and bookmarks available to me on my new one.  I actually began by having trouble logging into the new computer. I was definitely inputting the password correctly, because I just made the account, and ended up having to reset it after waiting much longer than the supposed 15 minutes I was locked out for. Now, the only passwords saved are what I've managed to log into while I was waiting to be allowed to try to log in.  </p><p>How do I sync up the saved passwords from the old computer on to the new one? I read all available articles on the topic and none seem to have a solution that works. I really don't want to have to reset all my passwords, I just did that when I was updating the password manager on my Firefox account on my old desktop. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,sync,en-US,"",maggie.m1994
