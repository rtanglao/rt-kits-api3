I wanted to see what that was, and saw it's mainly firefox cache. From there i searched and found a few sites suggesting and showing the settings to change to switch from disk cache to RAM cache. I did so since i've enough free RAM from a little while now. Changed settings (in <strong>about:config</strong>): </p> <ul><li> <strong>browser.cache.disk.enable</strong> from <strong>true</strong> to <strong>false</strong> </li><li> <strong>browser.cache.disk_cache_ssl</strong> from <strong>true</strong> to <strong>false</strong> </li></ul> <p><strong>browser.cache.memory.enable</strong> was already on <strong>true</strong> and <strong>browser.cache.memory.capacity</strong> on <strong>-1</strong> (not sure it's the best setting, only displaying 32768 KiB in about:cache... Any insight appreciated). </p><p>The concern: Cf. title, about:cache is still displaying the cache is also on disk, while i don't see writings being done related to the cache on the SSD. Is it just a display error in this configuration, or is there something else? If it's an error, i guess i should report it if it's not already done on the appropriate platform after. </p><p><em>Also, i hope the 4.5 Mo/s was just a peak, because if it's constantly like that if you've Twitch opened for instance, that's a major issue. On a SSD like the Samsung 850 EVO 250GB with its small TBW of 75, that's slightly less than 193 full days.</em> </p>",desktop;customize;needsinfo;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,customize,en-US,1367306;1367316;,Harest
