I wanted to see what that was, and saw it's mainly firefox cache. From there i searched and found a few sites suggesting and showing the settings to change to switch from disk cache to RAM cache. I did so since i've enough free RAM from a little while now. Changed settings (in <strong>about:config</strong>): </p> <ul><li> <strong>browser.cache.disk.enable</strong> from <strong>true</strong> to <strong>false</strong> </li><li> <strong>browser.cache.disk_cache_ssl</strong> from <strong>true</strong> to <strong>false</strong> </li></ul> <p><strong>browser.cache.memory.enable</strong> was already on <strong>true</strong> and <strong>browser.cache.memory.capacity</strong> on <strong>-1</strong> (not sure it's the best setting, only displaying 32768 KiB in about:cache... Any insight appreciated). </p><p>The concern: Cf. title, about:cache is still displaying the cache is also on disk, while i don't see writings being done related to the cache on the SSD. Is it just a display error in this configuration, or is there something else? If it's an error, i guess i should report it if it's not already done on the appropriate platform after. </p><p><em>Also, i hope the 4.5 Mo/s was just a peak, because if it's constantly like that if you've Twitch opened for instance, that's a major issue. On a SSD like the Samsung 850 EVO 250GB with its small TBW of 75, that's slightly less than 193 full days.</em> </p>",desktop;customize;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,customize,en-US,"",Harest

Prior to doing so, I got my Firefox Account set up and synced on my old computer so that I could have all my passwords and bookmarks available to me on my new one.  I actually began by having trouble logging into the new computer. I was definitely inputting the password correctly, because I just made the account, and ended up having to reset it after waiting much longer than the supposed 15 minutes I was locked out for. Now, the only passwords saved are what I've managed to log into while I was waiting to be allowed to try to log in.  </p><p>How do I sync up the saved passwords from the old computer on to the new one? I read all available articles on the topic and none seem to have a solution that works. I really don't want to have to reset all my passwords, I just did that when I was updating the password manager on my Firefox account on my old desktop. </p>",desktop;sync;windows-10;firefox-820;,firefox,sync,en-US,1367259;1367291;,maggie.m1994
