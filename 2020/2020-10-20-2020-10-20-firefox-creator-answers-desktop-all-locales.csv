When you try to click on it it looks like it wants to open, but the homepage is blank.  When I try to log in the page stays blank.  I can see the menu bar but none of the choices will open.  I have uninstalled and reinstalled multiple times, each time removing any and all Firefox folders.  Still will not open.  Followed the steps for a clean install, no change.  The last time I was downloading Firefox I received my first error message: c:\windows\system32\msvcp140.dll error message I get no other error messages, the home page stays blank.  Any suggestions on what to try? </p>",desktop;fix-problems;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",bozelley
