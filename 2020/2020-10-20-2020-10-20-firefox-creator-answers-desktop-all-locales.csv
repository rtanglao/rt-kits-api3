Then when I restarted my PC and re-opened firefox all my tabs were missing again so I used the backup again and after a few tests I realized the files and folder were being deleted on exiting the browser. The strange thing is I did a refresh using the tool under about:support and it created all the sessionstore files that were missing but then deleted them when I closed the browser. </p>",desktop;other;windows-10;firefox-810;,firefox,other,en-US,"",wandering_uncle_chris
