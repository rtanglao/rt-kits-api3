I prefer ESR, since not so many upgrades. Installed 78.4.0ESR on the new PC &amp; tried copying the contents of the 81 profile folder into the ESR profile folder, deleting all the content of the ESR profile folder 1st. When I try opening the ESR install, it tells me ""profile contains old content, set up new profile."" For the PW's, I tried copying &amp; replacing key4.db, signons.sqlite &amp; logins.json in the ESR profile, still no PW's or logins in the ESR. All I really need in the ESR from the 81 are the bookmarks (thousands) &amp; passwords (about 400). There MUST be some way to do this!
