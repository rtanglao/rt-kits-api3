I find them easier than using a mouse often.  Two that are most annoying at not working is  Ctrl-T to open a new tab Ctrl-C to copy. That now opens developer tools This all started with last update. Does anyone know how I can restore those keyboard shortcuts? </p><p>Anyone have any idea who would make a common keyboard shortcut like the one for copy do something different.

This began just before the last update, and happens more frequently than not, forcing me to abandon the application because I can't close the shaking window. I can't see a specific pattern to which links will cause this to happen, but if I restart Firefox and try the same link, it will repeat the error.
