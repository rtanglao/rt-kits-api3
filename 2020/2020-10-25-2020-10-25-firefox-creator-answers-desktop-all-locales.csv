My addons say that I have shockwave flash installed.  I have installed adobe flash several times with the same result.  Perhaps I should remove shockwave flash and install again.  I have no clue. </p><p>Thank you................ </p>",linux;desktop;firefox-820;,firefox,other,en-US,1361022;1361051;1361057;1361172;,jwhitt12
