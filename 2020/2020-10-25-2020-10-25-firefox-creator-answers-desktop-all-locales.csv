Restarting in Safe Mode, refreshing, and uninstall/re-install of Firefox failed to solve these issues.  Additional troubleshooting involved disabling accessibility, disabling DNS prefetch, adjusting memory cache, disabling network proxy, and etc. as put forth in various forum threads. </p><p>Only successful solution was to roll back to version 79 (Last known good version.) </p><p>I run Firefox, Firefox Nightly, and Firefox Developer Edition.
