I have tried every fix I can find in the help guide and the community section but none of them have worked. So far I have: </p><pre>- completely uninstalled Firefox and everything related - emptied cache of Chrome (which is what I am using to re-download Firefox) - deleted everything in Windows Temp folder - re-downloaded a brand new download of Firefox directly from the site - run a full clean re-install of Firefox (same error message) - restarted the computer (still getting XML Parsing error) - unable to start Firefox in safe-mode as I don't have the button on the browser to do so. </pre> <p>Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated as Firefox is my favourite browser and I want it back! </p>,desktop;download-and-install_1;,firefox,download-and-install,en-US,"",tellemonstar2002

Amazon Prime store and other features work fine, but when you select a video, the Amazon page and Firefox screen freezes in that the cursor travels over the screen and page but no matter where you  click you get no response.  You have to refresh the page and reload Amazon to get functionality back. I can stream video on Safari, but not on Firefox, and Firefox is my browser of choice as it is more content feature rich than Safari.  I need to get my Amazon video streaming working again.  Two additional issues, this is now happening with YouTube too. You can watch YouTube videos, but they take a great deal, sometimes over a minute or two, to load. Finally, I get a message on my Firefox page when I try to load Coinbase that I have to use Chrome, an idea that I detest, using any Google product. Please provide me with some answers and solutions.  I have posed a number of questions regarding loss of use and features on the version of Firefox in the last week, and not one of them has been responded too, or answered, which really disappoints me as far as my opinion of the support you offer, volunteer or not.  Not trying to bust your chops, but some support would be better than none.  Thanks for your input.  PLEASE give me a solution so I can continue to use Firefox.  BTW when I clicked the "" share data"" button below, it erased over 30 minutes of work I did in this field and answer, and I had to start again from scratch, so I have over an hour invested in trying to contact you and get some support. </p>",mac-os;desktop;fix-problems;firefox-780;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,"",bekglm1
