El Consumo es muy elevado, tanto de CPU como de RAM, alcanzando el 95% del CPU en algunos casos y la RAM al 100%. En principio pensé que podía tratarse solo de la pc de bajos recursos, pero luego probé con el navegador Chrome y no hay ningún problema en la navegación (Siempre hablando de Facebook) Por lo que me queda muy en claro que es un problema específico de Mozilla y Facebook. Me he dado cuenta que el consumo se sale de control cuando aparecen Videos, Gifs u otras animaciones, esto con Chrome no sucede, por lo que no es un problema de gráficos de la pc, sino de como se ejecuta lo anteriormente mencionado en este navegador. Espero se pueda corregir o servir para investigar el funcionamiento en general, ya que siempre he usado este navegador y no quisiera cambiarlo aqui en la oficina para poder mirar de vez en cuando el mencionado sitio web.

However, after long sessions on Facebook, when I switch to YouTube, I'll get two really annoying effects: </p><p>1)  When I start watching a video, the Firefox browser will start grinding away at my hard drive, as if Windows Defrag function started running in the background - that level of grinding.  I know this because I checked it with Windows Process Explorer, and there were multiple instances of Firefox running, sometimes as many as 7 instances.  I don't know what Firefox is doing, but it was impacting my computer's performance, **even if I stopped the video I was watching and all other programs **.  The only way to get it to stop was to close Firefox, and then re-open it with Restart Previous Session, and then it quit. </p><p>I don't know why Firefox needs 7 sessions open at once, but they're not mine, and they're grinding performance badly.  Can anyone tell me why this is happening, and if it's possible to stop it? </p><p>2)  Linked to #1 is a huge lag problem at times when I use YouTube, which goes away when I restart Firefox.  I'll click on a link in YouTube, and literally nothing happens for as much as 3 seconds.  Restart Firefox, and it goes away. </p><p>I'm wondering if there's a huge memory leak in Firefox, and if there's any way to check that. </p><p>I've got 32 GB of RAM, an I7 CPU, and hundreds of GB of disk space, so none of this should be happening.

I hate searching for things and not finding a straight answer, and I'm hoping that I can bring light to others who may be undergoing the same issue. </p><p>I was infuriated by YouTube (and only YouTube) and how slow it was to respond to pretty much any command I sent via my keyboard. Clicking was fine, but if I wanted to skip 5 seconds in the video by mashing the right or left arrow a bunch, it would buffer those key presses and then register all at once. Basically, YouTube was lagging out of its mind and decided that any kind of action I wanted to take on the page would be done incredibly slowly (by modern computing standards, so ~700ms). I play rhythm games, so any input delay more than about 2ms will annoy me to no end. </p><p>This ended up being something called GC or garbage collection, and it was ""minor GC"" and ""non-incremental GC"" and something to do with a Nursery being full. Whatever that is, switching over to the Call Tree function in the F12 performance menu (F12&gt;Performance&gt;Start Recording Performance&gt;*input commands on video*&gt;Call Tree) told me that the function GC was taking up around HALF of my time recorded. This gave me a place to start at least, and I'm glad that Firefox has this feature and that it's user friendly. I know NOTHING about webpage design or coding, and it wasn't that hard to figure out what was going on. </p><p>Expanding the menus was helpful, and I found out that it was actually my Kaspersky Antivirus causing the issue. I dug around for another hour or so and found this <a href=""https://blog.lakshmanbasnet.com/web/website-slow-connecting-to-gc-kis-v2-scr-kaspersky-labs-com-solved/"" rel=""nofollow"">helpful article</a> on how to fix it. </p><p>A TL;DR from that article is, if you have Kaspersky, go to Settings&gt;Additional&gt;Network and untick ""Inject scripts into web traffic to interact with web pages"" </p><p>This script injection was doing something to slow it down, most likely trying to scan and monitor the inputs I was making on YouTube to be sure I wasn't getting myself into any trouble. Hope that this helps anyone else having this issue, and any moderation can mark this as solved. </p>",desktop;fix-problems;windows-10;firefox-830;,firefox,fix-problems,en-US,1375767;1375801;,jahinson2002
